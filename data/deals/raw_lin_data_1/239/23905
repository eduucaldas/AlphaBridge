nt|gulyas: hello and welcome to round16|pg||

mb|p|nt|psyck: ok we are back with the correct boards|pg||
nt|pauleger: that looks right|pg||
mb|1C|nt|james_h: Welcome All|pg||
nt|mcphee: decent slam on the way|pg||
nt|clinch: Looking at this board, NS will probably bid to 3NT, but the duplication in spades will make that an uphill struggle.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Hi - looks like a quiet 450/420 for the start|pg||
nt|gulyas: so, top9 teams advance to the second RR, and these teams are currently 7th and 8th, so a big loss may cause either to drop out|pg||
mb|1D|nt|tomi2: NS in 3@Cx in the OR|pg||
nt|solex333: prob one of the most successful pairs in dk and ro for the moment|pg||

nt|james_h: Ireland play Italy next, so its going to tough going|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2@H is to play, which E has a perfect reopen for|pg||
nt|gulyas: not that W is happy, with 4333, and his 4 card suit is @Hs|pg||
nt|james_h: I hope to be ring side for Ireland next match ... poking Bocchi etc so that he loses concentration etc|pg||

nt|geot: to overcall 1@D|pg||
nt|oleberg:  2@H = 8-11, and any 5-3-3-2 or side-suit in hearts|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: wijs-muller play Tarzan Precision  but they open fewer hands at 1-level than most big clubbers|pg||
nt|pauleger: defending 3@c X you have to switch to a trump early|pg||
nt|oleberg:  2@S = relay|pg||

mb|p|nt|james_h: This match is likely to count as both teams likely to qualify for the 2nd week of action|pg||
nt|yusufb: bu arada yuksek skor aldýgýmýz takýmlarýn ilk 9 girmesini istiyoruz tabii|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: 3NT would maybe better this time|pg||

nt|geot: Hard to win this one, have to solve both the clubs and the trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: NS tell me the names are in wrong - Berg playing South, Svendsen North|pg||
nt|ahollan1: most other rooms NS playing 2@S|pg||
nt|psyck: dec could make his low trump last deal to survive the trump split|pg||

mb|p|nt|geot: I am told Norway reached 3NT on this one in the OR. |pg||

nt|fabsayc: if willard had the diamond king and golin the queen, golin should have overtaken heart queen, so i am pretty sure oliveri should know to underlead diamond ace|pg||
nt|mcphee: 4-1 @S just enough to stop 13 tricks for N/S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2c=majors, they use multi defense|pg||
nt|nilsland:  not obvious to open 1NT with xx xxx in the red suits in my opinion|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: he will be endplayed eventually (and we also know the 4th @S will be good, so no need for the @HA)|pg||

nt|gulyas: if he did, declarer can win the @H and put him in with @Ss - its a matter of figuring out the distributions really|pg||
nt|geot: Better trump suit in 4@S, but maybe not an easier contract?|pg||
nt|star6ija: looks easier now|pg||
nt|geot: should win it even though trumps are 4-1 and the diamond Q can not be cashed|pg||
nt|gulyas: so, bd3, 3@S ended up down 4 in the OR, 10imps to IRL, leading by 13|pg||
nt|gulyas: nice lead|pg||
nt|james_h: pop the ace and play @d|pg||
nt|gulyas: this may beat the contract, unless EW block the @C suit|pg||
nt|james_h: yes|pg||
nt|gulyas: right, but still, 2@Cs and 2@Hs to give, and a @D|pg||
nt|james_h: then EW know the @s Q is an entry and def is easy|pg||
nt|james_h: so declarer must be more cunning|pg||
nt|gulyas: if you play a low @D, they may not know|pg||
nt|james_h: looking at the N/S hands its still a good games ...|pg||
nt|james_h: if the @d 3-2 and the Q with East|pg||
nt|james_h: or if the @h ace with West|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pg||

nt|solex333: han 3nt - which actually makes...|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Good call by west. 5@C is a much better contract, even though 3NT is a winner here|pg||

pc|s5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: there was no need to play diamonds first since you basically need clubs to break and heart king onside to have any chance|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this line has complicated matter, she is aiming to pitch a club on diamond jack, but to gain a trick that way she needs four spade ruffs in hand|pg||
nt|mcphee: a reasonable spot, just not today|pg||

nt|mdgraham: will be hard to stop out of game here  |pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: As the lay-out is N/S can not hurt declarer much in the spade suit|pg||
nt|baardolav: true... and the natural heart lead, give declarer an easy way for 9 tricks|pg||
nt|gulyas: double dummy 6@D makes if you guess right in @Cs, but its not a slam you want to be in|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: dobrze ¿e przed parti¹ (z mojej strony a Twojej Lechu jak?|pg||

mb|p|nt|tez: bi bakarsýnýz @h ya da @c rua ataðý gelir hemen olur|pg||
nt|oleberg:  West will feel a little endplayed, when in with the @SA|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Double-dummy this can make, by playing two rounds of clubs, and then a spade to the ace|pg||
pc|d5|nt|fabsayc: after the overcall oliveri might have tried 2@S rather than 2NT, assuming that asks for help in spades|pg||
nt|clinch: with @h 3-3|pg||

pc|d3|nt|james_h: There is a lesson on that last hand for pundits like me ...|pg||

nt|tez: @h oynrsa þimdi|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Oliveri may have missed the 1s overcall|pg||
nt|fabsayc: blame seems to be with golin, whatever 3@D meant it looks wrong|pg||
nt|baardolav: there is no way for Aronov bid 2nt on ten? |pg||
pc|dK|nt|gulyas: then declarer can duck and test the suits|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bye Bob|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Fantoni thinking this time, not Muller |pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: screen down briefly, F asks M a question|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i believe Muller's PASS was a RELAY  but Nunes 3@C ended the artificial bidding|pg||
nt|clinch: Can actually make 6 by ducking a @h to S, but unlikely with the whole @d suit exposed|pg||
nt|baardolav: instead of 2d|pg||
nt|geot: his partner is limited to 15|pg||
nt|baardolav: yes i knoww|pg||
nt|geot: I guess 2NT was an option to try reaching a vul game, but...|pg||
nt|baardolav: Yes, you end up in 2NT on 11+10 hp too|pg||
pc|d2|nt|psyck: 3@h would have shown 4 or 5 @h, 3@s would have shown 5@s, & 3N both majors|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|pauleger: should S have taken the 1st @s, to play a @h up and then a @d? propably E will rise thinking S could have stiff @s A?|pg||
nt|geot: Lauria - Versace (in the OR) has not missed much so far in this set, but I think Bulgaria has got a chance on the next board|pg||
nt|baardolav: In 2@d they will end up with minus one now|pg||
nt|baardolav: need to ruff with K|pg||
nt|baardolav: and play trumph|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Perhaps he figured the @H9 showed an odd number|pg||

nt|ahollan1: does Nunes open 1N [12-14] or PASS?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: helps*|pg||
nt|mathat: 6 @c @d|pg||
nt|geot: Well, this hand was at first scored as 200 in the other room, then changed to 500|pg||
nt|star6ija: about 10-15 years ago, returning from one European Championships, Ivan Nanev, one of the topBulgarian international players shared with me the following|pg||
nt|fluffy: hi all|pg||
nt|star6ija: Italian style is not to play scores with 24-25 points|pg||
nt|star6ija: they never compare +150 with -600 and +480 with -980|pg||
nt|oleberg:  And a club-switch instead ogf the diamond would have tangled declarers communication|pg||
nt|monde9: W helped with the @H second time|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Quite a bad defence|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: 4@s x /1 is correct|pg||
nt|mcphee: might have been better to run more @C there|pg||
nt|gulyas: so back to 9 tricks, playing it safe|pg||
nt|james_h: some cards may be wrong there|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzeq: iyi swing þansýydý|pg||

nt|baardolav: here we find links for running scores http://eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: This feel like the calm before the really calm :(|pg||
nt|geot: East in OR, Brogeland, went from playing 1@H on board 6 to playing 1@S on this one|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4441 is systemically opened 1N when 12-14|pg||
nt|monde9: Coldea has a good fame as dec in Romania|pg||
nt|monde9: I think the 6th board can bring another points to Romania|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Not that he did anything wrong at all, but there was only the straightforward way to play it|pg||
nt|oleberg:  It was EW who "made" the contract|pg||
mb|2D|nt|eyamut: yok tehlikeli..|pg||
nt|tez: rakip 2 tur @d dan sonra @c oynamalý..yoksa @h lere @c ler gider|pg||
nt|psyck: Duboin opened 2@c last deal, so they should get there too|pg||
nt|clinch: Last match was full of slams; this one seems to be characterised by awkward misfits so far|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 6nt by south my preferred contract|pg||
nt|blum1956: They will soon discover the lack of Aces|pg||
nt|james_h: 1@d is a catch all 2+|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what happened on 6?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lechcold: wejcie EInarssona przed 23 nie powinno byæ pokazywane:)|pg||
nt|yusufb: deminki 6-6 siyah olan el kadýnlarda 6@c soylenip yapýlmýþ|pg||
nt|geot: that was why a thought this was a possible good board for BUL, but note that 4@S by West can be set|pg||
nt|geot: if South gets two heart ruffs|pg||
nt|mcphee: may have been worried about @S 5/3|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Norths return of @S4 could mean that spades are 4-4 |pg||
nt|mdgraham: S's second heart presumably suit pref - dangerous switch otherwise |pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: and it will be the same contract|pg||
nt|gulyas: 1nt showing both minors, 5-5|pg||
nt|gulyas: so E may also try for game|pg||
nt|kamyk: skupiamy siê tu na grze naszych, ale popartyjne wejcie 1@H z pi¹ta dziesiatk¹ budzi szacunek:)|pg||

nt|fabsayc: aha, 7 bid and made|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: the displayed bidding in open room is clearly not correct, that table is having problems with operator boards|pg||
nt|gulyas: his major honors are really too soft, so this is enough|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N is the catchall that doesn't fit  1-suit [usually 14+ HCP] or 2-suit [10-13, 5+ suit, unbal]|pg||
nt|fabsayc: whereas 6d is dependent on spade favourable since played by north|pg||
nt|blum1956: Khokhlov knows partner is 18+ but going on the 5th level is unsafe|pg||
nt|james_h: 20 imps up for grabs on that last board|pg||
nt|MolvaM: seyirciler sebep soruyor sn yorumcular|pg||

nt|james_h: ok|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2@H shows 3 card support|pg||
mb|p|nt|eyamut: evet|pg||
nt|james_h: I'll use this time to make myself a nice cup of gin|pg||
nt|geot: :)|pg||
nt|james_h: +11 or -9 for Sweden|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: sorry computer froze will enter result when claim comes|pg||
nt|nilsland:  North 2@S shows a raise, S pass oven 3@C shows minimum and denies @C shortness|pg||

nt|star6ija: and this agressive style helped Italians to win plenty of competitions|pg||
nt|fluffy: Momchil, you mean "scores" as partscores?|pg||
nt|star6ija: yes|pg||

mb|4C|nt|gulyas: NS can make slam here, lets see if they can find it|pg||

nt|oleberg:  He can expect barrage, and to may of his bids will be Non-forcing|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Here he will have to bid something like 4@C|pg||
nt|monde9: if 5 @C now in South the slam in @D is far|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Maybe west will then chance 6@C. Maybe|pg||
nt|monde9: if 3NT 6 @D is possible|pg||
nt|oleberg:  But south has much defence. Surely he doesn't expect EW to have a slam on|pg||
nt|solex333: 5 @c is a good bid|pg||
nt|oleberg:  If he is alive to Wests huddle, he might preempt some|pg||
nt|oleberg:  But pass is surely an option|pg||
nt|solex333: pass is prob not an option. maybe a soft 4@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Hagen thinking...|pg||
nt|gulyas: now @S may dream of slam, and it makes, too!|pg||
nt|gulyas: I mean S|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: in the Open room|pg||
nt|star6ija: yes, but some variations of tricks are probable|pg||

nt|mdgraham: thin opener by E - strikes gold|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: yes, maybe a diamond lead can make some trouble for declarer in 4@H|pg||

nt|gulyas: you can find running scores here: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|gulyas: if they play the same as I do (which is possible), 3@C means a good suit and a good hand (in context to being NV)|pg||
nt|gulyas: or bad-bad|pg||
nt|gulyas: but they did end up in 4@S|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: Muller shows 1-suiter, then short @S, then exactly 2326|pg||
nt|james_h: 1@c is 11-13 bal in this case|pg||
nt|star6ija: having Ace and King Aronov assumes he has 8 plus points, not 0-7|pg||
nt|james_h: South I expect will be looking for 7@s ...|pg||
pc|hA|nt|james_h: Fun over on this hand -  from an Irish perspective|pg||
nt|gulyas: 3@D is an artificial GF|pg||

pc|h4|nt|begse: they can send in 3 min|pg||

nt|gulyas: ok, this will probably end in 13 tricks|pg||
nt|james_h: 1@H shows 4+@s, 1@s shows 3 card support|pg||
nt|mcphee: looks like 11 tricks to me|pg||
nt|psyck: @d looks likely lead|pg||
nt|baardolav: And a good distribution 4252|pg||

nt|gulyas: operator got that last call wrong|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ryskiel_: niewiele siê dzieje na boisku|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@H=3  [2@C promised 2+]|pg||

nt|geot: Only one imp at stake here, the overtrick|pg||
nt|star6ija: now it is easier for Madala to find @h lead|pg||
pc|d5|nt|psyck: did well to lead it even after W probably showed @d stopper|pg||
nt|solex333: garozzo: "never lead ur singleton" :)|pg||
nt|james_h: in this hand, I think both souths must drive to at least 5, but its easy for me to say that|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: if memory serves  4@S now asks  Denial Cue Bidding|pg||
pc|d2|pg||

nt|vugraphzgn: 2@D GF artificial, Sylvan wrote for Mesbur|pg||
nt|james_h: Tx Martin|pg||
nt|geot: 4@S played by West at the other table|pg||
nt|star6ija: as we are 12 behind I am jealoused for every IMP Italians won|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: so Muller will show control in @C but not @D  [don't quote me]|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Wijs writing lots of explanations for Nunes|pg||

nt|james_h: I doubt that will be the case come board 20|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 3NT N/S on a possible @D lead may make.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: even making four required major help from defense|pg||

nt|blum1956: the vulnerability may prevent EW from the 5th level save|pg||
nt|geot: Looks like declarer must have taken the double finesse in hearts at the other table|pg||
mb|3N|nt|tomi2: NS in 5@Cx on 9, the double will make it easier to win (make overtrick)|pg||
nt|monde9: now that's the time for Konow to hesitate ? |pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: they can tell by the mouse clicks. This is standard procedure for vu graph operators. |pg||
nt|gulyas: EW has 3@Cs making, maybe even 4|pg||
nt|gulyas: so NS stealing the contract in both rooms|pg||
mb|p|nt|ken__: ama bu kadar önde olduklarýný tahmin etmiyorlardýr bence|pg||
nt|geot: If declarer does nothing funny there will be 2 spade losers and a diamond loser|pg||
nt|blum1956: Do Bakshi-Townsend have an agreement against the popular "redouble=bid your auit" convention?|pg||
nt|tez: 2@d ya pas geçmesinin sebebi..2@d kontrlu oynamak istemesindendi assaelin|pg||
nt|MolvaM: sorulara cevap vereyim|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzeq: line up yazýlýrken  tahmin etmeleri lkazým:)|pg||
nt|geot: He will probably cross to hand with the @HA and take a spade finesse followed by the ace, then play on clubs for +620|pg||
nt|clinch: Pass looks normal here|pg||
nt|clinch: Yep|pg||
nt|baardolav: Aronov will earn one imp on this hand... if NS play diamond and diamond all the time|pg||
nt|baardolav: you need the double finesse for the entry|pg||
nt|geot: not really|pg||
nt|star6ija: the coach Vladislav Ispoeski helped me with explanation of the openning: 54+ in majors (NonVul maybe 4441), VUL usually 55+ 6-10|pg||
nt|oleberg:  5@H is even wrongsided|pg||
nt|solex333: lead directing bid ?|pg||
nt|nilsland:  EW did not came close to 6@D/@H but suits does not break|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: will they investigate @D slam?|pg||
nt|blum1956: "your suit"|pg||
nt|blum1956: Karpov is accurate|pg||
nt|clinch: Cards don't lie that well even for declarer to make 3|pg||
nt|clinch: Seemed to my (lesser than these guys) eyes to be between a 2 and 3 @h rebid|pg||
nt|monde9: same story as in Open|pg||
nt|oleberg:  In West it takes the lead of a diamond-singleton to defeat|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Virtually impossible to find :)|pg||
nt|monde9: 4 @D was alerted :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: both majors are makable, lets see how 2@S fares here|pg||
nt|baldjean: since this contract will not make it does not matter much|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry, not certain about NS system - not sure whether 2@c is GF or not|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I wonder if 4NT is quantitative|pg||
pc|hK|nt|tez: 2@d ya pas geçeyim..ortak kontr der belki..ben de pas geçerim..|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bir oyuncu 60+ yaþýnda ise hem senyör hem açýk takýma katýlma hakkýna sahiptir|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Probably a re-transfer|pg||
nt|mdgraham: whatever it is, it's taken up quite a lot of room|pg||
pc|h2|nt|geot: but other lines will work as well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i have no idea what inferences are available from Fantoni's sequence  [2@H then 3N  vs  immediate 3N ...]|pg||
nt|blum1956: probably the agreement is that 4th hand passes first with good hand|pg||
pc|h8|nt|tez: ters taraftan oynuyorlar ama @c atak edilmez heralde|pg||
nt|blum1956: otherwise Townsend's first pass looks strange|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no doubt 2@C was some form of gazilli|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|gulyas: 5@H needs 3 rnds of @Ds to beat it|pg||
nt|kamyk: uparty ten W|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my guess -- Fantoni was showing hand that hoped for reopening DBL|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: good lead so long as they collect the 2@c b4 S gets rid of one|pg||
pc|hA|nt|blum1956: His hand deserves a 3@h bid if it is nonforcing. Still it could force according to their agreement|pg||

nt|baldfriede: sorry, have to take a break|pg||

nt|ritong: please check the score, then|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Right Henri - I said 9 :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: so a small gain turned into another small loss|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzeq: bu günün son eli|pg||
nt|ahollan1: west hand automatic opener for most big clubbers -- not sure if deWijs will open 1N [good 12-15]|pg||
nt|blum1956: 1@d is 4+ diamonds unbalanced|pg||
nt|begse: tek karo|pg||
nt|monde9: a lightner here for -1 X in N in TOR|pg||
nt|gulyas: -6 instead of +6|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: X=majors|pg||
mb|1C|nt|gulyas: it was the lucky 1nt opening - if it went 1@C-1@H overcall, they would never have gotten to this|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i believe Fantoni's DBL = same HCP as opener|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: looks like a fairly routine 3NT E/W ..|pg||
nt|pauleger: 2@d 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|fabsayc: score on board 7 is still wrong|pg||
nt|nilsland:  4@H is down on a diamond lead - as 3N|pg||
nt|fabsayc: can make double dummy perhaps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: low club towards the jack|pg||
nt|nilsland:  South would like to X here - but it may show a hand with 4+@S|pg||
nt|monde9: 6 @S is the normal & good contract|pg||
nt|monde9: for N-S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ken__: Batman Briç Kulübü tüm takýmlara baþarýlar diliyor|pg||
nt|ken__: Batman Briç Kulübü tüm takýmlara baþarýlar diliyor|pg||
nt|ritong: wow|pg||
nt|nilsland:  and welcome!|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: but Muller treating the DBL as artificial rather than Penalty|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vs Strong NT   NS DBL = 4@H/@S and 5+@C/@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe always that shape, but vs weak NT  also shows HCP|pg||
nt|blum1956: The Rudakov-Khokhlov CC does not contain the meaning of the 2@h  bid|pg||
nt|blum1956: I guess it guarantees at least 3-card support, thus Rudakov is able to splinter|pg||
nt|james_h: Israel putting a storming performance so far ... I'm looking forward to reviewing their results|pg||
nt|oleberg:  This might end with 6@S in south|pg||
nt|ritong: if you did so, id a free shot for me:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: NS will end up in 3nt, and will get a @C lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzeq: 6@s gelinmesi zor fakat yapýlabiliyor|pg||
nt|vugraphzeq: son bord herkese teþekkürler|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ok board 7 finally correct|pg||
nt|ritong: really saying " you won t toy with me lorenzo"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont see any reason to bid with fredin's hand|pg||
nt|clinch: 3@s probably preemptive, as X mainly disruptive|pg||
nt|baardolav: here... coffee I think|pg||
mb|1S|nt|eyamut: sabah mý?|pg||
nt|blum1956: the rest is simple|pg||
nt|james_h: throughout the tournament|pg||
nt|nilsland:  surprisingly - but RD showed a good hand|pg||
nt|nilsland:  And Lauria is hoping for a club lead|pg||
nt|monde9: :)|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Where an underlead of clubs is needed|pg||
nt|baldjean: Hungary now need 6 IMPs per board to still win this|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzeq: :)|pg||
nt|ritong: i think he expects the contract to be cold|pg||
nt|clinch: Well it's obviously preemptive... I mean by agreement|pg||
nt|monde9: same 200 but different contracts :)|pg||
nt|ritong: hi hi|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ritong: the formula is 3sn+1|pg||
nt|ritong: 2sn+1*|pg||
nt|ritong: ty ty|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Helgemos double is a little aggressive but makes life easy|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2@C invitational stayman|pg||
nt|gulyas: or just showing 4@H now with a minimum GF|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzgn: These lads don't make it easy for me :) All conversation at this table is in Russian, including explanations and claims|pg||
nt|nilsland:  It is not obvious to double a partscore knowing that you have a 9-card heart fit|pg||
nt|ritong: south visibly having the rest of the high cards|pg||
nt|ritong: now, the @d five bagger is a bad surprise|pg||
nt|nilsland:  BjÃ¶rn knows that Lauria is prepared for a club lead|pg||
nt|nilsland:  so he will not lead a club|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not so sure he wont|pg||
nt|nilsland:  In this situation Fredin could not pass over the RD because that would probably show values - so 3@C is not a free bid|pg||
nt|ritong: also, who understands redouble?|pg||
nt|ritong: i would translate " my @hs are fine"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: redouble=max hand probably|pg||
nt|ritong: has he?|pg||
nt|geot: this will not be any swing, standard 4@H|pg||
nt|mcphee: possible to go down|pg||
mb|3C|nt|caruse57: Bu turnuvanýn hazýrlanmasýnda ve vugrap'da yayýnlamasý için ugraþýlarýný esirgemiyen Sayýn Erdoðan ÖZBEY arkadaþýmýza.Modern Briç Kulubu oyuncularý adýna teþekkür ederim|pg||
nt|nilsland:  At the other table South is playing 2NT with a heart lead |pg||
nt|fabsayc: not in my book|pg||
nt|fluffy: another flat board I'd say|pg||
nt|monde9: Coldea has "some" temperamant" :)|pg||
nt|monde9: teperament |pg||
nt|oleberg:  Tea-apartment? :)|pg||
nt|solex333: unlucky 6 @d, but prob 5 @d will lead to 5/6 @s|pg||
nt|monde9: Bogdan Marina in N seems more cool to me :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: 2@c is probably a version of Drury showing 3 card fir|pg||
nt|geot: I think on board 10, the 3@S, it was something to be said for playing the Ace of trumps first. That is if East had KJ doubleton. So playing the ace and later play as he did was ...|pg||
nt|geot: acdtually ok|pg||
nt|james_h: fit|pg||
nt|james_h: 2s = min|pg||
nt|pauleger: 3@d = 4+ @c I am told|pg||
nt|psyck: so E shows his suits by not bidding them|pg||
nt|clinch: Might have been clobbered if N only had 4 @s|pg||
nt|gulyas: declarer just needs to guess the @SJ to make, which should be a normal play to finesse|pg||
nt|gulyas: I mean, normal to play it to W after E shows up with the long @Cs|pg||
nt|baldjean: N/S can develop a @H trick here for 9 tricks, but it needs careful play|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good 2NT rebid - 2NT usually stronger in a balanced hand, but here W has a good source of tricks in diamonds  |pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: interesting use of 4C as a kind of leaping michaels, kibitzers will no doubt say standard in France but new to me|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 1S shows @D i assume - 2@s anyone know what that means ?|pg||
nt|clinch: 4@d pretty comfortable losing 3 red tricks in all likelihood|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i blame it on the defenseless 3@S bid :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: when did that bid promise any defenses?:)|pg||
nt|blum1956: I first played against Tiit Laanemae in... probably 1979. |pg||
nt|mdgraham: defence needs a spade switch sharpish-like|pg||
pc|dT|nt|fabsayc: defenseless bids cause opponents to overbid|pg||
nt|gulyas: well bid, this may make|pg||
nt|geot: Some will maybe consider 3NT as South. Bad contract, but would make |pg||
nt|monde9: Rotaru X the 6 @S for @D leading in TOR|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzeq: akþam pardon|pg||
nt|gulyas: that would not work with E having 2 aces|pg||
nt|mdgraham: after an A/K lead vs NT, the defenders carding is usually either count/attitude, not suit pref - so if N finds a spade switch we can be seriously impressed |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: no bonus points for being in 5|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|gulyas: N needs to cash his @HQ to beat it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not obvious|pg||
nt|gulyas: its true that his black suit holdings are not very promising|pg||
nt|nevaio   _: after 2@h 3@H by w|pg||
nt|gulyas: thats dummy|pg||
nt|gulyas: if pd has a @C honor, and only one @H honor, @HQ could be fatal|pg||
nt|nevaio   _: i speak about led|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: he has closed the screen and asked if 3@c was forcing|pg||
nt|gulyas: 3@C is forcing, yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: now sketching sample hands and asking Hegedus how he would have bid them|pg||
nt|nevaio   _: if 3 @c is forcing Bocchi probably plays @hQ|pg||
nt|gulyas: I cannot tell exactly what the @D8 is, but says on the card, that hi-x is even, low-x is odd|pg||
nt|gulyas: but its attitude as well|pg||
nt|gulyas: so he cannot have Axxx|pg||
nt|gulyas: for convention cards: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/docdefault.asp?page=Italy&start=c%3A%5Cinetpub%5Cwwwroot%5Cecatsbridge%5Cdocuments%5Cfiles%5C2012Dubli...|pg||
nt|gulyas: n%2Fsystems%2FOpenTeams|pg||
nt|nilsland:  this will be good for sweden - on  11 as expected we lost 6 imps|pg||
pc|s3|nt|geot: the 4@S I mean, reached and won by both teams|pg||
nt|baardolav: and here same number of tricks all over|pg||
nt|oleberg:  6@D is an ok spot|pg||
nt|ritong: he has the entries for the standard trump handling|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Helness looks like a man that makes it|pg||
pc|s9|nt|james_h: well denies a major anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: 2@D explained as 18-19 bal - hard to overhear, but I think 2@s was explained as denying major|pg||
nt|tez: güney dengeli 16 puanla 1 saniye düþünmedi pas geçmek için|pg||
pc|sK|nt|fluffy: this trump position starts with @hAQ to pin singleton @h10/J on East|pg||
nt|ritong: small to 8|pg||
nt|mcphee: good start|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|gulyas: he got it|pg||
nt|gulyas: nice|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Even with diamonda 5-1 it has chances, and with 4-2 its a claim|pg||
pc|c5|nt|baldjean: it does work here. 9@h is the important card|pg||
pc|cT|nt|james_h: I expect Ur right given the 2@d responce|pg||
nt|MolvaM: seyircilerimiz 7@d bordunu soruyorlar. o elin skoru muhtemelen maçtan sonra netleþir ve skor tabelasýnda görürüz|pg||
nt|tez: akibin rengi uzun |pg||
pc|cA|nt|oleberg:  And 6@S is down with spades 4-1|pg||

nt|nilsland:  Will he play a low diamond now?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|monde9: yes, it is a enough good spot, obviously|pg||
nt|oleberg:  So even though 6@S is better, its a good effort to land in a sensible contract, when the opponents has preempted|pg||
nt|oleberg:  With 5@C|pg||

nt|blum1956: And if I am not mistaken, Eugeni Rudakov who is playing the OR now was born just in 1979|pg||
nt|nilsland:  correction 8 imps on the strange multi|pg||
nt|monde9: 4 @S was not that easy here ; |pg||
nt|nilsland:  never in much danger however|pg||
nt|gulyas: OK, E thought he was just trying to steal a trick and went up with the @SA, no harm done, a likely push|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: Tough game bid and won by Hanlon-MC Gann gives Ireland the lead|pg||
nt|gulyas: wow, a nice score for Hungary in the OR|pg||

mb|p|nt|geot: or gives them a real lead, to put it that way. |pg||

nt|monde9: playing sry|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  BjÃ¶rn found the good lead and 8 came back|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Helgemo is hoping for much more bidding|pg||
nt|mcphee: risky to try 3@H?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|geot: Yes, and it was good judgement by North with KJx of spades in partners side suit, to accept the game invite|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, ok, 3nt is easy:)|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 12 imps for sweden - stayed low in 3@h bd 10 and Ireland pushed to 3NT on bd 11|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3. elde kuzey düþünerek 6nt dedi|pg||
nt|MolvaM: güney de 7 karo dedi|pg||

mb|2S|mb|2N|nt|nilsland:  as I expected :)|pg||

nt|geot: Another "boring" hand|pg||
nt|mcphee: and now the 3N|pg||
nt|gulyas: I hear NS is in 3@D on bd12, so this a 10 imp pickup for Hungary|pg||
nt|mdgraham: very quiet set so far - biggest swing 8 imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: good judgement on the 3@h by NS in the open room|pg||

nt|mcphee: helgemo, no fear pard we have em now|pg||
nt|ritong: i don t think daddy bessis loves it|pg||
nt|nilsland:  They certainly has to improve their declarer play - or go to the bank|pg||
mb|3N|nt|geot: Tough 3@S bid from East|pg||
nt|fabsayc: at other table nystrom doubled 2@H, a move i think should show a better overall hand|pg||
nt|gulyas: it was time we started the comeback :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: and North bids 3NT on the stiff king over his partner's t/o double|pg||

nt|mcphee: this isn't over yet:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: we are not sure which side will go for the cross ruff yet|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Geir know that Tor will lead a trump if he has one.|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: All fine about the spades, but 3NT does not work very well anyway|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@C artificial game force, not sure about the rest|pg||
nt|baldfriede: No slam possible here.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and whats the TD verdict pls operator?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: still no ruling on board 3|pg||
nt|monde9: like that S can take the hand on the Jack of @C to give the ruff in @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: it maybe helped by the EW action|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: declarer will want to draw trumps may just cash the K+A and then play on D which works on all 3/2 splits.  If the trumps 4/1 though ...|pg||
nt|ritong: ouah|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Now he worries about the long pause|pg||

pc|s4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: as usual i would rather be in 3nt|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Ok, played by N 6@s works|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes, must be around 25% or 100% on actual layout|pg||
nt|ritong: confirmed, operator?|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|nt|gulyas: 2nt shows a good hand, any other bid is just a wk hand|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: jak siê pytam dwa razy to znaczy by³em podwójnie zdziwiony|pg||
nt|blum1956: 3@c from Townsend first suggested by the viewgraph could have created a problem for EW |pg||
nt|clinch: Cards lie pretty well so may make 9, though would need a different NT range to bid game|pg||
nt|baldjean: this may make 12 tricks even|pg||
pc|dK|nt|james_h: exactly Karel|pg||
nt|tez: hala karar yokmuþ|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Not obvious to make this, though double-dummy it is easy|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kdr_fm: may also finesse into the east hand on the basis a @d switch will be hard to find.  S8 looks ominous|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|fabsayc: i always thought lebensohl was backwards|pg||
nt|fabsayc: are you drinking sparkling grapfruit?|pg||
nt|nilsland:  seems operator have enough to do :)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|nilsland:  You may regret not double if S bids 3NT - but I agree :)|pg||

nt|nilsland:  But we may see TD at the table if Helgemo feels that its needed|pg||
nt|ritong: i doubt that|pg||
nt|nilsland:  I am not sure - East has a good hand and west may have 5-5|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Have lost play. Will claim with result when they are finished.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kamyk: dobrze, ¿e W to skontrowa³;|pg||
pc|h5|nt|geot: The bidding started the same way in the OR, but North chose to bid 4@C where he played|pg||
nt|monde9: is not yet in|pg||
nt|oleberg:  No, you are right|pg||
nt|oleberg:  He shouls have taken one high heart before the diamonds|pg||

pc|cT|nt|oleberg:  The heart-lead in the other room made that task easy|pg||
nt|baldjean: puling 1 round of trump first would have given the 12th trick. now 11 only|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|clinch: Still, not making 9 anyway so likely to be nothing significant|pg||
pc|h2|nt|oleberg:  Now a high spade from hand|pg||

nt|monde9: ducked|pg||

nt|oleberg:  Yeah,:(|pg||
nt|oleberg:  :( as a dane|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Konow thinking...|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Had he taken one high heart earlier, he could have played a heart from dummy, when North was void, thus making it|pg||
nt|oleberg:  A harsh penalty for a marginal error|pg||
nt|solex333: monaco blitz poland 72-0 !|pg||

nt|monde9: imagine sry|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Even though it is highly unlikely to succeed, a high spade from hand would still be my choice to try and induce an error|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Konow still thinking..|pg||
nt|solex333: at the moment: romania 4th , dk 10th, but still a lot of boards|pg||

pc|cA|nt|monde9: I'm joking of corse|pg||

nt|blum1956: which is by no means beautiful|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: 2@D ask longer major|pg||

nt|nilsland:  BjÃ¶rns 3N denies support|pg||

nt|mdgraham: to be fair, a lot of players open flat 11's these days|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: i guess that is route for Nunes to invite|pg||
nt|pauleger: this will lead to 8 tricks |pg||
nt|sastro: with 1C lead|pg||
nt|ritong: an other possibility is " i don t like @ss" when 3@s would promise fit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: declarer will need to discard dummy's clubs to avoid a ruff|pg||

nt|clinch: 2@d to play opposite a bal hand with 3@d; 2@h showing precise shape|pg||

pc|d4|nt|psyck: declarer may have to endplay South to make, after forcing a @h pitch by S on 4th @s|pg||
nt|sastro: to duck an honneur bets the kontrakt|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Lauria consulting the Germans convention card and asking about lead..|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: will play a @s toward the KJ, may cash the @CA see if he can get honest count|pg||
nt|clinch: How easy will it be for E to persude W that he has 4 card @h support?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mcphee: might be a bit concerned here as 3N seems to have some play|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sastro: small back|pg||
nt|fluffy: fall of @d10 makes it easy even if aronov ducks|pg||
pc|d9|nt|pauleger: low @h now|pg||
nt|nilsland:  But who am I to teach the italians how to bid :)|pg||
nt|baardolav: if aronov ducks I believe Bocchi play club for the ten|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|clinch: Guess that was known then|pg||
pc|sK|nt|blum1956: 1@c could be everything, still 3@s is a  dangerous bid (@s xx and @h Kx with South is enough for the game)|pg||
nt|geot: He might do that|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: note low from worthless doubleton    in Slawinski   low from even without honor  or  odd with honor|pg||
nt|pauleger: endplay squeeze coming up|pg||
nt|psyck: @c fin 4@s's, @c endplay seems to work now|pg||
nt|sastro: but S will be squeezed on 4 rounds of @s|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, we are all saying the same thing :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: @C8 of Fritsche seemed a bit odd|pg||
nt|sastro: but missing the communication for the squeeze   |pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Lauria thinking...|pg||
nt|psyck: One would bet on him figuring it out|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that's more like it :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kdr_fm: has on real option now but the @C finesse, when E will show out in @s|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: could play east for @HQxx precisely but I dont think thats as good odds as the @C position|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|clinch: So, looking at convention card it seems that double may just have meant "don't lead a @d"|pg||
nt|monde9: Yes they are leading confortably on seniors ! :)|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|pc|cK|nt|star6ija: 12 tricks possible now|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|sA|pc|c4|nt|geot: We have seen a match so far, with not too much action, really. Norway went down in a game they could have won, and Ireland bid a very tough but good game they won. That is about it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for NS  that works up through 9x|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: at this moment due to vacant spaces 6@D with E and 1 with west.  West is likely to hold any card declarer wants by the odds of 12-7 fairly significant|pg||
nt|MolvaM: defans trefl çakasýný alamazsa yapacak|pg||
nt|tez: @c gelse @s oynasa|pg||
nt|tez: 2@s i alsa ve @h oynasa|pg||
nt|tez: batacak|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kdr_fm: west is actually getting squeezed out of @C's here - must guard the !majors|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|baardolav: he will not be able to make 12 now... |pg||
nt|star6ija: yes|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|baldjean: 4@s went down in the other room on board 14, so more IMPs to Ireland|pg||
pc|c6|nt|psyck: :(|pg||
nt|star6ija: with @ss blocked|pg||
pc|c9|nt|clinch: By inference, he wanted a @c lead|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|s8|nt|james_h: Any predictions for the Euro Bridge winners Geo?|pg||
nt|geot: We have seen a tight match|pg||
pc|h6|nt|tez: yumurtaya can veren Allah:)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|s9|pg||
pc|h2|nt|geot: He could have squeezed East for 12 if he had unblocked the spade king after club to the ten|pg||
nt|baardolav: yes|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Nunes didn't open with 4-Qs  so deWijs can't with only 4-Js|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes -- let's play this again|pg||
nt|tomi2: other room as well in 3nt E, also medium club lead and 8 from north|pg||
nt|tomi2: let's see how Piekarek plays this|pg||
nt|psyck: should be interesting, a chance for Germany to catch up|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, versace is a superactive bidder|pg||
nt|star6ija: yup|pg||
nt|baardolav: but then aronov could have played clubs|pg||
nt|monde9: more than 20 IMP's than France :)|pg||
nt|solex333: vp's|pg||
nt|monde9: Coldea did it :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Half time just announced in playing area|pg||
mb|1C|nt|geot: They are the best team in my opinon|pg||
nt|james_h: I seriously doubt that Monaci will win, while wishing them well at the same time|pg||
mb|1S|nt|blum1956: Gromov is an extremely fast player, Dubinin being no faster then average |pg||
nt|monde9: & I said he's a very good dec :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|james_h: Monaco|pg||
nt|geot: :)|pg||
nt|geot: Italy favourites of course, then the World Champs the Netherlands|pg||
nt|james_h: y, throw Poland into the mix also|pg||
nt|geot: But I think Monaco has a chance|pg||
nt|geot: Polan is always in such a mix|pg||
nt|james_h: only 17 imps on that hand|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: ohh big swing - played from the other hand and teh S lead gave declarer more options, went -2|pg||
nt|clinch: That's a pretty dire opening bid|pg||
nt|tez: 4@h oluyor 5@d oluyor|pg||
nt|tez: bizde 4@s e yakýnýz|pg||
nt|MolvaM: internet kopmasýndan önce bu masada bulunan yaklaþýk 700 seyircinin hayatlarýndan endiþe ediyoruz|pg||
nt|tez: oyuna ve savunmaya baðlý|pg||
nt|baldjean: 51 IMPs are too much to gain in only 5 boards|pg||
mb|r|nt|fabsayc: well if sweden wins the europeans, maybe you get bragging rights for a year|pg||
nt|ritong: ouch|pg||
mb|2D|nt|geot: Will be interesting to see how Israel goes|pg||
nt|james_h: They have shown no form dispite bursting with talent|pg||
nt|lechcold: równy podzia³ pików oznacza, ¿e na WE wychodzi zarówno 4@S, jak i 5@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N 12-14   could include any 5422 except @H & @S  [so 5-card major is common]|pg||
nt|mcphee: so the bar is open?|pg||
nt|gulyas: luckily, this is not a knock out match|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  I am not sure they can bid either :P|pg||
nt|ritong: making friends is your strong points, true?|pg||
nt|ritong: -s|pg||
nt|clinch: Taking vulnerability into account|pg||
nt|baardolav: A new 4nt from OR|pg||
nt|baardolav: where 6@s can be made...|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: 2@D = TRF, not necessarily @H|pg||
nt|mcphee: possible 6|pg||
nt|gulyas: gain half of it back, and I would be happy:)|pg||
nt|baldjean: 3@c looks like a Bergen raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: in his room south did not overcall since he bid 1@H himself, so he does not know the @H layout|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Not really hehe|pg||
nt|baardolav: both black small slams and 6nt is makeable|pg||
nt|geot: Friendly clubs makes both 6@S and 6NT makeable. Have to solve the spades though|pg||
nt|star6ija: 6 @s needs very unusual treatment of trumps|pg||
nt|geot: You have to bring in the spades in NT as well|pg||
nt|monde9: the finesse in @H was protecting the @C in the same time|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: They are good players, but I do not expect them to win this time. They are young, very good, but ......maybe in a few years|pg||
nt|james_h: Fitzgibbon is not lacking courage|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 4@s not easy to reach|pg||
nt|james_h: 3@h is a balanced slam try (I think)|pg||
nt|ritong: oohh|pg||
nt|baardolav: it is no help making the @c tricks in 6nt... before you play spade|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: now looks like on the way|pg||
nt|clinch: Forrester must know that Gold is weak, and one assumes that must mean he has 5 @d at least. I'm just guessing this, but it's logical to me|pg||
nt|tez: 5@d @h ataðýndan sonra batýyor(muþ)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|baardolav: double club have single spade...|pg||
nt|mcphee: make a lot of @S here|pg||
nt|nilsland:  That why they are playing so quick|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 9 imps to France on board 11 - 4@sx= next door |pg||
nt|mdgraham: N has an awkward hand-type|pg||
pc|s8|nt|fabsayc: 2@C game force, 3@C relay, not sure about 3@D|pg||
nt|clinch: Ah apparently 1@d showed 5@d; thanks|pg||
nt|gulyas: S reopening yet again, N is happy to pass that|pg||
nt|gulyas: but it needed some @S plays to beat this 2 tricks I think|pg||
pc|sA|nt|james_h: nice lead|pg||
nt|james_h: dont know if it will make any difference tho|pg||
nt|geot: Unusual to let E/W play 3@C I think|pg||
nt|james_h: Israel are a tough outfit, yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Monitor gone, Muller thinking again! Players joking about the situation|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now 4@c perhaps|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|blum1956: Not enough from Karpov's point of view, needs some extra values (few)|pg||
nt|tez: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=916&qroundno=1&qshowflag=1|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: actually only 1 board behind other room|pg||
nt|baldfriede: S was afraid of @h, it appears|pg||
nt|gulyas: the defense has to be careful not to try any trump promotion|pg||
nt|baldjean: still ok with @H switch, I think|pg||
pc|s7|nt|geot: In my opinion I think South should bid 3@S. I know I am seeing all the hands, but.....|pg||
nt|baardolav: true|pg||
nt|baardolav: sorry private|pg||
nt|monde9: it was not a big risk of ruff in @S with the lead of @D|pg||
pc|sT|nt|baldfriede: so no 3nt|pg||
nt|baardolav: Even if you miss the spade play in 4@s here... I think Bulgaria make +1 imp|pg||
nt|fluffy: this lead ensures the 2 spade tricks fron south :)|pg||
nt|geot: At this moment Israel leads the group. But it is 237 237 236 236|pg||
nt|nilsland:  1NT would have been better this time|pg||
nt|mcphee: difficult to pass|pg||
nt|mcphee: maybe some S hands will act over 1N|pg||
nt|mcphee: no fun defending NT with S hand|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|blum1956: As everyone may see, in the OR Khiouppenen doubled 1NT, then Forrester (East) bid 2@d (which probably was "diamonds or majors"?) and was buried there|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now cue bids (this partnership's favorite action)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  In many systems East will be able to show short diamonds which would cool off West|pg||
nt|ritong: @s lead looks very possible after this auction|pg||
nt|ritong: so they better stop lower than 6|pg||
nt|tez: þu direktör onlarýn aleyhine olcaksa.kararý bildirseydi..iyi olacaktý|pg||
nt|gulyas: ouch|pg||
pc|c2|nt|nilsland:  At the other table it started 1N-3@D showing 4441 with a singleton minor|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i like that a whole lot better|pg||
nt|clinch: This looks to be on the @h guess; won't be much of a guess after Forrester turns up with AQ of trumps and a @d honour|pg||
pc|c5|nt|james_h: 3s initially, makes life easy|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Yes - west will ask for which minor and then bid 4@H|pg||
nt|ritong: 5@d might be turbo-ish|pg||
nt|ritong: showing odd number of keys and something interesting in @ds|pg||
nt|ritong: a priori interesting, that is|pg||
nt|ritong: 4NT would show even number of keys|pg||
nt|nilsland:  at least we know that they probably know what they are doing :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont think they play turbo on this auction|pg||
nt|gulyas: now down 1 only|pg||
nt|baldjean: yes|pg||
pc|cT|nt|geot: South showed a good raise of spades with 2@D|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kdr_fm: if east had the @HT - 6@S could make - as it is the @HT with west will beat it.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mcphee: perhaps E was a bit conservative|pg||
nt|nilsland:  or not|pg||
nt|ritong: i t would match  now, i m told they do play turbo, but restricted to minor fits|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not a straightforward hand to play - may try a cross-ruff|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ritong: as expected|pg||
nt|nilsland:  easy lead from the sequence :)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|clinch: Will have to play a @h early now|pg||
nt|baldjean: still a little swing for Hungary, since it was not doubled at the other table. but not enough|pg||
pc|d4|nt|geot: Italy, Bulgaria and Turkey|pg||
pc|d6|nt|geot: Myself I do not like 3@S the first time unless it is agreed to show some cards|pg||
nt|geot: I think it is too strong for 3@S initially|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: very nice play from Fantoni|pg||
nt|psyck: Sementa will return @h after winning @d, maybe Piekarek will have an idea then|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was busy thinking maybe deWijs does better to play @DJ at trick 1|pg||
nt|tomi2: maybe it will be too late then, he is still thinking how to play the @D|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, too difficult a hand, even when looking at all cards :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: yapmak içen @cQ yerini bilmesi gerekiyordu|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ama daha ilk turdan empas atmasý için bir sebep yoktu. normal oyun|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ferlema: http://csbnews.org/my-way-iv-by-norberto-bocchi/?lang=en|pg||
pc|dT|nt|james_h: I have to go now, enjoy the rest of the match|pg||
nt|clinch: As otherwise Forrester will get a @c ruff|pg||
nt|monde9: -1|pg||
nt|monde9: for 6 IMP's|pg||
nt|solex333: ok if k of h offside, a of @c onside and spades 4-1 or spades to dummy return spade and east ruff with 2 @s. but|pg||
pc|s9|nt|geot: but I dont think it can be right to let opps play 3@C on Souths hand|pg||
nt|fluffy: they move to the next board I guess|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Muller will think again -- but it is too late|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Nunes as dummy takes out a magazine to read|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from Italy, Monaco or Ireland??|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Sry, lost play|pg||
nt|MolvaM: running score linkleri þu adreste|pg||
nt|nilsland:  I do not say that 1N is always making - but passing may still be good in the long run|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: no worries Michael|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Magazine was Italian!|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: lose a @D ruff one - if @c's 3/3 or JT drop it makes or if one defender has to guard hearts and clubs - so odds wise maybe low 40's slam - which is poor|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ritong: that was  said, lemme see....21 lines ago|pg||
nt|ritong: but great minds drink alike:)|pg||
nt|clinch: Good defence, and would have been supernatural to find the counter-play|pg||
nt|clinch: Before knowing the @s position|pg||
nt|MolvaM: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mcphee: it sure can|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|clinch: Nothing about the bidding suggests Gold has such a weak hand|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|c3|nt|james_h: My bridge suffers from real life and vice versa|pg||
nt|gulyas: no, its a push|pg||
pc|h6|nt|blum1956: Certainly he could try some 5th level invitation (the 5@d cue probably being the best) but the 5th level was not safe from Maxim Karpov's point of view|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|MolvaM: açýk takýmýmýz A grubunda|pg||
nt|tez: koz gelirse|pg||
nt|tez: batacak|pg||

nt|MolvaM: sizi totemciler sizi|pg||
pc|c4|nt|tez: kozu alamýyor þimdi de|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|fabsayc: actually east denied a spade control and west bid slam reluctantly so any lead but a spade would mean fredin was not listening|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this is ok|pg||
pc|d8|mc|10|nt|kdr_fm: people suggest a squeeze - but the squeeze card is the 4th @C and the @h9 ... not the J so west saves the day|pg||
