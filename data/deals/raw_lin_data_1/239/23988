mb|p|mb|p|nt|rmb1: A big match for both teams - England rarely make to the Bermuda Bowl these days and are poised to do so|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|kit: the top 6 make it, right?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: right and to do it with a podium finish would be welcome|pg||
nt|MolvaM: right|pg||
nt|rmb1: Israel are 7th, one of the qualifying spots and so need things to happen|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|MolvaM: Israel has a chance to make the cut too|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: one off |pg||
mb|p|pc|s4|nt|kit: A guess what to play at trick 1.  On this hand the cards are so favorable that anything will succeed.|pg||
nt|kit: However, 4@H in the 5-3 fit might not do so well.|pg||
nt|rmb1: A routine auction to a 24-point 3NT - but making lots of spade tricks from KJ9|pg||
nt|MolvaM: monaco seems to have practically secured the title at the top of the list. needing just 6 vp's to guarantee arithmetically|pg||
nt|jallerton:  http://info.ecatsbridge.com/Systems/2012EuropeanTeams-Dublin/OpenTeams/Israel/Fisher_Schwartz.pdf|pg||
nt|jallerton:  for N/S convention card|pg||
nt|MolvaM: in the older days 8-9 points flat hand was an invitational hand. now it is routine 3nt|pg||
nt|kit: Is declarer still thinking about the play at trick 1?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: yes|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|s8|pg||

nt|roswolf: a few 50's probably|pg||
nt|ady: can hardly blame east for no protection   and west a bit fixed     west might have overcalled 1@H|pg||
pc|s6|nt|star6ija: actually this double might have been misunderstood from S...I really doubt they play penalty doubles in this situation|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer will set up a @d trick and try for a crossruff|pg||

nt|vugraphzgp: N asking about Ws alternative bids|pg||
nt|psyck: @s would have been better for defense, but difficult with that holding|pg||
nt|baldjean: hard to find that lead. it might as well have given a trump trick away|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|ady: 2@H made in OR so Bulgaria should gain 2 imps|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|nt|santyclz: Yes, needed to avoid leading a @d from hand.|pg||
nt|ady: looks like defence should play trumps at every opportunity  even west give up a trump trick to stop any cross ruff|pg||

nt|barnets: down 1|pg||
nt|psyck: same contract other room|pg||
nt|baldjean: since S could easily hold AKJ in @s|pg||
nt|psyck: sure @s lead by W unlikely but @h to E & @s back was a possibility|pg||
nt|psyck: & another @s after @cA...|pg||
nt|gulyas: declarer trying to ruff a @H in dummy, but it will not work|pg||

nt|fabsayc: go Italy :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|ady: seems no where to go for defence to prevail|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think birman has to give a neutral signal|pg||
nt|roswolf: also it should be remembered that Israel have a chance to qualify for the BB as well if they win heavily|pg||
nt|fabsayc: which is what he seems to have done|pg||
pc|d7|nt|star6ija: 690 is the most probable result here|pg||
nt|poohbear: No reason to dbl opps who voluntarily bid game. ESPECIALLY nv|pg||
nt|star6ija: right...|pg||
nt|poohbear: imp odds terrible|pg||
nt|santyclz: Back to -1 again...|pg||
nt|roswolf: but declarer looks good|pg||
pc|d6|nt|geot: Note that even on a spade lead there is no chance in this contract|pg||
pc|d2|nt|poohbear: if they make 5 imps against. If they go down 1,  2 imps for . If they go down 2 then 5 imps|pg||
nt|desinka: why both tables starts from 1st board?|pg||
nt|sastro: Roland sollte @h zurückspielen- hat Jörg mit @D Dame gezeigt|pg||
nt|gulyas: now S will exit with a trump|pg||
nt|poohbear: need to cash the @c ace to avoid the endplay |pg||
nt|gulyas: but even a @D would do|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|jbgood: only a heart lead gives it|pg||
nt|geot: In fact it is in theory possible to go 2 down bye endplaying declarer|pg||
nt|poohbear: If they make overtricks..........|pg||
nt|desinka: h tables starts from 1st board..|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sQ|nt|ady: now trump trump|pg||
nt|fabsayc: does not really matter, west gets two trump tricks for down 1|pg||

nt|psyck: as we see, Versace did indeed lead @s other room|pg||

nt|roswolf: although it is basically the same whatever he plays|pg||
nt|ady: 12 tricks possible now|pg||
nt|gulyas: 4@C probably a natural slam try|pg||
nt|gulyas: cue bids follow|pg||
nt|ady: if Gold plays on diamonds  east will need a low spade shift at some time to hold to 8|pg||
pc|d2|nt|geot: and Norway can't really complain about bad luck on board 1, because East's @H opening was on a 10 count with 10 to five hearts. He got punished hard.|pg||

nt|ady: 5@H   carrys risk this hand   cannot afford the safety play in trumps   does not want north on lead for a spade switch|pg||
nt|gulyas: its always hard to find slam when you have a void, unless you plan on using exclusion|pg||
nt|gulyas: oops, a wheel fell off|pg||
nt|gulyas: S thought his @Hs are worth something|pg||
nt|poohbear: Ace of trumps is the hardest one to Q bid|pg||

mb|p|nt|poohbear: very aggressive bidding|pg||
nt|desinka: sry, 2@C 1+|pg||
nt|star6ija: some misbalanced auction|pg||
nt|star6ija: and the penalty will be as severe as possible|pg||

nt|sastro: das XX sieht Kaplan nicht gerne, weil es schlechte Werte verspricht|pg||

nt|ady: A@H lead would help declarer|pg||

nt|poohbear: Ducking a @c makes it easy for the defense to play a @d|pg||
nt|poohbear: I dont think a dbl squeeze works. Ducking a @d will squeeze the dummy |pg||
nt|poohbear: and ducking a @c will get a @d played|pg||
nt|poohbear: Padon has to be worried about 3-3 @ds on the auction|pg||
nt|poohbear: Needs both the J of @hs and the @d Q|pg||

nt|barnets: north has to hold his trump losers to 2|pg||
nt|jbennet: perhaps possible, |pg||
nt|jbennet: south might play west for 1552 |pg||
nt|santyclz: With the short @cs and @ss in the same hand it looks possible.|pg||
nt|barnets: dont think he will make it|pg||
nt|barnets: will lose 3 trumps and diamond likely|pg||
nt|nevaio: if he plays 2 round of cl and spade...|pg||

nt|barnets: then west is endplayed|pg||
nt|santyclz: He has to play @cs and if/when w ruffs what does he exit with?|pg||

nt|jbennet: but if south had placed west with 1552 from start (not unreasoanble since west might have led singelton club if he had one.|pg||
nt|barnets: you see with the extraction west would have to play a red card that would eliminate souths red loser|pg||

nt|barnets: at the 4 level|pg||
nt|santyclz: Is there any possibility this is a cue in support of @Ss?|pg||
nt|barnets: is this a natural bid|pg||
nt|jbennet: west made a clever move; 4 clubs then removing 4 sp should tell his p "I have a massive red-suiter and think that the 5 level is safe"|pg||
nt|barnets: why do I have this problem ?|pg||
nt|barnets: he thinks it should be obvious to his partner but I assure you it is not|pg||
nt|jbennet: cue for spades?? 5 clubs would be cue for spades. |pg||
nt|barnets: or he would have bid already|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: east has hands on head thinking|pg||
nt|barnets: east is wondering what is going on and probably should bid 6@D to cover all possiblities|pg||
nt|santyclz: Many are telling me (all for different reasons) that this "Can't" show @s support.  I agree, if you're looking at the w hand it's obvious it can't.|pg||
nt|barnets: you , I and west know that bit does east ?|pg||
nt|jbennet: so east have to work this out, but if he thinks that west is showing a red 2-suiter good enough to go to the 5 level. East just might raise to 6 d.|pg||
nt|barnets: the club can be pitched on a long diamond|pg||
nt|barnets: after a backward fineese|pg||
nt|ritong: je suis très vieux jeu, j ai des informateurs  je déteste le double écran|pg||
nt|ady: could be right to trust diamonds 3-2  and play ace and king  to gauard against QX with west for a damaging spade switch    if east wins Q@D   no problem|pg||
nt|eggy:  Presumably the x shows a singleton D?|pg||

nt|geot: 7@S can always be won on a diamond ruff, but are there communication for a double squeeze in NT. Definitely a heart lead will break all chances in NT|pg||
nt|geot: Yes the double squeeze works without a heart lead|pg||
nt|geot: You may ask why South did not double 4@H in this sequence?|pg||
nt|geot: Lets say a club or a spade lead in NT, declarer cashes A of clubs, enter dummy with the @SJ and cash the club king|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: yes - he should have done as he had no pass cards left|pg||
nt|rodvenn: so he hopes that club ruffs will make Souths trumps good. To no avail.|pg||

pc|sT|nt|kit: And the double may be conventional vs. str NT, penalty vs. weak.|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sJ|nt|ritong: or double means penalty, often based on a long suit and east is not keen on leaving it in, for some reason, so 2@c inquires about the suit of the doubler|pg||

nt|sastro: @c - as Angriff ist nicht ungewöhnlich|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  Forrester makes the practical pressure bid.  Might miss a slam sometimes, but also forces the opponents to guess at a very high level|pg||
nt|ady: 5@S  presume   after n/s bid to 5@C     so good decision in OR   good score for England|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  just needs the h10 onside|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  He's thinking about how to make it with hKQ offside. There are elimination chances.|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  If he ruffs a spade, crosses in trumps twice to ruff his spades, and exits with the third diamond, he just needs the d10 onside.|pg||
nt|ady: play does not make sense otherwise|pg||
mb|2S|nt|xenya: presumably this shows 4/5 @S/@H?|pg||

nt|ady: was down|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe you are right|pg||
nt|gulyas: NS played the safer-looking 4@H on bd8, but that was also down on a trump promotion, so only a loss of 3 imps for going down a few extra in 3nt|pg||

nt|barnets: lucky for e/w no X|pg||

nt|ady: if hearts are led and continued after losing diamond finesse then may have to take the same 9 tricks  unable to finesse spades|pg||
nt|fabsayc: kibitzer saying 1@D merely denies a 5 card major|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzgp: one round of hearts have been played so far|pg||
nt|jbgood: so maybe Norway will get off the schneid now|pg||
nt|geot: N/S can win 6@D on this hand, but only double dummy. Has to drop the @DK|pg||

nt|vugraphzgp: 10 diamond lead from south on 5th trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: club discarded West and east|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: west and north|pg||
nt|geot: N/S still bidding this hand in the OR, on their way to a possible slam that normally will fail. But they are lacking 2 Key Cards in a diamond contract, so I suspect 5@D will be the ...|pg||
nt|geot: contract.|pg||
nt|jbennet: 5h can even be set -3. |pg||

nt|eggy:  There isn;t a chance in the world that N will get the spades right|pg||

nt|roswolf: the israelis on the way|pg||
nt|ady: unlucky 6@H for England in OR    5-0 diamond split|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: sure seems NS had 9 tricks on defense that last hand|pg||
nt|tez: keser var mý yok mu?|pg||
nt|arigun:  hersey bilinirse 4@h oluyor ama batma olasiligi var|pg||
mb|5S!|nt|geot: 7-3 fit in hearts again (N/S)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: 11 tricks agreed by teams|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: E did ask his partner why the panic to cash|pg||
nt|ady: with a free run n/s might have played 3NT    but now may settle for a diamond part score|pg||
nt|barnets: :) well put|pg||
nt|roswolf: west will now revalue his hand skywards|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1@H-3@D= any shortness 8singleton, not void)-3@H= ask,3@S= short @C|pg||
nt|ady: 7 level save  800   |pg||
nt|ady: England ventured rather high on limited values  in OR|pg||
mb|d!|nt|tez: diðer masa da 3 nt|pg||
nt|2celik1: 10 love aldi|pg||
nt|yusufb: kaldýrabilir versace en azýndan 4nt den korkmaz eli|pg||

nt|ady: Irish lukcy to be undoubled here|pg||
nt|remo: srry|pg||
nt|roswolf: so  iam informed by some specs|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  Unlikely to lead a heart, so another pick up for England|pg||
nt|ady: another bid result for England    avoiding the heart lead  can take their 9 tricks|pg||
mb|6H|nt|yusufb: bu eldede dogu eliyle tercihim 1nt degilde X olurdu|pg||
nt|tez: 4 te kaldýlar þlem elini..|pg||
nt|tez: berabere olacak|pg||
nt|tez: yok en fazla 3 el|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: bence 4@h batacak|pg||
nt|arigun:  @h 2 kaptirirsa @d yu bilmesi lazim|pg||
nt|yusufb: @h Q koyarsa batar|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in europe many pairs use 2@C natural and 2@D for majors, that may have had something to do with the first norwegian disaster|pg||
nt|lechcold: tak, przejrza³em pobie¿nie rozdania. Dunki rzeczywicie nie zostawi³y wielu szans naszym Paniom.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: so  -4 rather than -2|pg||
nt|tez: 6@d da sorun yok|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2D showed 5 @ds and 8+ points|pg||
nt|arvidsson: ok then I guess W raised with a @S H or S finessed with T of @S|pg||
nt|barnets: needs a spade lead or switch to beat it|pg||
nt|tomi2: does anybody know what 2@D was?|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  west opened a multi in the other room|pg||
nt|barnets: Sementa misguessed heat in 4@S|pg||
nt|gulyas: 1@H was a xfer, showing @Ss|pg||
nt|ritong: you ll have to correct score on board 11, op|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: i trzba tê zarazê rozszerzyæ na inne konkurencje, zw³¹szcza na seniorów|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: since partner is passed hand East just bids 3NT|pg||

nt|tez: @s dam uçuyor|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: tedbirli oynarsa yapar ama|pg||
nt|tez: haklýsýn haklýsýn|pg||
nt|roswolf: exclusion blackwood|pg||
nt|gulyas: so 2@S just showed 4 cards, and a minimum|pg||
nt|fluffy: 1@h is a transfer bid showing your normal 1@s response in walsh style, 2@s just shows 4 cards in a weak nt context normally|pg||
nt|gulyas: now E is trying for slam by first a game invite, denied, then a cue bid|pg||
nt|antoniz: lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: Will make 10 or 11 depending on the play of the trumps. |pg||
nt|tez: içerde tokay biraz acele etmiþ|pg||
nt|yusufb: 4@d kaldýrýnca laura eli cok degerli oldu @s puaný yok AKQ@c AJ@d var|pg||
nt|tez: puanlarý @s te sandý Nafiz|pg||
nt|2celik1: bari 7 deseler |pg||
nt|tez: onlar kontrol gösterirken keykart sayýsýný da veriyorlar ama burada emin deðilim|pg||
nt|ady: no  still 3NT     need to get spade position to make|pg||
nt|ritong: il me semble que le déclarant aura un choix|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@D|pg||
nt|sastro: Polewt denkt sicher, dass die anderen 4 @h drin haben- geht aber nicht|pg||
nt|roswolf: i dont like that dbl|pg||
nt|fabsayc: really bad double of 5@S|pg||
nt|ady: dbl of 5@S  says no spade lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: unless it means DONT LEAD A SPADE|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vahaboglu: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H alert because may have longer @C/@D|pg||
nt|barnets: moment of truth is now|pg||
nt|barnets: for spade switch|pg||
nt|tomi2: "weak Multi" also ein schwacher schwacher Einfärber in einer Oberfarbe|pg||
nt|tomi2: das erklärt, warum Ost keine Ambitionen Richtung Vollspiel hatte|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: i wonder if Brink-Drijver will play this hand in 3N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we see that perfect defense defeats 3N |pg||
nt|ahollan1: but if defense does NOT take first 5 -- then declarer takes first 9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Drijver did rebid 3N with east hand|pg||
nt|poohbear: if partner was unpassed and unlimited East would bid 2NT and give partner room to describe|pg||
nt|panosk: this might get expensive|pg||
nt|ritong: soit le @sR, soit l as de @h|pg||
nt|ritong: bien mis|pg||
nt|gulyas: W with no cue would bid 4@S I thought|pg||
nt|fluffy: either 4@c is a rare convention or 4@h is a psyche|pg||
nt|gulyas: in slam you need the @DA doubleton to have a chance|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  4@H is "last train"|pg||
nt|ritong: bit optimistic, maybe|pg||
nt|gulyas: last train for what? he has no controls to speak of|pg||
nt|barnets: :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: a super minimum, I would not even open that hand:)|pg||
nt|fluffy: no controls, minimum etc, but he has @dQ where he said he didn't wanna play game, so maybe it looks good for him|pg||
nt|ritong: quacky 11 does not seem to justify any merrygorounding|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  he has good pades and the @CA and rejected the game invit, not ideal bud ...|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  but ...|pg||
nt|barnets: not sure he can make 6 eben guessing diamonds|pg||
nt|barnets: even guessing|pg||
nt|fluffy: QJxx is great in 8 card fit, but it can be worthless on 10 card fit|pg||
nt|barnets: he has to ruff a diamond and a heart in hand|pg||
nt|barnets: and trumps are 3-1|pg||
nt|gulyas: even if they guess the @DAx location, he will have his work cut out for him|pg||
nt|fluffy: if you paly perfectly and ruff 2 club in hand, north will be squeezed in the minors|pg||
nt|barnets: needs a diamond lead to make I think|pg||
nt|gulyas: with @Cs 6-2 as well, he cannot ruff everything in hand low|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  Hi Barnet, I'n not suggesting they should bid slam, just trying to interpret the bid 4@H|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, a @DJ lead helps a lot:)|pg||
nt|ritong: i agree with your position, SO|pg||
nt|fluffy: sorry, ruff 2@c in dummy, they transfered declarer :)|pg||
nt|ritong: he has said " i have nada" already, and can consider he has a good nada|pg||
nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
nt|ritong: so i take back my merry go round|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|kbitzer: 600  cepte görmek  dbl ý tutmak..|pg||
nt|yusufb: rakip 1nt dedikten sonra 3nt ye ulaþmak ve yapmak cok nadir olan bi durum|pg||
nt|arvidsson: a very good double by E and this might be whats needed for norway to get back in the lead |pg||
nt|arvidsson: declarer need to cash out for -800 otherwise this could go for 1100|pg||
nt|yusufb: @c cýk|pg||
nt|tez: çýk @c i|pg||
nt|tez: çýkar bence|pg||
nt|yusufb: cýkabilir @c|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: anladýlar batacaðýný belki 3NT olur dediler|pg||
nt|ady: CR   settled for diamond part score   so lleaders may go further ahead|pg||
nt|barnets: he took an early wrong position in hearts rather than delaying it|pg||
nt|gulyas: a trump lead gives away the @ST show|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|barnets: now a low club lead|pg||
nt|yusufb: bravo salvo|pg||
nt|arigun:  @h de dogru oyun 8'e dogru oynamak ama yanlis yapar dam koyarsa ve pisman olursa @d da yuksek ihtimal cift pass (masada kaybettiriyor)|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: @c atak batýrma þansýný artýrýr|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: çok güzel çýktý|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: en azýndan ümit vaadediyor|pg||
nt|tez: burda @c i çýkarttýk..öbür odada da 4@h ü yaptýralým|pg||
nt|arigun:  iste haldun farki|pg||
nt|yusufb: bunada yapabilir ama kolay degil|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: þimdi kaldý oyunu batýrmaya|pg||
nt|arigun:  gelir gelmez bi 5 bi 12 aliyoru,|pg||
nt|tisserand: good contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: efficiently done|pg||
nt|roswolf: now north must be careful|pg||
nt|fabsayc: some are claiming double says dont lead a spade|pg||
nt|ady: England will lose impos though  as no double   and only 1 down now|pg||
pc|d4|nt|xenya: so the off-the-wall preempt by E has worked...|pg||
nt|tisserand: molto bravi|pg||
nt|eggy:  I hadn;t forgotten|pg||
nt|gulyas: so really N can only lead a @H safely|pg||
nt|fluffy: 5@c shows 1-4, not 5@d will ask for @sQ most likelly, althou maybe birman goes all in with 9 trumps|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: what do YOU lead from south hand against 3N  [without peeking at north hand]?|pg||
nt|star6ija: this one looks like overbid|pg||
nt|barnets: in open north made mistake and split diamonds|pg||
nt|barnets: giving an extra trick there|pg||
pc|h3|nt|baardolav: well done Nybo... +1|pg||
nt|barnets: and west makes a ruff|pg||
nt|ady: sorry   open room|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s didnt bid - unsurprisingly|pg||
nt|barnets: looks easy to us|pg||
mc|11|nt|2celik1: kotu oldu bu board|pg||
nt|sengulerz: çok güzel konuþtular (maalesef)|pg||
nt|arvidsson: but I would see the player that do not take the @C finesse|pg||
nt|rodvenn: this is traditional double: I have something in your suit pd. |pg||
nt|tez: büyük abi 1 fazla olur diyor ama o @d valeyi oturtuyor|pg||
nt|kareno: He needs three tricks from spades.|pg||
nt|barnets: we would finesse the spade|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but since Gold lead one anyway i am not convinced|pg||
nt|dburn: double does indeed mean "don't lead spades"|pg||
nt|roswolf: phew!:)|pg||

nt|MolvaM: only monaco made the slam (6nt)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so far|pg||
nt|rmb1: or does doubling 5S and not doubling 6H ask for a club lead - don't lead spades, and don't lead their side suit|pg||

nt|rodvenn: only 3 down?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: 1100 and norway back in the lead|pg||
nt|ady: 3 spades    so there was no double on hand 2?|pg||
nt|barnets: anyway a better auction by Italy and deserved imps|pg||
nt|andersk: Bulgaria was in the lead 36-4 after 6 boards vs Norway....now after 12 boards, the scoore is 65-36 to Norway, this might be good news for Italy and Israel|pg||

mb|1C!|nt|xenya: NS had no problem at other table|pg||
nt|poohbear: at least in Victory Points|pg||
nt|panosk: he did score @CA in the end apparently|pg||
nt|barnets: today yes is the answer|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe not tomorrow|pg||
nt|barnets: east could have x 6@C to suggest lead of course so blame east|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: açýldý takým|pg||
nt|barnets: north has the dreaded 7-2-2-2 pattern|pg||
nt|gulyas: 11 to Monaco, the match closer again, ISR by 8|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: DBL can also include normal strong NT|pg||

nt|ahollan1:  11  Lauria-Versace reach 4@S after Fitzgibbon DBL of opening bid|pg||
nt|barnets: which often turns out badly for preempts|pg||
nt|kareno: No, this did not go this way operator|pg||

nt|fabsayc: ok david, that explanation seems more accurate|pg||
nt|ady: diamonds will be played|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: Gold said that he felt if it was not standing up the contract was making anyway - hence the lead|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|barnets: and are piling on the imps|pg||
nt|ady: tht north might have taken some action   maybe dbl    but has done ok to lay quiet|pg||
nt|ady: this should be a push|pg||

nt|ritong: fantunes open many bizarre hands 1NT, due to their 1X forcing opening|pg||
pc|s8|nt|yusufb: zpas pas makul|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think he didnt like his @d holding and also @hs might be wasted|pg||
nt|poohbear: Has to avoid a @d ruff and at the same time not get forced in @cs|pg||
nt|psyck: lucky @dJ single|pg||
nt|roswolf: game might be bid by some folk on the grounds we're vul and games seems around 30%+|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|andyv:  and the match is tied|pg||
nt|tez: @h dam al @s oyna|pg||
nt|poohbear: If he plays AK of @s then he might lose to 4-1 spades. |pg||
nt|barnets: south won the points here by bidding 3@H and tking away a constructive move from west|pg||
nt|jbennet: will he make it?|pg||
nt|jbennet: 4 sp+|pg||
nt|santyclz: While any team could win any match, you're not going to get rich betting against Italy...|pg||
nt|barnets: in other room south passed 1@S|pg||
nt|ady: likely spade lead    then easy|pg||
nt|ritong: that one is not a pure example, ofc|pg||
nt|fluffy: 3@h is very good, defence lacks the comunication to put it down on a diamond ruff|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jbgood: Norwegian ladies way ahead against Germany! (without Auken - von Arnim on the team though)  |pg||
nt|psyck: & trump 22|pg||

nt|james_h: unfortunately there is no minor suit squeeze as north has to discard before east|pg||
nt|ady: now looking further     5@C seems ok    but 6 should fail    although only 1 top loser|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think 6 will make actually|pg||
nt|ady: might make 12 tricks in clubs as A@D   comes down in 3   so can play diamond to king   and ruff the ace out   also ruff finesse k@S|pg||
nt|gulyas: right, N has no reentry to give S a @D ruff|pg||
pc|d4|nt|geot: Blind guess what to lead of H or S, and spade lead seems more appealing I guess|pg||

nt|ady: england in 5@D   on position of A@S   decent contract|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: of course  07:30 here, so i may be hallucinating|pg||

nt|geot: Yes, Jon. Lucky slam is the word. I will not call it a good slam though :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: neither would I!|pg||

mb|p|nt|star6ija: killing lead...|pg||
nt|james_h: that 3@s was a killer|pg||
nt|ady: ungainly contract    need to keep this to losing 3 trump tricks|pg||

nt|lokaty: muttering, battering must be difficult for You there?:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: and to our spec - we hope you all enjoyed the show|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@H usually less than game force|pg||
nt|arvidsson: (N in that room did not open on his 9 count as found in this table) did let the opponents in (not to be read as open every 9 count) :)|pg||
nt|tez: milli takýmýz bu maçta kötü skor aldý çünkü hem çok þanssýzdýk hem de iyi oynamadýk|pg||

nt|jaapfr: forr the real lovers an exciting 1nt|pg||
nt|ami61: +|pg||
nt|fabsayc: birman does not have a good bid now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe 4@c as cue for hearts|pg||
nt|roswolf: just will bid 4@h since he has forced to game|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: and his discomfort is showing- hair pulling again!|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: and N didnt take some action and 4@H were lost|pg||
nt|panosk: in this 1|pg||
nt|arvidsson: this time it is the latvians that is outbid|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: Boks|pg||
nt|tez: iyiyken þansýn olmalý|pg||
nt|ady: Verace balanceing with weak hand but 7 card suit  knowing east must have some fair values  when 1NT passed round|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks risky but e/w are limited by their respective actions|pg||
nt|ady: last hand of the segment    thx all   thx op  and specs|pg||
nt|jaapfr: for declarer and defense|pg||
nt|dburn: he could bid 3@s if that were fourth suit, or he could bid 4@h if 3@s would be a cue for hearts|pg||
mb|4H|nt|poohbear: 0 + diamonds I am tild. I am commenting in American precision . No Google translator to Bulgarian precision :P|pg||
nt|tez: genciz güzeliz..en kýsa zamanda gideriz:)|pg||
nt|psyck: Last deal, thanks all.|pg||
nt|barnets: yes good set to watch|pg||
nt|ady: danterous in this case as n/s have 4@S on|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2nt a scramble manoeuvre for the minors|pg||
nt|ady: could make 12 on that lead|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: no có¿ - nasze gwiazdy coraz czêciej opuszczaj¹ stóly przed koñcem meczu - rodzi siê pewna tradycja|pg||
nt|ady: there could be a swing either way if Israel bid a slam here    though 6@H rates to go down even without a spade lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: tks all|pg||
nt|jaapfr: butler score you find in small box in the middle of the result page|pg||
nt|ahollan1: have you seen this transfer overcall before?|pg||

nt|ady: Laria obviously cant take a joke  |pg||
nt|ady: Lauria|pg||
nt|roswolf: south has been very conservative throughout the match - doubt he will chang now|pg||
nt|roswolf: there is a case for bidding 41s now|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@s|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  having started with a X because he judged the hand too strong to overcall 1@s, Svendsen follows up by X 1NT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@H is a slight underbid|pg||
nt|dburn: 6@h is just about OK - slightly worse than the club finesse|pg||
