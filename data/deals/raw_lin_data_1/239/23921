nt|patricck: The 3 card diamond opening effectively stopped NS competing to 3@D|pg||
nt|andyv:  a couple of ways to play the @h suit...both work this time|pg||
nt|jbgood: Brogeland is fighting|pg||
nt|bobholl: the 7 i hope but i guess he will put the J|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ady: very likely some action from north|pg||

nt|murat e: good morning everybody|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mamos:  i agreealthough cant be sure oppo have found much of a fit|pg||

nt|roswolf: i would have passed 2@S and the 3 level may be uncomfortable|pg||
nt|jaapfr: not really imo|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @C8 a weapon|pg||

nt|jaapfr: true|pg||
nt|jaapfr: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer has to make the best oof his Diamonds though defence has a lot of work to do to make 5 tricks as well|pg||
nt|runnerup:  for some reason ns never bid in board 1 -in other room -and so nice 4 counter as south had -4 @s +1 a push :) |pg||
nt|jaapfr: but if @DQ in tr 3 he is down|pg||
pc|h2|nt|roswolf: 2@C is 98% forcing for most players|pg||
nt|murat e: with the diamond queen dropping all kinds of games possible here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW  odd/even discard|pg||

nt|bobholl: chauvinistic i am sry|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|runnerup:  north had sorry|pg||
nt|patricck: technically it loses on this layout, but only if North can duck smoothly wen a low heart is led from dummy|pg||
nt|andyv:  the @d tap may minimize declarer's options|pg||

pc|c2|nt|mamos: we might have expected the Netherlands to qualify but Welsh supporters will be pleased with their team's current position|pg||
nt|jaapfr: bad luck|pg||
nt|jaapfr: soccer?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ady: n/s need to defeat this to prevent a possible 6 or 7 imp loss  may still lose 2 or 3|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: sorry     still making   3 trump tricks 1 heart and 1 spade|pg||

nt|skaftij: Well, he could|pg||
nt|barnets: yes it is|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|roswolf: did north really duck!?omg|pg||
nt|patricck: potentially a part score swing for Israel, if NS can buy 3@D on the replay, but quite likely a flat board|pg||
pc|h3|nt|murat e: hi sunil|pg||
nt|mamos: defenders have their chance now  -- no clues for declarer I think|pg||

nt|murat e: very good result for ukraine|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: Was harder for Helgemo in the other room in 4@H he found the winning endplay|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: some discussion among israelis after last board|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  1 @H not everybodyÂ´s taste - and vulnerable|pg||

nt|ahollan1: of course  a lot of what i learned -- i got from Rob|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|runnerup:  7 @d perhaps best |pg||
nt|jbgood: first 3 to Israel for being allowed to play 2@h in the CR|pg||

nt|mamos:  1NT?|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 4 kolor|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y but scores less (7nt fine too)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  7 @s is not safe at all-if you lose 1 @s|pg||
nt|mamos: South has shown unbalanced hand with both blacks |pg||
nt|runnerup:  can you jump in partners opening suit -showing a void?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: the logic was how marginal it may seem that if @DK with E he could have played it in tricjk 3|pg||
nt|runnerup:  in xyz -you can just bid 2 @s|pg||
nt|jaapfr: to return @H|pg||
nt|mamos: im told 2@H would show @d and @hs 12+|pg||
nt|runnerup:  2 @d|pg||
nt|jaapfr: welsh with a promising start|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D = 4+@H|pg||
mb|2H|nt|roswolf: a fairly boring hand|pg||
mb|d|nt|mamos:  specs do speak to me glad to hear|pg||
nt|runnerup:  system is so that responder on second round can bid 2 @d -gf -or 2 @c to transfer -to show stop in @d or inveite in some other suit|pg||
nt|tweety1: brave 1 @c and 3 nt:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lechcold: 2@D to sztuczny forsing do dogranej|pg||

nt|garden2005: dawaj ¯mudziak 2NT :)|pg||
nt|skaftij: 2@d= 10-13 (good 9) 5+. unbalanced hand; in 3rd seat could be weaker and max 12|pg||
nt|murat e: ukraine still carry hopes for a seat in the first 9 and this match they need a good win to carry their hopes to last match|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: I think 1@H was alerted as multi ,,,there was some mention of multi at the table |pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: now Mdm Birman take a bid out and return it to box|pg||

nt|bobholl: will west bid 2@S 2nt or 3@D ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: or pass :)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ady: west has done well as it goes   3 diamonds down 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: gromov asks lavinthal or count and discussion ensues|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Helness tried 3NT in the other room, but the @C lead meant defence gets 4@C 1@S before you can get 9th|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ryskiel_: teraz dopiero 3@c?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: slam depends on bringing in the @Cs for the loss of 1 trick... not there|pg||
nt|runnerup:  they are on same pace of system declaration -good|pg||
nt|jbgood: should ask for a di shift...|pg||
nt|bobholl: doubled partscore lead trumps very good|pg||
pc|h3|nt|blum1956: hi all|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: will struggle to make this but north needs to unblock by plg the @SQ|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hi Micheal|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: actually if East had bid 6@H on a transfer seq then South might have led a nat @CK|pg||
nt|murat e: maybe he can try for elimination clubs were not led|pg||
nt|jaapfr: it is the same as in other sports: the small countries do not remain small:)|pg||
nt|mamos: presumably 4@c showed Spade fit|pg||
nt|jaapfr: are the scores for all kibs linked (you see OR played 7@D)??|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i get complaints|pg||
nt|jaapfr: tx kibs when you do not see change yr software|pg||
nt|runnerup:  north misses 2 key cards -but can he count those to his partner -i think he can |pg||
nt|mamos: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/Results.htm for links to all current running scores Board scores enough data to drown in|pg||
nt|patricck: EW can make 5@D, but hard to see how they would have bid it|pg||
nt|andyv:  this doesn't not appear to be the best spot for EW|pg||
nt|andyv:  E hand worth one more try over 3@d|pg||
nt|jbgood: duly delivered|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|mamos:  8 +|pg||
nt|murat e: israel already qualified but the matches between first 9 scores are carried to next round so somehow important for israel if ukraine manages to qualify|pg||
nt|poohbear: Would be more important if Israel can win the match and still have Ukraine qualify :)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|vugraphzgq: rombaut think|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: dec will duck this|pg||
nt|mamos:  yep defence looks likely to make five tricks|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: no squuuze as North can protect @S and @Ds|pg||

pc|c7|nt|ryskiel_: okazuje siê ¿e kluczowe by³o 2@s a nie 3 @d w poprzednim rozdaniu|pg||

nt|ahollan1: defense is getting more difficult though|pg||
nt|bobholl: no entry to the 2nd diamond|pg||
nt|ahollan1: perhaps deWijs should have flown @CA???|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess 2 down for 300 may be 500|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or  deWijs split @H honors at trick 1  but not sure how that would help Muller at this point|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ady: 5@C down 1 on hand 1 was flat|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Usain Bolt is faster than the players at this table|pg||

pc|c4|pc|dT|nt|andyv:  also depends on what EW play over the 2@s X...if a lebonsohl type system, 3@d shows values.|pg||
nt|patricck: On a trump lead 5@D would be completely relaint on the 3-3 @C break|pg||
nt|andyv:  some partnerships play 2N by W would be two places to play while others play simply a xfer to @cs|pg||
pc|hT|pc|c5|pg||

nt|skaftij: EW certinly not going to end up in 4@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: said nunes|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mamos:  i am asked if this opening  has a name |pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@h seems indicated now|pg||
nt|skaftij: Maybe 4@s and North may express an opinion about that contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: jorg pass fantoni thnk|pg||
nt|mamos: 3NT denie three card support for Spades I think|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@C creates danger of 6@C-1|pg||

nt|hawe45:  DidÂ´nt @S 8 show an even number?|pg||
nt|murat e: left 3nt behind now 5 dia maybe|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|jaapfr: or a small @H by N?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  yes if you don't use ligthner now|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: unless S take first heart with ace as one of the specs poitned out|pg||
nt|runnerup:  reverse ligthner|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i bet 6@C made|pg||
nt|jaapfr: how can he find @H lead|pg||
nt|patricck: On a spade switch declarer has to lead the right way in hearts|pg||
nt|patricck: or guess to finesse after the spade ruff|pg||
nt|andyv:  @s switch now?|pg||
nt|bobholl: if he plays the @S as ak (no finesse) he makes but he won't i fear|pg||
pc|c6|nt|hawe45:  No hurry, North|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: North is O.Herbst |pg||

nt|mlodygda83: it doesn't matter, you have 5 discards|pg||
nt|mamos: cant he make even on Heart|pg||
nt|jaapfr: even aunt truus makes 6@C on a non @H lead kibs:)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  -ok doubled -so lets se|pg||

pc|c9|pg||
pc|c5|nt|hawe45:  Why not discard 3 x @S from South, bridge is an easy game|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - the the even number is hardly 2!|pg||

nt|vugraphzgq: South thinking...|pg||
nt|murat e: things mixed up it seems|pg||
pc|cT|nt|hawe45:  If North had ducked, 9 tricks wer possible|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - and still possible. Maybe South will regret his @d-discard|pg||
nt|mamos:  although declarer surely likely to play South for @dQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: N thinking|pg||
nt|mamos:  i dont understand why  South didnt discard Spade to give count|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Would 4 diamonds to the Queen really be your first discard-choice?|pg||
nt|mamos:  no I agree but surely more @d length in South might even imagine 5 wirth @c 4-0|pg||
nt|mamos: this wont make|pg||
pc|cK|nt|blum1956: In fact, it is hard to bid 3NT, but it makes as EW cannot take both a club and an extra diamond trick|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but who will lead a @H small in dummy against 6@C?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/Results.htm |pg||
nt|jaapfr: yes indeed IF 6@C @H2 lead and @H4 in dummy one can make 6@C|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but very DD story imo|pg||
nt|mamos: i agree jaap|pg||
nt|runnerup:  6 @c looked making -and this -no chance so strange 6nt |pg||
nt|andyv:  that play takes a lot of nerve|pg||
nt|murat e: declarer has to play well to make 5 dia after heart lead|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: I lost play ù|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Its been suggested the 1@S shows 0-3@S and no @H stop, can someone confirm|pg||
nt|skaftij: In OR, 1NT showed 14-16, so impossible for Jonsson-Baldursson to stop short of game|pg||
nt|barnets: if dec leads clubs nort should win the ace and clear hearts|pg||
nt|barnets: dec should of course then test spades first|pg||
nt|barnets: @CJ low low @CA|pg||
pc|c8|nt|roswolf: a spade switch is more likely|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jaapfr: pls check other tables if 6@C was made or down (imo 50% will make it)|pg||
nt|jbgood: if I remember correctly the rebid of 2@h in the CR shows a 18-20 balanced (or so)|pg||

nt|400 volt: 8-17 hcp in general|pg||
nt|400 volt: obviously east upgraded because he had 6@C and @C 1098 and @S 10|pg||
nt|roswolf: the norsemen in the other room did well for team Monaco|pg||
nt|andyv:  @c finesse was forced.  Declarer needed K@c to be in N hand...otherwise S would get in and push a @h thru before the @d pitch|pg||

nt|400 volt: it's even 2 down on a @D lead|pg||
nt|400 volt: west will soon be surprised that his partner has the @S-suit, 2@D probably asks for the major |pg||
nt|arderi:  1@c is special bid: 12-16 any unbal hand or 15-17NT|pg||

nt|ahollan1: EW flip flop normal meaning of PASS/DBL|pg||

mb|p|nt|mamos:  low scoring in most matches over these first few boards - these two teams lead in Group A  but scores are very closely bunched as we  would expect|pg||
nt|patricck: The Hungarian East switched to a small @S on board 5 just the same as this room. I fear that I would have failed the test as well, but I agree leading the Q@S is better|pg||

mb|p|nt|tomi2: did Fisher play the 13th @D to promote a trump trick?|pg||

nt|mamos:  ah   wont East have Spade trick or Spade exit|pg||
nt|ady: as said still only 8 tricks with an end play|pg||
nt|skaftij: 2@s, sry pard for bidding a 4 card suit :-)|pg||
nt|patricck: While declarer can still make on a @C switch it doesn't seem likely he would play for exactly this layout and spurn the 50% chance of a club finesse|pg||
nt|andyv:  now it's more difficult...he needed to lead a @h at trick 2 so that his timing would be better (he could ruff a 3rd @h after only one round of @cs were played to see if suit broke)|pg||
nt|patricck: Still just 1-0 after 6 comparisons, but I think there could be a swing on board 7|pg||
nt|barnets: In 3N duck a hear win the heart lose a diamond to East then cash clubs and run the @S8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that is coolest part of KnR tool -- let's you see how small changes to a hand can have huge impact on value|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mamos:  oor|pg||
nt|mamos:  Germany picking up imps regularly|pg||

mb|p|nt|petergill: Contract was 4@H - bidding not shown due to the crash|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: 4@S might of course make if defenders do not cash their four tricks fast enough|pg||
nt|400 volt: this is a routine 4@S|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, certainly not a clear error|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: david birman sends me to check the time remaining ...54 minutes|pg||

mb|p|nt|arderi:  So that lession costs 17 imps|pg||

nt|jbgood: difficult not to - prd could have either red ace|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|arderi:  This looks hopeless to Baldursson|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: west has to find some testing discards|pg||
nt|400 volt: smirnov tries to give south the feeling @S are not breaking favorable, but I doubt this will work after east was playing the @S 9|pg||
nt|mamos:  play is very slow NS especially it seems|pg||
nt|yanivz: hi|pg||
nt|400 volt: otherwise if east holds @S 10983 he could have played the @S 9, too|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@C was the second|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the running score shows  4 only -1  and that result comes from bridgemate entry|pg||

nt|roswolf: this should be flat|pg||
nt|petergill: Flat board - 4@H and 4@S both are good contracts - I'm not sure which contract is superior, perhaps 4@H.  |pg||
nt|petergill: on Bd 10|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: when I was on board 8 I accidently clicked redeal and this blocks the scoring system|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i think when you do not cash @DA one could make 4@H (which bright kib wants o review in detail?)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: comfort break|pg||
nt|andyv:  result duplicated on board 7|pg||

nt|patricck: oh yes, so he did.... I saw the 3NT bid but it was from EW|pg||
nt|oliverc: This looks like a fairly inevitable 4@S for NS|pg||

nt|farrukh: actually east was helpless, if he returned a @h, he would break squeeze but give declarer @c ruff so declarer was always gonna make it|pg||
nt|gewd: not really...|pg||
nt|farrukh: Like I said earlier that e/w need careful defence to beat it|pg||

nt|hawe45:  play|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes indeed|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard to ask for @d switch with W hand but, if E is awake, the 8@h would be the card for the @d switch|pg||
nt|jbgood: defense could go wrong against 4 - if for example heart to ace and another - the club loser might disappear on g good diamond|pg||
nt|barnets: israel have 45 unanswered imps in last boards|pg||
nt|barnets: only way to go down i think|pg||
nt|pelu:  oh we had a flat bpard in No 3 :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: mdm birman is annoyed with herself |pg||

nt|jaapfr: 3@D can give a new leader|pg||
mb|2N|nt|400 volt: 1@C shows either a balanced 11-13(14) count with 2+ @C, or an unbalanced hand with @C or 18+ any distribution|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H = 11-15 hcp  and can include 5@H 8@S !!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: 3N may make n/s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=@H, INV|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|farrukh: but dbl seems reasonable|pg||
nt|murat e: yes they have values to bid it|pg||
nt|bobholl: difficult 6@H/ @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|farrukh: obviously had to be slow, he had choice between bidding 2@s, dbl and pass|pg||
nt|petergill: At this table, when 4@H was reached, EW had extra info due to the "14+ pts" nature of the Fantunes 1@C opening, |pg||
nt|barnets: in 3N dec just has to guess the @SJ|pg||
mb|4S|nt|400 volt: 4@C obviously showed both majors|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: In spite of 27 hcp, game is not completely safe|pg||
nt|bobholl: they are going well i guess|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now 5@D should do it|pg||
nt|bobholl: wijs now thinking i should have given a splinter in @C |pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos:  thats not the bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: missed bidding final contract 4@h South|pg||
nt|arderi:  2@h was good raise to 2@s|pg||
nt|petergill: allowing EW to bid on|pg||
nt|petergill: on Bd 11|pg||
nt|petergill: 1NT 12-14, can be offshape|pg||

mb|4N|nt|ryskiel_: rany boskie z czym ta laga Narkiego?>|pg||
nt|lechcold: teraz bêdzie jeszcze wiêkszy dramat|pg||
nt|tomi2: ok, israel was not even close to bid 4@S on the hand where we had the misunderstanding here, they bid 2@S only and gain some 11 or 12 imps|pg||
nt|mamos:  :)|pg||
nt|arderi:  Baldursson has nothing more|pg||
nt|runnerup:  sorry have to leave -see you  later .have  nice bords to watch -bye|pg||
nt|patricck: no, surely not|pg||
nt|jbgood: 4 card supp and 18-19 balanced |pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos:  defence needs @s ruff|pg||
nt|400 volt: even @S ruff doesn't kill the contract|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West is top-class, but the three swiss ar not good|pg||
nt|andyv:  undo please|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: If you play heart to the Q, you have better chances of an end game with the spade king in E|pg||
nt|barnets: I just say you cant quarel with succes when all other plays dont work Pter thats all|pg||
mb|5C|nt|farrukh: but N/S is have earned the board now|pg||

nt|oliverc: have|pg||
mb|d|nt|400 volt: you need to get your @D trick too|pg||
nt|murat e: just makes|pg||
nt|arderi:  looks like 8 tricks if defence take their tricks|pg||
nt|jaapfr: -2|pg||
nt|mamos: hard to imagine anything other than Club and blood spilled|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 22-29|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: lithuania bid and made 3nt on this board|pg||
nt|pelu:  what a upgrade - 1NT is 15-17 - :)|pg||
mb|p!|nt|ady: now 1 trump trick|pg||
nt|yanivz: only chance is @D shift and declerer try to enter table with S! |pg||
nt|yanivz: @s|pg||
nt|400 volt: some pairs play K lead of AK shows a single in another suit so when you switch to a short suit you show a singleton|pg||
nt|barnets: well dc wont be worried about the lead :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: PASS denies @C control??    but didn't 4N imply one???    can we please go back and bid 5@D instead of 4N|pg||
nt|bobholl: even V against nv 7@C/@D are good saves (800 only)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nystrom in 6@H after Brink overcalled 2N with 3@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unless of course 4@D already said void @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  3 NT must be played by West - otherwise a @C-lead might defeat it|pg||
nt|jbgood: best line to play W for H10 in hearts isolated to the trump suit?|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: So rather even between heart to the Q or heart to the 9|pg||
mb|5D|nt|farrukh: if south gets a @d ruff 500|pg||
nt|farrukh: wow, that looks like very desperate lead to me, |pg||
nt|ady: israel gained 10 on hand 9 where 3NT was made    same contract in open room  but not made|pg||
nt|andyv:  so we will assume that NS are in 4@hs|pg||
mb|p|nt|jkotor: rozumiem, ¿e to jest sposób stawiania 1100 jak w pierwszym meczu|pg||

nt|lechcold: tym razem gwarantujê, ¿e THomas nie wszed³ z mocnej trójki:)|pg||
nt|patricck: only possible if South has two cards hidden :)  Contract is surely 4@H|pg||

nt|djneill:  it's just too hard to figure it out|pg||
nt|petergill: We know as much as you about the bidding after 3@S = not much. Not sure why Dubinin bid 4@H instead of 3NT. an untidy auction on a difficult hand to bid?|pg||
nt|petergill: Perhaps South took 3@S as minors, and bid 4@H natural, then 4NT was "pick a minor" |pg||

nt|patricck: Yes, it is close though isn't it, and he probably wants to generate a swing after just going for 1100 and this being such an important match for them|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2 NT forcing - but Broge may go low since prd surely have something wasted in hearts|pg||

pc|cA|nt|patricck: I'm sure it doesn't have an influence.... in the Vulcan championships...... but here on Earth sometimes our emotions get the better of us|pg||
nt|andyv:  I agree...one of Bob Hamman's great strength is he can completely forget the previous board and focus on the board in front of him.  We all try to do that...sometimes we fall short.|pg||
nt|jbgood: Norway is now 11th - 12 VPs behind Greece in 9th - Greece demolishing Turkey - a big surprice|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Even if Norway qualify to the next step they will not be able to achieve a decent result at the end after three heavy losses against Israel, Germany and Hungary|pg||

mb|p|nt|tomi2: I think 2@H is @S + any minor, so Rehder expects @D but it might be some great fit, if partner really has clubs|pg||

nt|patricck: So as it stands they are losing 19-11 in Victory Points, but they need to do better|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: software is awkward .. changes both names|pg||
nt|andyv:  not that easy although declarer should be able to prevail...remember, the stiff A@c in dummy makes transportation difficult.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: anybody know ? ilian is with glasses ?|pg||

nt|lechcold: jest drobna przes³anka: E nie poszed³ w obronê|pg||
mb|p|nt|farrukh: this way he can cater to @H 4-0 and ensure the contract also both things working|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: lorenzini deep thought|pg||

nt|ahollan1: nope   neither do the commentators from that room -- but i'm told score was confirmed|pg||
pc|c8|nt|lechcold: :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: we can see that whatever he does it make but he migth be nervous about @H 41|pg||
nt|bobholl: or @S 41|pg||
pc|cA|nt|oosmanb: Helness was allowed to play 1@S?|pg||
nt|djneill:  West takes the @sK to hide the lower honors, but South might smell a rat here|pg||
nt|djneill:  North can pitch a discouraging @s|pg||
pc|c7|nt|arderi:  5@h is down of course with diamond lead, but it is fairly unlikely|pg||
nt|bobholl: and keep their scores |pg||
nt|ahollan1: effectively the end result is 18 team RR -- with top 6 countries qualifying for 2013 Bermuda Bowl|pg||
nt|andyv:  nice play of K@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: thanks ..glasses is East and declarer|pg||
nt|patricck: Winning the Ace and playing clubs will work out OK here|pg||
pc|c3|pg||

nt|ahollan1: other room 6@H North|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|mamos:  bye everyone|pg||
nt|petergill: West knows N has 4+ cards in @c or @D, makes @DJ look good to me as next play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no Knockout phase in this event|pg||
pc|hA|nt|djneill:  if needs 2 diamonds, low one might work, but I think needs 3 diamonds, yes?|pg||
nt|petergill: well, yes, unless clubs are very friendly|pg||
nt|djneill:  big club but not friendly|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|andyv:  declarer should prevail here...in OR, N played the 9@s at trick 4 making the task a little easier for E|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hawe45:  By playing the @D King in the first trick, South gave West "an open book"...|pg||
pc|h8|nt|hawe45:  A really gentleman would claim|pg||
nt|andyv:  here if the doubleton @c was with N, declarer would have a problem|pg||
nt|barnets: I n group a 9th is Greece and 10 th Norway|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mamos:  been fun|pg||

nt|vugraphzgq: Sleep well|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||

nt|ahollan1: wish trick!!|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pc|s4|nt|vugraphzgq: fucik thinks lots on these 2 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: risky opening at 3 level with 6 card suit    have defence with an ace and king   will sometimes go for a number  on a part score hand|pg||
nt|djneill:  right with @d9 offside|pg||
nt|petergill: which is what he seems to have played for|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y you right -3|pg||
nt|patricck: the defences plan here is for North to score the 9@S and Suth to overruff dummy on the diamond exit, but declarer can simply ruff high|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sQ|nt|jaapfr: oh no |pg||
nt|jaapfr: -2|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @S8 true??|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if @S will be @S4|pg||
pc|s7|nt|patricck: hmmm, declarer could go wrong now, that is nice|pg||
nt|patricck: overruffing witht eh 8S and 9S it will go down on a heart exit|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, declarer can make by piutching a heart, but he might just do the wrong thing|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: good work Maria|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: at fav vul what abt a @D preempt by Jonsson ?|pg||
nt|arderi:  I think pre- empting 3@d with East cards could work sometimes, but in the long run it only kills partners faith to your bidding.|pg||
nt|arderi:  What to bid with AKJ10xxx in the diamonds if this is an opener :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: another straightforward bd|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Good old Blackwood or something lik that|pg||

mb|1S|nt|djneill:  so West reasoned it out based on the 2@s opening distributional information|pg||

mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: on a 3@D prempt, South wd probably try 3 nt which is also making|pg||

nt|lechcold: i wcale mu siê nie bêdê dziwi³|pg||
nt|roswolf: should just settle for game|pg||
nt|oliverc: 3NT the likely spot here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: it is interesting that on a 30-VP scale, maximum for winner is 25|pg||
nt|skaftij:  2NT would perhaps be around 20|pg||
nt|jaapfr: will NS go to 3nt?|pg||
mb|p|nt|arderi:  :) for sure|pg||
nt|petergill: Dan is the expert on Fantunes system|pg||

nt|skaftij:  3@d = rubbish?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry   2@S=11-15 HCP, 5@S & 4+@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C would have been  a) 16+ HCP  b) 14-16 HCP, 6@S|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ady: club lead    down 3    but natural spade lead    down 1|pg||

nt|garden2005: grzmoty|pg||
nt|arderi:  but there is a chance for the defence|pg||
nt|murat e: ace and duck a heart|pg||
nt|barnets: 6@H needs a sing or doubleton heart honour in north|pg||
nt|bobholl: does he trust this to be from QJ ?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: in reply to all kibs questions : I think that if a wrong claim was clearly accepted you can not reclaim afterwards (correct Al?) and mb opps gave the 10th trick by returning @C ...|pg||
nt|jaapfr: (record does not show that)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i believe faulty claim  can be corrected within a defined time period|pg||
nt|ahollan1: try to come up with plan for declarer without looking at EW cards|pg||
nt|jaapfr: we will see (interesting whilst I saw more than a few times wrong claims in the past which were not changed afterwards)|pg||
nt|bobholl: if you trust QJ 5@S 1@D 3@H 1@C|pg||
nt|jaapfr: logic line to me :@HK and @CA x@C to start with|pg||
nt|ahollan1: want to protect against @S4-1   need to take care of 3rd round @C loser|pg||

nt|djneill:  1N GF with desire to declare NT, 2@c bal or @c, 2@d relay, 3@c no 4M 5@c|pg||
nt|petergill: this might be exciting in the play|pg||
nt|jaapfr: as expected|pg||
nt|jbgood: and as you might have guessed - 2 NT is a good heart support (as most play these days)|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|ady: not unreasonable effort by east    partner can go down better than a low singleton diamond|pg||
nt|lechcold: u pañ tymczasem wygl¹da na 10:20 z Austri¹|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and now easy to take the ace and duck @h to west|pg||
nt|djneill:  1@c 14+ so West had enough for slamtry|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 11 imps NS|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @CA @Cx seems dangerous to me|pg||
nt|jaapfr: it is tough to decide|pg||

pc|h3|nt|mlodygda83: jeszcze w ostatnim szansa na punkty|pg||

nt|oliverc: this lead will not be a great success :)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|pbmarstr: 4 @S is more or less lay-down, but 5 @C just one down.|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|400 volt: let's see if piekarek will make the @S right|pg||
nt|400 volt: great|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: nie wiem jak rozdanie wygl¹da, ale 3nt wygrywaj¹, a Austriaczki przegra³y|pg||
nt|arderi:  what if west finds @S Q after that?|pg||
nt|arderi:  Or lets say a diamond|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hmmmm|pg||
nt|arderi:  They have a good chance to keep declarer in 8 tricks|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: @S is tough but a @D cpossible i thk|pg||
nt|arderi:  Bridge is easy. Dont give opponents 9th trick|pg||
nt|jaapfr: it looks pretty standard to be in 3nt here|pg||
nt|mamos: The WElssh NS in the OR have been a little timid in these last few boards seems normal to bid to 3Nt here|pg||
nt|jbgood: sry - spade support|pg||
nt|barnets: 6@S is a poor contract|pg||
nt|barnets: but on this lead|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hawe45:  Another ! - the fastest play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i would duck @C before playing Ace then low|pg||
pc|h5|nt|400 volt: leading the J of @H indicates a length in @S|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: teraz ju¿ bez 1, Ada nie dostrzeg³ potencjalnej promocji|pg||
nt|arderi:  hmm|pg||
nt|barnets: can be made|pg||
pc|dK|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|djneill:  yes 1NT is to declare, without declaring intention would bid 1@h (@s)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Yes indeed. But as little as 5 @h to the queen and 10 and game is feasible|pg||
nt|pelu:  but N are very but he sh know that S is very weak - 2@C is a opening hand|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lechcold: zawilimy? czy tylko ja?|pg||
nt|400 volt: that's why he finessed even if he had 9 @S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Problems with 4-1 now - or?|pg||
nt|pelu:  N very strong|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Iceland making a lot of borderline pushes that proved wrong|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Nystrom did not overcall   Brink rebid 2@D  [i think most north american experts would rebid 2@S]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so  2@D South|pg||
nt|bobholl: brink in 2@D NS|pg||
mb|2S|nt|hawe45:  reason|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: w ostatnim u pañ niestety kwit|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos:  might not be some people's idea of vul overcall ...... :)|pg||

nt|mamos:  EW  certainly going for it here vul v NV|pg||
nt|lechcold: czyli jest w tej chwili 65-14|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I resist the wish to comment on such a 3 @C - at both tables |pg||
nt|pelu:  a lucky 3Nt need @hs 3-3|pg||
nt|jaapfr: most will agree with 4@H bid|pg||
nt|mamos: in OR E competed in  H so harder for NS to bid 3NT|pg||
nt|patricck: North would have bid 2@H without the interference, South would have found an easy raise to game|pg||
mb|p|nt|kamyk: tak, jeden z³y mecz, to jeszcze nie koniec wiata; trzeba o nim szybko zapomniec, odbudowac sie psychicznie, i...|pg||

nt|mlodygda83: 2@s od N by³oby forsuj¹ce|pg||

mb|p|nt|jaapfr: X by S only DD fear imo|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|djneill:  oh never mind, had 5 spades|pg||
nt|djneill:  so could be 5431|pg||
nt|petergill: because N lead from Jxxx in @s is dangerous, West thought N probably had @H honour(s), hence play for 3-3 @D not for @H onside?|pg||
nt|ritong: and underled a jack|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i believe 2@S here implies 14-16 hcp|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ryskiel_: a nie mo¿na odbudowywaæ siê psychicznie po jednym nieudanym rozdaniu? to chyba ³agtwiesze?|pg||
nt|400 volt: a sacrifice for 1100 (down 5) is possible here in 6@S|pg||
nt|djneill:  2@s = @d|pg||
nt|patricck: No stopping North|pg||
nt|oliverc: no problems for Declarer here|pg||

nt|ahollan1: they open 2@S with 6+suit and 10-13|pg||

pc|d2|nt|mlodygda83: st¹d pas|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes not standard|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No - I have done with J x x x x - thatÂ´s better|pg||
pc|dK|nt|vugraphzgq: hmmmm results just disappeared|pg||
nt|tomi2: hmm, sad, so the match will be scored 0-0?|pg||
nt|400 volt: but when they didn't enter in the bidding (i really don't know how), they won't find|pg||
pc|d4|nt|djneill:  not sure what 3@h is|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|hawe45:  we got our 480|pg||
nt|mamos:  not much point bidding them if p's lead @c|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Some additional chance if defense does not start in @s|pg||
nt|skaftij:  and black aces favourably placed|pg||
nt|pelu:  after @s-start there are 1@S tricks + 8 red tricks|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lechcold: bardzo cenne punkty|pg||
nt|djneill:  I know of only one system in the world that actually relays a 6-6 hand, ultimate club or whatever granovetter/rubin play these days|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Sure, on this layout|pg||
nt|skaftij:  What I meant to say that a 4-2 @h split does not always doom 3 NT !|pg||
nt|bobholl: so it is a manche with 40% chance or so |pg||
nt|bobholl: but NV not enough|pg||
pc|d8|nt|400 volt: but first of all east has to find the @C slam - but he's on the best way|pg||
nt|lechcold: i mo¿e oznaka jakiego prze³omu?|pg||
nt|garden2005: podarunek od Basi :)|pg||
nt|djneill:  yeah at some point, East is going to select one of the red suits|pg||
nt|petergill: Playing UDCA, NS on Bd 18 both gave true count in @d, but West did not believe them, at this expert level. |pg||
nt|jaapfr: i hate the AQ@H (only) for the X not the @CK|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|kania12: Witam wszystkich|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL not double dummy -- but agree close choice   because @CK decreases chance partner has trapped|pg||
pc|h8|nt|roswolf: but as a pard of mine says 0+POINTS + 6+card suit at these colors|pg||
nt|jaapfr: nice: 4 different opinions about 1 bid:)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|tomi2: kibs suggest that the boards will be played again, but obviously that is not possible|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No - he should have bid @C...|pg||
nt|petergill: If you want to know anything abour Relay Systems, go to Dan Neill's website one day...|pg||
nt|jaapfr: likely 5 ips for Welsh (for being timid:)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|400 volt: the other table failed to bid the slam|pg||
nt|400 volt: 4@S was RKCB, 5@D showed 2 without the @C Q|pg||
nt|djneill:  oh no!|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|ritong: they both contributed their smallest @d, not sure it has to do with count|pg||
nt|petergill: Match is close again|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|hawe45:  Sure - IÂ´m old-fasioned|pg||
nt|djneill:  well the play is not difficult|pg||
pc|hK|nt|tomi2: in 40 minutes the football match starts, nobody will bring Gromöller to a bridge table then|pg||

mb|2S|nt|roswolf: this is the last bd of this match|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Better defence here is worth 5 IMP and for sure a victory|pg||
mb|p|nt|arderi:  1NT overcall is 15-18hcp|pg||
nt|arderi:  and probably 4@c|pg||
nt|arderi:  transferring to 4@h|pg||
nt|bobholl: to defaet 4@H @C lead (or switch) necessary|pg||
nt|jaapfr: tx Liz (order the 4 boys to be once operator this week:) |pg||
nt|ahollan1: page for running scores does let you check to see all results [not just vugraph] for a particular board|pg||
mb|3S|nt|djneill:  East has no "both majors weak" option, so just gets out in @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 15 minutes left|pg||
mb|p|nt|lechcold: raczej nie|pg||
nt|roswolf: well slam is on here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But it is a very poor slam indeed|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed but the norsemen sailed into it with no bother in the other room|pg||

nt|jaapfr: tx Mike and kibs for all yr fine comments questions and advises|pg||
nt|bobholl: wow  may be very costly|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: 3@C is asking for 5card majors|pg||
nt|400 volt: 3@D denies a 5card major|pg||
nt|murat e: and spade king lead...|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think that is meant as exclusion blackwood|pg||
nt|josj: let's hope so|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But it is easy to play - West must have King doubleton in @S and @H 3-1 would also give problems|pg||
nt|oliverc: a fairly inevitable 3NT, it seems|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ty mart indeed not all Wests will bid 2@C so it was not proving too much:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 8 more  20-board matches  to play all teams from the 'other' group  yields an effective 18 team Round Robin|pg||
mb|4S|nt|djneill:  another suprising contract in other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|arderi:  yes|pg||
