nt|pauleger: that looks right|pg||
mb|1S|nt|james_h: Welcome All|pg||
nt|mcphee: decent slam on the way|pg||
nt|clinch: Looking at this board, NS will probably bid to 3NT, but the duplication in spades will make that an uphill struggle.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Hi - looks like a quiet 450/420 for the start|pg||
nt|gulyas: so, top9 teams advance to the second RR, and these teams are currently 7th and 8th, so a big loss may cause either to drop out|pg||

nt|begse: þu anda ciddi bir 9 culuk yarýþý var bizim için en iyisi latvianýn çýkmasý|pg||
nt|geot: but Bocchi has not exactly for a overcall at the two-level anyway (?). Would have been easier lets say over a 1@C (+2) opening|pg||
nt|geot: to overcall 1@D|pg||
nt|oleberg:  2@H = 8-11, and any 5-3-3-2 or side-suit in hearts|pg||
nt|jbennet: however against spade lead 6 clubs requires either D 3-3 or D 4-2 + 10x in clubs somewhere. |pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: wijs-muller play Tarzan Precision  but they open fewer hands at 1-level than most big clubbers|pg||

nt|barnets: if west plays a diamond dec can eliminate hand|pg||
pc|dT|nt|8252:  still wondering where the son( tom) enf the dad (michel) is seating |pg||

nt|james_h: East must have seen West lead directing Dbls on previous oceasions|pg||
nt|geot: What I think is that South was aiming for a 5-4 fit in spades, or else 3NT, but then the double of 3@C came|pg||
nt|geot: and he changed his mind and tried for a 4-4 fit|pg||
nt|gulyas: lets see if they find the lead to beat it (as they should, pd must have short @Ds for running)|pg||

nt|jbennet: a bit tricky on spade lead. |pg||

nt|vugraphzgn: Fantoni thinking this time, not Muller |pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: screen down briefly, F asks M a question|pg||

nt|clinch: Can actually make 6 by ducking a @h to S, but unlikely with the whole @d suit exposed|pg||
nt|baardolav: instead of 2d|pg||
nt|geot: his partner is limited to 15|pg||
nt|baardolav: yes i knoww|pg||
nt|geot: I guess 2NT was an option to try reaching a vul game, but...|pg||
nt|baardolav: Yes, you end up in 2NT on 11+10 hp too|pg||

nt|gulyas: you can find running scores here: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|gulyas: if they play the same as I do (which is possible), 3@C means a good suit and a good hand (in context to being NV)|pg||
nt|gulyas: or bad-bad|pg||
nt|gulyas: but they did end up in 4@S|pg||
nt|barnets: it certainly looked like it , wonder why sementa played it|pg||
mb|4N|nt|ahollan1: Muller shows 1-suiter, then short @S, then exactly 2326|pg||
nt|james_h: 1@c is 11-13 bal in this case|pg||
nt|star6ija: having Ace and King Aronov assumes he has 8 plus points, not 0-7|pg||
nt|james_h: South I expect will be looking for 7@s ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: Fun over on this hand -  from an Irish perspective|pg||
nt|gulyas: 3@D is an artificial GF|pg||
nt|james_h: lets hope he finds it :)|pg||
nt|barnets: some pairs play reverse sit pref signals|pg||
mb|5H|nt|begse: they can send in 3 min|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@C asks total controls  [A=2 K=1]|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: ok, this will probably end in 13 tricks|pg||
nt|james_h: 1@H shows 4+@s, 1@s shows 3 card support|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: if memory serves  4@S now asks  Denial Cue Bidding|pg||
nt|jbennet: 6nt a decent contract . (lots of chances but communication problems. espeially if a heart is lead.)|pg||
nt|geot: I am not sure about the Italian style here, a reverse by opener (?) |pg||
nt|barnets: even a diamond breaks communication for a squeeze|pg||
nt|barnets: in pointed suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: I'm told 1@s is 2/3 card support|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: 2@D GF artificial, Sylvan wrote for Mesbur|pg||

nt|geot: 11 tops tricks|pg||
nt|geot: now four heart tricks|pg||
nt|geot: has to guess whether to take the heart finesse or the diamond finesse|pg||
nt|barnets: how does h finesse help|pg||
nt|jbennet: so east can (a) win in dummy spade king and play clubs (that requires 3-3 spade break.)|pg||
nt|barnets: he is blocked from his long clubs|pg||
nt|geot: not much communications between the hands here|pg||
nt|geot: if they duck the first club|pg||
nt|jbennet: or b) win in hand, but more less requires d 3-3 + queen onside. |pg||
nt|jbennet: so sp 3-3 looks like the best chance.|pg||
nt|geot: What if he takes the first heart, finesses the heart 9, cash the two last hearts and the spade king and play a club|pg||
nt|geot: I mean if North plays the jack|pg||
nt|geot: and he should not?|pg||
nt|geot: everything blocked|pg||
nt|jbennet: hseems like best play is to win in dummy  and then immdiately play a club to the king (hpoing that south will win).|pg||
nt|geot: if North plays low in hearts (or the 7)|pg||
nt|barnets: def just duck a club|pg||

nt|oleberg:  Cannot remember the diference betweem this and a direct 4@H|pg||
nt|oleberg:  West tempted to pass? :)|pg||
nt|monde9: Coldea thinking or BBO is slow ? :)|pg||
nt|monde9: They can read "The Dubliners" during that :) |pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Hagen thinking. I enter the bidding two at a time so players on other side of screen dont know who is taking their time to bid..|pg||
nt|monde9: ok Ty :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: well it does work if not covered|pg||

mb|2D|nt|geot: This is a great result for Ireland|pg||
nt|geot: may be copied? If North bids 4@Cleaping Michaels|pg||
nt|gulyas: 5@C only down 1, but 5@H is close to making, too|pg||
nt|james_h: Its not often that N/S are 1 board ahead of the other room|pg||
nt|tez: @s i atýyr ki ortaðý gergedan sqz i lmasýn..en çok gelen sqz çeþidi..bil bakalým elimde ne var:)|pg||
nt|monde9: Hagen imagining a bid. Not that easy !|pg||
nt|gulyas: 1nt 12-14|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: obviously both majors now :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|tez: 3 sanzatu super|pg||
nt|tez: du bakali nolcek|pg||
nt|geot: 4@S is a super contract|pg||
nt|geot: and here we go|pg||
nt|james_h: snap|pg||
nt|geot: 4C! is showing a big hand with 5@C+5@S|pg||
nt|james_h: I doubt that will be the case come board 20|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 3NT N/S on a possible @D lead may make.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: even making four required major help from defense|pg||
nt|fabsayc: fredin deems his hand not worth a constructive direct raise|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6@S can make from south hand, with some luck and a spade guess|pg||
nt|MolvaM: briçte senyör = 60+ yaþ demektir|pg||
nt|star6ija: sacrifice is good here|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: but Madala gave up|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Looks like 2@D vulnerable it a week two|pg||
nt|barnets: looks like def slipped up also on last hand|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=F1, (good 12/13)14+ HCP, 5+@D 4@D441   this is first time i've seen  the good 12 apply|pg||
nt|blum1956: the vulnerability may prevent EW from the 5th level save|pg||
nt|geot: Looks like declarer must have taken the double finesse in hearts at the other table|pg||
nt|geot: for running scores all series: http://eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: NS in 5@Cx on 9, the double will make it easier to win (make overtrick)|pg||
nt|monde9: now that's the time for Konow to hesitate ? |pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: they can tell by the mouse clicks. This is standard procedure for vu graph operators. |pg||
nt|gulyas: EW has 3@Cs making, maybe even 4|pg||
nt|gulyas: so NS stealing the contract in both rooms|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ken__: ama bu kadar önde olduklarýný tahmin etmiyorlardýr bence|pg||
nt|geot: If declarer does nothing funny there will be 2 spade losers and a diamond loser|pg||
nt|blum1956: Do Bakshi-Townsend have an agreement against the popular "redouble=bid your auit" convention?|pg||
nt|tez: 2@d ya pas geçmesinin sebebi..2@d kontrlu oynamak istemesindendi assaelin|pg||
nt|MolvaM: sorulara cevap vereyim|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a lot of tricks for NS here - looks like 13 - 6+1+2+4|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzeq: line up yazýlýrken  tahmin etmeleri lkazým:)|pg||
nt|geot: He will probably cross to hand with the @HA and take a spade finesse followed by the ace, then play on clubs for +620|pg||
nt|clinch: Pass looks normal here|pg||
nt|clinch: Yep|pg||
nt|baardolav: Aronov will earn one imp on this hand... if NS play diamond and diamond all the time|pg||
nt|baardolav: you need the double finesse for the entry|pg||
nt|geot: not really|pg||
nt|star6ija: the coach Vladislav Ispoeski helped me with explanation of the openning: 54+ in majors (NonVul maybe 4441), VUL usually 55+ 6-10|pg||
nt|oleberg:  5@H is even wrongsided|pg||
nt|solex333: lead directing bid ?|pg||
nt|nilsland:  EW did not came close to 6@D/@H but suits does not break|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: will they investigate @D slam?|pg||
nt|blum1956: "your suit"|pg||
nt|blum1956: Karpov is accurate|pg||
nt|clinch: Cards don't lie that well even for declarer to make 3|pg||
nt|clinch: Seemed to my (lesser than these guys) eyes to be between a 2 and 3 @h rebid|pg||
nt|monde9: same story as in Open|pg||
nt|oleberg:  In West it takes the lead of a diamond-singleton to defeat|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Virtually impossible to find :)|pg||
nt|monde9: 4 @D was alerted :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: both majors are makable, lets see how 2@S fares here|pg||
nt|baldjean: since this contract will not make it does not matter much|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry, not certain about NS system - not sure whether 2@c is GF or not|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I wonder if 4NT is quantitative|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: on hand 8 down three is that ok we just waiting for the |pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: 2@d ya pas geçeyim..ortak kontr der belki..ben de pas geçerim..|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bir oyuncu 60+ yaþýnda ise hem senyör hem açýk takýma katýlma hakkýna sahiptir|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Probably a re-transfer|pg||
nt|mdgraham: whatever it is, it's taken up quite a lot of room|pg||
mb|3H|nt|geot: but other lines will work as well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i have no idea what inferences are available from Fantoni's sequence  [2@H then 3N  vs  immediate 3N ...]|pg||
nt|blum1956: probably the agreement is that 4th hand passes first with good hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: ters taraftan oynuyorlar ama @c atak edilmez heralde|pg||
nt|blum1956: otherwise Townsend's first pass looks strange|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no doubt 2@C was some form of gazilli|pg||
mb|3N|nt|gulyas: 5@H needs 3 rnds of @Ds to beat it|pg||
nt|kamyk: uparty ten W|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my guess -- Fantoni was showing hand that hoped for reopening DBL|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: good lead so long as they collect the 2@c b4 S gets rid of one|pg||
nt|barnets: 3N only chance of making game|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: His hand deserves a 3@h bid if it is nonforcing. Still it could force according to their agreement|pg||
mb|p|nt|ken__: 2tur boþlayacak körü|pg||
nt|lechcold: E te¿:)|pg||
nt|tomi2: Smirnov's actions in this match are not very successfull|pg||
nt|clinch: @s suit won't fetch, @c finesse wrog, but may have to be taken for -2|pg||
nt|MolvaM: yani Açýk takýmlarda yaþ ve cinsiyet sýnýrlamasý yok|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: Wrang was not born yesterday|pg||
nt|star6ija: Isporski *|pg||
nt|barnets: so 4@H down in other room with 4 inescapable losers|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ken__: karo atmasý lazýmdý yerden|pg||
nt|ken__: 1@d 1@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzeq: evet |pg||
nt|clinch: May have to be attempted, in order to make contract|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s8|nt|geot: 3NT will most likely go down as well|pg||
nt|geot: 4@H was an ok contract?  3-3 hearts or club finesse|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|james_h: He use to play in the High/medium skates rubber bridge game in TGR in London for many years|pg||
nt|fluffy: you cn affrord to leave north with one trump|pg||
nt|riccho:  obv you managed to feed computer with results|pg||

pc|h2|nt|geot: oops|pg||
nt|geot: if he runs this one it might be some trouble here|pg||
nt|geot: or...then he will go down to put it another way|pg||
nt|james_h: he will play the Q|pg||
nt|geot: yes|pg||
nt|geot: that is why the first suggested line is better, I think|pg||
nt|geot: just to cross to the heart ace and finesse spades|pg||
nt|james_h: lol|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: If S played a spade back at trick 2 its much harder to find the @D switch by west.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: He's keeping the trick up... giving this plenty thought|pg||
nt|baldjean: it may even be down 2|pg||
nt|baldjean: if W continues @h now E gets a ruff|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|kamyk: straszny pesymista - 5@H móg³ chyba wyksztusiæ - okazja dla naszej pary w otwartym |pg||

pc|h4|nt|tez: 2@h kontruna doðu eliyle 3@c denebilirdi|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, going down for sure now|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mcphee: if the redble is a the 10 mark his simple raise seems to get across what he holds|pg||

nt|tez: büyük abi 5@c olur diyor|pg||
nt|geot: the defence must be careful now|pg||
pc|dK|nt|fabsayc: not sure about 3@H, presumably it showed his junk, not standard gazilli but everyone seems to have their own version|pg||
nt|begse: 2@d 6 tane körle pas dermi salvo sadece pik þikanla neg free bid oynamadýklarý için tercihini pastan yana kullandý|pg||
nt|barnets: south plays @D7 s he does not want one back|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|fluffy: actually duck directly a trick without finese|pg||
pc|sA|nt|gulyas: nice play, now a @D ruff coming as well|pg||

pc|s9|nt|ken__: aynýyere geldi|pg||
nt|clinch: So I prediict -2, though none of us would finesse the @c of course|pg||

pc|sT|pc|s7|nt|blum1956: Thanks to the spectator I realised that Karpov is PH. Then I suppose 3@h was most correct|pg||

nt|riccho:  1@d is a typical choice of opening in a limited system|pg||
nt|riccho:  3@c by N seems natural|pg||

mb|p|nt|tez: benden size tavsiye hiçbirþey için hiç bir zaman demeyin:)|pg||
nt|tomi2: think it's either weak or GF|pg||
nt|clinch: I think 4@s will make in practice|pg||
nt|gulyas: this will be down around 2|pg||
nt|riccho:  3@d is more aggressive in convincing Partner to bid 3nt with a @d stop|pg||
nt|riccho:  but 4@c is more difficult than 3@c|pg||
nt|geot: wd Drijver. He new the hand in a way now, but still a good defence. Also the switch to the 7 of @D was important (not a low) |pg||
mb|3D|nt|nilsland:  4@H is a good sacrifice against 3N|pg||
nt|fluffy: opposite 15-17 north's hand is a game drive for me, but opposite 14-16 I don't know|pg||
nt|baldjean: though we have of course seen matches where the trailing team still won|pg||
nt|gulyas: so maybe a swing for Hungary, as EW can make game (4@H or even 3nt probably)|pg||
nt|gulyas: 3 down is also possible if they play a trump in time|pg||
nt|riccho:  the strngth of 3@c depends on the strength of intervention bids. |pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  NS make 5C but not 5D!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: put the jack on this trick|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3nt gayet atak bir deklare|pg||

nt|blum1956: If the declarer uses the diamond suit correctly he will sooner or later win|pg||
nt|blum1956: But he does not know the advere distribution. The only thing he may be sure after the lead - 3rs spade trick|pg||

pc|s7|nt|vugraphzgn: he is back now explaining his absence - but in italian!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart ace and ruff and second ruff when in with spade ace|pg||
nt|james_h: The difference on board 9 was Fitzgibbon deciding to upgrade his 13 count to a 14-16 NT|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 7 tricks on top.  Possible overtrick in H, or long spade - but i doubt declarer will risk anything|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|blum1956: good start, now he will succeed |pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Khokhlov still thinking|pg||
nt|blum1956: probably  the best for Khokhlov is to discard a club and then try to create a loosing option for the declarer by leading a small heart (when in the lead)|pg||
nt|baldjean: yes, looks like 4 down indeed|pg||
nt|gulyas: ouch, Hungary down in 5@H in the OR|pg||

nt|gulyas: so a small gain turned into another small loss|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzeq: bu günün son eli|pg||
nt|ahollan1: west hand automatic opener for most big clubbers -- not sure if deWijs will open 1N [good 12-15]|pg||
nt|blum1956: 1@d is 4+ diamonds unbalanced|pg||
nt|begse: tek karo|pg||
nt|monde9: a lightner here for -1 X in N in TOR|pg||
nt|gulyas: -6 instead of +6|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: X=majors|pg||
mb|1N|nt|gulyas: it was the lucky 1nt opening - if it went 1@C-1@H overcall, they would never have gotten to this|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i believe Fantoni's DBL = same HCP as opener|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: looks like a fairly routine 3NT E/W ..|pg||
nt|pauleger: 2@d 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|fabsayc: score on board 7 is still wrong|pg||
nt|nilsland:  4@H is down on a diamond lead - as 3N|pg||
nt|fabsayc: can make double dummy perhaps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: low club towards the jack|pg||
nt|nilsland:  South would like to X here - but it may show a hand with 4+@S|pg||
nt|monde9: 6 @S is the normal & good contract|pg||
nt|monde9: for N-S|pg||

mb|2D|nt|ahollan1: but Muller treating the DBL as artificial rather than Penalty|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vs Strong NT   NS DBL = 4@H/@S and 5+@C/@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe always that shape, but vs weak NT  also shows HCP|pg||
nt|blum1956: The Rudakov-Khokhlov CC does not contain the meaning of the 2@h  bid|pg||
nt|blum1956: I guess it guarantees at least 3-card support, thus Rudakov is able to splinter|pg||
nt|james_h: Israel putting a storming performance so far ... I'm looking forward to reviewing their results|pg||
nt|oleberg:  This might end with 6@S in south|pg||
nt|ritong: if you did so, id a free shot for me:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: NS will end up in 3nt, and will get a @C lead|pg||
nt|barnets: Madala bid 2@S over 1n|pg||
nt|geot: Turkey is leading Monaco by 6 IMPs after 12 boards|pg||

nt|ritong: really saying " you won t toy with me lorenzo"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont see any reason to bid with fredin's hand|pg||
nt|clinch: 3@s probably preemptive, as X mainly disruptive|pg||
nt|baardolav: here... coffee I think|pg||
mb|2N|an|4 plus hearts|nt|eyamut: sabah mý?|pg||
nt|blum1956: the rest is simple|pg||
nt|james_h: throughout the tournament|pg||
nt|nilsland:  surprisingly - but RD showed a good hand|pg||
nt|nilsland:  And Lauria is hoping for a club lead|pg||
nt|monde9: :)|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Where an underlead of clubs is needed|pg||
nt|baldjean: Hungary now need 6 IMPs per board to still win this|pg||
nt|barnets: e/w may not get in bidding now|pg||
nt|geot: but it depends on methods|pg||
nt|barnets: n/s I meant|pg||
mb|3S|nt|vugraphzeq: :)|pg||
nt|ritong: i think he expects the contract to be cold|pg||
nt|clinch: Well it's obviously preemptive... I mean by agreement|pg||
nt|monde9: same 200 but different contracts :)|pg||
nt|ritong: hi hi|pg||
mb|4D|an|presumably re transfer to hearts|nt|ritong: the formula is 3sn+1|pg||
nt|ritong: 2sn+1*|pg||

nt|nilsland:  Helgemos double is a little aggressive but makes life easy|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2@C invitational stayman|pg||
nt|gulyas: or just showing 4@H now with a minimum GF|pg||
nt|geot: this looks strange|pg||
nt|barnets: par looks like 5@SX down 1|pg||
mb|4S|nt|vugraphzgn: These lads don't make it easy for me :) All conversation at this table is in Russian, including explanations and claims|pg||
nt|nilsland:  It is not obvious to double a partscore knowing that you have a 9-card heart fit|pg||
nt|ritong: south visibly having the rest of the high cards|pg||
nt|ritong: now, the @d five bagger is a bad surprise|pg||
nt|nilsland:  BjÃ¶rn knows that Lauria is prepared for a club lead|pg||
nt|nilsland:  so he will not lead a club|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not so sure he wont|pg||
nt|nilsland:  In this situation Fredin could not pass over the RD because that would probably show values - so 3@C is not a free bid|pg||
nt|ritong: also, who understands redouble?|pg||
nt|ritong: i would translate " my @hs are fine"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: redouble=max hand probably|pg||
nt|ritong: has he?|pg||
nt|geot: this will not be any swing, standard 4@H|pg||
nt|mcphee: possible to go down|pg||
nt|april7: hello everybody|pg||

nt|nilsland:  At the other table South is playing 2NT with a heart lead |pg||
nt|fabsayc: not in my book|pg||
nt|fluffy: another flat board I'd say|pg||
nt|monde9: Coldea has "some" temperamant" :)|pg||
nt|monde9: teperament |pg||
nt|oleberg:  Tea-apartment? :)|pg||
nt|solex333: unlucky 6 @d, but prob 5 @d will lead to 5/6 @s|pg||
nt|monde9: Bogdan Marina in N seems more cool to me :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: 2@c is probably a version of Drury showing 3 card fir|pg||
nt|geot: I think on board 10, the 3@S, it was something to be said for playing the Ace of trumps first. That is if East had KJ doubleton. So playing the ace and later play as he did was ...|pg||
nt|geot: acdtually ok|pg||
nt|james_h: fit|pg||
nt|james_h: 2s = min|pg||
nt|pauleger: 3@d = 4+ @c I am told|pg||
nt|psyck: so E shows his suits by not bidding them|pg||
nt|clinch: Might have been clobbered if N only had 4 @s|pg||
nt|gulyas: declarer just needs to guess the @SJ to make, which should be a normal play to finesse|pg||
nt|gulyas: I mean, normal to play it to W after E shows up with the long @Cs|pg||
nt|baldjean: N/S can develop a @H trick here for 9 tricks, but it needs careful play|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good 2NT rebid - 2NT usually stronger in a balanced hand, but here W has a good source of tricks in diamonds  |pg||
mb|d|nt|fabsayc: interesting use of 4C as a kind of leaping michaels, kibitzers will no doubt say standard in France but new to me|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 1S shows @D i assume - 2@s anyone know what that means ?|pg||
nt|clinch: 4@d pretty comfortable losing 3 red tricks in all likelihood|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i blame it on the defenseless 3@S bid :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: when did that bid promise any defenses?:)|pg||
nt|blum1956: I first played against Tiit Laanemae in... probably 1979. |pg||
nt|mdgraham: defence needs a spade switch sharpish-like|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: defenseless bids cause opponents to overbid|pg||
nt|gulyas: well bid, this may make|pg||
nt|geot: Some will maybe consider 3NT as South. Bad contract, but would make |pg||
nt|monde9: Rotaru X the 6 @S for @D leading in TOR|pg||
nt|geot: South did not bid at the 2 level, but 3@S. He knows that North has got a singleton heart because of the fact that East superaccepted the transfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzeq: akþam pardon|pg||
nt|gulyas: that would not work with E having 2 aces|pg||
nt|mdgraham: after an A/K lead vs NT, the defenders carding is usually either count/attitude, not suit pref - so if N finds a spade switch we can be seriously impressed |pg||
nt|barnets: e/w have only 1 obvious loser|pg||
nt|barnets: in hearts|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: no bonus points for being in 5|pg||
pc|s3|nt|gulyas: N needs to cash his @HQ to beat it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not obvious|pg||
nt|gulyas: its true that his black suit holdings are not very promising|pg||
nt|nevaio   _: after 2@h 3@H by w|pg||
nt|gulyas: thats dummy|pg||
nt|gulyas: if pd has a @C honor, and only one @H honor, @HQ could be fatal|pg||
nt|nevaio   _: i speak about led|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: he has closed the screen and asked if 3@c was forcing|pg||
nt|gulyas: 3@C is forcing, yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: now sketching sample hands and asking Hegedus how he would have bid them|pg||
nt|nevaio   _: if 3 @c is forcing Bocchi probably plays @hQ|pg||
nt|gulyas: I cannot tell exactly what the @D8 is, but says on the card, that hi-x is even, low-x is odd|pg||
nt|gulyas: but its attitude as well|pg||
nt|gulyas: so he cannot have Axxx|pg||
nt|gulyas: for convention cards: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/docdefault.asp?page=Italy&start=c%3A%5Cinetpub%5Cwwwroot%5Cecatsbridge%5Cdocuments%5Cfiles%5C2012Dubli...|pg||

nt|nilsland:  this will be good for sweden - on  11 as expected we lost 6 imps|pg||
pc|sA|nt|geot: the 4@S I mean, reached and won by both teams|pg||
nt|baardolav: and here same number of tricks all over|pg||
nt|oleberg:  6@D is an ok spot|pg||
nt|ritong: he has the entries for the standard trump handling|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Helness looks like a man that makes it|pg||
nt|barnets: if 4@D was a natural bid why did East not go to 5 level ?|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|james_h: well denies a major anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: 2@D explained as 18-19 bal - hard to overhear, but I think 2@s was explained as denying major|pg||
nt|tez: güney dengeli 16 puanla 1 saniye düþünmedi pas geçmek için|pg||
nt|geot: E/W has 5-4 hearts, so the 3@S bid may not be so strange as it looks|pg||
pc|hA|nt|fluffy: this trump position starts with @hAQ to pin singleton @h10/J on East|pg||
nt|ritong: small to 8|pg||
nt|mcphee: good start|pg||
pc|h6|nt|gulyas: he got it|pg||
nt|gulyas: nice|pg||

nt|barnets: for running scores|pg||
nt|geot: Many matches have opened up since i said there were all tight matches. Ireland has no a lead worth 25VPs ag Iceland|pg||
nt|geot: 52-7 after nine boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|riccho:  the 1@h opening was at least misleading partner in evaluating slam chances|pg||
nt|geot: sorry 57-2|pg||
nt|barnets: Italy are 19vps behind Monaco as results stand|pg||
nt|geot: Both leaders  Monaco and no. 2 England are behind in their matches|pg||
mb|5C|nt|nilsland:  as I expected :)|pg||
nt|clinch: Looks like a meek NT partial here|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bizimkiler de 7 karo demeyebilirdi diye itiraz ettiler|pg||
nt|geot: Another "boring" hand|pg||
nt|mcphee: and now the 3N|pg||
nt|gulyas: I hear NS is in 3@D on bd12, so this a 10 imp pickup for Hungary|pg||
nt|mdgraham: very quiet set so far - biggest swing 8 imps|pg||
nt|riccho:  in mypersonal opinion: you sould not open 1@h in a astrong club system with a hand with game-forcing values|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: good judgement on the 3@h by NS in the open room|pg||
nt|fluffy: after board 9, Bulgaria had regained the lead on group A, just 1 VP ahead of Italy|pg||
nt|mcphee: helgemo, no fear pard we have em now|pg||
nt|ritong: i don t think daddy bessis loves it|pg||
nt|nilsland:  They certainly has to improve their declarer play - or go to the bank|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: Tough 3@S bid from East|pg||
nt|fabsayc: at other table nystrom doubled 2@H, a move i think should show a better overall hand|pg||
nt|gulyas: it was time we started the comeback :)|pg||
nt|april7: its a nice pass by S, but a game try was appropriate imo|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: and North bids 3NT on the stiff king over his partner's t/o double|pg||
nt|ritong: notice that versace does not wander in doubling 2@h|pg||
nt|monde9: better lead : @H |pg||
nt|mcphee: oh my|pg||
nt|nilsland:  We go for crossruff|pg||
nt|mcphee: this isn't over yet:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: we are not sure which side will go for the cross ruff yet|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Geir know that Tor will lead a trump if he has one.|pg||
nt|geot: so a Michaels Cuebid here, and a tough 4@C bid by Duboin|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|geot: All fine about the spades, but 3NT does not work very well anyway|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@C artificial game force, not sure about the rest|pg||
nt|baldfriede: No slam possible here.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and whats the TD verdict pls operator?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: still no ruling on board 3|pg||
nt|monde9: like that S can take the hand on the Jack of @C to give the ruff in @H|pg||
pc|hA|nt|james_h: it maybe helped by the EW action|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: declarer will want to draw trumps may just cash the K+A and then play on D which works on all 3/2 splits.  If the trumps 4/1 though ...|pg||
nt|ritong: ouah|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Now he worries about the long pause|pg||
nt|gulyas: with everything friendly, 5 or even 6@C is a decent contract|pg||
pc|h5|nt|gulyas: no lebensohl? strange|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 5@c? co to mia³o byæ?|pg||
nt|blum1956: It was probably Khokhlov who bid 3NT|pg||

nt|mcphee: hehehe|pg||
nt|april7: but successfulaccording to the layout|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|nevaio   _: maybe inverted on @H|pg||

nt|ritong: great minds drink alike, martin|pg||
nt|monde9: can always go this defense, let see|pg||
nt|gulyas: certainly better than 3nt|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|fabsayc: as usual i would rather be in 3nt|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Ok, played by N 6@s works|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes, must be around 25% or 100% on actual layout|pg||
nt|ritong: confirmed, operator?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|riccho:  yes. looks a bit overpessimistic to pass 2@h (NS playing 1NT 15-17)|pg||
nt|barnets: while this is a qualifying for the Brmuda Bowl the European Championships themselves  is one of the toughest tournaments to win and very prestiguous|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2nt shows a good hand, any other bid is just a wk hand|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: jak siê pytam dwa razy to znaczy by³em podwójnie zdziwiony|pg||
nt|blum1956: 3@c from Townsend first suggested by the viewgraph could have created a problem for EW |pg||
nt|clinch: Cards lie pretty well so may make 9, though would need a different NT range to bid game|pg||
nt|baldjean: this may make 12 tricks even|pg||
pc|c2|nt|james_h: exactly Karel|pg||
nt|tez: hala karar yokmuþ|pg||
pc|d5|nt|oleberg:  Not obvious to make this, though double-dummy it is easy|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kdr_fm: may also finesse into the east hand on the basis a @d switch will be hard to find.  S8 looks ominous|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i always thought lebensohl was backwards|pg||
nt|fabsayc: are you drinking sparkling grapfruit?|pg||
nt|nilsland:  seems operator have enough to do :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|nilsland:  You may regret not double if S bids 3NT - but I agree :)|pg||
nt|clinch: Opposite 14-16 NT E might just have a go|pg||

nt|blum1956: 1@c could be everything, still 3@s is a  dangerous bid (@s xx and @h Kx with South is enough for the game)|pg||

pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: note low from worthless doubleton    in Slawinski   low from even without honor  or  odd with honor|pg||

nt|sastro: but S will be squeezed on 4 rounds of @s|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, we are all saying the same thing :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: @C8 of Fritsche seemed a bit odd|pg||
nt|sastro: but missing the communication for the squeeze   |pg||

nt|psyck: One would bet on him figuring it out|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that's more like it :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kdr_fm: has on real option now but the @C finesse, when E will show out in @s|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: could play east for @HQxx precisely but I dont think thats as good odds as the @C position|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|clinch: So, looking at convention card it seems that double may just have meant "don't lead a @d"|pg||

pc|s4|nt|geot: We have seen a match so far, with not too much action, really. Norway went down in a game they could have won, and Ireland bid a very tough but good game they won. That is about it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for NS  that works up through 9x|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: at this moment due to vacant spaces 6@D with E and 1 with west.  West is likely to hold any card declarer wants by the odds of 12-7 fairly significant|pg||

nt|mcphee: so the bar is open?|pg||
nt|gulyas: luckily, this is not a knock out match|pg||
mb|p|an| |nt|nilsland:  I am not sure they can bid either :P|pg||
nt|ritong: making friends is your strong points, true?|pg||
nt|ritong: -s|pg||
nt|clinch: Taking vulnerability into account|pg||
nt|baardolav: A new 4nt from OR|pg||
nt|baardolav: where 6@s can be made...|pg||
nt|barnets: a club lead defeats an e/w slam|pg||
mb|5C|nt|ahollan1: 2@D = TRF, not necessarily @H|pg||
nt|mcphee: possible 6|pg||
nt|gulyas: gain half of it back, and I would be happy:)|pg||
nt|baldjean: 3@c looks like a Bergen raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: in his room south did not overcall since he bid 1@H himself, so he does not know the @H layout|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Not really hehe|pg||
nt|baardolav: both black small slams and 6nt is makeable|pg||
nt|geot: Friendly clubs makes both 6@S and 6NT makeable. Have to solve the spades though|pg||
nt|star6ija: 6 @s needs very unusual treatment of trumps|pg||
nt|geot: You have to bring in the spades in NT as well|pg||
nt|monde9: the finesse in @H was protecting the @C in the same time|pg||
nt|tisserand: good bid 4nt|pg||
mb|5D|nt|geot: They are good players, but I do not expect them to win this time. They are young, very good, but ......maybe in a few years|pg||
nt|james_h: Fitzgibbon is not lacking courage|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 4@s not easy to reach|pg||
nt|james_h: 3@h is a balanced slam try (I think)|pg||
nt|ritong: oohh|pg||
nt|baardolav: it is no help making the @c tricks in 6nt... before you play spade|pg||
nt|april7: nothing special here, easy 4@H, but a 3@C opener might have made NS task more difficult|pg||
nt|barnets: in diamonds|pg||
nt|barnets: can they get to hearts ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: now looks like on the way|pg||
nt|clinch: Forrester must know that Gold is weak, and one assumes that must mean he has 5 @d at least. I'm just guessing this, but it's logical to me|pg||
nt|tez: 5@d @h ataðýndan sonra batýyor(muþ)|pg||
mb|5H|nt|baardolav: double club have single spade...|pg||
nt|mcphee: make a lot of @S here|pg||
nt|nilsland:  That why they are playing so quick|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 9 imps to France on board 11 - 4@sx= next door |pg||
nt|mdgraham: N has an awkward hand-type|pg||
nt|april7: the vulnerability held W back from opening 3@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 2@C game force, 3@C relay, not sure about 3@D|pg||
nt|clinch: Ah apparently 1@d showed 5@d; thanks|pg||
nt|gulyas: S reopening yet again, N is happy to pass that|pg||
nt|gulyas: but it needed some @S plays to beat this 2 tricks I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: nice lead|pg||
nt|james_h: dont know if it will make any difference tho|pg||
nt|geot: Unusual to let E/W play 3@C I think|pg||
nt|james_h: Israel are a tough outfit, yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Monitor gone, Muller thinking again! Players joking about the situation|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now 4@c perhaps|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: Not enough from Karpov's point of view, needs some extra values (few)|pg||

nt|barnets: we |pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: actually only 1 board behind other room|pg||
nt|baldfriede: S was afraid of @h, it appears|pg||
nt|gulyas: the defense has to be careful not to try any trump promotion|pg||
nt|baldjean: still ok with @H switch, I think|pg||
nt|barnets: we can see diamonds are well placed|pg||
nt|barnets: but it would be a poor slam|pg||
nt|jbennet: a winning view taken by west wd. Not clearcut.|pg||
nt|barnets: going down |pg||
nt|barnets: when diamonds bad|pg||
pc|s8|nt|geot: In my opinion I think South should bid 3@S. I know I am seeing all the hands, but.....|pg||
nt|baardolav: true|pg||
nt|baardolav: sorry private|pg||
nt|monde9: it was not a big risk of ruff in @S with the lead of @D|pg||
nt|barnets: Wests 4N showed two places to play|pg||
pc|sK|nt|baldfriede: so no 3nt|pg||
nt|baardolav: Even if you miss the spade play in 4@s here... I think Bulgaria make +1 imp|pg||
nt|fluffy: this lead ensures the 2 spade tricks fron south :)|pg||
nt|geot: At this moment Israel leads the group. But it is 237 237 236 236|pg||
nt|nilsland:  1NT would have been better this time|pg||
nt|mcphee: difficult to pass|pg||
nt|mcphee: maybe some S hands will act over 1N|pg||
nt|mcphee: no fun defending NT with S hand|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|blum1956: As everyone may see, in the OR Khiouppenen doubled 1NT, then Forrester (East) bid 2@d (which probably was "diamonds or majors"?) and was buried there|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now cue bids (this partnership's favorite action)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  In many systems East will be able to show short diamonds which would cool off West|pg||
nt|ritong: @s lead looks very possible after this auction|pg||
nt|ritong: so they better stop lower than 6|pg||
nt|tez: þu direktör onlarýn aleyhine olcaksa.kararý bildirseydi..iyi olacaktý|pg||

pc|h5|nt|nilsland:  At the other table it started 1N-3@D showing 4441 with a singleton minor|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i like that a whole lot better|pg||
nt|clinch: This looks to be on the @h guess; won't be much of a guess after Forrester turns up with AQ of trumps and a @d honour|pg||
pc|h6|nt|james_h: 3s initially, makes life easy|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Yes - west will ask for which minor and then bid 4@H|pg||
nt|ritong: 5@d might be turbo-ish|pg||
nt|ritong: showing odd number of keys and something interesting in @ds|pg||
nt|ritong: a priori interesting, that is|pg||
nt|ritong: 4NT would show even number of keys|pg||
nt|nilsland:  at least we know that they probably know what they are doing :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont think they play turbo on this auction|pg||
nt|gulyas: now down 1 only|pg||
nt|baldjean: yes|pg||
pc|hA|nt|geot: South showed a good raise of spades with 2@D|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kdr_fm: if east had the @HT - 6@S could make - as it is the @HT with west will beat it.|pg||
nt|april7: 2imps to Ireland|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mcphee: perhaps E was a bit conservative|pg||
nt|nilsland:  or not|pg||
nt|ritong: i t would match  now, i m told they do play turbo, but restricted to minor fits|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not a straightforward hand to play - may try a cross-ruff|pg||
nt|jbennet: many X instead; for 300 ; now they get 680 instead. (4NT was of course primarily 2 places to play. |pg||
pc|h8|nt|ritong: as expected|pg||
nt|nilsland:  easy lead from the sequence :)|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|clinch: Will have to play a @h early now|pg||
nt|baldjean: still a little swing for Hungary, since it was not doubled at the other table. but not enough|pg||
pc|h3|nt|geot: Italy, Bulgaria and Turkey|pg||
pc|h9|nt|geot: Myself I do not like 3@S the first time unless it is agreed to show some cards|pg||
nt|geot: I think it is too strong for 3@S initially|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: very nice play from Fantoni|pg||
nt|psyck: Sementa will return @h after winning @d, maybe Piekarek will have an idea then|pg||
nt|april7: 8 of @D to makje sure:)|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was busy thinking maybe deWijs does better to play @DJ at trick 1|pg||
nt|tomi2: maybe it will be too late then, he is still thinking how to play the @D|pg||

nt|april7: a double dummy 7@H but 6@H  very possible to reach|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: 1 lvl higher here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink was definitely operating on this hand|pg||
nt|psyck: yes only a couple of hands had some potential, maybe we will end with a bang with some fancy hands|pg||

nt|baardolav: 4@s makes with diamond too?|pg||
nt|fluffy: sorry, on diamond pushes you can discard all hearts from dummy, so 4@s still makes|pg||
nt|star6ija: Aronov knows Stefanov has singleton @d|pg||

mb|d|nt|geot: This might be a pick up for Norway|pg||

nt|barnets: e/w do well in hearts|pg||
mb|3S|nt|blum1956: 2NT is more challenging than 2@d in the OR and will probably fail|pg||
nt|clinch: Dbl presumably support; not sure what rdbl was|pg||

nt|baardolav: double can be invite from east|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: very true|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: 4@S a good save|pg||

nt|nilsland:  Fredin may even make this with a club finess|pg||
pc|dA|nt|psyck: yes Bessis probably wrote that up in BBO news|pg||
nt|tomi2: if they get kicked out a new discussion will start about the way the team gets selected|pg||
nt|nilsland:  or without|pg||
nt|ritong: bar is open:)|pg||
nt|jbennet: they sold out to 2 sp and inflicted a well deserved part score swing. East of course will led high d follewd by a trump switch. |pg||
nt|barnets: still another swing for Italy coming here|pg||
pc|d6|nt|geot: At the other table Boye Brogeland made this hand simple when he overcalled 4@H over Hanlon's 1@C|pg||
nt|clinch: Good work from NS to muddy the waters|pg||
nt|mcphee: i like this move from helness|pg||
nt|mdgraham: defence needs to be on the ball to defeat this |pg||
nt|april7: 6@S is in danger, of losing 1 @S and 1 @H, but the @H losers could be discarded on long @D except on @C leads in lacking of entries to the @D suit, but as we see NS are on the way ...|pg||

nt|clinch: England has played very well against a strong French team (so far)|pg||
nt|fluffy: another line pointed by an spec is to pitch the heart on second/third diamond|pg||
nt|monde9: Coldea's temperament ? 14 PH 1 NT opening ?|pg||

nt|geot: 12+12 HCPs N/S|pg||
nt|baardolav: this was a weak opening even for prec players|pg||

nt|mcphee: reasonable spot|pg||
nt|ritong: bessis senior likes his two aces|pg||

mb|p|nt|geot: or to be honest :(|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Helness is lucky here|pg||

mb|p|nt|tomi2: 15 has been finished in the OR, Piekarek made 8 tricks, 2 imps for Germany|pg||
nt|nilsland:  needs one trick extra - the hearts will provide it if you play careful|pg||
nt|ritong: although garozzo advocates 6Nt with 34 and no fit|pg||

nt|oleberg:  2@D = 10-12 (13) and a minor-side-suit|pg||

nt|gulyas: EW play precision, so 2NT some sort of a maximum with long @Hs|pg||
nt|gulyas: maximum being 15hcp|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|geot: This will be 10 IMPs if South is not ....|pg||

pc|hA|nt|gulyas: dummy: I think you may need these...:)|pg||

nt|monde9: @S lead ?|pg||

pc|h2|pg||
nt|lechcold: w 16 kolejna strata|pg||
nt|lechcold: troszkê nam siê smutno robi, no ale to pierwsze koty...|pg||

nt|ritong: drumroll|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hakem kararý = 7@d tam. skor geçerli|pg||

nt|oleberg:  The double gives the trumf-stack away, but probaly not enough for the contract to make|pg||
nt|monde9: always -1 |pg||
nt|gulyas: now he wants to ask for the @HQ, but cannot|pg||
pc|h4|nt|geot: that is how it is, and it will be 10 IMPs whether he gets 11 or 12 tricks|pg||
nt|clinch: On that leadd, though....|pg||
nt|clinch: Might still make...going to be tight|pg||
nt|gulyas: below 5@H, that is|pg||
pc|h5|nt|pauleger: lauria will take his 10 tricks I guess|pg||
nt|ritong: sigh|pg||
nt|ritong: traitor!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now lauria will bid 6 based on those clubs, i think|pg||
nt|mcphee: west might well have dbled|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kdr_fm: losing 2@h, one @C ruff and the @SA, no guess unless N underleads the @S now|pg||
nt|monde9: maybe -2 some days :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: hmm, so they end up in 6@S after all|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|hK|pc|c7|nt|nilsland:  It has come down to Lauria vs Upmark. Make you bets!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he only has 10 top tricks, so play is very complicated|pg||
nt|clinch: Needs to strip E of his @d s  then throw him in|pg||
nt|clinch: Also needed to play two trumps as now W can trump third @c|pg||
nt|clinch: Perhaps too double-dummy|pg||
nt|clinch: Of course E may think his partner has J @c|pg||
nt|clinch: So defence is not clear|pg||
nt|clinch: If W has QJ10 of @cs|pg||
nt|clinch: will not be right to play a third one|pg||
nt|gulyas: maybe I was wrong all along then, sry|pg||
nt|gulyas: @Ss were agreed as trumps|pg||
pc|h7|nt|blum1956: The declarer needs not to discard a diamond but he cannot be sure |pg||

nt|ritong: my crystalball is broken  i ll abstain:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4c,3d,3s note clubs not running|pg||
nt|mcphee: not going to see it being redbled|pg||
nt|gulyas: OK, Hungary making 6@S in the OR, lets see if Mesbur can make it, too|pg||
nt|baldjean: this is a lucky make if declarer ducks now. tricky lead|pg||
nt|gulyas: a good lead|pg||
nt|gulyas: after a passive @C lead, he can set up @Hs easily|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|baldfriede: percentage play in @s wrong this time, but that's why it is percentage only|pg||
nt|geot: Bulgaria in 3NT at the other table and win 600, and this table N/S do not take a bid at all. Very unusal against Italy|pg||
nt|geot: The opening was creating it, because who of N or S should bid?|pg||
nt|baardolav: 10 I belive  if Aronov maake -3 11 if -2|pg||
nt|tax456: ok. ma su 60 mani il carry over conta il 10%|pg||
nt|star6ija: Stefanov did it well here|pg||

nt|monde9: 2 boards|pg||
nt|gulyas: the good news is, Norway has overtaken Greece by half a VP|pg||

mb|1N|nt|geot: some kind of come back for Norway in this match, and there are still 2 boards to go|pg||

nt|oleberg:  Yes, it could be missed on a (very) bad day|pg||
nt|gulyas: the bad news is, we may end up behind both, and be eliminated|pg||
mb|2S|an| |nt|kdr_fm: the @D lead on the previous board tempted declarer into playing the @C's 3/3 for a @d discard in which case the contract could be made so -2|pg||

nt|pauleger: lauria will pass I think|pg||

nt|nilsland:  Sweden in 7 here - without success|pg||
nt|baardolav: 33 33... 3@h non vul preemtive style|pg||
nt|geot: I wonder how the weak 3@H bid is defined, if he may have something like KQ or AQ to six|pg||

mb|p|nt|psyck: well 4@h can make too i suppose, esp as bidding marks cards|pg||
nt|psyck: making some endplay on North possible|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i meant nothing works after the heart pitch, we could all see how to make it|pg||
nt|baardolav: Madala scans the records... and try to estimate if Bocchi can have 2 hounours in @h now...|pg||
nt|geot: He goes on in the hope that the heart suit is stronger|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2@S is some form of a wk2, but S thinks this has play, and he is right|pg||
mb|5C|nt|baldfriede: 6@c works fine here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: pitching anything but a heart on the third club gives up on various other chances|pg||
nt|clinch: on last hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  But maybe playing a heart before playing the third club preserves some chances|pg||
nt|geot: Maybe 5@H could have been an alternative?|pg||
nt|monde9: now plus 1 costs some points |pg||
nt|jbennet: so 3NT cant work. |pg||
mb|5D|nt|blum1956: Not an easy job for Khokhlov who may see only the EW hands|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: again 3NT by E/W could come hope if the defence not careful - 4@H has no chance off 2|pg||
nt|nilsland:  running scores for this group http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=917&qroundno=1&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|mcphee: this is not a lead he enjoys|pg||
nt|ritong: this type of auction will not exist anymore soon|pg||
nt|ritong: with gazzilli, etc|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: @D lead best|pg||
nt|psyck: best would be to set up a @d ruff here|pg||
nt|nilsland:  At the other table South opened 1@C and thus was favourite to hold the @DK - so a little bit unlucky for sweden|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in open room south opened so the grand odds were different than at this table, ie a bit unlucky the diamond king offside|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: Since trumps are 3-2 and clubs 3-3 the contract makes automatically|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Not an unreasonable double. The opponents hands fit miracolously|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: still, may survive - depends on the way E plays the diamonds|pg||
nt|april7: 2@S by S, but an unaccessable dummy, now going even 2 down|pg||
nt|barnets: very nicely done e/w|pg||
nt|jbennet: wd east..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Open Room just finished play|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mcphee: y, but not exactly a claimer:)|pg||
nt|blum1956: with @sA wellplaced|pg||
nt|barnets: perhaps easts 4N suggested a slam try i diamonds  in case west was much stronger|pg||
nt|barnets: west about minimum for bid|pg||
nt|jbennet: so what about the 3spade bid (many uses that to show "i have 4 suoort plus minimum"|pg||
pc|h5|nt|fabsayc: well we covered that :)|pg||
nt|polpkeeper: dì a wald di mandare anche a te programma dirette bbo su tua mail|pg||
nt|polpkeeper: sorry|pg||
nt|ritong: there is an hallucinant bid, other room|pg||
nt|ritong: bocchi's double of 4@h|pg||
nt|clinch: I think 2@d confirmed a 17-19 balanced hand in N|pg||
nt|geot: On a diamond lead declarer must fly ace and cash three rounds of clubs to win|pg||
nt|geot: 3-3 clubs|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|geot: South opened in this room with 8HCP, mini NT. In the other room North opened the bidding in third seat with 9HCPs :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: coming up on final board of the match|pg||
nt|star6ija: this is tricky even now|pg||
nt|monde9: if Coldea doesn't try a finesse in @S|pg||
nt|gulyas: with trumps behaving, this is 10 top tricks|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|gulyas: if left to his own devices, declarer will go down|pg||
nt|jbennet: theory says that t is effective to use 3sp as a "preempt" (4 support but minimum."|pg||
pc|c5|nt|clinch: As 1@c could have been a number of weaker hands|pg||
nt|geot: yes|pg||
pc|c8|nt|baldfriede: well done to find 6@c|pg||
nt|psyck: duly done|pg||

nt|gulyas: well, he was not|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: well actually on that lead it maybe possible to set up the 4th @D (duck the @S entry to the N hand)|pg||

nt|geot: East must switch to a diamond now|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|gulyas: he may still go down if S, upon winning the @HK, plays the @DQ for N to discard his @H|pg||
nt|gulyas: he needs to play 2 rnds of @Hs eventually to ruff the 3rd|pg||
nt|gulyas: so either @HA-Q, or just Q, S wins and plays the @DQ|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: is no duck N has a certain @s entry ...|pg||
nt|star6ija: now @d switch will make it very tough|pg||
nt|oleberg:  That would make his handling of heart-losers to troublesome|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|nt|oleberg:  Taking the @SK and running clubs virtually guarantees ten tricks|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|baardolav: three round of cllubs and crossruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S is signoff  so  min/max doesn't really apply|pg||
nt|tisserand: undo|pg||
nt|barnets: right it is purely barrage|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: lost the play basically|pg||

nt|baardolav: 140 ew par score... |pg||
nt|gulyas: Ireland making a partscore, this may be duplicated here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: england gains lead in B I think if they push this one|pg||
nt|oleberg:  They virtually had a day off yesterday|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: 1@C forcing  14+ hcp, 4+@C or 15+ bal, 2+@C|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 3nt works here for E/W, but if N interferes it may not be found|pg||
nt|blum1956: This probably ends with 4@h N|pg||
nt|tomi2: cards could not be friendlier, I think 6@H could make if they bid it|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Sweden EW stopped in 3@S |pg||

mb|p|nt|yusufb: selamm levent bolþanss|pg||
nt|star6ija: non-forcing|pg||
nt|monde9: 3 NT on South ? :)|pg||
nt|april7: a trial bid by N and then 4@S|pg||
mb|2C|nt|gulyas: OK, Hungary scored up the normal 4@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as score reflects -- this has been a very tight battle|pg||
nt|tomi2: @SK doubleton onside, clubs 4-4, hearts 2-2|pg||
nt|psyck: see, i told you cards will slowly get exciting towards the end :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@S = any shortnes, weak or strong|pg||
nt|ozgull: önemli maçlarýmýzdan biri üstgruba skorumuz taþýnacaðý için kazanmak önemli umarýmson bord birþey olmaz 18 çok iyi|pg||
nt|MolvaM: iyi oynayan millilerimize de|pg||
nt|MolvaM: thanks to our excellent operator MArtin|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: 2@s=any spl 5-8 or 12-14|pg||
nt|tomi2: hmmmmmm|pg||
nt|tomi2: their notes say 4m = minor void|pg||
nt|tomi2: so I would think this bid would show @C void and no @D void in north|pg||
nt|pauleger: S won´t believe the @c void :)|pg||
nt|clinch: It's been good bridge, I think - not obviously swingy hands, but England have handled them very well|pg||
mb|2S|nt|gulyas: 4@S is not a good save|pg||
nt|baldfriede: that was somewhat keen by E, considering he has no @h stoppers|pg||
nt|clinch: To hold France to less than 2 IMPs per board is very well done|pg||
nt|tez: 2d yý 18 19 dengeli oynuyorlar|pg||
nt|yusufb: evet cýkacak olan takýmlardan alýnan puanlar onemli 18 iyi skor|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Fitting reply from partner|pg||
nt|oleberg:  3-3-2-5 not so fitting|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Not doubled any of those occasions|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: Good result by E/W in the OR|pg||
nt|tomi2: but they have sequences where "first step = high shortnes, 2nd step = lowest shortnes" could apply. Hope they are on the same wavelength here|pg||
nt|nemeo: sorry sorry private :)|pg||
nt|oleberg:  The only way not to be in a 8-card fit|pg||
nt|monde9: a X from Coldea ? |pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: yes confirmed|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: confirmed down one|pg||
mb|4S|nt|geot: But fairly normal as long as West get heart support |pg||
nt|gulyas: 1@D means @Hs I assume, so why no supp x? interesting|pg||
nt|gulyas: all right, so NS play no supp x-s|pg||
nt|nilsland:  2 dwn is likely here |pg||
nt|baardolav: 4@c X is -200|pg||
nt|nemeo: a me questa foto piace molto di più, l'altra molto meno (diciamo che qui mi riconosco mentre nell'altra ho la solita faccia di quando devo sorridere per forza), mi chiedevo solo ...|pg||
nt|nemeo: quale può andare meglio per lo scopo che interessa...|pg||
nt|baardolav: Par score is 140 EW|pg||
nt|baardolav: 3@s|pg||
nt|baardolav: The result from OR|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Still, getting out of 1nt is going to be fine|pg||
nt|monde9: His temperament was calm than :)|pg||
nt|oleberg:  X would probably have been take-out|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: low from worthless doubleton is the system lead|pg||
nt|blum1956: Gromov must be most accurate to make this|pg||
nt|mcphee: all on the @D|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: thank you|pg||
nt|ozgull: herkese iyi günler iyidilekleriniz  bizle olsun|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: I wonder how they will find this fit|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bugün baþka maç yok|pg||
nt|tez: 3 nt oluyor|pg||
nt|gulyas: E 'nevergiveup' Fitzgibbon bids one more|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: yes, this is what the notes say: If OPENER bids 2M over 2M-1, RESP can continue with 2NT asking, showing a side suit or  a splinter.|pg||
nt|april7: W hsould have already opened 3@H, and now NS were kept out of 4@S|pg||
pc|s2|nt|gulyas: the answer is: they don't|pg||
nt|2celik1: .|pg||
nt|mcphee: lots of chatter over this hand from the specs|pg||
nt|mcphee: play on @D which cuold lead to going down|pg||
nt|blum1956: if there is a trump loser then the diamond guess is inevitable, from Gromov's point of view... Also, he does not know that the diamond ruff is possible...|pg||
nt|mcphee: or trump a @S on dummy to take the trump finesse|pg||
nt|mcphee: i prefer the @S ruff to try trump finesse|pg||
nt|mcphee: we can see from up here he could just bang down A@H|pg||
nt|mcphee: but I think that is unlikely|pg||
nt|blum1956: playing a diamond to the King creates one more problem - the 4th diamond in dummy...|pg||
nt|2celik1: @d atagina oyuncu dogru koyup koz empasi yapmazsa dahi olabiliyor|pg||
nt|blum1956: Even Gromov will not be quick in declaring this|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Thanks to his fast play earlier he has nearly an hour to decide on his line|pg||
nt|mcphee: one @D can go on J@C|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Not many pairs would copy that bidding|pg||
nt|mcphee: 4 card @S invite|pg||
pc|s4|nt|geot: So most likely a push, and this ends as a small win for Ireland|pg||
nt|kamyk: tu siê nic wielkiego nie stanie; dziekujê i dobranoc|pg||
nt|lechcold: do zobaczenia:)|pg||
nt|blum1956: This should go down in the 6th trick|pg||
nt|blum1956: Suppose he plays a diamond to the Queen now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think 4@S is plain and simple an overbid|pg||
nt|MolvaM: yarýnki 3 maçtan hangisinin yayýnlanacaðý akþam belli oluyor|pg||
nt|tez: @c dam 3lü|pg||
nt|geot: Noone will double 4@C here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: E has taken a bit of a view here, not supporting spades|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: Nunes would also lead @C3 from  @CQ73|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 9 tricks may come from 4@S, 3@C 1@D & 1@H.  But N/S at that point should be able to cash 1C 2@d + 2@H - I don't see this making|pg||
nt|baardolav: Now probably Italy will win with 1 imp...|pg||
nt|star6ija: or with 7|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|clinch: Good lead; makes 4 on a @s lead|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bana iletiliyor ve ben de TBF web sayfasýnda yayýnlanmasý için bildiriyorum|pg||
nt|gulyas: this can be beaten by playing trumps|pg||
pc|sK|nt|tomi2: 3NT is defined as @S void, so 4@C could be @D void and 4@D club void|pg||
nt|psyck: guess they knew what they were doing anyway|pg||
nt|pauleger: everybody knows the situation holding 2 aces against a bid slam :)|pg||
nt|pauleger: most of the time it is bad to lead one of them|pg||
nt|tomi2: N and E are sitting on the same screen side, so if N thinks his bidding shows @D void he will tell this to Lauria|pg||
pc|s3|nt|gulyas: just like that, yes|pg||
pc|s5|nt|clinch: Less than 1 IMP per board of course|pg||
nt|tez: diðer masada 1 nt oynanýyor|pg||
nt|baardolav: Can be 2 down... |pg||
nt|geot: He is more likely to go 2 down than winning this|pg||
nt|mcphee: or weakish?|pg||
nt|baldjean: I like that Irish spirit. too bad it did not help in the European soccer championships|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: versace has the worst possible diamond holding after the double|pg||
nt|nilsland:  and 3@S prob making in other room will be 8 imps to sweden|pg||
nt|star6ija: right|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Declarer doesn't really want to play any suits|pg||
nt|monde9: it's depending on agreements|pg||
nt|barnets: looks like  swing for netherlands on last board|pg||
nt|barnets: with Italy too high|pg||
pc|hT|nt|gulyas: as long as the director lets the OR score stand, this is a huge gain for Hungary|pg||
nt|mcphee: so down he goesa|pg||
nt|tomi2: this would be a problem if the opening lead was on the other side and south would explain "i dont know what this shows"|pg||
nt|nilsland:  thanks for watching|pg||
nt|ritong: merci a tous|pg||
nt|bobholl: other room defended very well but 1 down for "sure"|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: on first card by dummy it was overturned too quickly to be sure but wont by ew|pg||
nt|barnets: good shot by west|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: this hand so far ok|pg||
pc|h5|nt|geot: I expect both these teams to be in the fight in this Championship, for top 6, but maybe also possibly for medals if they are at their best. Good luck!|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: been informed the other room result is incorrect - 3NT -1 whch given Tom + Hugh's record of bdding vul games would be more consistent|pg||
nt|MolvaM: yani www.tbricfed.org.tr adresini takip ediniz|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|geot: so this will decide the match. 9 tricks = Italy wins, 8 tricks= BUL wins|pg||
nt|star6ija: but this is still 15-15|pg||
nt|geot: I put my money on Bulgaria here|pg||
nt|baardolav: If Bocchi start with AK heart... and heart for ruff... it is easy for stefanov to find the diamond ruff|pg||
nt|geot: it will likely be 15-15 anyway, but the imps:)|pg||
nt|star6ija: @D jack shows @d ratherthan @h|pg||
nt|szeryf: Muller spasowa³ z rêk¹ S na otwarciu! graj¹ 1 kiera|pg||
nt|star6ija: @S Jack|pg||
nt|baardolav: I think bocchi start with @d 8|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Well, if we could bet, I'd bet you a beer their agreement is take-out|pg||

nt|mdgraham: thanks all. A quiet start, but it got swingy towards the end. |pg||
nt|barnets: now just down 1|pg||
nt|bobholl: i hope my sure comes true :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mcphee: i had a few specs suggest @D was best|pg||
nt|mcphee: by golly he is going to make 3 I think|pg||
nt|nilsland:  @H to J and @D now?|pg||
nt|gulyas: so this only a 1imp loss|pg||
pc|c4|nt|geot: I do not think the defence should take the diamond ruff, then nine tricks|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: for all specs who were asking -- this is why Fantoni didn't need to continue @C immediately|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course -- if Nunes original trump was @D9xx  then    oops|pg||
nt|jkotor: ruff high, play low @d, and makes|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: this is making now I think - the defence dont have the 2nd @d trick|pg||
nt|tez: son bord kazasýz|pg||

nt|tez: bakarsýn @c empas atar imp kazanýrýz|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphzgn: Vigorous discussion between Madala and Bocchi during and after that hand.|pg||
nt|gulyas: all right, so Italy wins by 2 imps, thats 16-14? maybe 15-15|pg||
nt|gulyas: ok, 15-15 I am told - now we just need the declarer's decision on this bd from the OR to get the final result|pg||
nt|gulyas: next round starts in abt 25mins (17:40 CET)|pg||
nt|gulyas: the format is a double round robin: first, 2 groups play a RR for abt a week (17 rnds)|pg||
nt|gulyas: then the top 9 teams from both groups advance to RR2|pg||
nt|gulyas: then they play each other, but taking the results from the advancing teams along, only playing the other 9 teams|pg||
nt|gulyas: final result is determined by total VPs|pg||
nt|gulyas: all right, the result shows online as here, so I assume that means the director let the score stand, Italy may appeal|pg||
nt|gulyas: small correction from Roland: 18 rnds, including a bye|pg||
nt|gulyas: so the final result is 15-15, appeal pending (maybe)|pg||
nt|gulyas: certainly an entertaining match, come see us again in 20 mins for rnd3|pg||
nt|gulyas: made the 4@H call easy after the reopen|pg||

pc|d2|nt|psyck: anything that could work, works, @s Kx, @h22, @c44, etc.|pg||
