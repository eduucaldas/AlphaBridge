mb|1D|an|unbal. nat or 17-19|nt|othered1: controls and tricks, rather|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: difficult for west to say pass here . . . |pg||

mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: oh for a penalty double, really|pg||
pc|d2|nt|wilkinsona: thats a view by west..|pg||
nt|othered1: well judged, on this h and.  I do wonder how much east needs to act over 3@S and whether he expects a reopening double with the 17-19 point hand.|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|nt|sybarra: last bd for this room in this set |pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Everybody happy with 1@c"|pg||
nt|santyclz: ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like their system |pg||
nt|sybarra: we seem to be catching up |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: south taking liberties|pg||
nt|roswolf: might well help e/w in the auction|pg||
nt|roswolf: well a tactical PASSS might work as well|pg||
nt|santyclz: 1@d appears to be a transfer to @hs.  W rejects.|pg||
nt|sybarra: we are ahead of schedule,  so break will be short |pg||
nt|sybarra: probably about 10 min|pg||
nt|patricck: goo night all.... too late now, even for me :)|pg||
nt|patricck: good night even|pg||
nt|othered1: 14 was a pick-up for NS, as 10 tricks were also taken in OR, but they had stopped in a partial.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pjs_ch: Morning all - very brief auction here put the pressure on East to find the killing lead|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: oops - now on B2|pg||
nt|roswolf: east will bid his hearts again - 1@D no doubt a transfer|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt looks makeable on EW|pg||

nt|ralfwil: hello Shirley!|pg||
nt|sybarra: club lead makes it dangerous|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome  Ralf |pg||
pc|s5|nt|roswolf: as 2@D appears to be as well|pg||

pc|s2|nt|roswolf: east cant pass can he?|pg||
nt|sybarra: did we miss a pass?  |pg||
nt|sybarra: seemed unlikely S would come in|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup but west backpeddalling fast|pg||
nt|santyclz: In minus territory with best defense already.|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pg||

pc|d2|pc|dT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this was a strange way|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes why not a low ht up?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree shirley. looks more normal for me|pg||
nt|santyclz: S is torn between a @s return and a @c to knock out dmy's entry - or one of them anyway.|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|nt|sybarra: oh well|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: 6@C offerred a choice of contracts|pg||
nt|roswolf: quick claim coming|pg||
nt|roswolf: this has chances in practice since a heart switch by defence is unlikely|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the discard of @c6 is for me from a 5-card suit, so @cK|pg||
nt|sybarra: so none of the above |pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|h9|pc|h4|pg||
nt|roswolf: sneaky|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and why - if only a 4-card suit, N could discard a @s|pg||
nt|sybarra: had W led the j of hts,  from hand, he could well have had 2 entries to dummy |pg||
pc|h6|nt|sybarra: for @D hooks|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|pc|h7|pg||

nt|roswolf: wouldnt be surprised by a low @D now|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think same |pg||
nt|sybarra: or do they lock him in dummy with a ht? |pg||
nt|santyclz: Which seems to me to be the only legitimate chance to make (a low @d).|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|roswolf: great switch|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|roswolf: or not so quick:(|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|c4|pc|s8|pg||

nt|ralfwil: of course with 3@s, 3@h 2@d and 1@c|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s9|nt|santyclz: Out for -1 by pitching a @c on the @sq, cashing the @C and exiting with the @d.|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: those were 2 tough hands to start out with in a short match|pg||

pc|c4|pg||
pc|cT|pc|h5|nt|santyclz: So slightly less than 50%.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|patricck: I don't want to write screeds here, but essentially when South dropped an honour there it was about a 66% chance that it was a singleton and about a 33% chance it was QJ doubleton|pg||

nt|santyclz: hen highlight the board you wish to review by clicking on it and click the "Next" button to step though the play.|pg||
nt|sybarra: as you look at the scores,  the match is probably pretty even |pg||
mb|2H|nt|santyclz: *then|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: the slam was a grand which needed trumps 2/2 and finesse, so like a push in 6 +1 |pg||

nt|sybarra: thx!|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|sybarra: some bringing the axe out here?|pg||
nt|othered1: Ew figure to go plus here|pg||
pc|sA|nt|pjs_ch: might be live bridge now ...  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: now we seme to be caught up :) |pg||
pc|s3|nt|pjs_ch: this won't be everyone's contract - a 4-3 fit with minimal values|pg||
nt|roswolf: selling out to 3@C is a surprise|pg||
nt|patricck: will still be a double digit swing even with nobody doubling|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d2|pg||
pc|sK|nt|pjs_ch: the club position is ideal and the lead probably saves some entry problems|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: but the diamond ruff will be a killer|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: ruffs in fact|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h5|pc|c9|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|santyclz: Yet with 8 @ss and 9 @cs, 3@c is the lawful contract.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|c4|pg||
pc|dA|nt|roswolf: the law doesnt work all the time|pg||
nt|santyclz: My point.|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sybarra: I suspect the 4 @H making last hand (b 14) may be the match in one hand|pg||
nt|othered1: both teams are very much in contention -- EW leading and NS third, only a handful ov VPs behind|pg||
nt|patricck: several lines of play possible I guess, but they all work|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|pg||
nt|santyclz: Now is, of course, the time that the finesses work and suits break, since you're down before you get in.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|pjs_ch: the 2@S bid tempted East too much; there is a desire nto to pass 1@S in case partner has a big hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: twas ever thus|pg||
nt|santyclz: And it assumes perfect play and perfect defense, something a bit beyond most of us.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|pjs_ch: and no alternative appeals - perhaps pass is just a safer choice|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: could have been that 1@S is forcing - some do play that|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|s5|pg||
nt|patricck: There are lots of bids I'm not keen on for this board.... in both rooms, I'm not sure where to start|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|d7|pc|c8|pg||
nt|roswolf: beyond me at any rate:)|pg||

pc|s8|pc|s7|pc|c2|nt|sybarra: need to separate these last spades some how |pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|h7|nt|santyclz: I had 1 8-bd session in my life in which I'm not aware  of any mistakes.  I doubt I'll see another.|pg||
nt|warrens:  doesn't the dummy get squeezed in front of him?|pg||
nt|sybarra: dummy was west |pg||
nt|warrens:  I mean the declarer, but it didn't matter, since he has 3 winners in his hand|pg||

nt|patricck: Spiders from Mars went radioactive in both rooms .....  sounds like a movie title doesn't it?|pg||
nt|sybarra: it does |pg||

mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3H!|nt|roswolf: THIS IS GOING HIGH NOW|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|pjs_ch: that's quite a roubst heart suit East is hiding, in an effort to get the hand strength across|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: can east find a double|pg||
nt|sybarra: just like the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: so far |pg||
nt|othered1: do you play a cue-bid by north as 2-suited or just a to double with a void (the latter my preference)?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: i would pass this double too|pg||
nt|sybarra: you have to but hate open W hand |pg||
pc|h3|nt|pjs_ch: That's a nice treat !|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sybarra: looks normal to be in 3 nt |pg||
pc|hK|nt|santyclz: That sequence used to show about 16hcp 6331 - back in the middle ages.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|roswolf: it os not game|pg||
nt|sybarra: and the same |pg||
nt|patricck: seems like 4 losers, 2@H, 1@S, 1@D and the A@C pitch isn't good enough to lose any of them|pg||
nt|othered1: 4 apparant losers here, but north may have a way to save a trick, especially with knowing that east has all the high cards|pg||
nt|othered1: Maybe 3 immediate rounds of @D would do|pg||
nt|patricck: endplayed with the Q@D perhaps to lead another club or a spade|pg||
nt|othered1: or trump, all of which seem to cost a trick|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pjs_ch: This is the downside of 1@C opening on balanced hands - partner may failt o recognise when |pg||
nt|pjs_ch: you really have clubs|pg||
pc|h9|nt|patricck: mission impossible for declarer here|pg||
pc|h7|nt|roswolf: declarer in fine form|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm insurance no doubt but 5the clue is in pards 2@S i think -this suggests some defence|pg||
nt|othered1: Not sure that was the best discard from north's hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is he takes the spade finess |pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|roswolf: he would have jumped to 3@S or more WITH NO DEFENCE|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|nt|sybarra: oh well we are all wrong|pg||
nt|othered1: still has action against east|pg||
nt|othered1: certainly a reasonable trump play, north wants east on lead and west just might have j10|pg||
pc|hT|pc|c3|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|pjs_ch: the spade make 6 tricks and the top diamonds will generate one more|pg||

nt|sybarra: 35 min per the schedule|pg||
