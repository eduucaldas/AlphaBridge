mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|davidstern: Although 3NT quite playable too|pg||

nt|davidstern: OK the play will be interesting|pg||
nt|chorush: he has many choices and they all seem to work|pg||
pc|s5|nt|henryb:  a @d lead will end it quickly|pg||
nt|davidstern: Ruff one club and run the spade queen but the lead will finalise the defence|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|chorush: On a diamond lead, he would pretty much have to pitch a club then play 3 rounds of clubs ruffing and run the spade Q|pg||
nt|davidstern: Correct |pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
pc|d8|nt|davidstern: Only realistic line |pg||

nt|vugraphzfa: david|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: what do we do?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: the know|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: but billy saw a card so they left it like this|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: lev open 1d|pg||
nt|davidstern: As they would/should|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: 2c2d|pg||
nt|davidstern: Just change names|pg||
nt|davidstern: For this hand|pg||
mb|1D|mb|2C|mb|2D|mb|d|mb|p|nt|davidstern: So Cohen/Smith are sitting EW for this Board ONLY|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfa: no|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: billy is north|pg||
nt|davidstern: Oh 180 degrees|pg||
pc|d6|nt|davidstern: SO players are in their partner's seats|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: yes very confusing to follow :)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|dA|pg||
nt|davidstern: It is almost impossible sitting behind South and East in practice and entering the cards as though are sitting beyween North and West - You have my sympathies Cata|pg||
mc|10|nt|davidstern: Good move just enter a claim|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|davidstern: 5@D N/S perhaps here|pg||
mb|2H|nt|davidstern: Then 5@S EW|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|chorush: Here Smith-Cohen were the beneficiaries of good fortune. With clubs breaking or a singleton honor in the right place, a vulnerable 3NT would come home nd 5 clubs would be ...|pg||
nt|chorush: reasonable|pg||
nt|davidstern: Have to untangle clubs for a ruff to beat 5@S|pg||
nt|davidstern: So club lead, heart to ace/king and club ruff|pg||
mb|4D|mb|4H|nt|davidstern: 6@C will fail on a psade ruff|pg||
mb|4N|mb|d|nt|mslair: 6 @c off 2 aces|pg||
nt|davidstern: Indeed|pg||
nt|davidstern: Neither side have bid their best fit yet|pg||
nt|chorush: Another hand with huge swing potential|pg||
nt|davidstern: As asked are they feeding the computer LSD|pg||
nt|davidstern: That spec likely showing age it would be Meth today|pg||
nt|davidstern: 4@D perhaps fit showing jump|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: there was an alert of 4d, cant read the paper though|pg||
mb|5D|mb|6S|nt|davidstern: Cata where are your super eyes|pg||
nt|davidstern: OK nobody picked this one|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: hahaha|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|davidstern: South should double this|pg||
nt|davidstern: Can declarer afford to simply draw all the trumps here|pg||
nt|davidstern: Does anybody here know whose hand it is|pg||
nt|davidstern: Indeed or who is sacrificing|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|davidstern: OK here we are likely -1 possible -2|pg||
pc|d8|nt|davidstern: so -200|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s7|pc|s3|pg||

mb|p|nt|davidstern: so 4@S N/S this time|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3C!|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chorush: 3 clubs likely shows any minimum. south will have a way to ask for shortness but may choose not to use it|pg||
nt|davidstern: Not sure what 3@C is over the 2NT spade raise possible suggesting minimum|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: minimum 3@c|pg||
pc|d5|nt|davidstern: Ah I knew you had go-gogadget eyes Cata|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|d4|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||
