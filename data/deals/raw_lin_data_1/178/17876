mb|p|mb|p|nt|pef: a really lucky slam for north south, but very unlikely to be reached|pg||

nt|rv: this slam doomed to fail though with 5-2 @d break off-side|pg||
nt|ady: need diamonds 4-3    or 5-1  the opposite way|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It seems a really good slam in theory|pg||
nt|ady: 5-2|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|rv: yes combined N-S hands I would like to be in slam, with E-W cards as they are I would happily stay in game|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|rv: 2@d is ubiqutous multi, weak in either major and possibly strong bal|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: I wonder if West's pass of 2@DX shows diamonds, i.e. happy to play in 2@D|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If so, it's just the clue N/S needs|pg||
nt|ady: usually 6 card suit for that|pg||
nt|rv: some play transfers on multi with South hand, another preferred treatment is to play 2M as t/o of bid major|pg||
nt|ady: may well not bid beyond game|pg||
nt|rv: either of those might work better in long run instead of doubling with South hand|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I assume double just shows cards, and 2@H shows hearts|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|rv: if East had opened 2@h, South might have bid 4@d to show 5@d+5@s (leaping Michaels)|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|ady: in CR  bidding began the same up to 2@H   then east doubled to show hearts    south bid 3@S   and ended in 4@S    though north did cu 4@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: here on 2@d, bid of 4@d would be nebulous since major is not known, hence it is not such good treatment|pg||

nt|bjacobs: E/W played hardball in the CR|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Another golden rule is that he who has the gold makes the rules|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 3@S opening and 4@S response ... just the bids to lead N/S astray|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@s alerted- probably shows a weak spade raise (2@h can be used to show a good raise) |pg||

nt|ady: 3@S opening in CR     n/s found their fit  and gambled sing spade opposite |pg||

mb|3S|mb|d|mb|4S|nt|athene: but the other player may well go for a major after which declarer will most likely get the diamonds wrong|pg||

mb|5H|nt|ahollan1: 2@C is a Game Force RELAY  but i don't know their response structure|pg||
nt|athene: maybe 2@D = minimum and then 2NT = single-suiter spades|pg||

nt|bjacobs: As it turned out, N/S were happy as larry with their +800 and naturalish sort of bidding|pg||

nt|rv: playing 2n as natural by North is not such a percentage treatment on this auction|pg||
mb|1C|mb|d|mb|r|mb|1H|nt|bjacobs: yes, the thing about these transfers and rumpelstilskin bids is that they carry lots of baggage ... requires EXTENSIVE discussion to make it work|pg||
