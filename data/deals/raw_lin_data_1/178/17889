nt|sybarra: hi Joe :) |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: NS - standard - EW = precision|pg||
nt|hawe45: hi|pg||
nt|peachy: Thanks operators, appreciated information|pg||
nt|hawe45: Excuse me - can one play precision and be late for the start...?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: No you haven't|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Now you have|pg||
nt|hawe45: This board was played two hours ago|pg||
nt|hawe45: 100 % sure - director|pg||
nt|andreasw:  good hands to start with tho.. what happend on the board?|pg||
nt|iceak:  JÃ³n and ÃorlÃ¡kur both world champions from Yokohama 1991|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridge.is/meistarastig/20102011/magiccontest.htm  for running scores|pg||
nt|iceak:  SÃ¦var and Karl have both often represented in open teams for Iceland|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I think we start with board 1 in this room|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 15 and 126 in the open|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 15-16|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Sry folks, need to restart|pg||
nt|iceak:  JÃ³n and ÃorlÃ¡kur play relay system|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Good morning everyone|pg||
nt|sybarra: gm Liz and all:)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: East is my partner from the Mixed Teams in Rhodes :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and hello to Isak our operator |pg||
nt|sybarra: great so you will know proclivities |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: hi - 2@d, 2@h and 2@s are same for both pairs - multi and 9-12|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Unfortunately he agreed to play my system, so I cannot help much with his|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty |pg||
nt|sybarra: nt ranges?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Hello everyone. Welcome to the 11th round of Icelandic Championship Finals|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello folks|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|psyck: This is the last round & finals from tomorrow?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: N-S are strong favorites to winning the title in tomorrows 4 team finals|pg||
nt|psyck: ah, thanks|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: E-W will need to be quite lucky to crawl into top 4|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Live score:  http://www.bridge.is/meistarastig/20102011/magiccontest.htm|pg||
nt|ady: just short of a slam for n/s|pg||
nt|ady: aeven with K@C onside would still need favourable trump split    and diamond split 4-3|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: velcome all - your operator is Isak Orn Sigurdsson|pg||
nt|ady: good morning all|pg||
nt|ady: hi Orn|pg||
nt|ady: there is the chance that should n.s reach 6@S  east might lead A@H  which would set up 2 heart tricks for 12   or also  otherwise there is a possibility of east being end played|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We need our operator to shut down and reconnect|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But not much luck when I ask him to|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: both pairs play standard their version|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: aker-richter playing short 1C with transfers and unbal 1d|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: Good bidding - up to now|pg||
nt|peachy: operator seems to have some practicing session going, no cards :)  Hang on, I'm sure we will be on shortly|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Hmmm....|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: The bidding has not been like this :)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: You need to redeal to a board first|pg||
nt|Walddk5: You can't bid with a blank screen|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: I have the board|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Isak?|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ianmcc: hi Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Ian |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 14-16|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like strong nt for e/w |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Please read on your screen|pg||
mb|1H|nt|hawe45: Good luck to everybody|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Looks normal to reach 4@S here, but game is off on top. So unfair|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good evening all|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: this table was late finishing first segment.  donn-goren in a hurry to start, other table wasn't up yet|pg||
mb|d|nt|mgb81: That's an odd choice of take out double from south I must say- makes it hard to express her hand type|pg||
nt|athene: yet another good hand for the "4333 plays in notrumps" rule|pg||
nt|psyck: EW 6th with 159|pg||
nt|psyck: NS joint 2nd with 175|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: E-W play Precision with 14-16 NT. N-S play 2/1 with unbalanced @D and transfer responses to 1@C|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks, welcome back to the final round of the Icelandic team championship.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Both pairs are playing Precision with quite unusual 2nd level|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
nt|lml: hi|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Peter|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
mb|3C!|an|mixed raise|nt|glen: good evening all :)|pg||
nt|dinos1: hello|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: heavy mixed raise I'd say|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: hello commentators and specs|pg||
mb|3D|nt|dburn: well, if it gets them to 3NT...|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt looks as though it definitely ought to have chances|pg||
nt|mgb81: NS have the chance for a brilliancy by bidding 3NT...seems a bit far fetched though|pg||
nt|athene: i am amazed how well 3nt scores over 4major when you have a 4333|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: more system details available from the teams pages off the www.usbf.org site|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 2@S was not obligatory|pg||
nt|lml: hi Mark|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Mark|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now, is that 5@C exclusion roman key-card for spades.....|pg||
nt|psyck: NS play Precision, EW 2/1|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sybarra: a not so easy 3 nt|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Early evening here in Bath|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hello Mike, Ed and CK|pg||
nt|dinos1: I wd bid 2@s as suit+fit, if they play it|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hi John|pg||
nt|Walddk5: and welcome to Sergey and Glen|pg||
nt|glen: agreed, fit showing jump better |pg||
mb|5C|nt|sybarra: we will probably see smolen in use |pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @H showing 4 H! and 5 @S |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Smolen|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Indeed - I think we just did. if East bids 3NT now West should trust him|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: North has seen his partner's 1@H bids before|pg||
nt|psyck: :)|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@h some king of positive response i guess, maybe with bal hand too?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 4@H seemed to be natural vs. a more solid citizen|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: gordon/aker exchanging scribbles regarding 2@S|pg||
nt|othered1: HI, everyone|pg||
nt|mdgraham: HI all|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: NS play a lot of unusual methods and gave me a copy of their CC so I can try to follow along|pg||
nt|glen: now @S Q is worth 13 points (or is that in the game of @Hs?)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Rosenthal pulls the tray through, 3@H slides off the pile, Silverstein rushes to put it back|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdh: The theme of today has been favourable slam layouts|pg||
nt|othered1: West must have prety high standards for an opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: North can try eliminating and messing around a bit but with everyone balanced there isn't any chance of a defensive screw up|pg||
nt|athene: you really want to be facing a 1-suiter though - not so good if the long spades are part of a 2-suiter|pg||
nt|mgb81: or is there...?|pg||
nt|copeyj: @DA lead should eliminate the problems at trick 1, 2 and 3 Michaerl|pg||
nt|copeyj: or even Michael|pg||
nt|dburn: well, the defence can begin with three rounds of diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn: and if they get endplayed after that, they deserve to get endplayed|pg||
nt|ianmcc: a bit desperate if @h led|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello folks|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome David and Warren|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: you could endplay them after that and force them to give a ruff and discard :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and ht it is (was certainly likely) |pg||
nt|santyclz: I would have led a @c, probably the only lead that lets it make.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: i think the only way it might make is if west somehow loses her clubs and then east gets squeezed in hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|peachy: Thanks for coming to cheer for your favorites|pg||
nt|pelu: looks like down 1|pg||
nt|lml: I think 4@H is a touch pushy especially nv. |pg||
nt|lml: yes it will take very careful defence to let 4@H make|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: muted voices from the next table.  we are curtained off in the corner of a large ballroom here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, easy 1M rebid over a 1@D response|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but this looks like a good reward|pg||
nt|dinos1: easier for N to evaluate the game, easier to defend if EW overbid|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|psyck: don't need to preempt opps when they tend to do it themselves i guess|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|cuttysark: Oh well - worried about the clubs, does not know where partner's shortage is|pg||
nt|xenya: well we all have been in worse slams i believe|pg||
nt|psyck: I can understand a try with 5@d, but 6@d looks to be a bit of a gamble.  This is a decent slam though, unfortunate as it needs nothing more than a finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: The problem with the West hand is that it is only worth a GF in NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Sry - was following the board|pg||
nt|ady: hi Roland    Warren|pg||
nt|warrens:  hi all.  |pg||
nt|Walddk5: Other match scores are now up at http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_vugraphs&event=USBC2011|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|santyclz: And another potential slam hand.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: this will go down (Unfortunately) on the club ruff |pg||
nt|ady: not a great slam    but could make with wrong lead   either club or heart|pg||
nt|warrens:  S has to decide if he has enough for another bid here.  his Kx of @H's and only 3 trumps was not enough|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Here we have a making grand slam, which you would not want to bid though|pg||
nt|santyclz: 7 on a finesse.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Easy -1 if N doesn´t cover @sQ!@sJ|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzdh: A double of 2@H, showing some 5-7 HCP had maybe worked better|pg||
nt|ady: now should be 12 tricks|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mgb81: In the other room it looks like Susannah Gross pulled off a pseudo squeeze as Ruth Connelly sitting west pitched two clubs, squeezing her partner|pg||
nt|hawe45: @H - @D-ruff - and then @S from the defence|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|iceak:  could have a chance because of favourable @d lay|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Unless, of course, as here, when you need a 23-7 victory|pg||
nt|santyclz: This is very likely to be the standings link:   http://www.bridge.is/meistarastig/20102011/magiccontest.htm|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Then perhaps, if you find out that nothing is missing except the king of trumps, you might take the action to bid 7|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: As you can see in the running scores, Grant Thornton has a comfortable leading margin of 15 VP, so 10 VP is enough for them to defend their title|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: director pops in to write down the lineups|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphzdh: I guess that Jón Baldursson's @S2 in first trick meant that he wanted a @C switch|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: They play udca, so low card is usually encouraging, which in the case of a singleton in dummy usually calls for a trump|pg||
nt|iceak:  difficult not to find a trump switch|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sT|nt|athene: but since west hasn't got anything to keep but her clubs....|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|ianmcc: don't like that @h8 but still 5 tx for defence|pg||
nt|pelu: now sown 2: 3x@C and @S-ruff|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hawe45: @D Jack was a partner-test..|pg||
nt|psyck: EW System: http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=768&pid=151|pg||
nt|psyck: NS System: http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=800&pid=458|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap contemplating the defense again.  very contemplative the first set as well|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: leans back, shakes head, leans forward, rubs his forehead...|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mgb81: However declarer then claimed one down, so maybe the play record is inaccurate.|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, but even this requires some good breaks (which work).|pg||
nt|santyclz: They are certainly trying for a grand and have bypassed rck so...|pg||
nt|santyclz: But they stop at the sensible contract.|pg||
nt|friggi: then best one|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|friggi: the|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hawe45: @S now, what else could work well?|pg||
nt|iceak:  declarer maybe on his way|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: But it is very common to play Lavintahl when dummy shows with a singleton|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all sorry I am late |pg||
nt|suketbombi: hi all|pg||
nt|iceak:  hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: High @S would have called for @D, small for @C, middle for more @S or trump|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Shirley Ybarra|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and Dima Nikolenkov|pg||
nt|dima:  Hi all :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Hi there :)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: HI Dima Isak & Shirley:)|pg||
nt|iceak:  hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: The defence stands no chance now, should I tell Þorlákur :)|pg||
nt|dima:  Do pairs use some special systems?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: The 2011 USBC will select USA2 for the 2011 Bermuda Bowl to be held Oct. 15-29 in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. USA1, chosen at the 2010 USBC, will be the Fleisher team ...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: (Fleisher-Kamil, Levin-Weinstein, Martel-Stansby). |pg||
pc|c4|nt|Vugraphzfd: cashing HQ for the uppercut not obvious|pg||
nt|psyck: Cashing @hq & playing @d would have allowed another trick with trump promoted|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hawe45: Claim|pg||
nt|hawe45: Trump back would have defeated this contract|pg||
mc|10|nt|iceak:  EW use relays|pg||
nt|psyck: Actually, if 2@h denied @h stopper in addition to showing a balanced positive, 6@d bid looks much better|pg||
nt|friggi: home run|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Cohen: well done, we saved|pg||

nt|mgb81: we can see that the defence lost its way in the other room|pg||
nt|mgb81: 4S looks booked for at least two down but west played ace and another diamond and declarer got a club away|pg||
nt|santyclz: And a quick lead for the team I'll not try to type.|pg||
nt|peachy: Then he does not lose the DK to ruff, tricky hand to defend|pg||
nt|hawe45: One @H to the 10, @D-ruff and trump|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think especially at pairs you want your systems in working order |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Yes E-W play strong @C, N-S standard 2/1|pg||
nt|iceak:  Think strong club |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Yes, I think 6@D was quite reasonable|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Wolfson: that [3@D] doesn't show extras, does it?  Cohen: a ittle|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: east played the @D5 on the ace|pg||
nt|mgb81: with 5H cold (North is squeezedin the minors on an unlikely trump lead) there are several ways for this to gain a swing to England|pg||
nt|mgb81: will kelly bid 4S or 1S?|pg||
nt|athene: 3NT overcall definitely a bit whimsical|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe we can just call them SS |pg||
nt|dima:  ok|pg||
nt|ady: 6@H   an excellent spot     but may fail  |pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: or pronounce|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: easier if gordon cashes @HK and plays @H across|pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: asking partner to have an ace out of the blue is a bit much|pg||
nt|santyclz: (It being only 7:15 here my fingers aren't awake yet.)|pg||
nt|psyck: 1N probably artificial|pg||
nt|ady: 6@S   has only 1 top loser    but not enough tricks   especially on a trump lead|pg||
mb|2D|nt|vugraphzdh: 20-21|pg||
nt|sybarra: some of us up much earlier watching the royal wedding :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: N/s could maybe make 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: I figured since they didn't invite me I wasn't obligated to watch.|pg||
nt|peachy: Often the defense indeed does well to start trumps early, the reason they play in trump contract is so they can ruff something :)|pg||
nt|hawe45: Exactly|pg||
nt|dima:  looks like negative double will get NS to 4@h|pg||
nt|iceak:  How strong is NS NT?|pg||
nt|dima:  likely 12-14 :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: N-S use weak NT in 1st and 2nd|pg||
nt|ady: 2@C   shows diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: this is interesting|pg||
nt|ady: 3@C   natural   |pg||
nt|santyclz: 6@s on a low @h lead...|pg||
nt|santyclz: A truly awful contract.|pg||
nt|friggi: yes - but very unlikely to get there|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mgb81: what????????|pg||
nt|athene: hmmmm|pg||
nt|sybarra: making 5 moving right along |pg||
nt|iceak:  no problems to win this|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 6@H actually can be made on this one|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: And Sævar has a bit of a problem, because he does not quite know partners hand type|pg||
nt|iceak:  My guess he will pass|pg||
nt|dima:  surely they would have some slam try bid (like 4@d) on the way available|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Does he have 15-17 balanced? Even 18-19? Or maybe 14-17 unbalanced?|pg||
nt|psyck: or not :|pg||
nt|friggi: 3NT is the deal here|pg||
nt|santyclz: Needs the 10,8 doubleton of @ss just for starters.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the rise to 2@s from W is for me a strong hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: literally what on earth is going on|pg||
nt|athene: west has decided that she can get lots of heart ruffs|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe South really bid 4@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: I remember the grant thornton team from prior tourneys,  SS we saw in an early round |pg||
nt|chessmaste: South has a decent hand, but North's pass made it clear to go quietly|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mgb81: why would you ever reopen with a double on the east cards?|pg||
nt|athene: best would be an SOS redouble from north|pg||
nt|ianmcc: howcome they left you out?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think being vul, N/S do not get in|pg||
nt|psyck: I would have prefered a mixed raise instead|pg||
nt|psyck: (mixed raise, 6-9, by passed hands or in competition)|pg||
nt|psyck: anyway, with the @da well placed this should also make|pg||
nt|cuttysark: East can afford to be brave at the vulnerability|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I am not sure you can ever make 6 with a @D lead |pg||
nt|sybarra: I just dont see that,, unless you are talking about judging the spade position immediately|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Double dummy you can, by finessing @S at first opportunity|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You can't|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Does not help|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: A painful pass from East|pg||
nt|warrens:  tough call for S now.|pg||
nt|friggi: right|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3N not bad|pg||
nt|friggi: and then the rest to be good|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: E-W's 2 of a major opening is quite unique. |pg||
nt|santyclz: Welcome to Germ Kemper.|pg||
nt|friggi: they must just used it when unvul or what StefánÐ|pg||
nt|friggi: ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: And I have noticed that the frequency is really high|pg||
nt|friggi: sry I have US keyboard|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: They use it all vulnerabilities|pg||
nt|kemperg: bit late, was on another table |pg||
nt|mdgraham: I don't know if NS do it, but some pairs who play this 2-way 2@c response rebid 2@d as an artificial game-force|pg||
nt|psyck: 1@h was 10-15, so 3@h may have been an inv only, not sure|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: donn's pad seems to say 2@H = 4+@D|pg||
nt|glen: its nice to see a Levin at the other table even though Levin-Weinstein were barred from this event (along with Fleisher, Kamil, Martel and Stansby)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: West has 3 trumps and 2 spades|pg||
nt|suketbombi: y|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Then use entries to play @Cs twice|pg||
nt|Walddk4: How do you get your diamond loser away in time?|pg||
nt|psyck: though 5@c clearly superior|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@s, 2@h, 3 trump losers or so|pg||
nt|friggi: welcome |pg||
nt|kemperg: much used in Holland those 2 openings|pg||
nt|psyck: well, clearly 3@h was gf i guess now|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south might decide to float that too|pg||
nt|mgb81: well this looks to be 7 tricks on accurate defence i think|pg||
nt|copeyj: is this definitely the auction, operator?|pg||
nt|Walddk1: I fear it is|pg||
nt|mgb81: I just cant imagine what goes through the mind of someone that wants to double 1S for take out when they are 7-4|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: it definitely is :)|pg||
nt|copeyj: thanks Stephen|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: :):)|pg||
nt|athene: well, received wisdom is that you strain to re-open with double as often as possible, but "possible" doesn't cover 0-7-2-4|pg||
nt|mgb81: I'm not sure why youre smiling Stephen - looks painful to me|pg||
nt|santyclz: An oversight, I'm sure.|pg||
nt|ady: 6@H  can be made  by playing a low club towards the jack  and if west takes the king   get the heart right|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|sybarra: afraid to push them to game maybe |pg||
nt|cuttysark: 3@S already rather high - even if he gets spades right there are problems|pg||
nt|ady: if west does not play the king  the clubs can be ruffed out as they lay and south then loses only a trump trick     but that is an obscure double dummy play   |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: wolfson has lost a screw from his glasses|pg||
nt|glen: not much to this board, except for the lost screw|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sybarra: seems like it should make 6 but I guess that needs the @H's played correctly|pg||
nt|hawe45: No double? - but undertricks "en masse" as they say in France|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@D in OR - and very friendly defense: @D to J, @C to 9, @D to K @C to A|pg||
nt|pelu: - so prob making|pg||
nt|lml: the @HJ seems an odd card|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|copeyj: he is smiling because he is scottish|pg||
nt|copeyj: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: absolutely|pg||
nt|hawe45: E/W will come closer to 9 tricks than North...|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 1@c 11-14 bal or nat|pg||
nt|ady: e/w  may save|pg||
nt|warrens:  now East faces the problem of having bid 5@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: goren mutters something before facing dummy|pg||
pc|cA|nt|dima:  In Imps seems to be pretty easy board|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Can make - the clubs are kind and he can establish a long heart|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap asks: upsisdedown signals, richter nods, aker says there are a couple of exceptions|pg||
pc|c4|nt|hawe45: Come on, North - take some tricks|pg||
nt|peachy: Perhaps there was some misunderstanding in NS auction|pg||
nt|psyck: about the same as allowing NS to make 1@s|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|steshome:  Passing the double with the West hand is a bit odd though|pg||
nt|athene: that's one way of putting it, yes|pg||
nt|mgb81: yes it's the bid of someone who is going for the quick kiil|pg||
nt|mgb81: hoping partner is 2524 with a goodish hand say|pg||
nt|warrens:  safety first|pg||
nt|ady: this will only go down 1   unless a trump lead|pg||
nt|warrens:  trump lead looks right, since your side has all three side suits there should be no hurry|pg||
nt|santyclz: What are they?  5 card suit, not 5332, 8-12?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|friggi: 8-10 - ugly|pg||
nt|kemperg: 5major + 4+ minor|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 8-10, 5-card with 2-3 other major, can be balanced or side suit minor|pg||
nt|kemperg: 6-10|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ady: well done    might still be down 2  without a trump lead    west can ruff 3 hearts  but would hacve to give up a club and as long as south ducks the first club  north can with the ...|pg||
nt|ady: 2nd club with the jack and play a trump|pg||
nt|ady: as it stands   9 trump tricks and K@C|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks Stefan.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: They only variation is that in 3d and 4th they are not so strict about 2-3 other major|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap now leaning over the table, chin in palm|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap closes the screen, whispers some questions to richter|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: apparently about shapes that would open 1C vs 1D|pg||
nt|ralfwil: playing another @h from dummy looks obvious|pg||
nt|lml: Spades are fine too|pg||
nt|lml: not much bad can happen if you lead spades that I can think of|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap inquires NS 1NT range: 15-17|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: trying to deduce what hands aker can/can't have|pg||
nt|lml: 1@C shows either clubs or balanced|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sybarra: but he has to draw trump also |pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: sounded like "...screwed this one up, good lucj"|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|cuttysark: East sensibly preserving his trump|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c8|nt|lml: if balanced any shape in the minors|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: always important to get your excuses in first|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mgb81: Declarer is going to bash out a few trumps now and make her 7 top tricks|pg||
pc|dT|nt|Vugraphzfd: aker did give some thought to a takeout double of 1@S.  not sure if that was evident through the screen|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: first hand pratap thought a while at trick 1 then the rest of the play went quickly|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Vugraphzfd: this time he called quickly at trick 1 and has been contemplating at every trick|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|peachy: 2NT seems like transfer to clubs, meybe they were not on same page asto what bid "likes clubs"|pg||
nt|hawe45: Do´nt forget, that the lead gave one trick away from the defence!|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|dima:  If West overtakes to return a trump East is sqeezed in black suits|pg||
nt|ady: it was very tough for east to sit 6@H  when non vul against vul|pg||
pc|hT|nt|psyck: more pain|pg||
nt|xenya: N will be pleased to score all his trumps|pg||
nt|dinos1: could be 6@c with 5@c down 1 if W had a little different hand|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mgb81: west should have count now and not uck the diamond|pg||
nt|psyck: other table just bid 4|pg||
nt|dinos1: with 3N-1*|pg||
nt|glen: i love the format of this event, no round robin, just 120 board matches, who ever wins this will deserve it|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|cK|pc|sT|nt|mgb81: often its the vul overtrick that really costs. -790 when teammates make 620 isnt a disaster but -990 is|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: takes and replaces @DA|pg||
nt|psyck: ...4@h on 3@h, strange that the precision pair tried more here|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap gets around to recording contract on his private score|pg||
nt|lml: so looks like another 5 imps and aker will have an 11 imp lead after two seemly innocent looking deals|pg||
nt|ralfwil: very slow now - in a partscore|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: aker nods nods and nods|pg||
nt|lml: sorry these imps belong to gordon|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|nt|mgb81: here -160 wont be the end of the world, though with game cold EW might think it is|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hawe45: One more gift - play the Queen, you must|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's a common thing, that precision club pairs make more bids|pg||

nt|ybob: i don´t like 3@C |pg||

nt|ybob: S can´t bid game with this bal. hand|pg||

mb|3D|an|majors|nt|pef: that's not what their system notes say|pg||

nt|pef: I can't believe 3n is meant as natural here, but maybe there is some confusion.  weinstein clearly means it as showing extra length in at least one minor|pg||

nt|vugraphzaw: was also the auction...lol|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Don't tell anybody|pg||
nt|santyclz: For those new to BBO:  To see how a board was played at the other table, click "Movie", then "(other) Room", |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Karl claimed the overtrick on squeeze |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: For me, the south hand is a 3@H opening|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, they can generally afford to, with already limited hands|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: quick discussion through the screen, couldn't make out all of it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: goren: "sorry, going to sleep here.  good thing this isn't on vugraph"|pg||
nt|glen: note that the "Green Valley Ranch" where the event is being held, is not another ranch in the vegas area|pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: when you have a 7-4 as opener on that sort of auction do you just lose the 4-card suit?|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: too late|pg||
nt|santyclz: then highlight the board you wish to review by clicking on it and click the "Next" button to step though the play.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: lots for N/S here|pg||
nt|ady: 2 available slams for n/s|pg||
mb|2D|nt|athene: so opener just bids 4@H or something over 1@S?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 14-16 NT|pg||
nt|santyclz: A "two-strike" multi -- side ace, side void.|pg||
nt|glen: now for a fun board|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: cohen surreptitiously looks at the W hand from the last board|pg||
mb|2H|an|!C, INV+|nt|Walddk1: yes Bill|pg||
nt|athene: these actions aren't discussed much - e.g. what is a cue-bid by opener|pg||
nt|mgb81: it looks like declarer mistimed the play in the other room here. She allowed north to pitch her diamond and ruff away the ace|pg||
nt|hawe45: Here the spot is 3 NT - to avoid cross-ruffing defence|pg||
nt|sybarra: E will open |pg||
nt|ralfwil: important to play 4@s on E|pg||
nt|lml: east has a good hand after the double.  But 3NT or spade?|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@s cant make - 3NT in OR - down on @H-lead but S found @s6 - and now peob making|pg||
nt|pelu: 3NT now a practical bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: music wafts in from somewhere|pg||
nt|lml: it is the kind of call you like to think about|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @d lead is needed to defeat 4@s on E|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: gordon arranging his box.  pratap studying his hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: The 800 was flat. Two relieved NS pairs at set end |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: goren had alerted 2@H as 6+ on his side of the screen, asked after the hand, then shook his head realizing he was wrong|pg||
mb|4D|nt|dima:  He had a complete count here West turned up with 6-3 in reds and rhe position of club ace was known|pg||
nt|psyck: x generally played as asking for @s here|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Interesting situation. The X sometimes asks for @S, sometimes for shorter Major|pg||
nt|psyck: they may run to 5m|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Looking at the E-W cards only, you would have nothing against playing 4@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: decides to protect the H honors|pg||
nt|mdgraham: So EW here did need that 1100 that they could have got  |pg||
nt|dinos1: 2@h - asking stopper or what?|pg||
nt|glen: you have a spell checker on or just can type surreptitiously quickly and correctly?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: the latter|pg||
mb|5C|nt|santyclz: Is the grand biddable?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: One way to find the queen of trump is never to play the suit :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: :)|pg||
nt|psyck: 4 i mean|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: South had a pretty clear escape, no doubt|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: West took my advice|pg||
nt|psyck: should be a routine -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: What do you call AQJ9xxxx?  Trumps!|pg||
nt|Walddk1: even ith one card less|pg||
nt|athene: yes 4@H doesn't look too tricky|pg||
nt|copeyj: can just get a @C trick in the bank and cross ruff|pg||
nt|copeyj: i think|pg||
nt|athene: make four tricks in the side suits and some number of trumps on a crossruff|pg||
nt|mgb81: this will be a good text of alice and bryonys temperament if they can get back on te horse and get a solid game under lock and key|pg||
nt|sybarra: drury  |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Drury, I guess|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap: "getting a workout over here"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: gordon: "I like it, get to sit in my rocking chair"|pg||
nt|lml: tough choice  |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap at @SAKQ: "was wondering where those were"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: could hardly bid 3NT himself|pg||
nt|glen: will W risk 5@D pick a major?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: and on the topic of spelling, Silverstein's last name is too long for the software|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Wolfson's eyes flicker between his hand and the tray|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: North seems intent|pg||
nt|santyclz: If that is exclusion s should bid it.|pg||
nt|sybarra: voidwood |pg||
nt|sybarra: or exclusion |pg||
nt|ianmcc: 2@s was an ask. Could 5@c be an answer?|pg||
nt|sybarra: alerted at voidwood |pg||
nt|santyclz: N chose not to answer the "ask", that shows a suit whose loser(s) can be determined by b'wood.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: :) will they get to this 4@S difficult tho but a 10 card fit is such an Asset|pg||
nt|iceak:  Favorable lay|pg||
nt|warrens:  6@C is easier to play and a better contract|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: asks about leads.  3/5|pg||
nt|pelu: strange that Sontag didnt leed @H against 3NT - if pd has a singleton prob no defense|pg||
nt|lml: you have to be in this game and if they find the diamond lead then thats unlucky|pg||
nt|psyck: South may have trouble guarding rounded suits in 5@d|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: director overseeing table again|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: with his glasses askew all the while|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|peachy: Quite reasonably|pg||
nt|sybarra: @D position (in south) values fully |pg||
nt|othered1: Also possibility of strip and endplay in @H|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra: I think S has to bid it |pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well |pg||
nt|hawe45: Without pre-empt, 4 @H is the normal contract to bid - not to make|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 4th lead, udca|pg||
nt|sybarra: W has nice hand but the flatness of it .....|pg||
nt|psyck: S doesn't know N's hand, & opps x cannot always be trustede|pg||
nt|ady: 6@C might make with the hearts 4-1 so is a little better|pg||
nt|warrens:  some players play a bid to show a double fit over 3@C (such as 4@D), which would make it much easier to find this slam|pg||
nt|warrens:  nevertheless, if N makes a try, I expect S will get excited |pg||
nt|psyck: yes, on non @h lead|pg||
pc|s8|nt|warrens:  do they play 3@C as natural and GF or just an artificial GF?|pg||
nt|kemperg: down start|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Declarer would really like an entry to his hand, to throw his @C loser|pg||
nt|lml: woops|pg||
nt|lml: maybe north expects really bad hearts from partner|pg||
nt|lml: that defence is "sleepy"|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: people sometimes panic when they hit a 5-0 trump break|pg||
nt|copeyj: they shouldnt find out about ot until it doesnt matter|pg||
nt|copeyj: just cash winners and x ruff|pg||
nt|ianmcc: agree, source of tricks|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes should make this without any problem|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think I expected North to re-open then - in my experience Icelandic players do not pass much|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: gf|pg||
nt|glen: N will be happy to see the @C King pop up|pg||
nt|dinos1: now @hA - N has @d stiff from the bidding|pg||
nt|dinos1: @h* stiff|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sybarra: but they only bid 6 in the other room so a push|pg||
nt|santyclz: Well, it's easy to bid from up here but they didn't find it at either table.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: I was expecting same |pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm why double? Gives the opponents so many extra bids|pg||
nt|othered1: played by east, @H lead gives contract away immediately|pg||
pc|sA|nt|copeyj: 2@D 1@S 1@C and at least 6 trumps|pg||
nt|athene: sure|pg||
nt|athene: but playing one round of trumps would have been ok if declarer had then remembered rule 1 of crossruffing (take side suit tricks early)|pg||
nt|lml: he can "see" one down if he wins it if his partner has hearts|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|c8|nt|psyck: but here if was a fairly clear choice i guess|pg||
pc|cK|nt|warrens:  this is a very tough way to start a match, with slam auctions on every hand|pg||
nt|psyck: aah right, just assumed W would play with those lovely trumps :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Vugraphzfd: lead consistent with @HAQ but perhaps also @HAJ|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|iceak:  not communication to pick up trumps|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 3@H-1 but better than defending 2@S :)|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|nt|ady: difficult to reach 6@C  if not natural way to show a 2nd suit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Whenever you lead from KQ10, there is ALWAYS Jxx in dummy|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ralfwil: be careful with your entries|pg||
nt|lml: yes but what is he playing for|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|nt|warrens:  in this cash, artificiality hurt them (imho)|pg||
nt|warrens:  in this case...|pg||
pc|dA|nt|cuttysark: If he doubled South could respond 2NT = 2 places to play, and they would reach their best fit|pg||

nt|copeyj: and another good result for England from next door here|pg||
nt|copeyj: E/W got way overboard and Sally Brock told them it wasn't making|pg||
nt|athene: ok a classic misunderstanding here i think|pg||
nt|athene: if you double then bid a new suit that should not be natural and strong|pg||
nt|suketbombi: another 10 card fit|pg||
nt|psyck: NS have a 4@s sacrifice, but not findable|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: The double asked for shorter/weaker major|pg||
nt|psyck: ok thx|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: When my partners double like that, I lead my doubleton @H and find the ops have missed a 9 card fit there|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Where as my natural @S lead from Kxxx would have hit partner with AQJTx|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: gordon: "I never get the colors right" pratap: 620|pg||
nt|pelu: so games i both room - could be defeated - but making|pg||
nt|lml: all around the heart suit :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: cohen: I was hoping you wouldn't save - I have @CK and was hoping it was a trick|pg||
nt|Walddk5: wb Martin|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: because with a strong shapely hand you start by bidding your suits not by neg Xing|pg||
nt|mgb81: ouch|pg||
nt|athene: so nash's 4@C really caused a lot of problems|pg||
nt|athene: probably interpreted as a cue bid supporting diamonds|pg||
nt|copeyj: according to the movie Gross as south doubled 7@D|pg||
nt|copeyj: I doubt it :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to find 3 nt here for e/w ?|pg||
nt|ady: I think better to play 3 of any other suit after transfer  game forcing   but natural|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi folks|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: well its less likely that Sally passed it as north!|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ianmcc: N/S probably 10 tx in @h but not enough in high cards to bid it|pg||
nt|hawe45: Here we might have our fun|pg||
nt|suketbombi: would you open that hnad?|pg||
nt|warrens:  3nt makes, but better stay away from 4@S.  most likely E will get the suit in first|pg||
nt|glen: ew cc: http://usbf.org/docs/2011usbc/acblcards/CohenWolfson.bmp|pg||
nt|dinos1: hi|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: Solid 1 @S - I love it...!|pg||
nt|sybarra: best if W plays it but bidding wont permit that |pg||
nt|psyck: lol true, 1NT - 3N can come with wide ranging hands|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT a spot for n/s|pg||
nt|warrens:  S passing, hoping to defend a doubled contract|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: optimistic takeout double facing a passed hand|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mgb81: "I didn't want to push the opponents into 7NT partner"|pg||
nt|dima:  South rates his hand as too good for 2@h overcall|pg||
nt|cuttysark: They sort of have the values, but its a bit of a misfit|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 'Its Bridge Jim, but not as we know it.'|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: Alice Kaye will do well to take the low road and bid 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: well everyone will remember a 7@D not too long ago where the defender with the @DA had to double to gain on the board|pg||
nt|athene: and it wasn't at a humble level either|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Or the 7@D this EW pair bid against Scotland earlier today|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Made on a finesse|pg||
nt|copeyj: Well it was a quasi marked finesse Roland|pg||
nt|copeyj: the hand under AQ@S had overcalled a vulnerable @S|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Yes, they surely knew that :)|pg||
nt|dburn: very good auction, that was|pg||
nt|mgb81: one of the juniors watching has just quoted the old rhyming adage "Misfit -time to quit"|pg||
nt|copeyj: Let's not talk about slams anyway after the one in the first stanza of the day today|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Simon forgets to tell that the hand with @HQxxx bid the grand slam although her partner never cuebid hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk1: But she found a void opposite|pg||
nt|dburn: her partner had guaranteed first-round control in hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk1: When did she do that?|pg||
nt|Walddk1: She never bid hearts|pg||
nt|mgb81: is Alice really still in the tank?|pg||
nt|athene: 6@D looks pushy here and east hasn't got any easy way to just invite it based on the diamond suit quality, has she?|pg||
nt|Walddk1: She jumped from 3NT to 6@C|pg||
nt|dburn: when she bid six clubs as a grand slam try opposite a partner who had cue-bid 4@s when she could have cue-bid 4@h|pg||
nt|steshome:  Bill tries unsuccessfully to get us back on track|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Well, not much action right now, Sarah :)|pg||
nt|athene: there is a lot of action|pg||
nt|athene: but it's all in east's mind at the moment|pg||
nt|athene: she sees a big, fat 920 at the end of the rainbow|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Palli is agressive - was thinking of bidding 4@s|pg||
nt|psyck: reasonable with passed pd & fav vul|pg||
mb|3C|nt|hawe45: Par is 5 @S doubled 9 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: may get to 4 hearts here |pg||
nt|dima:  West opening is very aggressive, but he's protected by big club structure|pg||
nt|psyck: may have thought, but unlikely to act on it vul :)|pg||
nt|ady: not so easy for south|pg||
nt|mdgraham: optimistic is one of those BBO words that can mean a large number of things|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdh: West will want to play the hand because of his KJ of @D|pg||
nt|santyclz: His 7 @ss might be an influence too.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Good thing for him that East has a powerful singleton in @S|pg||
nt|santyclz: He really can't afford to make a non-forcing, non-game bid with a 3 loser hand.|pg||
nt|kemperg: looks if 2@S was forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Yes, seems like it|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sybarra: nothing breaks, best to stay low  |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Gazzili in one of its many forms. Presuably East needs 9HCp to give a positive with 2@D|pg||
nt|pelu: but defense is - as i have seen so often - the most difficult disciplin in bridge|pg||
nt|glen: hi Martin|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: sorry 1370 even|pg||
nt|mgb81: as predicted she wheels out the woolley cue bid|pg||
nt|steshome:  East's first Lady Milne, I do believe, and the first of many, I'm sure|pg||
nt|copeyj: true speak Sarah|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Absolutely, she is only 24|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: optimistic to think it is your hand when pard passed playing light limited openers and you have no 4+ major|pg||
mb|3H|nt|vugraphzdh: E-W open every 11 count and most 10 counts :)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Much more dangerous to re-open in the no fit auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: N did not think - my fault|pg||
nt|ady: the bidding has not suggested  solid 7 card suit with north     maybe 3@D better 2nd turn|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I prefer 3@h from W, for me showing a rather good 5-5|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: gordon reached for pass card and withdrew|pg||
nt|glen: no acbl format cc for ns|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: likely to be duplicate auction in other room |pg||
nt|santyclz: You wouldn't really want to be there seeing both hands single dummy, even vul at imps.|pg||
nt|dima:  Not much of a problem in the play again.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: ok:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: The leas of the Queen show either King or Jack|pg||
nt|ady: still a hard call for south  to bid 3NT|pg||
nt|warrens:  now S has to worry about not having a double club stopper as well as having enough running tricks|pg||
mb|4D|nt|hawe45: Surprising, that South with 10  HCP and an opening bid from partner, just sells out to 4 @S undoubled|pg||
nt|warrens:  West comes alive.|pg||
nt|ady: hand 1     6@S was bid and made OR    A@H led|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: and if it is not your hand, X only helps opponents to declare|pg||
nt|othered1: Didn't Edgar Kaplan used to distinguish between effectively aggresive and foolhardy by results?|pg||
nt|psyck: double dummy, 4@s can make i think|pg||
nt|psyck: (say by playing @ct 1st chance or something)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: really I am not qualified to judge these players or I would be in one of their chairs and not mine|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: yes East was a reserve last year just misisng out on her first lady milne but this year she and Bryony qualified comfortably in the trials|pg||
nt|mgb81: good work|pg||
nt|athene: now east still might not want to bid 4@D because that might sound as though she looked for 3nt, didn't find a stop, and gave up|pg||
nt|diumraid: For Live IN RUNNING LADY MILNE SCORES - http://bridge.silvertexter.eu  then browse results then 1o3.txt|pg||
nt|athene: and partner might sometimes pass it or something horrible|pg||
nt|hawe45: He must have seen many bad openings from partner|pg||
nt|hawe45: One more  @H from North  = 620|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: I prefer a direct 4@S bid on the East hand. Don't want the ops to find out about both strength and fit|pg||
nt|kemperg: np here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: gordon: sorry if we're too high.  pratap: we'll soon find out|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, one of the differences is that we can see 52 cards and they can't |pg||
nt|psyck: running this to T, double finessing @c, & ruffing a @d is a possible line now|pg||
mb|4H|nt|santyclz: Needs @ds and @hs both 3-3.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Quite common in Iceland only to lead King vs. NT with a stronger combination, asking for count or unblocking|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Perhaps in this case the queen asked for unblocking|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap: "not much for you, good luck"|pg||
nt|lml: quite enough on the cards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: after commenting on richter's constancy he now seems slightly rattled|pg||
nt|psyck: for an o/t|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: Scotland currently +23 against Wales|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: forearms twitching|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: had a eureka moment when the @H position on  3 was revealed|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this seems like a very light jump shift, based on the 3 card heart fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  oh, I hate that 4@D bid.  if North wanted to bid again, why not 3@S, giving partner a chance to bid 3NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: EW in the other room will be hoping that their counterparts bid 6@D, of course|pg||
nt|sybarra: well they never are for me|pg||
nt|ady: if North is going to bid diamonds so many times    better to have jumped to 3@D 2nd roiund   or maybe open 3NT|pg||
nt|warrens:  he's the only one who knows his @D's are solid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: gordon asks about leads and carding.  aker: trumps could be anything|pg||
pc|sK|nt|dinos1: good layout for dcl|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 5@D is simpler, whether better i can't say, since 4@H is very complicated|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: 2 down in a grand isn't always so bad|pg||
nt|copeyj: Scotland are currently 33 up|pg||
nt|athene: it's rarely a cause for celebration, of course|pg||
nt|copeyj: not 23|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Someone surely knows how many IMPs Scotland need if England get 23, 24, 25 VPs|pg||
nt|diumraid: For Live IN RUNNING LADY MILNE SCORES - http://bridge.silvertexter.eu  then browse results then 1o3.txt|pg||
nt|dburn: 23 IMPs is 19-11 - Scotland need to win 18-12 to be sure of the Lady Milne|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ady: this can go down if they find spade ruff|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|hawe45: Agree|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|peachy: Anything might have worked at this table where N and S were rather timid|pg||
nt|hawe45: Squeeze...|pg||
nt|suketbombi: they will cash there 2 tricks in good time once in witha @C|pg||
pc|h7|nt|steshome:  East did well on this hand, I think|pg||
nt|hawe45: They should have "killed" dummy´s @C 4|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|pg||
nt|cuttysark: South decided to cut out the heart ruffs - but has helped decalrer avoid a second trump lose|pg||
nt|psyck: W knew the @h position, but hoped to 2 entries with nothing better to do|pg||
nt|dinos1: in 4@h dcl shd play @c's to disc @s on 4th @c|pg||
nt|fabsayc: when as here they are in 44 fit, i like partners signal to focus on continueing suit rather than suit preference|pg||
nt|fabsayc: sorry i meant 43 fit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 4-4?|pg||
nt|dinos1: or they use middle as encouraging|pg||
nt|glen: Q about live scores, what we have is: http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2011/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof16|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: rosenthal can see that tapping dummy creates a second trump trick for himself.  but good idea in general|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mdgraham: so, naturally, all out lines of play and defence are 100% double-dummy perfect, just like at the table, of course |pg||
pc|h3|nt|dburn: she did indeed|pg||
pc|h4|nt|pelu: EW in OR in 3NT?? - 1@S - 1Nt - 3@H - 3NT|pg||
nt|lml: this is all going so well for declarer he has fallen asleep on this card|pg||
nt|pelu: 1NT only semi-forcing on 12 HCP?|pg||
nt|lml: he has 10 tricks now but that seems to make people play more slowly|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: detaches something, puts it back|pg||
nt|psyck: this will fectch him his contract with trumps splitting|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap called "Queen?" as if expecting it to lose|pg||
nt|psyck: he will still be expecting trumps to not split on the bidding|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there's a pragmatist - expects his finesses to lose|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: goren shuffling his played cards|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|santyclz: (Or jx of @hs.)|pg||
nt|warrens:  they might play that 3NT denies an outside A or K|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kemperg: claim|pg||
pc|h5|nt|psyck: but has no other option, as drawing only 1 more trump & say playing @c will give opps too many tricks|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: taking it one trick at a time and rethinking |pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|dinos1: now will tap dcl|pg||
nt|glen: if LC goes down here, will be on his next set of CDs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he survives here only because all winners will cash, still needs the club hook|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c2|nt|dima:  stealing overtricks|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Eastablshing @C8 for a diamond discard|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lml: sure take your eleven tricks ... well done|pg||
nt|psyck: a low @d for pd to draw trump may have been better|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: looks like he was playing Donn for 4 spades, trying to get ST and SK separately|pg||
pc|h6|pc|sJ|pc|c6|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|santyclz: That may get it up to 25% or so.|pg||
nt|glen: he has a complete website here: ww.larryco.com|pg||
pc|h8|nt|dinos1: still needed not only @c hook but @c3-3|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|warrens:  but he should have found some way to bring his partner into the hand (your suggestion of 3@D at his second turn or 3@S over 3@H)|pg||
nt|psyck: now N endplayed to give 9th|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the defence will have to give declarer another trick now though|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|glen: sorry, here www.larryco.com|pg||
pc|d5|nt|psyck: y, @dQ was costly|pg||

nt|pef: 1H by weinstein was a normal 1s response|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pef: transfer responses to 1c, even when 1c isn't necessarily strong, have become increasingly popular|pg||
nt|pef: 1nt here denied 3 or more spades|pg||
nt|pef: with three spades and a modest hand he would have bid 1s, with four 2s|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: no, 1NT could have 3 spades -- 1@S over 1@H would be bal min with 2 or 3 spades|pg||
nt|santyclz: Been seeing more transfer overcalls recently, too.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: sorry, u r right (didn't see modest hand part)|pg||
nt|pef: 1n also showed 17-19 in this situation|pg||
nt|pef: west really hates to lead from that hand on this auction|pg||
nt|pef: but maybe the auction is revealing enough to suggest a spade lead|pg||
nt|ybob: probably @H lead and later change to K@S ...|pg||
nt|pef: that seems normal|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Garner could have 4 spades here if he is 4=3=3=3|pg||
nt|pef: 4 on board 34 went down 2, so silverstein has taken over the lead and is pitching a shutout at the moment|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||

nt|santyclz: then highlight the board you wish to review by clicking on it and click the "Next" button to step though the play.|pg||
nt|pef: south now thinking about where to play ace of clubs or the 10/9|pg||
nt|pef: all 7 of the matches except the gordon aker match are quite close after 30 boards|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|pc|h9|pc|h4|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|pc|c9|nt|pef: ah, a bit of a surprise, he decided that if he loses a club he's likely to go down, so he's going to try for kx onside|pg||
nt|santyclz: That makes the @s shift pretty obvious.|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|pef: now a decision whether to play another club or get his 7 trick in diamonds.  turned out to be quite an interesting play problem|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|nt|ybob: W knows K@D and A@C on S, if A@S declarer play over @C at trick 2 ...|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: grabs a cough drop.  gordon: "use the Ricola I gave you".  aker: "codeine, that'll take the edge off"|pg||
nt|ralfwil: any idea about 4@s?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: scribble says "...quant raise"|pg||
nt|pelu: looks like asking for max or min - with max bid best minor|pg||
nt|dinos1: higher is a suit :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: especially light and vulnerable|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: With a source of tricks and controls in all 3 suits not bidding slam would be huge position.|pg||
nt|kemperg: does not know E has a lot more than a minimum|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: East has to worthless kings, he has 4 important cards = 14 working HCP|pg||
nt|lml: it is either slam invitation or force asking partner to bid suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: different drury sequence here |pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks quantitative for me|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdh: 2@S by East simply means he does not accept game invitation|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@s showing a minimum here i guess|pg||
nt|psyck: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Does not promise 6 of them. West has shown approx. (9)10-11 I think|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, the transfer method isn't so popular - most here would just bid 3@h|pg||
nt|psyck: a reasonable game on the auction, too bad @cK off|pg||
nt|othered1: That's different|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: rosenthal confirms explanation with cohen|pg||
pc|hA|nt|cuttysark: 3-card limit raise - looks as if West had a no-cost double, but that might have been takeout of hearts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, of course|pg||
nt|dinos1: 2@h @c and 2 trumps to lose|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk1: 4@S was perhaps a bit much with that moth-eaten suit, but it did put pressure on West|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridge.is/meistarastig/20102011/magiccontest.htm|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I know the relays here|pg||
nt|dima:  So East is going to relay 4 times to finish in 3NT or 4@s?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Every bid by East is asking relay, West is describing his shape|pg||
nt|sybarra: not an easy hand btw |pg||
nt|ady: this may be uncomfortable|pg||
nt|warrens:  I know S has a good hand, but I would not overcall that suit vul at the 2-level|pg||
nt|lml: the invitational one ... good for them|pg||
nt|lml: to bid suits if accepting usually|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sybarra: for lack of a better lead |pg||
nt|ralfwil: a fast claim:)|pg||
nt|othered1: I must run.  thanks all and by for now.|pg||
nt|psyck: thx Ed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: what I meant was that 3@h in this lind of auction is not necessarily an independent suit |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Bye Ed|pg||
nt|psyck: Right Mike|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and here, @HJ was the best lead. Defence can take four hearts and sit back and wait|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Donn studying dummy, glancing at his hand, back to dummy|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: squints, scratches his cheek|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap removes his jacket|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Not to be underestimated|pg||
nt|lml: do you guys think an invitation is a bit pushy?  Flat hand and all|pg||
nt|fabsayc: double dummy he can make|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|nt|hawe45: I vote for 460|pg||
nt|peachy: EW play Precision so NT could be 14-16 I think|pg||
nt|kemperg: @DK good value|pg||
nt|santyclz: W can't count 12 tricks but this has to have some play.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Of course, if East held xx in @D this was a noplay|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Moderate at best|pg||
nt|mdgraham: play another heart, North - South might have five|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hawe45: To me, the West hand is too strong for being a 14-14 - and yes, I am able to count and calculate|pg||
nt|hawe45: 14-16|pg||
nt|cuttysark: can't afford to draw trump, again|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but holding @CK, North can see that it doesn't matter very much|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|hawe45: My 460 were based on a @S-lead|pg||
nt|suketbombi: rational of these tranfer positives with wrong sided Nt often has a huge Disadvantage I feel|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: West has shown 6-4 Majors and 8+ HCP, East has just shown 16+|pg||
pc|h5|nt|dima:  Well you can't have it all - most of the time and especially on slam hands 1@c opener is going to finish at the helm|pg||
pc|h7|nt|psyck: 4@h contract on deal 17 prduced a swing when declarer other table short trumped himself after non @c lead|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Vugraphzfd: elects to go down hard|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|dima:  And most of the time you'll make the game on power|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and now this can go six off :) |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: perhaps thinking @H were 1-5|pg||
nt|psyck: esp vul, should have cashed @d 1st|pg||
nt|dinos1: how? not enuff entries for trump endplay|pg||
nt|fabsayc: with a trump endplay|pg||
nt|fabsayc: true he may need help from defense|pg||
nt|dinos1: dcl cant disc @c from dummy|pg||
pc|c4|nt|dinos1: coz @d6 is high spot)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ady: A@H   not good in this case|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sybarra: and this 3 nt plays better with the  W hand as dummy on S on lead (imo) |pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|suketbombi: ye as Dima said has it's own advantaage the system have to live with the problems|pg||
nt|dima:  An interesting point about the lead - if NS know that W has 6-4 in majors they might try to conceal diamond split|pg||
nt|sybarra: true in any system, has advantages and disadvantages on certain hands|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Interesting point Dima|pg||
nt|dima:  Had N led @d 2 (4th best I presume) declarer might be tempted to win @d J|pg||
nt|iceak:  In deal 1 - Arons team made 9 imps - contract 3@s minus 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: When declarer's shape is pretty much known, you probably should give wrong count on every opportunity|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes good point Dima|pg||
nt|fabsayc: reduce hand to only diamonds, lead the 10 and duck the jack|pg||
nt|dinos1: u'll make 2 ruffs in hand?|pg||
nt|dinos1: (@h and @c)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: cohen leans back slightly in his chair and holds his cards under the table|pg||
pc|h8|nt|dima:  Communication cutting move|pg||
nt|sybarra: really can afford to put in J either do you think?|pg||
nt|sybarra: easy from this  vantage point but at the table?......|pg||
nt|sybarra: that should have *cant afford |pg||
nt|suketbombi: declerar knows the @D split and the position of @H Ace has to guess weather to finesse @S or for @HJ both working here|pg||
nt|iceak:  If somebody is able to vin it - ÃorlÃ¡kur can - very good|pg||
nt|sybarra: may need to shortly after @D ruff |pg||
nt|warrens:  that was the right play if W had 4 @H's, but a real problem now.  |pg||
nt|ady: taken west exit out   will now have to help declarer|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mgb81: Is the play really right here?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe should have cashed the lot |pg||
pc|dT|nt|dburn: might have been an idea to leave that @h9 in the dummy|pg||
nt|dburn: but with @dK wrong, it won't matter|pg||
nt|steshome:  Yes, I was thinking that|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: yes...that was the play :)|pg||
nt|Walddk1: They are tired|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: ...and the auction....|pg||
nt|mgb81: I cant believe that Bryony wouldnt have played the queen from dummy at trick one which gives her 11 cold tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: well...she didn't :)|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|dima:  W "knows" @h ace to be offside (otherwise N would likely clear diamonds)|pg||
nt|sybarra: wow well done |pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe it does not work :)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|cuttysark: Needs a club ruff also|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: picks out a card, still under the table, then plays it|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: North will probably get squeezed out of his @D trick|pg||
pc|cT|nt|suketbombi: no communication for squeeze and will not try to finese @HS so 400 weather or not @D is cashed now|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: No, lacks an entry, sorry|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cJ|pc|d3|pg||
pc|d9|nt|sybarra: we can see the 8 of @H will work, but at the table he is likely to ruff with Ace|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Now, which trump to ruff the club with?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|hawe45: No defensive-award for playing the @H Ace in the first trick|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|hawe45: The Jack is better - leaving the guess to West, how is the "H-situation|pg||
nt|sybarra: might lose the @D trick now |pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap: what were your @D?  gordon: Q8x.  I knew he had @H but I thought he had 5 of them|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not so bad not vulnerable. A bit different vulnerable |pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphzdh: I'm sorry, I need to close the table for a few seconds, to connect to the open room|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Back in 30 seconds|pg||
nt|hawe45: But now, possibly North might have lead away from 10 x x x x |pg||
pc|s4|nt|warrens:  shows how bid declarer's advantage is. a good board (finally) for N/S|pg||
pc|s6|nt|cuttysark: Slightly odd maybe - West has 8 minor cards to East's 6 so East more likely to have 3 trump|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|suketbombi: no |pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|sA|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d6|nt|sybarra: all in as they say |pg||
nt|suketbombi: he wont|pg||
mc|8|nt|sybarra: might hook the J of @H |pg||
pg||

mb|2D|nt|pef: 2d was multi--a weak 2 in a major--not sure if they have a strong option, also|pg||
nt|pef: n/s are cold for 3n.  5c is on a diamond guess|pg||
nt|ybob: X = t out @S ?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: EW did not know they were required to have a defense for multi written for their opponents; they offered to write it out but NS think they know it anyway|pg||
nt|pef: not sure what their defensive methods are to multi--many play double here is a balanced 13-15 or any 19+, others play double is a takeout of one of the majors|pg||
mb|d|mb|3S|nt|pef: so it could be either of the two methods at this point|pg||
nt|pef: 3s here is either pass or correct or preemptive in spades depending on what double was|pg||
nt|pef: e/w are down either 2 or 3 at 3s doubled|pg||
nt|ybob: 3@S shows at least 4 cards in @H ... |pg||
nt|santyclz: Are they writing out a defense now?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: no, Garner thinking|pg||
nt|ybob: clear X if it denies 4@H but not sure here ... 4NT works fine|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: NS now have a written defense to follow|pg||
nt|pef: ok.  so will he still bid 4n?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: no ruling -- they are playing the board again with the same start -- I don't know if Garner will be allowed to bid something other than 4NT, using the written defense.  Garner was ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: out of the room with the director and is now back|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: Weinstein and Levin have left the room -- Levin asked about 4NT and Weinstein shrugged; may be discussing something; may be taking a break |pg||
nt|pef: if they stop in 5c, they are likely to get the diamond finesse right as west will show up with the ace of spades and to bid 3s vul. east must have something (one would think)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Double was 12-15 bal or good hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: now Meyers has left for the bathroom|pg||
nt|pef: a good thing the first 5 went so quickly, this one may consume more than all of those combined|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Jill Meyers is back now, but Howie Weinstein and Jill Levin still missing in action|pg||
nt|santyclz: Well, we'll probably have comparisons for the rest of the match...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: director here asking about the lack of written defenses;  he asked Garner is his 4NT is part of the ACBL defense.  "I have no idea" said Garner|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Director now asking everyone to put their hands back in the board.  We will come back to this one. Apparently Weinsteing and Levin were talking with the director all this time.|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ybob: On board 37 i choose 3@D than 3NT :)|pg||

nt|sybarra: didnt and can not blame him |pg||
nt|iceak:  interesting deal|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Jón Baldursson said when he claimed: "I do not have the courage to finesse @H, but I know it works" :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: :)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: But he did not need the club ruff after all :)|pg||
nt|psyck: decent 6@h, not easy to get to|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: E-W did well (or were lucky) to stay out of a 50% game there|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Still, if partner has 22 you might have a play|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: aker asked:" which way do we do it" and richter answered: "4S is the weaker one"|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 20-22, perhaps a little bit wide?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: that may have been specifically a mild invite|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mgb81: Sorry I just dont believe you|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Our operators never make mistakes. Commentators make plenty|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: OK...now I'm cross...lol|pg||
nt|mgb81: That's what happens when you let Scottish bbo oeprators loose on the English match|pg||
nt|hawe45: Result board 5, pls?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridge.is/meistarastig/20102011/magiccontest.htm|pg||
nt|warrens:  big...|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzdh: 1@c standard opening|pg||
nt|kemperg: what was 2@D,  @H's?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: No 2@D was natural|pg||
mb|3S|nt|cuttysark: SOme scoers in now from boards 1&2: EW played 3NT on 1, but Baldursson brought home 4@S on 2, so all square|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: I think N-S want to stay out of slam here|pg||
nt|glen: now this is a problem for S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: responsive double by south now|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: tartan usualy 5/5,  maybe  a diam. in with his clubs? |pg||
nt|kemperg: Ah was alerted|pg||
nt|fabsayc: next round is the big bidding problem|pg||
nt|glen: unless N finds 3NT here|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: the "precision" 2 @C |pg||
nt|ady: if east was playing west for a singleton diamond  there was no hurry for the heart   diamond ruff first    |pg||
mb|4C|nt|warrens:  on board 2, West doubled by 6@C and 6@H, which helped declarer find the right line|pg||
nt|lml: 1@H was a transfer response showing spades|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: gordon puts on his glasses to read aker's explanation|pg||
nt|lml: 2@C showed he had real clubs|pg||
nt|lml: and supposedly a real opening bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: with the pad exposed I can see it says "weaker quant raise" re:4@S last time|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: Difficult bid for North now|pg||
nt|peachy: Bow North has a lot of info to convey, perhaps the only choice at this point is heart cuebid|pg||
nt|peachy: *Now|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: The Law is not protecting E-W very well here, 9 card fit but even 2@H might be expensive|pg||
nt|hawe45: Yes|pg||
nt|psyck: not likely to get there with a key card & trump Q missing|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: North has only promised invitational values, I think, 10+|pg||
nt|psyck: but still possible due to 9 card fit|pg||
nt|dinos1: 4@c by N - and now problem :) Raise or not to raise|pg||
nt|fabsayc: undo, pass missed|pg||
nt|dinos1: no - 4@c by N)|pg||
nt|glen: undo, N bid 4@C not W|pg||
mb|5C|nt|suketbombi: in the context of their earlier opening this East hand is a super max:)|pg||
nt|iceak:  4@s has no chance|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Hard to picture E-W making a game here|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: No wonder when they have only 20 HCP and a misfit|pg||
nt|sybarra: bold 2 @D|pg||
nt|cuttysark: He is a passed hand - an Icelandic passed hand, even|pg||
nt|xenya: but 9 trumps -- an eternal problem|pg||
nt|kemperg: but then he knew the @H length with partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdh: Sævar is thinking. Shall I check if he has hair on the cheast? :)|pg||
nt|peachy: :)|pg||
nt|hawe45: Easily 200 in 2 @H D|pg||
nt|hawe45: Maybe more|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 3NT seems to be reasonable|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: 1NT 18-19 Bal|pg||
nt|mgb81: This is why you should play 1C 1H X as take out without 4 spades - you have to make stupid passes like the one hre|pg||
nt|dima:  4@c - 4@h - 4@s - pass?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: It would be nice if that were penalties, and when West has denied a major maybe it should be|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: However she came to the party on the next round which is good|pg||
nt|copeyj: in fact you should play X as 4+@S and 1@S as takeout with 4@S in truth Michael :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 3NT looks OK despite poor guard in @c|pg||
nt|hawe45: I vote for 500|pg||
nt|peachy: S takes the plus, not unreasonable these colors|pg||
nt|iceak:  Both think their had is good - but no fit|pg||
nt|psyck: were short of values too anyway to try seriously|pg||
nt|ady: very flat opening east    |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: sorry, distracted trying to find URL for the 2/8 scores.  yes, they're up at usbf.org|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sybarra: cards friendly for declarer |pg||
nt|ianmcc: which red suit would you go for?|pg||
nt|hawe45: When you double hard - defend well|pg||
nt|iceak:  hand|pg||
nt|dima:  BTW was 2@s forcing?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 2@S is forcing, yes|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes must have been|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Probably 3@H was forcing, but not promising another bid|pg||
nt|iceak:  better chance in @c|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: He might take a safety finesse in trumps to get only 11|pg||
pc|s8|nt|psyck: a strange 1N, maybe experimenting in 4th seat|pg||
pc|sA|nt|steshome:  The play isn't going to be very interesting here|pg||
nt|hawe45: This is about the first penalty double, I´ve seen for months|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: donn raises screen not quite high enough to stick and it crashes back down|pg||
nt|mdgraham: :)|pg||
nt|psyck: The tables are certainly coming alive, they attacked a player previous session too|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 4@S played the best way round|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 2@C = "natural, usually < 3 spades"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap: "it's your lead partner"|pg||
nt|glen: i posted it b4: http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2011/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof16|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Has partner one diamond, or two?|pg||
nt|frankaus: 2@D did the trick here|pg||
nt|cuttysark: provided he ducks|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome to Frank Budai, Australia |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: EW: 3/5 leads, standard carding|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap: what's the lightest he'd open? what's your style?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: richter: 11? 6-card club suit, 11|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: richter holds his finger up and writes something on the pad|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: aker shifts in his chair, sitting sideways, legs crossed|pg||
nt|pelu: have to plan the play - we can see that almost all cards well placed for Aker - but he dont know|pg||
nt|lml: this isnt that simple|pg||
nt|chessmaste: True, but hard to find a losing line|pg||
nt|ralfwil: win on dummy and play @c10|pg||
nt|lml: he has few entries to the south hand and he doesnt know who has the CA|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|nt|Walddk1: They have a system they are comfortable with and that's what matters|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Sedcude by @D7|pg||
nt|ady: will have to play well    ruff 1 spade low   and 1 with A@H    and combined wirh club finesse|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3nt was a whole lot easier, whether north should have bid 3nt is debatable however|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|peachy: Low level doubled partscore is a rare bird at IMP scoring|pg||
nt|hawe45: East has no way to his hand for playing @H|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|dima:  North goes for forcing game with his 4 trumps|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Or even seduced|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: odd|pg||
nt|psyck: risky duck with @d open|pg||
pc|c7|nt|warrens:  he can make this if he ruffs in his hand, harder this way|pg||
nt|lml: I like the line Ralf suggested and declarer took|pg||
nt|mdgraham: defence needs to be careful here |pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphzdh: Yes, as much as I fancy to lead my singleton no matter what, this was the moment to hide the singleton @C with the trumps :)|pg||
nt|psyck: only 3@s, 2@h, 2@c for dec due to lack of communication|pg||
nt|psyck: get away with murder|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: hard for goren to pick what has happened|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @dQ needed now|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|mgb81: Indeed it is playing a natural system where you can raise clubs, but it feels like having to pass th west cards after 1C (1H) isn't a good idea.|pg||
nt|hawe45: This @D Jack is candidate to worse defence in april 2011|pg||
nt|hawe45: Now North can not play @S|pg||
pc|c2|nt|dima:  nice play the @h 8|pg||
nt|psyck: wow, 3N= on deal 5 other table|pg||
pc|cT|nt|hawe45: We might be close to 670 instead of safe 500|pg||
nt|frankaus: @D K  was not well thought out|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but declarer has played well, concealing the @s2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: they lead 4th vs NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: presumably donn would show it at trick 2 if he held it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: if 1NT is 15-17 then donn can hardly hold @DATxx on top of @SJ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: very true|pg||
pc|cA|nt|frankaus: @DJ|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|hawe45: But the 200 will be the result|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Declarer still has to work on @Cs|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: If South stays away from them|pg||
nt|pelu: 2x! and @D-ruff|pg||
nt|pelu: 2x@s|pg||
nt|chessmaste: On some hands of this type it might be right to play four rounds of diamonds pitching hearts - this was not one of them because of the lack of a side entry to hand|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|peachy: he has to open up the clubs now, to get another entry, well done|pg||
nt|dima:  loses to H9x offside otherwise gains|pg||
nt|dima:  Well unless South is brilliant to duck @h AK|pg||
nt|iceak:  expects to go down - minimizing damages|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: I don't think Jón Baldursson ever expects to go down :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ianmcc: I think he's in trouble|pg||
nt|santyclz: @ds need qx, 10x or 3-3, plus it's easier to pitch three times from dummy, so I'd of course do the opposite of what the world class players do.|pg||
pc|d8|nt|suketbombi: has to hope the !L is with North and restrict trump losser to 1 no other chance |pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks safe peter. If W can overruff he have to give S an entry|pg||
nt|pelu: and @D 5 6 = odd Number - so no Overruff|pg||
mc|11|nt|suketbombi: @HK|pg||
nt|sybarra: surprised he didnt pitch the @D |pg||
nt|mdgraham: so this might make up for the previous board, which cost 12 imps |pg||
nt|fabsayc: this seems the % play and duly found|pg||
nt|dinos1: S has perfect cards for 3N - exactly for 9 quick tricks|pg||

nt|Walddk5: (Fleisher-Kamil, Levin-Weinstein, Martel-Stansby). |pg||
nt|mdgraham: which will be the 9th trick|pg||

mb|3N|nt|mgb81: Is North playing a weak or strong no trump?|pg||
nt|hawe45: But 7 ir by far more sporty|pg||
nt|psyck: declared appeared to have guess @d & squeeze North to make 9 in that 3N|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: director on PA confirms "should be halfway through"|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: *And|pg||

nt|copeyj: I am with you Michael|pg||
nt|henryb:  It is bad for the home internationals for the same team to win on all occasions|pg||
nt|dburn: useful result for ENgland, this - East-West can make 3NT, and North-South can make 1NT|pg||
nt|copeyj: would definitely open 1|pg||
nt|mgb81: The north hand feels worht an upgrade given the good suit and quality of the controls|pg||
nt|dburn: or at any rate, did make 1NT|pg||
nt|dinos1: why not? S didnt raise, N hardly has @hAKQ :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Silverstein, seeing dummy: "that was the bid you were looking for - or pass!"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: rubensohl hand, where he can bid 3@C showing diamonds, then 3@H asking stopper|pg||
pc|s7|nt|psyck: can't figure out why 3@d instead of @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: seems misunderstanding|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 3NT looks a practical shot from South|pg||
nt|psyck: need to set up @d's soon|pg||
nt|psyck: before 1 goes on @c|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: i think it is ok to open either 12-14 OR 15-17 NT with that north hand|pg||
nt|athene: it's right on the borderline and the extra tactical advantage for 1nt opener means you bend it as necessary|pg||
nt|santyclz: To view more than one table at a time: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/  Open 1 browser window per table.|pg||

nt|hawe45: Anyway, it cannot be that hand|pg||

nt|ady: east has done well not to compete  |pg||
nt|pelu: so ½  boAard late :) - 15 borads in sektion|pg||
nt|glen: will N avoid @H lead "knowing" W has @H king|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: has to be South playing it for sure |pg||
nt|cuttysark: North contemplating slam, East wondering how cheap a save might be|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: N showing facial expressions - looking to the air|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Lack of aces should put him off|pg||
nt|warrens:  3 discards should allow E to let his partner know he has nothing but @S's|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|dima:  Trumps structure is not good enough to convert|pg||
nt|sybarra: one would thing |pg||
nt|kemperg: 3@C a bit "strong"|pg||
nt|psyck: actually, a @h will go on @c instead|pg||
pc|dK|nt|dima:  9 tricks next case|pg||
nt|sybarra: this may make declarer play the clubs right |pg||
nt|psyck: *as 1@c need...|pg||
nt|sybarra: *think|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: South can probably not be sure pd has 5@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Allthough he denied 4@H himself, his partner might be weak in @D|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: "brady, what'd you tell him?" richter: "clubs" aker:"it's hearts and clubs"|pg||
nt|pelu: some would open 2@S in West|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mgb81: England have got another brucey bonus board coming on 24, but all the imps in the world wont matter unless scotland lose some|pg||
nt|athene: there is at least 1/2 hcp's worth of advantage in opening 1nt, after all - surely more?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: learn to love your aces - hands with none are never great hands :)|pg||
nt|psyck: nice shify|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphzdh: Well, for South, this is an obvious "maximum" for a 9-15 opening |pg||
nt|psyck: *shift|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|ianmcc: not much of interest here|pg||
nt|kemperg: spec tells opening 9-11 and 2@D good rais|pg||
nt|psyck: @d knocks out dummy entry now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: halfway beeps ringing|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzdh: A @D lead seems natural|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Exiting contract, not clear how declarer will play|pg||
nt|ady: 10@H should tell the storry|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzdh: Unfortunate lead, now declarer has 2 entries to set up and enjoy @Cs|pg||
nt|kemperg: e|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Or 2@D|pg||
nt|psyck: E can now be endplayed with a @d though|pg||
nt|psyck: so dec may still avoid @h loser if he reads well|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphzdh: East had a chance to duck|pg||
nt|kemperg: 9-15 |pg||
nt|lml: like it better not vul or not in second chair|pg||
nt|ralfwil: as NS have 5-4 in trumps, I prefer a trumph lead from E |pg||
pc|h2|nt|mgb81: 2d is a pretty ineligant contract for ew but it should make comfortably|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Vugraphzfd: cohen laughs after @D position revealed|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|santyclz: Time for a caffeine run. |pg||
nt|psyck: that was premature however & he should go down now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: might get a heart away on @CQ|pg||
pc|cT|nt|psyck: this will be a costly misunderstanding with a vul game|pg||
nt|ady: 2@S  udca    but throwing a trick|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but this will perhaps work....:)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|henryb:  North will lose her @cA if she does not take it|pg||
nt|peachy: A lot of 2/1 players use 3C here as invitational with long clubs, passable or bid 3NT |pg||
pc|c9|nt|peachy: But to be clear, I am not familiar with their method of course|pg||
nt|iceak:  10 tricks most surely|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: And North liked his ace of @C after partners trial bid, but forgot to dislike his bad shape and probably @S king or @D queen not working|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|hawe45: In fact, 6 @C is no bad contract. Without a @H-lead, it might succeed even with a bad @C-break|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap shaking his head|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|vugraphzdh: 10 top trick now for declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: And 11 by squeezing East|pg||
nt|lml: especially because there didnt figure to be a diamond ruff with south having nine cards in  two other suits|pg||
nt|psyck: oh well, def started so well, but these low level contracts are tough to play & defend|pg||
pc|c4|nt|cuttysark: I would enjoy a claim - instead I shall enjoy a coffee|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Vugraphzfd: uncertain tone of voice calling @HT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: very difficult to defend these hands|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ianmcc: S squeezed|pg||
pc|d9|nt|vugraphzdh: No, has no entry|pg||

nt|athene: if west really wanted to bid over 4@H then at least bid 4NT so partner can choose diamonds when it's right|pg||

nt|ralfwil: sry 66@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: maybe she felt it might help in the play to have concealed the side suit|pg||
nt|mgb81: It doesnt even look like 4S is that easy - if south plays ace, king and ruff s diamond low east can overuff the 7 with the 8 and bang another turmp back|pg||
nt|sybarra: some part score here|pg||
nt|ianmcc: thin 4@s here|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: gordon grimaces|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mgb81: Moya Kelly as south had a few choices after 1C P 1H - she could double, bid 2NT, or just 1S.|pg||
nt|steshome:  Um, I'm with Simon on this one|pg||
nt|athene: the problem is if you show the 5-5 you can't really show the values - 2nt would usually be weaker|pg||
nt|copeyj: Why Sarah, what does Simon think? :)|pg||
nt|ady: wonder if east will compet   4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: can they get to it (nad do you want to be in it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: This way he got to bid both Dima :) 1 and 3 @H|pg||

mb|3S|nt|athene: she doesn't know but she knows you will be right|pg||
nt|athene: i'm with you too|pg||

nt|dinos1: y, in fav S cd enter the bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: you mean S's pass with 5-5?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: yes, with 5-5, at favorable, against a 2@C opening I would be in the bidding even with worse suits than that|pg||
mb|4C|nt|athene: eeek|pg||
nt|steshome:  Yes, you're right Bill made the 4NT comment.  But of course I'm with you in any event|pg||
nt|Walddk1: It does not help England's cause that the Welsh are committing suicide at the moment|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: South was in a scary balancing position|pg||

nt|lml: the cards are very friendly|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: not sure what 3@D was meant to be.  jump cue as mixed raise is popular treatment|pg||
nt|pelu: u are right, Linda|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: gordon excuses himself from the enclosure|pg||
nt|psyck: this will not be a success|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: eek! I can understand both of EW actions (unlike -360 against 1S X) but this is going to get murdered on a trump lead|pg||
nt|dima:  :)|pg||
nt|dima:  seems natural to play double finesse in @d|pg||
nt|iceak:  Karl probably plays low @s and JÃ³n low @d|pg||
nt|iceak:  SÃ¦var sry|pg||
nt|kemperg: but N has a bad 12|pg||
nt|friggi: right|pg||
nt|psyck: good lead for team Gordon to possibly make up a few imps|pg||
mb|6S|nt|athene: time for north to get out the big stick of justice|pg||
nt|athene: the 5-level is no time to volunteer 2-card support|pg||
nt|mgb81: this will probably be 1100 as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: but a big mistake missing at least 4@s|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap asks him to bring water when he returns|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not a good contract. North seems a bit light for his actions, but maybe thay have agreements about 2@h at this vulnerability |pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Wish I knew their methods, but I dont|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Showing 4@H and 5+ @C|pg||
nt|peachy: There is alert on 3C|pg||
nt|sybarra: well... |pg||
nt|dinos1: and EW have comfortable road to slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 6-5 come alive, yes - but only when you actually have a trump fit in one of your long suits|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 3@C probably puppet to 3@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: tought to time this one |pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think a balanced 18-19 was included in 2@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: it was|pg||
nt|sybarra: hence the 2 @S alert |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Then one uses all sorts of transfers and relays and ends in 3NT|pg||
nt|lml: 6 is not a good contract but 4 is|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: west has followed the rule "6-2 come alive"|pg||
nt|athene: or perhaps it should be "6-2 in the glue"|pg||
nt|Walddk1: I think we all agree that 3@H was an overbid|pg||
nt|mgb81: how about "6-5-2, that wont do"|pg||
nt|glen: of course if @D king offside, not as comfortable|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this hand won't make the highlight reel either|pg||
nt|dinos1: comfortable road:) didnt say "slam" )|pg||
nt|fabsayc: cue bidding singleton on first bid is a loser in my opinion|pg||

pc|h5|nt|athene: people often bid too aggressively when they have shortage in opps' suit but not that big a fit for partner|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Friendly defence may keep this to 800|pg||
nt|athene: these hands are really difficult to control|pg||
nt|athene: when the ruffing value is with only 2 trumps - even with 3 trumps it can get out of hand very easily|pg||
nt|mgb81: Alice can get pout for 800 now - it looks like she can cross ruff but the 7 of hearts will come into play|pg||
pc|h3|nt|santyclz: LOTT say 16 tricks, looks more like 18 to me.|pg||
nt|santyclz: (says)|pg||
nt|sybarra: low spade and ?|pg||
nt|dima:  now low @d and he has to guess |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Actually a trump from West kills the contract|pg||
nt|dima:  true heart is better as specs mention|pg||
nt|sybarra: scary spot,  |pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure it can be made |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ady: takes Q@D lead   and a diamond ruff to beat 4 hearts motre than 1|pg||
pc|sA|nt|santyclz: Perhaps only 17.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|nt|peachy: ok, then 3NT after that apparently showed the clubs?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Attitude lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: club return easy,  @D a guess, (with good guess will bring it home) hts and messes up communication |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Defenders must take care not to set up that long club - maybe had to switch to hearts|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|sybarra: clubs 4/4  is that enough?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: cohen detaches several cards from his hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: above the table no less.  arranging his line of play?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: C7 SK ST DQ|pg||
nt|dinos1: he cant check @cKQx - not enuff entries|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: "I'm going to try to crash the @CKQ, then play you for @DK"|pg||
mc|12|nt|Walddk1: Scotland let a 4@S through that should have gone down as the play went, so +29 only now|pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|nt|lml: looks like one of those muidenberg things Mark|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: not alerted.  neither their online system card nor the CC at the table says anything special about 2@S|pg||

mb|p|nt|ianmcc: 30 HCP and 3NT a bit uncertain|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: seeing the cards n/s can make game in hearts and no-trumps   |pg||
nt|mdgraham: This may find the spade fit - if they get to 4@S, will East double?|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: oh well, took a more direct rout|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: A bit unusual @D preempt by North|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, with only 5 & good hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Pushing E-W above comfortable level|pg||
nt|ady: would have to play a low heart 2nd round in both contracts|pg||
nt|friggi: 4@S|pg||
nt|psyck: i guess S showed both majors|pg||
pc|d7|nt|peachy: This may be "J denies, 9 implies" 2 higher honors|pg||
nt|psyck: a little work to do with the minor breaks, but should get home |pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Henry @h|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: if 4@D is fitshowing raise to 4@S it seems strange to float 4@H back around - gives EW too many options|pg||
nt|pelu: would u all pass in N?|pg||
nt|lml: is this a forcing pass do you think?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: gordon pulls up his sleeves|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: director peeks in to see what board we're on|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@s a min hand maybe|pg||
nt|psyck: if 2N was inv|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Donn writes neatly: 2NT = 4-4 majors, INV|pg||
pc|dK|nt|fabsayc: 3nt is only better than 4@H if south has precisely Ax in diamonds|pg||
nt|glen: had to hop @D king as could not afford a @S switch here|pg||
nt|glen: turns out the long @S hand had no entry though|pg||
nt|dinos1: and if 4-4?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: rosenthal digging through his bag while wolfson decides whether to unblock|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sybarra: and W hand with a perfect yarborough|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome|pg||
nt|psyck: but at unfav, many preempt with wide ranging hands|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Welcome Henry :)|pg||
nt|friggi: 50%|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Needs to ruff 1 @D|pg||
nt|friggi: nice lead for decl|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ralfwil: this is too slow in my opinion. about 10 minutes/board|pg||
nt|lml: I play it as forcing because we voluntarily bid a vul game but more sophisticated rules might suggest that east cannot force west|pg||
nt|psyck: good to know his writing has improved|pg||
nt|mdgraham: glad N can write decently|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sybarra: the bidding of 1 @D will locate all of the missed high cards|pg||
nt|psyck: sry fav vul|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no, it was the SW writing that was bad|pg||
nt|psyck: aah right|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: gordon fans his cards, folds them again, leans back, studies dummy|pg||

nt|friggi: and more|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lml: I find the @HK a bit confusing.  I like to save that kind of card for something other than just a higher ranking suit please|pg||
nt|pelu: why signal for @D - if defense has a @D-trick it can¨'t go away|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: gordon left the @HA faced a while deciding what @HK was about|pg||
nt|lml: the one thing he doesnt want is another heart|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: director announces "45 minutes remain"|pg||
nt|lml: but I dont think Gordong will lead a heart no matter what he thinks the @HK is|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: should be able to play 5 1/2 boards in 45 minutes but we've been well behind that pace|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: oops, 6 1/2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: gordon sighs, crosses his arms.  not at all rushed by the announcement|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the safe play is to try to get 2 @c tricks first. If not E must have a @d trick|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: gordon scratches his head, hovers over his cards|pg||
nt|psyck: def should get their 5 tricks whichever path they chose to take|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|psyck: Deal 7 produced the expected swing to tighten the match|pg||

pc|h7|nt|lml: as he has the @SA even a diamond is fairly safe|pg||

nt|dinos1: 3N?|pg||
mb|d|nt|cuttysark: Not this one - they have a festival in Ferbuary which I attended once - highly recommended|pg||

nt|friggi: go bidding by Hrólfur|pg||
nt|santyclz: 8 bds 11 imps.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Dangerous N-S hands|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Can easily get to high|pg||
mb|4C|nt|athene: east might have considered 3@C|pg||
nt|athene: that has to be a fit bid as a passed hand|pg||
nt|mgb81: Ah - I am now told that the actual auction was 2H (2S) 3H all pass|pg||
nt|sybarra: N finding the 1 @S call "interesting" |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: I think E-W will not bid slam unless N-S push them by 1 more @S bid?!?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Sorry - I am behind the times - the Festival is in January now. |pg||
nt|pelu: looks like cheap insurence - but cost 5 + 5 = 10 IMP|pg||
nt|dinos1: 4@c-5@c|pg||
nt|dinos1: knowing N has @h void|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: cohen pulls the pass card face down then plays it|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: Good poin Bill|pg||
nt|Walddk1: point even|pg||
nt|santyclz: How many for a 2@s bid on 1st round?|pg||
nt|jbennet: again at this situations its good to have 2 ways to bid spades.|pg||
nt|jbennet: N now faces a guess. does South have full valus or does he only competing?|pg||
nt|dima:  2@d is likely to be a constructive @h raise - 7-9 or so with 2@h raise reserved for really junky hands|pg||
nt|jbennet: the same should be applied to NS.|pg||
nt|iceak:  seems 4 no more than 9 tricks in @s|pg||
nt|jbennet: so 2H and 2 sp both show spade suit.|pg||
nt|dima:  North might try 3@h as gametry in @s|pg||
nt|sybarra: brrrrrrrrr |pg||
nt|cuttysark: No, it was great!|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: East was wise not to double|pg||
nt|psyck: cheaply bought, EW make some 11 tricks in @s probably|pg||
nt|xenya: E's pass looks strange|pg||
nt|ady: 13 tricks for n/s    but  needs 2 3-3 splits|pg||
nt|ady: may settle for game|pg||
nt|friggi: dbl is min 4@H + values|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: North was hoping the opponents would bid 4@S, not his partner :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: had anyone of you tried 3nt as W?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 3NT too rich but I liked 3@H over 1@H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: to slow down the tray, 4@C bid without hesitation|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdh: But this might easily be a double game swing|pg||
nt|pelu: agree with 3@H, John|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: aker writes: "X = ?", gordon shrugs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: apparently he has seen North's overcalls before|pg||
nt|dinos1: seems so :)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: south might double here rather than bidding 3@S? |pg||
nt|hawe45: I would never bid 3 @S in this situation - just helping opponents|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Well, depends on what 2@S meant|pg||
nt|psyck: good lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: I am quite confident, that East knows, who is in position of the @C Queen = 680|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 2@S was 8-13 balanced, no @S stopper|pg||
nt|henryb:  you stay inside where it is warm and well lit -- always dark outside|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: so as not to overstate the support|pg||
nt|mgb81: NS can't make very much either a club ruff or a heart trick for the second undertrick|pg||
nt|steshome:  Double's probably game-try|pg||
nt|jbennet: yes but of south only had competing valus 3 sp is likely to be too high|pg||
nt|dima:  Oh well he makes Sandra Landy game try - bid it first then try to make it|pg||
nt|sybarra: LOL|pg||
nt|iceak:  Favorable @c|pg||
nt|dima:  They might know each others 3rd seat opening bids |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Friendly @C layout might see this home|pg||
nt|dima:  brilliant small @h lead?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: A small @H lead would have been killing|pg||
nt|iceak:  JÃ³n more likely to play small @c|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Seems that declarer might be tempted to work on @D which will not work|pg||
nt|henryb:  and I understand the hospitality is fantastic|pg||
nt|friggi: but a nice slam try by Oddur|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Impossible, in my opinion, not to give it a shot|pg||
nt|pelu: many IMP on stake here|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: lucky not to get hit in this|pg||
nt|athene: east might well consider double if really in need of imps|pg||
nt|jbennet: seems 4 sp too high.|pg||
nt|jbennet: but lucky break makes it possible.|pg||
nt|ady: difficult  even to be confident of a small slam |pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: E had some defensive cards in @h, but the rest of his hand was massively offensive|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: smooth 5@D from pratap|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the 1@S bid has done it's job|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: East thought there might be game if partner had some heart support - when he does not, screeching brakes|pg||
nt|sybarra: a spec told me:  16 cm of snow fell last night - hasn't snowed this much in may for 24 years in Iceland|pg||
nt|warrens:  6@H looks like the right contract.  has many chances (either suit 3-3 or a spade ruff in dummy overruffed by the hand with 4 @H's or clubs setting up)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: might be expecting more than A6 from the double|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: well e/w are missing some spots in @D,   |pg||
nt|sybarra: I do not see a way to make this|pg||
nt|ianmcc: -100 probably good going|pg||
nt|iceak:  plays @h to K - for a trump|pg||
nt|friggi: not imp 50%|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not a bad slam except the 1 minor flaw...|pg||
nt|pelu: Gordon found the winning bid - but his X confused - or mislead partner|pg||
nt|ralfwil: cannot understand 5@d from E . W didn´t bid 4nt|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: other room has caught up and johnson did bid 3@H with the west hand|pg||
nt|lml: I am not a big fan of the double anyway|pg||
pc|c8|nt|pelu: no Ralf but he X 3@S - 5@C now sh be 6-4 i minor|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap picks up his cards rather than putting out another green one|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 2@C alerted as 2+ by S to W but not by N to E.  pratap looks askew at the second club trick|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: closes the window and whispers a question to Donn|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap coughs.  gordon tosses a ricola under the screen.  pratap accepts, says thank you, continues to contemplate his defense|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: roughly 30 minutes remain for 5+ boards|pg||
pc|c3|nt|psyck: sure did not expect the biddingto die down before 4@s|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
nt|steshome:  With a 10-count opposite a weak two?  Nah|pg||
nt|psyck: a loser in each suit here...|pg||
nt|xenya: i think E had a clear raise to 4 -- as a double shot at least|pg||
nt|psyck: true|pg||
nt|santyclz: It violates Burn's Rule of 8.|pg||
nt|friggi: nice bidding by N-S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: pushed EW to 4 level with only 9 trumps, which has to be a sin|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lml: interesting|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: that explains that|pg||
nt|ralfwil: don´t agree. in that case W has at least 7-4 with 5@c|pg||
nt|lml: -300 or 400 is still going to lose quite a few imps|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: richter never put out the final pass.  the red X on top misled me|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but landed cheaper than in 5@cX|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: director peeks in to verify it's board 25 on the table|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Vugraphzfd: undoubled.  sorry for the confusion|pg||
pc|sT|nt|hawe45: 3 @S X = 800, better than game|pg||
nt|jbennet: i think though best bet is too draw trumps ending in dummy and then start the clubs|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|mgb81: East does best to switch to hearts and then if north finesses she can give a club ruff for 3 down|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Declarer might get fatally shortened when West gets his @D trick|pg||
nt|kemperg: trump start was better|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: If declarer goes for @D he might make it|pg||
nt|friggi: we do not like rules in Iceland:)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Burn's Rule of 8:  Subtract the number of aces the opps hold from 8.  Don't bid to that level.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: That's an excellent rule :)  I will try to memorize that|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: He might try a ruffing finesse in @D|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: well yes, only a 10 count, but 3 very likely tricks|pg||
nt|pelu: but Ralf for sure West sh have 4 card @D for his X - dont u agree?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|psyck: yes, he has too much work to do with too many cards unfav|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|iceak:  propably vins |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: West's 3@S bid was not effective|pg||
nt|friggi: yes|pg||
nt|kemperg: nice rule|pg||
nt|lml: 4 down is 11 imps to aker|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|pc|c7|nt|xenya: should persevere with diamonds for 1 off|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 1@S or 4@S would have worked better on this hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: But with a passed partner 3@S is a reasonable shot|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Then when 4@H comes to him undoubled, perhaps he should consider 4@S|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|mgb81: I suppose it's a bit fancifl to think that north will play ace of trumps and sprun the diamond finesse to get out for down two anyway|pg||
nt|psyck: did E pass 4@h smoothly?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Burn's Laws.  3 of them:  http://www.blakjak.demon.co.uk/burn_law.htm|pg||
nt|dinos1: and S X'd on this ground|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s7|pg||
nt|dima:  well done|pg||
nt|henryb:  16 cm is much more impressive than 6 inches isn't it|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kemperg: only has to ruff 3@C's|pg||
nt|lml: 5 down is worth just 1 more imp|pg||
nt|lml: however you look at it the doubled served no purpose except to confuse partner|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mgb81: NIBU is the Northern Ireland Bridge Union, in effect the Northern Ireland second team|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Seems nobody tries to draw trump here - can't have any embankments to walk|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|mgb81: added to make up the round robin to an even number|pg||
nt|mgb81: this will be 3 down and 4 imps to England|pg||
nt|athene: are england allowed to give some of their imps to wales for this match?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|pelu: agree 100%, Linda|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: gordon faced dummy one card at a time.  pratap visibly taken back by the sight of it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: aker fidgety at the table|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|nt|sybarra: does he have the count?  I think so |pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mgb81: uh oh|pg||
nt|lml: -500 (-400+-100) is worth 11 imps.  You can see the imp scale by hovering over the players names|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mgb81: now she's in a mess - King from east and a diamond and i think she will be 4 down?|pg||
nt|pelu: in CR the bidding - as u can see by pointing on contract: 1@H and 3@H by West - 3Nt and NS never found the @S-suit in bidding|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: except pratap-gordon's teammates were +100|pg||
nt|lml: right|pg||
nt|pelu: not the best defense - but never mind - +Imps for NS|pg||
nt|lml: so the spec who said 7 iimps got it right if they do go 4 down|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: extracts @D9 and puts it back|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk1: England leading now. Scotland only 11 ahead against Wales; that is 16-14 VP|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Well done by Hrólfur|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mgb81: yep GIB backs me up|pg||

nt|athene: maybe the moral of the story is, don't go raising partner with a doubleton|pg||
nt|Walddk1: It does not matter much what happens at this table from now on. It is being decided in the Scotland-Wales match|pg||
nt|steshome:  Aye <waves a daffodil>|pg||
nt|mgb81: Yes <waves a leek>|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Poetry in motion|pg||
nt|hawe45: A @H-contract now, possibly|pg||
nt|dima:  Pretty strong set for NS so far - that 4@h on N8 was a bit of a stretch but could have also made|pg||
nt|iceak:  4@s or 5@d seems|pg||
nt|psyck: I would probably have hesitated a bit on 4@h, & having hesitated, bid 4@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: East did not hesitate much, anyway we are playing on screens|pg||
nt|psyck: aah, ok thx|pg||
nt|friggi: sure it was|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but 3@h - 3nt or a direct 3nt was a winning decision (-1 in 3nt)|pg||
nt|lml: the last 4 boards have been rather unpleasant for Gordon.  They obviously need to play faster|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: aker apologizes for something, gordon asks about pratap's hand, richter shakes his head|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: gordon once again asks to confirm the score.  seems to forget the hand as soon as it's back in the board|pg||
nt|Walddk5: scores of all matches after 1st segment   http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2011/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof16|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: bah|pg||
mb|1C|nt|sybarra: nice 4 @H  likely makng +1 for e/w|pg||
nt|hawe45: The @S 10 in East is the only card to defeat 7 @H, but also a @S-lead kills it|pg||
nt|hawe45: Black squeeze against West|pg||
nt|friggi: Hrólfur is a very good player|pg||
nt|glen: exactly, 4@H right away at least makes NS wonder if W shapely|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: save in 4 @S?  a trick in every suit  |pg||
nt|psyck: then yes, W cold consider 4@s|pg||
nt|psyck: *could|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm still placing the blame on E|pg||
nt|psyck: me too :)|pg||
nt|psyck: 5@d for EW, not easy to get to|pg||
mb|r|nt|mgb81: in the event of a tie....is it the head to head match that counts? |pg||
nt|santyclz: Doubt n-s will get into the auction.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: club ruffs|pg||
nt|hawe45: Now East can really "disturb" the slam-bidding|pg||
nt|sybarra: here is that bid again |pg||
nt|henryb:  another hand (see board 1) where 3N is best despite the void|pg||
nt|sybarra: 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|pelu: do they have 10 min for 4 boards?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk1: Investigating|pg||
nt|athene: spade lead very costly in the other room|pg||
nt|hawe45: But the more E/W bid @D, the more South will be happy for partners values - showed in controls allready|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Well, East seems to think that 2@D was a takeout of @Ds!|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Yet another slam possibly|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: I did not note the time when director announced 45 min|pg||
nt|ralfwil: even 5 peter|pg||
nt|dinos1: 3@c? or 2?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what does 3@C by west mean at this point instead of 1@S|pg||
mb|3C|nt|sybarra: multi,  then 3 @c weak with hts, etc to 4|pg||
nt|peachy: 2H by E might have caused more problems than 2D|pg||
nt|hawe45: Good practical bid by South|pg||
nt|cuttysark: The one we just saw has been flattened|pg||
nt|psyck: but it also depends on their preemptive style|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: after 2nt they are likely to end in 4@H the same in here|pg||
nt|athene: then east just has to lead a diamond rather than a spade|pg||
nt|sybarra: right, didnt notice the club ruffs|pg||
nt|ralfwil: more than 20 minutes ago|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: nominal schedule says 1000-1210 for this quarter|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a kind of mini michaels ?!|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphzdh: I actually wondered if he would open 6@H|pg||
nt|sybarra: S 2 @S looked like a 2 suited (tartan type) bid |pg||
nt|iceak:  no reason to find play to loose 2 trump tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: some call it Muiderberg|pg||
nt|sybarra: tartan's are 5/5  and muiderberg can be 5/4+  |pg||
nt|glen: i actually like a jamming 3@H (preemptive) over the XX |pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Many play 3@c to be good w/@hs.|pg||
nt|hawe45: @D-lead - let´s see Søvar make the overtrick - but he will probably put his money on a @C-finesse. But with spectators, one is obliged to make the squeeze|pg||
nt|sybarra: I guess 2 @H says nothing about hts? |pg||
nt|friggi: sure it is|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Not sure, but I think 1NT asks for controls (A = 2, K = 1)  2@D showing 3|pg||
nt|dinos1: thk weak MM's|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: cards fit well for EW here|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Sequences over the mult-strong-meaning 2@C must be quite complex|pg||
nt|ady: south using evasive action   intending to pass any reply to stayman|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdh: Claim on a @C finesse|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sybarra: sorry strong with hts|pg||
nt|psyck: compare this with the deal 9 2@c opening :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Yes, this one is quite more normal|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm 5@d better - depends on lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however, the auction was practical |pg||
nt|fabsayc: disadvantage is it allows north to double, so maybe 3@H better|pg||
pc|h7|nt|psyck: pther table did not bother to investigate grand on deal 9 either|pg||
nt|friggi: they should reach 6@S|pg||
nt|glen: back in the land of 9 tricks|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|psyck: right|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and who needs a spade stopper if (a) the suit is 4-4 and (b) they don't lead one? |pg||
nt|dinos1: not 9, more :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mgb81: I am told that Maida Grant has just found the onlylead to beat a game against Wales that her team-mates missed|pg||
nt|athene: there's surely a good case for just bidding 4@H over 2nt with that north hand?|pg||
nt|mgb81: so it might be 6 to Scotland instead of a possible 10 to Wales|pg||
nt|ady: this looks down 1  on top   I think n/s will be happy to conceed 50|pg||
nt|ady: have we got stuck?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|steshome:  Checking back for the 4-4 spade fit - might play better|pg||
nt|sybarra: Isak (our operator) is doing a great job of showing the alerts |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Indeed he is :) It's a fiddly process, but maybe he knows ahen they are coming|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Wonder if they have worked out who is on lead yet|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think he would agree, you get used to it as operator|pg||
nt|henryb:  standard transfer auction|pg||
nt|kemperg: in the wrong hand then:(|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 3@D possibly showed @D control, which slows South down|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vugraphzdh: This is why I like to lead a low trump from quack doubleton :)|pg||
nt|friggi: yes - must be|pg||
nt|pelu: 15 boards - normal time id 15 x 7,5 + 15 min for the screens = 128 min|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: auction is correct.  sorry for the glitch while checking the web page|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|mgb81: Here North south employ a common treatment whereby 3S is forcing with 4 spades and 4 or 6 hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk1: No one seems to know how they break a tie. I asked 5 'competent' people|pg||
nt|dima:  next case|pg||
nt|sybarra: need take the club or they dont get it|pg||
nt|dima:  might try to steal a heart trick but if it must be 5-5 then unlikely to work|pg||
nt|warrens:  a reasonabl play by North, hoping to pitch 2 @H's from dummy on his clubs if this held|pg||
nt|ady: now worried about losing 3 heart tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: lot of thinking about defense|pg||
nt|pelu: so 130 min is sceduled = still 15 min|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: @ST shows J or shortness|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: aker corrects himself: when dummy shows strong balanced hand leads are standard|pg||
nt|pelu: play @D in trick 2 = 12 tricks|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: someone tell gordon or we'll be here all day|pg||
nt|lml: :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: sitting back with his arms crossed|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|warrens:  oops|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mgb81: with 5H and 4S north bids 3H waiting to hear a 4 card spade suit from south|pg||

nt|cuttysark: But remembers some of his partner's opening bids|pg||
nt|henryb:  5@d is actually pretty good: needs either 2-2 @d and @c not worse than 4-2 or 3-3 clubs and @d not worse than 3-1|pg||
nt|friggi: now 10 tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so bye bye the clubs|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sybarra: clubs 3/3 will make this on easy for declarer |pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: EW are both wearing wristwatches - common practice in top-level events where cellphones are disallowed - but I have not noticed either of them checking the time|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra: (an @D 2/2)|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|santyclz: A good hand to play slowly.|pg||
nt|dinos1: 5@c2@s1@h1@d|pg||
nt|glen: given declarer knocks out @C ace first|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and no entry, depends on timing however|pg||
nt|dinos1: what else shd he do?|pg||
nt|glen: it depends on the CD|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: cohen moves CK, C6 to one end of his hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he has a losing option, if the aces were reversed in NS|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: same motif as the slam where he claimed early|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: asks for silverstein's CC, asks about leads from all small|pg||
nt|dinos1: he cant make if A's reverse - cant cash @sQ|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: @S4,@S3 might be from 9432 or similar holding|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mgb81: There are 2 boards left to score in the Wales match and Scotland lead by 2 imps I believe|pg||
nt|sybarra: it always works that way when you are NOT in game |pg||

pc|cK|pc|c9|pg||

pc|c6|nt|henryb:  Perhaps N might have doubled 1N -- then if S found 3@d over 2@s North could envision the game|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: South commented when he saw dummy - passed 1NT?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unlucky|pg||
nt|psyck: low to q was surely the % play|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|cuttysark: Yes, I think double would show the extra strength, but not convinced he would reach 5@D even if partner volunteered a bid|pg||

nt|vugraphzdh: Way too fast for me|pg||
nt|iceak:  end in 4@h - but risky|pg||
nt|sybarra: and that's a claim |pg||
nt|henryb:  now when both follow to the first @d S can claim|pg||
nt|kemperg: Why not @HQ instead ot @S ruff:(|pg||
nt|santyclz: Tapped himself out.  Might have saved a tap by winning the 1st @h in hand.|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|pelu: low IMP-score - but only 2 flat boards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap's cough drop has worn off|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap: sorry, nothing is going right.  gordon: don't worry about it.  pratap: not worrying about it.  I didn't make the right play|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: donn: hard to blame you|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: silverstein points out that he could be thrown in for the overtrick|pg||
mb|1C|nt|henryb:  4@s is easy with the good fit and good splits|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: E-W probably end in 3nt or 5@C here|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Allthough West would like to play against 2@H doubled|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: that's a view|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: oh the board is wrong|pg||
mb|1N|nt|xenya: they might overbid here|pg||
nt|ady: n/s hav e a play for 3NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, @SQ lead was obviously a sequence. Hard to make any inferences apart from that |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: OK, will fix the names|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: director makes sure we're on pace to finish on time|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: vul!|pg||
nt|santyclz: I think we can all agree with that discription of 2nt...|pg||
nt|psyck: W has a practical 3N bid, but E may want to show his @c |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 3@H from West here might promise a good @S raise, so 3NT is a likely bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: gordon asks about 1@C, aker writes detailed answer|pg||
nt|lml: 1@S or some kind of michaels now?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: @C or 12-14 bal or 18-20 any shape|pg||
nt|glen: N's bid depends on the NS light style of opening or not|pg||
nt|glen: if you shrunk the S name to Roth, N would double|pg||
nt|fabsayc: cohen could get ambitious with his hand|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mgb81: I think that doesnt take into acocunt the 1vo slow play fine does it sarah?|pg||
nt|iceak:  4@s sry|pg||
nt|jbennet: tricky hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: director: "five minutes"|pg||
nt|psyck: low to Q was % assuming no other considerations|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: board was placed incorrectly onto tray|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: 1vp*|pg||
nt|ady: this might lead to 4@H|pg||
mb|2D|nt|psyck: in which case they could get overboard as Vladamir suggests|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@C = @Cs or balanced 12-14 or 18-20 - If balanced any shape in minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbennet: good methos need to find the superious 3NT.|pg||
nt|sybarra: sort of a 10 count |pg||
nt|cuttysark: A bit of an upgrade by East for his 6-4 distribution|pg||
nt|sybarra: with the single @D |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: propably counting loosing tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, inclined to agree. South has long spades (North bid 1NT), therefore likely to be shorter in hearts than North  |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 2D = one major|pg||
mb|2S|an|5, INV|nt|jbennet: methods are:..|pg||
nt|iceak:  how strong is E?|pg||
nt|jbennet: 2NT= "i have a weak doubleton"|pg||
nt|pelu: u were too fast for me, John, :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 19   but 2NT might have worked out better |pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Looks like NS play weak NT first seat? |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Yes. Hard to stay away from hopeless 3NT here|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 4@S might make. Possibly 4@H|pg||
nt|hawe45: Good bidding might lead to 4 ! h - also down|pg||
nt|dima:  11-13|pg||
nt|sybarra: club system e/w |pg||
nt|jbennet: 3 clubs asks: "where"|pg||
nt|psyck: no @d cue meaning they should not crosss 5@c level|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|psyck: but with the @c break...|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: The fact that North did not double 4@H might help South on the lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: sometimes the players let me read their explanation pads, sometimes not|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: wolfson whispers: "mildly invitational", cohen:"he's probably got 14, never seen him refuse"|pg||
nt|glen: a popular style for experts, stayman, then 2@S as an invite|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: Stephen, can we leave the table open for confirmed results, please?|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: ok|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe W should not have raised with a purely defensive hand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Running scores at  http://www.bridge.is/meistarastig/20102011/magiccontest.htm  |pg||
nt|psyck: MultiLandy/Woolsey style 2@d|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: donn tried to lead from the wrong side|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: before window was lifted.  this board giving everyone vertigo|pg||
pc|d6|nt|santyclz: So both significant swings so far have gone against Vestri.  |pg||
nt|hawe45: 4 @H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: more ancient than nearly any living player|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: how ancient is Stayman itself?  1940s?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: seems like half the ACBL membership is older than Stayman|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jbennet: "3NT i have weak doubleton in clubs"|pg||
nt|dima:  One might need mirrors to make this one|pg||
nt|psyck: so play 4@hx as do not lead @h|pg||
nt|psyck: *some...|pg||
nt|pelu: some pairs use 2@D here to let W decide|pg||
pc|dT|nt|vugraphzdh: South now knows about 2-2 in @Cs|pg||
nt|hawe45: 4 @S can make 620 - "can"|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: And he actually knows that 4@D is most likely the "right spot"|pg||
nt|hawe45: 4 @S is he right spot|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: But vulnerable at IMPS he will guess some game|pg||
nt|dima:  ok one problem solved|pg||
nt|iceak:  first problem solved|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|peachy: I would rather try a Moysian than 4D|pg||
nt|jbennet: OK then ; then 4 major is no longer an option. EK stiff oppsite xx creates too many loseres in 4 major.|pg||
nt|sybarra: lead is helpful |pg||
nt|henryb:  well worth 10-12|pg||
nt|cuttysark: North hoping that South has the singleton|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Aðalsteinn is world champion from Yokohama 1991|pg||
nt|psyck: oh well|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|sQ|nt|mgb81: Declarer made a unusual play when she ducked the club lead in both hands|pg||
nt|peachy: if ten tricks are makeable some way|pg||
nt|hawe45: Why did South NOT support partners 3 @S - instead of bidding what he had allready showed|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Well bid by N-S I think|pg||
nt|lml: still I think 2@H will likely make|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|mgb81: had she ducked the second club from dummy she would have made 2 tricks which would have been enough. as it is a spade switch will lead her to down one I think|pg||
nt|cuttysark: As are his pair in the other room, I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: right you are McGowan|pg||
nt|sybarra: this was the team that was the surprise winner |pg||
nt|psyck: quite normal to see a lot of overbidding in the final stages i guess, they even got to 6@hx OR in the 5@hx-2 deal |pg||
pc|sA|nt|peachy: After AK clubs located and now SK, the HQ will not be hard to locate as with opening hand, E likely would have said something on 1D|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: South has no reason to think that @S are better than @H, the @H fit is actually much better|pg||
nt|ady: dont exit wirh small spade|pg||
nt|santyclz: Lovely suit for a vul overcall.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: director peeks in, frowns, departs|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sybarra: W is likely to take the @H hook |pg||
nt|iceak:  No reason to do othervise|pg||
nt|jbennet: so if playong a good system, EW reaches 3 NT which is as everybody can see.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: thanks to all of you who've stayed with us|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Vugraphzfd: goren leaning over dummy|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap calls for heart and has second thoughts when he sees @H7|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: cohen asks if 1C-(1NT)-2C is natural, silverstein nods yes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: probably a heart now to force defense to do something helpful|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: wolfson leans back, hands behind his head, watching me type|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: then yawns deeply|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: long tournament, grueling schedule, only just begun|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|h2|nt|Walddk1: Unofficially, we have a tie now. Scotland winning by 11 IMPs, just enough for 17-13 VPs|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Exciting|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|santyclz: I'd be tempted to double finesse the @ss on the auction.|pg||
nt|psyck: As Stefan suggested, S got the lead right|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ady: even then could not make|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lml: thanks :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: chorus of beeping clocks|pg||
nt|lml: thanks|pg||
pc|s7|nt|hawe45: Might be right, but WHY did´nt North bid 4 @H himself, South brought no new info|pg||
nt|psyck: easier in 6 than 5 though|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: This will not be pretty|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: In 6 the ace of @D lead stands out|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Holding a likely trump trick|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|sybarra: I wonder if you would |pg||
nt|sybarra: the lead was an obvious singleton |pg||
nt|glen: not too too grueling, 60 boards a day, often 6 person teams|pg||
nt|dinos1: @cA - low @h|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: often. but NS 4handed|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|pc|h4|nt|jbennet: far better than 4 spades.|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|santyclz: So putting n on lead is no danger.|pg||
nt|dinos1: in case E has 5-5|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Walddk1: For newcomers ....|pg||
pc|h9|nt|psyck: 2 trumps as it turned out|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|pg||
nt|glen: even with half the players older than Stayman, can still play 45 boards a day|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk1: Unofficially, we have a tie now. Scotland winning by 11 IMPs, just enough for 17-13 VPs|pg||
nt|sybarra: unless S had and entry|pg||
pc|d8|nt|pelu: they are now on last board in OR - so also late there|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: has aker pinpointed or concealed position of @SQ and @DK?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: they lead 2nd from sequences so @DK seems marked in N|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with souths defense, E should realise that trumps are not so well placed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap in no hurry|pg||
nt|lml: hoping for clock to run out?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: director patrias returns to look on disapprovingly|pg||

mb|p|nt|hawe45: 8 tricks on a @S-lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Hard to say, if declarer goes for @Cs, he's doomed.|pg||
nt|dima:  Karl is feeling well now :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 1@H 4+|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks forcing, if South felt inclined to bid over it - ah, may have a longer minor |pg||
nt|psyck: re Ed|pg||
nt|othered1: oh, just possible canape -- idea being that partner with a fit and maximum pass may try for game.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: with 100 for honours in spades? a 14 count and two suits wide open?|pg||
nt|hawe45: Undo, pls|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: donn whispered something to pratap about whether 1@H could be passed but I didn't hear the full sentence|pg||
nt|glen: 3NT could be quite wrong on some layouts|pg||
pc|c5|nt|cuttysark: Thin intervention by North, looks likely -1|pg||
nt|psyck: Malning will be inching towards the 4th spot maybe|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: silverstein: "good hand" as he puts it down|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not the most delicate auction, NS seem to resolve all close decisions in favour of 3nt|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mgb81: yes its so bad!|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H should make    3NT easier|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: looks roughly like a 1nt overcall to me, but ok|pg||
nt|hawe45: Small @H now = only hope|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|jbennet: but if souths now signs off then North should respect that.|pg||
nt|iceak:  Sees @d fit|pg||
nt|sybarra: he did have 15  (but flattish)|pg||
nt|henryb:  If he had kept quiet would have gone plus defending 1N|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|dima:  Is 2@s GF or only RF?|pg||
nt|dima:  Ok answered|pg||
nt|jbennet: 2NT was probably telling "i am week"|pg||
nt|kemperg: still wins 3 imps|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hawe45: @D now to the Jack - and SMALL!!! from North = best defence|pg||
nt|hawe45: But as the @H´s are cleared, normal defence also works|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
nt|jbennet: north respected it.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: With both opponents bidding it is quite dangerous, but then you have to remember what they bid on|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Grant is reigning team champions in Iceland |pg||
nt|henryb:  indeed, but sometimes silence is golden|pg||
nt|xenya: but it was Malning who went 4 off...|pg||
pc|h5|nt|psyck: oops yes|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|santyclz: Best defense would seem 500.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
nt|iceak:  SparisjÃ³Ã°ur lost 11 on 11 by playing 5@d instead of 4@s|pg||
nt|jbennet: on a bad day even 3 D is -1|pg||
nt|iceak:  2NT was most surely showing a weak hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: West has to find a @D switch now, which is far from obvious|pg||
nt|friggi: right|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphzdh: The ship has sailed for Málning. Probably making 10 tricks in a partscore on this board|pg||
nt|psyck: W surely had an invite|pg||
nt|psyck: A & intermediaries|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|santyclz: Cash 4 @cs and exit with @ha, @h.|pg||
nt|ady: 1 spade loser    the other spade goes on the 4th diamond |pg||
pc|c2|nt|mgb81: anyway ns have come to rest in a partscore|pg||
nt|peachy: crucial moment|pg||
nt|iceak:  3@d would have been GF and strong|pg||
nt|glen: some expert partnerships play 2NT over 2@H as forcing, since 2NT rarely exactly right spot|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|santyclz: Wd.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: GT can afford to lose by 23 IMPs and still win the championship, regardless of how Sparisjodur fares. 2 boards to go after this|pg||
nt|friggi: luck|pg||
nt|kemperg: still 1 off|pg||
nt|friggi: yes|pg||
nt|kemperg: @D start would have helped|pg||
nt|friggi: sure it would have done|pg||
pc|h9|pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|mgb81: south can lay a top club|pg||
nt|mgb81: and its one down|pg||
nt|mgb81: if she goes for disvcards west ruffs and cashes the heart so thats 2 down i think|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Don't go too far away, specs. Stephen will come back with the official results when the teams have scored up. Should not be long|pg||
pc|h6|nt|henryb:  When Kitty decided she wanted to become a better player, I told her to practice saying pass for ten minutes every morning|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s5|nt|lml: I like not overruffing in this position|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: had @H7 half an inch out then folded his cards again|pg||
nt|pelu: harder on @C-lead - as in OR|pg||
nt|lml: the @H7 seems right.  |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: voices from hallway as other matches compare|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: aker busy at the table again, can't sit still, talking silently to himself|pg||
nt|lml: at this point whatever south does the spade position will be more or less known|pg||
nt|chessmaste: A club lead ducked by North gives declarer every chance to go wrong|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|h7|pc|c8|pc|s8|pc|s7|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Just pitch the heart now|pg||
nt|lml: throw another heart aker...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: moved @HJ to the end of his hand, took a deep breath, moved his chair closer to table|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lml: then you control trump|pg||
nt|lml: nice defence|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Well done|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sybarra: N will still get tucked in |pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|pg||
nt|hawe45: Endplay North|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: North kept all the @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Threw a @S|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sybarra: that was the exit  that did |pg||
pc|d9|nt|cuttysark: You have rendered us speechless|pg||
pc|dK|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|mgb81: Thanks everyone for watching|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphzaw: thnx all|pg||
nt|steshome:  Just a reminder to spectators that we are keeping this table open for confirmed results|pg||
nt|mgb81: A little spillage at the end but still a convincing win for England and the title. |pg||
nt|Walddk1: Joined title likely|pg||
nt|dburn: or at any rate half of it|pg||
nt|athene: i thought it was likely a tie?|pg||
nt|athene: right|pg||
nt|dburn: we believe so|pg||
nt|eamongall: England will win because of the direct match|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Cut the trophy into two, nothing else to do|pg||
nt|steshome:  I don't think it's ever been tied before - what do you think David?|pg||
nt|highshore: don't England win on a split|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  regulation say 'Where there is a tie in Victory Points both teams receive the award for winning.'|pg||
nt|dburn: there is no split tie - the trophy is jointly held|pg||
nt|Walddk1: No Eamon, we found the tie-break in the regulations|pg||
nt|mgb81: Well even if its officially a tie, England feel like the winners as they beat Scotland in the head to head match.|pg||
nt|athene: well, just take half from each word - take the "ENG" from england and the "LAND" from scotland|pg||
nt|athene: put them together|pg||
nt|eamongall: ok there is no split tie .. ENGSCOT win the lady milne |pg||
nt|Walddk1: No, never a tie in the LM, England and Scotland tied twice in the Camrose|pg||
nt|highshore: whatever the result nice to have it go to the wire|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: Seems to be confirmed as a tie...thnx all|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Yes, the most exciting finish for as long as I can recall|pg||
nt|mamos: which table was fined for slow play ?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: wolfson: that too?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|pef: we're about to start the final board of this set.  play will resume in about 25 minutes from now.  my thanks to fellow commentators roberto and joe|pg||
mb|1D|an|unbal; 5+ diam or 4-4-4-1|nt|santyclz: Another of everybody's favorite contract/|pg||
nt|ybob: thx all :)|pg||
nt|pef: and to bbo and the usbf for making this all possible.  also special thanks to Roland Wald for yeoman work in organizing the commentary|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2D|nt|pef: in the closed room, south passed in third seat (which I think is a little strange).  and west got to play 1nt on a heart lead for a very good result|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Weinstein knows Garner likely have 5 diamonds, so choses to raise|pg||
mb|d|nt|santyclz: Special thanks to Joe Stokes our magnificent vg operator.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: here n/s are almost certain to go plus so the match may swing again to a slight lead for wolfson|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ybob: 3@C  p p p , lead ? trump works fine ...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pef: cards lie very well for n/s, poorly for e/w.  3c appears to be down 1, |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: an adjustment likely on 43 (to down 1)|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||

nt|henryb:  It worked|pg||
nt|henryb:  as you know|pg||
nt|ady: is this session 16 hands?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: yes|pg||
nt|pelu: decl missed the chance - sh take 1 more @h|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: director called "find your places please" for second segment.  not sure when this match will resume|pg||
nt|mdgraham: last board. Excellent operating, John|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: director announces ten minutes so we will get our full session break|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: silverstein: can you bid 2NT? it's not quantitative|pg||
nt|glen: no double digit swings this set - good bridge but not dramatic|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: to cohen: the hand we play 2NT forcing for|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: did we skip 14?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdh: Yes, missing 14|pg||
nt|jbennet: well after 1 NT opening; 1 should should be able to find 44 fit in majors|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok |pg||
nt|dima:  BOOM!|pg||
nt|jbennet: but still be able to choose 3NT.|pg||
nt|jbennet: stupid bid.|pg||
nt|iceak:  But bid at both tables|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Well, it is very hard to teach the scorpion not to bite|pg||
nt|jbennet: we all hate to be preempted.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: thank you. and thanks all for joining us|pg||
nt|psyck: Thanks Mike & Ed.  Very good job John.  Thanks to the kibs for joinnig us.|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: looks like 4M both ways|pg||
mb|1N|nt|henryb:  that is a brave double by Bjarni|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@c now|pg||
nt|glen: ok, they are just saying that since they looked at my 2NT comment|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: I would say 7@H sacrifices are dramatic|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Or not|pg||
nt|pelu: and I am signed up for Nickell nexi match - no time for tea :(:(|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: Welcome everyone to the final set of the Lady Milne|pg||
nt|mgb81: the current score as we just saw see Scotland only 1VP ahead of England|pg||
nt|mgb81: so there is literally everything to play for|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Hello Sarah, Michael and Bill|pg||
nt|mgb81: here north has made an inverted minor suit raise and south indicated a weak no trump hand|pg||
nt|steshome:  Hello Roland! |pg||
nt|mgb81: north might be thinking of a slam, but even the 5 level might be too high.|pg||
nt|sybarra: now S has to make it |pg||
nt|iceak:  SparisjÃ³Ã°ur seems to be winning back|pg||
nt|jbennet: very well put. |pg||
nt|henryb:  I would not find it|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Lebesohl, probably the first step in showing 4hearts and game values|pg||
nt|kemperg: 10 tricks in OR, much|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: on a club lead however |pg||
nt|dima:  no play|pg||
nt|jbennet: everybody has a "reptile brain" ; which is governed by emotions not by common sense and judgement|pg||
nt|sybarra: you put it more succinctly dima|pg||
nt|iceak:  9 tricks|pg||
nt|jbennet: if one should randomize a lareg number of layouts consistent with south:s opening bid.|pg||
nt|dima:  N does have a touching trust in his partner's suit quality preempt, but still 4@s is unLAWful and will lose IMPs here|pg||
nt|jbennet: then everybody would find that to enter with 4H is a huge huge losing bid..|pg||
nt|sybarra: could get very ugly if he goes up with K|pg||
nt|dima:  you have 8 trumps , opponents rate to have at most 9 so ..|pg||
nt|jbennet: and 4 spades was also a stupid action.|pg||
nt|iceak:  No reason to go up with K|pg||
nt|dima:  It could be from Q87 or so he preys ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: South is a very solid citizen, so North definately imagined 4@S as a rather good contract|pg||
nt|jbennet: but again the "repitle brain" caused a losing call. |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: "Only" needing the ace of @C with the 4@H bidder|pg||
nt|jbennet: yes but if now 4 spades makes.|pg||
nt|jbennet: the 4 h is surely likely to be 3 off at least.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: But a double seems to stand out at IMPs. Collecting a safe 300-800, instead of a 50% 620|pg||
nt|dima:  How in the world do you come to 10 tricks? Even opposite AK10xxxx + side King you need more then ONLY Ace onside|pg||
nt|othered1: Thanks all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@S is (probably) one of those things that has to be done|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mgb81: a misguess in spades is all it takes to go one down, as the two discards are useless to the south hand|pg||
nt|mgb81: ah thats a practical shot|pg||
nt|sybarra: alerfted leb |pg||
nt|sybarra: *alerted |pg||
nt|psyck: only 3 levels lower than other room|pg||
nt|glen: yes, but you did not entry any 7@H bids in this set|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: no, the action was at the other table where Weinstein came in on the 5-5 over 2@C|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|henryb:  slow shows the major. fast denies the major|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: That was peaceful|pg||
nt|santyclz: This is the penultimate deal of the event.  Thanks to the Icelandic Bridge Federation, particularly Olof for allowing us to visit here.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks to our operator, Stefan Jonsson, great job!|pg||
nt|lml: it will be fun to watch though|pg||
nt|pelu: yes|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sybarra: this is penultimate bd of this set |pg||
nt|santyclz: N didn't find that lovely @c preempt and e-w got to 6@s-1 for Vestri's 1st big score.|pg||
nt|sybarra: told you .... |pg||
nt|sybarra: was playing to make it |pg||
nt|jbennet: but bidding is a sort of "alfa male" action.|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 3NT perfectly makeable, but scary|pg||
nt|henryb:  a treatment invented (or at least first shown to me) by Helgemo|pg||
nt|cuttysark: If you were sure that you wanted to play in 3NT you would bid it right away|pg||
nt|henryb:  in contrast to showing the stopper|pg||
nt|sybarra: will E make one more try? |pg||
nt|henryb:  No, bidding 3N directly (in this method) says I do not have hearts|pg||
nt|cuttysark: West has his think: if @CKJ were @CA slam is cold|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Aðalsteinn seems to be in pain|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I mean East (sorry)|pg||
nt|henryb:  get him a couple of Tylenol|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Is that a variant of lebensohl too?|pg||
nt|henryb:  yes. Instead of "slow shows a stopper" it is "Slow shows the other major"|pg||
nt|henryb:  stopper is shown by whether you bid 3N or cue bid|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|nt|ady: routine 4@S    on a lucky day could make 6    |pg||
nt|warrens:  this can make 6 with everything working|pg||
nt|pelu: here 4@S on @HK - prob "fast" down 1|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: director watching seems to have hurried gordon a little|pg||
nt|othered1: Their style announced on system sheet owns up to very aggressive 1-level defensive actions and that's one of them, suit-wise|pg||
nt|psyck: You can see all the results here in a while: http://www.usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2011/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof16|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Gordon staring at the tray|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
nt|mgb81: One of the kibbitzers has suggested north might raise to 4NT, but if souths bid 6NT with something like KQJx, KJx, J10xx, Kx there will be a small problem in the ace department|pg||
nt|sybarra: that is disapointment |pg||
nt|mdgraham: little tester for West|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|nt|peachy: 2NT is often played in this auction as "two places to play"|pg||
nt|psyck: 1 level higher than the other room, but unlikely that anyone was getting any higher|pg||
nt|henryb:  when W shows 0 or 3, will E think W has 3?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks to my co-commentators, Fridrik Vigfusson and Germ Kemper.|pg||
nt|lml: nothing has been fast but nice try|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ianmcc: @s now?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Or @c?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Horrible bidding by E-W leads to a horrible contract :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: which (imho) he has failed  - double must be PENALTIES |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|peachy: hehe, NS have 4H|pg||
nt|peachy: as the cards lie|pg||
nt|henryb:  sorry, 1 or 4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East being a passed hand or not|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sybarra: (the 5 @D ibid showing 1 or 4 so can only be 1  key card|pg||
nt|henryb:  and he knows not 4|pg||
nt|psyck: Rabbi's will make the rest|pg||
nt|psyck: by dropping the kingleton|pg||
nt|friggi: ditto Joe:)|pg||
nt|kemperg: How do you find the time to give all that comments Stefan, I am impressed|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks to BBO for providing this platform and Roland Wald who works tirelessly to manage these vg sessions. |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap shakes his head, leans back in his chair|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this is getting out of control|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|warrens:  on  board 10 at the other table, they bid 7@S! in their 5-2 fit!|pg||
nt|ady: thats unbelievable|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk1: I have Scotland and England tied on 88 VPs before the last 16 boards|pg||
nt|ianmcc: now 9|pg||
nt|psyck: Yes, Stefan was doing that in earlier sessions too, he is great :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: probably wondering where the partnership desk is|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: donn: my lead? pratap: yeah it's your lead, I never bid clubs|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: last board of the set.  next segment scheduled 10 after the hour|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|peachy: The ace just could not be right|pg||
nt|pelu: down 2 now|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphzdh: N-S actually made 4@H in the open room !|pg||
nt|friggi: Stefán has many "hands"|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Can you confirm, Simon?|pg||
nt|iceak:  if from 78Q - loosing 1@s and 2@c|pg||
nt|kemperg: thank you all and also the specs |pg||
nt|santyclz: And finally thanks to you, the kibs, who drive the whole process.|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|nt|peachy: difficult with such a trump break and a side ace to dislodge|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Declarer is rather lucky to make from now on|pg||
nt|santyclz: Nice of them to provide a nothing hand for me to put out all those.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|pelu: too fast play :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: just as well declarer can't take the spade finesse|pg||

pc|d8|nt|lml: not this way though|pg||
mc|7|nt|fabsayc: an improbable diamond lead might have beaten this board|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: cohen checks what board the other table is on and what happened on the 6@S hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: table will remain open until the other room finishes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: thanks to our operator, John|pg||
nt|glen: thanks John!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: OK, other table has finished.  closing down.  clocks just beeped for end of this segment.  restart should be in 10-15 minutes|pg||
