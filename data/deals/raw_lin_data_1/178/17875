mb|p|mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: Fallenius did start with strong 2@C -- bet he gets same bad splits as Madala|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@S=0-3@S|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S t/o without spades and x would be 4+ (some play specifically 4-5) spades|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: secondly it gives responder more choice, especially with short club opener|pg||

pc|d5|nt|athene: i think you bid 3@H here|pg||
pc|d4|nt|pef: the -100 score on the previous board was obviously wrong|pg||

mb|1S|mb|2S!|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|mwigor: some people play that Michaels (2@s) is weak or strong - if so this hand might fit in that gap - i usually find its better to make a bid which describes your hand in one go|pg||
