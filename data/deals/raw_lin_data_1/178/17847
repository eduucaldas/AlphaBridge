nt|cuttysark: But this East has made a dangerous lead - the diamond in the other room led to an untroubled -1|pg||
nt|patricck: Quite a poor game, but the bidding is reasonable. The club lead gives declarer a chance to hope for a 3-3 @H break and take a @D pitch|pg||

nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: I suspect the 4 @H making last hand (b 14) may be the match in one hand|pg||

nt|patricck: several lines of play possible I guess, but they all work|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|nt|santyclz: Now is, of course, the time that the finesses work and suits break, since you're down before you get in.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pjs_ch: the 2@S bid tempted East too much; there is a desire nto to pass 1@S in case partner has a big hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: twas ever thus|pg||

pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||

nt|roswolf: excitement in the other room|pg||
nt|patricck: Spiders from Mars went radioactive in both rooms .....  sounds like a movie title doesn't it?|pg||
nt|sybarra: it does |pg||
nt|sybarra: almost looks like BAM teams here|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: THIS IS GOING HIGH NOW|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch: that's quite a roubst heart suit East is hiding, in an effort to get the hand strength across|pg||
mb|2S|nt|roswolf: can east find a double|pg||
nt|sybarra: just like the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: so far |pg||
nt|othered1: do you play a cue-bid by north as 2-suited or just a to double with a void (the latter my preference)?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|roswolf: i would pass this double too|pg||
nt|sybarra: you have to but hate open W hand |pg||
mb|p|nt|pjs_ch: That's a nice treat !|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|santyclz: That sequence used to show about 16hcp 6331 - back in the middle ages.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|roswolf: it os not game|pg||
nt|sybarra: and the same |pg||
nt|patricck: seems like 4 losers, 2@H, 1@S, 1@D and the A@C pitch isn't good enough to lose any of them|pg||
nt|othered1: 4 apparant losers here, but north may have a way to save a trick, especially with knowing that east has all the high cards|pg||
nt|othered1: Maybe 3 immediate rounds of @D would do|pg||
nt|patricck: endplayed with the Q@D perhaps to lead another club or a spade|pg||
nt|othered1: or trump, all of which seem to cost a trick|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pjs_ch: This is the downside of 1@C opening on balanced hands - partner may failt o recognise when |pg||
nt|pjs_ch: you really have clubs|pg||
pc|c7|nt|patricck: mission impossible for declarer here|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer in fine form|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm insurance no doubt but 5the clue is in pards 2@S i think -this suggests some defence|pg||
nt|othered1: Not sure that was the best discard from north's hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is he takes the spade finess |pg||
pc|h7|nt|roswolf: he would have jumped to 3@S or more WITH NO DEFENCE|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|sybarra: oh well we are all wrong|pg||
nt|othered1: still has action against east|pg||
nt|othered1: certainly a reasonable trump play, north wants east on lead and west just might have j10|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h2|nt|pjs_ch: the spade make 6 tricks and the top diamonds will generate one more|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|sybarra: last hand for this match,   |pg||
nt|sybarra: we will be back in about 1/2 if schedule is correct |pg||
nt|sybarra: 35 min per the schedule|pg||
nt|sybarra: and good defense  also |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|patricck: not the best opening it is true, but hard to pass AAK|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dA|pg||
pc|hK|pc|c3|pc|h9|nt|patricck: Aces are worth 4 and a half for me :)|pg||

pc|s4|nt|sybarra: this is last hand of this set |pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: we are due back at half after the hour |pg||
nt|othered1: nicely done|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|sybarra: however, we started early on this set |pg||
nt|sybarra: and likely same again  so dont give up seats |pg||
nt|sybarra: my best guess is up again in about 20 min |pg||
nt|sybarra: my money is on quarter after the hour :)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|pc|sK|pc|s7|pg||
nt|sybarra: and the @D is good etc|pg||
pc|s5|nt|roswolf: bye for now|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sA|pc|sQ|pg||
mc|10|nt|othered1: In a reasonable field, 10 tricks in @H would be relatively normal, even if card-by-card play might differ|pg||
