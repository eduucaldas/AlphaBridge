mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|poohbear: 5@d?|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: no|pg||
nt|poohbear: 5@c|pg||
mb|p|pc|hK|nt|jcwla: Once S takes the second @C bid no way N is not bidding five.|pg||
nt|gosia: tricky make in the @d suit - will likely fail|pg||
nt|gosia: not enu dummy entries|pg||
nt|gosia: enough|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think declarer will need to hook the @d jack to make this|pg||
nt|jcwla: It's a possibility after the responsive double.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|c2|pg||
nt|poohbear: and he might since there was a Takeout dbl|pg||
nt|jcwla: Compare with over a direct 4@H.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|dA|pg||
nt|poohbear: i take it back|pg||
nt|poohbear: only after a trump lead does he need to do that|pg||
nt|gosia: still does|pg||
nt|poohbear: cause the defense can get 2 rounds of trumps in|pg||

nt|poohbear: now ruff a heart. ruff a @d lead a @s|pg||
nt|gosia: yes|pg||
nt|jcwla: Two 5mX making in two hands.  This last session has started very swingily.|pg||

nt|poohbear: who dealt these hands???|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|poohbear: 1@c strong|pg||
mb|3H|nt|poohbear: Might make 5@d even with a @h lead|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|poohbear: declarer can trump endplay East|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|poohbear: by ruffing things and exiting a trump|pg||
nt|poohbear: might be easier than 5@c despite the break|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|poohbear: so on a @H lead and a @h continuation. Declarer plays a trump. . Gets the bad news. Now @S @s ruff a @s|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|hK|pg||
nt|poohbear: AK @cs ruff a @H|pg||
pc|h8|nt|poohbear: ruff a @c |pg||
nt|poohbear: and exit 9 of @ds|pg||
nt|poohbear: that makes|pg||
pc|d9|pc|hJ|pc|h3|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|poohbear: nope that doesnt make|pg||
nt|poohbear: had to play @cs first . so this line is entirely dbl dummy|pg||
nt|poohbear: seems 100 % normal to play a trump|pg||
nt|poohbear: and cant make it after that|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|c4|pc|s7|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: Event website: http://cavendish.bridgewinners.com/   Also live table pictures updating every two minutes|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|c7|pc|c9|pg||
nt|poohbear: yes playing @c first would make the hand but its totally dbl dummy. The @c might get ruffed with trumps 3-2|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|c8|pc|s9|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|d7|pc|sJ|pg||

nt|poohbear: if trumps 4-1 still have a shot to drop dbltn Q|pg||
nt|poohbear: of @cd|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|nt|poohbear: declarer can just givr up here|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|poohbear: 2@c shows @ds|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|poohbear: not sure of the follow ups but I suspect they wind up in 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|poohbear: might be all natural|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|poohbear: Meckstroth Rodwell play asking bids in this sequence|pg||

mb|p|mb|3H|nt|poohbear: but they have enough strength to back into @Hs|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: but will West play him for 4?|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h6|nt|poohbear: even if East has 3 @hs 4 @hs might be right. East can always correct to 5@c as well|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
nt|jcwla: W's hand now severely devalued with KJ of @S opposite shortness.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|poohbear: This is a John Lowenthal principle . If you want a ruff lead a trump :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: but I guess Meck didnt want one|pg||
nt|jcwla: The splits this morning have been treacherous.|pg||
nt|poohbear: sorry didnt notice they were in 5@c|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|nt|poohbear: thought 4@h was a routine pass|pg||

pc|hK|pc|hJ|pc|c8|pc|h7|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jcwla: Did well to get to @H's on this common, tough, pattern.  Not sure the reasoning behind 5@C  and surely each level riskier on values.|pg||
pc|cK|mc|9|nt|vugraphzfa: will be back soon|pg||
nt|poohbear: Johnson had the right idea . Playing trum ps . But didnt follow thru|pg||
