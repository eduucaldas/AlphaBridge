nt|cuttysark: But this East has made a dangerous lead - the diamond in the other room led to an untroubled -1|pg||
nt|patricck: Quite a poor game, but the bidding is reasonable. The club lead gives declarer a chance to hope for a 3-3 @H break and take a @D pitch|pg||

pc|s4|pc|c4|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sQ|nt|patricck: but if declarer is fgoing to get the spades so perfectly like that then the defence didn't have a chance|pg||

nt|santyclz: Now is, of course, the time that the finesses work and suits break, since you're down before you get in.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|pjs_ch: the 2@S bid tempted East too much; there is a desire nto to pass 1@S in case partner has a big hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: twas ever thus|pg||
nt|santyclz: And it assumes perfect play and perfect defense, something a bit beyond most of us.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pjs_ch: and no alternative appeals - perhaps pass is just a safer choice|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|cuttysark: it would be nice to bid clubs for the lead, but he could not do that without serious overbidding|pg||

pc|h3|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: This is the downside of 1@C opening on balanced hands - partner may failt o recognise when |pg||
nt|pjs_ch: you really have clubs|pg||
pc|d3|nt|patricck: mission impossible for declarer here|pg||
pc|d8|nt|roswolf: declarer in fine form|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm insurance no doubt but 5the clue is in pards 2@S i think -this suggests some defence|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|roswolf: he would have jumped to 3@S or more WITH NO DEFENCE|pg||
