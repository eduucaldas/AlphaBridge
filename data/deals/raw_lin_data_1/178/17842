mb|2H|nt|psridhar: was that game swing a 'DONT ' loss? the 2@H bidder gets no 2nd chance as in Landy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@S in the other room seems wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphzec: US use Precesion|pg||
nt|josj: with 0 aces, sign off and with 1 ace, ask for @HQ|pg||
nt|tejjyid: if NS are playing Precision that openin 2@C is very heavy|pg||

nt|josj: incredibly heavy, I would say...|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: its worse here this deal :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, North was quite strong - @SQ and @hQ were good cards, but 2@h might have been a 4-3 fit....a bit unlucky imho  |pg||

nt|Walddk2: Another 5-0 spade break|pg||
nt|josj: this is the last round of the event|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jcwla: Meanwhile, no idea what part of the nice @H holding and three only @S's suggested 3@S to N.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|josj: this time, NS should end up with 12 tricks as spades re 3-3 and @CK right|pg||
nt|josj: more than that is not needed|pg||
nt|ahalim: I think somewhere along the line N miscounted hus hand|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h5|pg||
nt|psridhar: poorer spots but Belly heard a 3@C from pd |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Normal but unlucky lead|pg||
nt|jcwla: There is nothing offensively oriented about the N hand that N has not already shown.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|dQ|nt|tejjyid: North presumably expects South's bidding to be weak...|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am told that it is a ridiculous lead|pg||
nt|psridhar: Bd 38 Belly didnt X holding K10942 of trumps-so that 3@C bid makes all the diff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: To be honest, I think any other lead would be ridiculous after partner overcalled the suit at the 3-level|pg||
nt|vugraphzec: okta thing|pg||
nt|mdgraham: why's that? Partner bid the suit at the three-level|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It is a ridiculous lead because one can see all the cards. North does not have the hand records|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|s6|pc|d4|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|nt|tejjyid: or, maybe a miscount, that seems consistent|pg||

mb|p|nt|josj: but the first board looked very flat...|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|kemperg: retransfer|pg||

nt|otoj: @sq doubleton helps declarer to make the contract..|pg||
nt|kemperg: has to shorten trumps|pg||
nt|otoj: declarer must be very careful to plan the play after W shows no trumps..|pg||
nt|otoj: he has a lot entries to shorten trumps|pg||
nt|kemperg: no has to use both @C's|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kemperg: just enough|pg||

nt|vugraphzec: ok Last Board.Thks all :)@S@H@D@C|pg||
nt|josj: ty too|pg||
nt|josj: next round starts in just under 20 mins. from now|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 9 tricks?|pg||
nt|vugraphzec: sry|pg||
nt|kemperg: she will not believe to have won on this board|pg||
mb|3D|nt|granguru: a black lead permits NS to make 6@S|pg||
nt|jcwla: Prima Timah A pulling away now after an unbelievable result in the OR saw Gabmo's W fail in 6@S.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|vugraphzed: result 1NW= thks all|pg||
nt|josj: so 18-12 to Tomohon|pg||
nt|josj: 14.45 local|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: That result confirmed by operator.|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|josj: apparently, EW play 12-14 NT...|pg||
nt|josj: so 1nt now should show 15-17|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|granguru: ALSO @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzec: sry lamp down|pg||
mb|4S|nt|jcwla: 6@D down on a @C lead.|pg||
nt|josj: in which case E has an easy raise to game|pg||
nt|josj: interesting again|pg||
nt|tejjyid: yes, NOrth seems to have a 3@C bid at some point|pg||
nt|josj: in OR W opened 1@D and NS quickly reached 3nt and made it, too|pg||
nt|vugraphzec: Last board here thks all.sry conetion bad @S@H@D@C :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: 6@C makes.|pg||
nt|josj: an overtrick has been added to the previous board :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think that's right...|pg||
nt|josj: X is as effective a choice as anything else now|pg||
mb|5C|nt|josj: @D lead is best|pg||
nt|josj: the missed game 2 boards ago did indeed create a major swing|pg||
nt|vugraphzec: Until Sesion 9 Prima Timah Open A rangk 1.Gabmo Tomohon Rangk 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: interesting auction, that - most pairs play some sort of method to distinguish between 3@H to play and 3@H forcing  |pg||
nt|bg: light opening bid style|pg||
nt|josj: on this lead, 3 nt is easy enough|pg||
mb|6H|nt|mdgraham: a 3@h rebid looks tempting with the South cards - good hearts and @SAK in partner's suit  |pg||
nt|granguru: S should keep @S3 |pg||
nt|granguru: to enter dummy (in case it is needed) after establishing @Cs|pg||
nt|bg: makes 5 if S guesses spades|pg||
nt|josj: soaring heights being reached|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|nt|josj: as we just saw, Prima Timah A were still leading the field, like they did yesterday|pg||
nt|ahalim: so some indonesian coffee Jos ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: 6|pg||
nt|granguru: sorry 5|pg||
nt|granguru: you'r rite Bruce|pg||
nt|vugraphzec: last board here|pg||
mb|p|nt|bg: anybody's guess how play went|pg||
nt|granguru: definitively not @SK @SJ|pg||
nt|bg: probably Club K ace heart heart losing to spade queen|pg||
nt|granguru: probably (@SK and then) @CK @CA  - @H3 to the @HK and @H uppercutting @SQ|pg||
nt|granguru: I think it was the last one|pg||
nt|bg: what happened to 8-9-10|pg||
nt|granguru: well c u ..seems the 3 hands 8 to 10 will not be played publicly|pg||
mb|d|nt|josj: 6@H might well have made on a good day...|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: last board.|pg||
nt|josj: but BPJN's chances of catching up their opps are quickly fading...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|josj: Tomohon, playing and losing here, were lying 2nd but will drop a few places, I expoect, after this defeat|pg||
nt|josj: yes, time for tasting a few Sumatran achievements in that field|pg||
