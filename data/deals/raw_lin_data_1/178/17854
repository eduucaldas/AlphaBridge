nt|robinswr: if you can, some open 4-4 in minors 1@d and others open 1@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then 1N it is!!  [sorry  couldn't resist]|pg||
mb|1C|nt|robinswr: i like 1@d|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|robinswr: playing standard, probably too weak to reverse|pg||

nt|curtis: yes, good round against levin-weinstein|pg||
nt|ahollan1: levin-weinstein finally on the wrong side of a score|pg||

pc|d5|nt|robinswr: this is why I don't like this event. you play this board against this pair and you gain imps|pg||

nt|vugraphzfp: TD announces that the time has expired - now into 2 minutes grace|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i guess time to mention    good hand for Reverse Flannery responses|pg||
nt|ahollan1: where  West in 1 bid can show  less than invite with 5@S & 4+@H|pg||
nt|robinswr: good underlead of the ace of diamonds|pg||
