mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  W dbl looks like action...mainly "do something intelligent, partner" double|pg||

nt|andyv:  E's spade spots are so poor, he can only hope to get some ruffs with them|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why not bid 3@D instead of double? East is known to have 4 of them on this auction. He can't be 4432|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Good morning all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Morning Liz|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think W meant his dbl as takeout, showing also @cs|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Liz|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Liz|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No point in looking for a new minor when a diamond fit has been esteablished|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Only West knows|pg||
nt|andyv:  but agree with you Roland...the dbl is awfully dangerous|pg||
nt|andyv:  I still think W meant it as a game try|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Surely better just to bid diamonds|pg||
nt|andyv:  he got his game|pg||
nt|andyv:  now he can try to set it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I just hate to see 670 and 870 in the "They clumn". when I score up. It really should be avoided|pg||
nt|andyv:  no argument here|pg||
nt|pfbr: morning Roland @h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello Anita :)|pg||
nt|xenya: i can see only 4 tricks for the defence -- well maybe they'll get a 5th but that should be the limit|pg||
