nt|andyv:  3N may be a leap a faith for W|pg||
nt|kemperg: in CR S did not ""bid"" @H|pg||
nt|andyv:  on @h lead, S has to duck first @h|pg||
mb|4S|mb|d|nt|andyv:  S never bid @hs in CR, so N, not unnaturally, led the Q of @s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kemperg: dbl is a hit under the belly:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@s may be as much a leap of faith as was 3N|pg||
mb|p|pc|cJ|nt|andyv:  once S bid @hs, EW were headed for a poor score....the question is how much of a double digit imp loss will they get|pg||

mc|8|nt|andyv:  the -15 is not all that bad.  I blame the S in the CR for most of the loss on this hand.  S had an easy 3rd seat bid of 1@h|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi all|pg||
nt|andyv:  once S bid 1@h, the best EW could do was probably lose 9 or 10 imps|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Rodal:)|pg||
nt|kemperg: hello Rodal|pg||
nt|rodal f: Any way to fail -1 here?|pg||
nt|andyv:  doubtful, it seems like you always have to lose 2@s, 1@h, 1@d and 1@c|pg||
nt|andyv:  only misdefense would lessen those tricks|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to PS|pg||

nt|jcwla: Ah, much better.|pg||

nt|jcwla: Thanks, Henri.|pg||
nt|jcwla: So on that last hand, 5@DX-2 was a profitable sac against the making @H game.  Earlier today on VG, though,|pg||
nt|josj: @HK|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: hi all thx Roland :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Steve Robinson said during the Cavendish that it's bad policy to make a bid that goes for 500 at IMPs.  |pg||
nt|jcwla: If you're right, you win a few, but if you're wrong, you lose a bunch.|pg||

pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|d4|nt|josj: in my book, it would have been GF after 2@H anyway|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|tejjyid: that would be my guess, unles there was a big note on page 2 of the system notes |pg||
nt|josj: but at least they managed to stay away from 5@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzec: Rang 1.PRIMA TIMAH OPEN A199Vp Rang 2.GABMO TOMOHON 191 Vp.Rang 3 PRIMA TIMAH MIXED 171 Vp|pg||
nt|tejjyid: if South theinks the auctions is GF, he can sensibly try @H on the way foward|pg||
nt|josj: but 3nt should be OK|pg||

mb|1C|mb|1N!|nt|tejjyid: 6@H won't be quite as good as they will expevt in the bidding, but it will still make|pg||
mb|d|nt|mdgraham: 2@h both majors? |pg||
nt|josj: apparently, Prima Timah A also lost their previous match|pg||
mb|3C|nt|tejjyid: I assume strong 1@C?|pg||
nt|josj: for NS, yes; not for EW, they play natural|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzec: 2@H=@H +|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|josj: and another very quiet partscore hand on which 8 tricks are there for declarer if the defence cash out in time|pg||
nt|josj: S needs to switch to @C now to prevent the 2nd overtrick|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|josj: 1nt shows pointed or rounded suits|pg||
nt|ahalim: EW play 'modified' Kaplan-Sheinwold as taught to the by their former coach EOK|pg||
nt|tejjyid: after that 3@C bid, the 6@H contract looks even better to North|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|tejjyid: I assume East has shown a 2-suiter without @C|pg||

mb|p|nt|tejjyid: worth an ask of some kind|pg||
mb|2C|nt|josj: 4nt tackles the problem well|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: was that game swing a 'DONT ' loss? the 2@H bidder gets no 2nd chance as in Landy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@S in the other room seems wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphzec: US use Precesion|pg||
nt|josj: with 0 aces, sign off and with 1 ace, ask for @HQ|pg||
nt|tejjyid: if NS are playing Precision that openin 2@C is very heavy|pg||
nt|tejjyid: right, Jos, seems plausible....|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: That's right PS|pg||
nt|josj: incredibly heavy, I would say...|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: its worse here this deal :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, North was quite strong - @SQ and @hQ were good cards, but 2@h might have been a 4-3 fit....a bit unlucky imho  |pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h9|nt|jcwla: W might have made a negative double the first round if available.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|andyv:  hi Mike|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Another 5-0 spade break|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jcwla: Meanwhile, no idea what part of the nice @H holding and three only @S's suggested 3@S to N.|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|josj: this time, NS should end up with 12 tricks as spades re 3-3 and @CK right|pg||
nt|josj: more than that is not needed|pg||
nt|ahalim: I think somewhere along the line N miscounted hus hand|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|nt|psridhar: poorer spots but Belly heard a 3@C from pd |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Normal but unlucky lead|pg||
nt|jcwla: There is nothing offensively oriented about the N hand that N has not already shown.|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|pg||
pc|s6|nt|tejjyid: North presumably expects South's bidding to be weak...|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk2: I am told that it is a ridiculous lead|pg||
nt|psridhar: Bd 38 Belly didnt X holding K10942 of trumps-so that 3@C bid makes all the diff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: To be honest, I think any other lead would be ridiculous after partner overcalled the suit at the 3-level|pg||
nt|vugraphzec: okta thing|pg||
nt|mdgraham: why's that? Partner bid the suit at the three-level|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It is a ridiculous lead because one can see all the cards. North does not have the hand records|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|dQ|pg||

nt|vugraphzec: sry|pg||
mb|1N|nt|granguru: a black lead permits NS to make 6@S|pg||
nt|jcwla: Prima Timah A pulling away now after an unbelievable result in the OR saw Gabmo's W fail in 6@S.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzed: result 1NW= thks all|pg||
nt|josj: so 18-12 to Tomohon|pg||
nt|josj: 14.45 local|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jcwla: That result confirmed by operator.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|josj: apparently, EW play 12-14 NT...|pg||
nt|josj: so 1nt now should show 15-17|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|granguru: ALSO @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzec: sry lamp down|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: 6@D down on a @C lead.|pg||
nt|josj: in which case E has an easy raise to game|pg||
nt|josj: interesting again|pg||
nt|tejjyid: yes, NOrth seems to have a 3@C bid at some point|pg||
nt|josj: in OR W opened 1@D and NS quickly reached 3nt and made it, too|pg||
nt|vugraphzec: Last board here thks all.sry conetion bad @S@H@D@C :)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jcwla: 6@C makes.|pg||
nt|josj: an overtrick has been added to the previous board :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think that's right...|pg||
pc|c4|nt|josj: @D lead is best|pg||
nt|josj: the missed game 2 boards ago did indeed create a major swing|pg||
nt|vugraphzec: Until Sesion 9 Prima Timah Open A rangk 1.Gabmo Tomohon Rangk 2|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mdgraham: interesting auction, that - most pairs play some sort of method to distinguish between 3@H to play and 3@H forcing  |pg||
nt|bg: light opening bid style|pg||
nt|josj: on this lead, 3 nt is easy enough|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a 3@h rebid looks tempting with the South cards - good hearts and @SAK in partner's suit  |pg||
nt|granguru: S should keep @S3 |pg||
nt|granguru: to enter dummy (in case it is needed) after establishing @Cs|pg||
nt|bg: makes 5 if S guesses spades|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c8|nt|josj: as we just saw, Prima Timah A were still leading the field, like they did yesterday|pg||
nt|ahalim: so some indonesian coffee Jos ?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|granguru: 6|pg||
nt|granguru: sorry 5|pg||
nt|granguru: you'r rite Bruce|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|bg: anybody's guess how play went|pg||
nt|granguru: definitively not @SK @SJ|pg||
nt|bg: probably Club K ace heart heart losing to spade queen|pg||
nt|granguru: probably (@SK and then) @CK @CA  - @H3 to the @HK and @H uppercutting @SQ|pg||
nt|granguru: I think it was the last one|pg||
nt|bg: what happened to 8-9-10|pg||
nt|granguru: well c u ..seems the 3 hands 8 to 10 will not be played publicly|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
pc|sA|nt|josj: Tomohon, playing and losing here, were lying 2nd but will drop a few places, I expoect, after this defeat|pg||
