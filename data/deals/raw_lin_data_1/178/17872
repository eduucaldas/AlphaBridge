nt|robinswr: stewart|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at trick 4   hamman leads @S2  toward dummy    will be interesting to see if that ploy works|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: It is actually Woolsey who didnt play a highe rdiamond board upside doown - VG operator nightmare|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: 2@C doesnt show enough IMHO|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: DBL could be strong NT     EW play Raptor 1N overcalls|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|pelu: Weinstein passed out in 1@H : making - for sure a +score for them|pg||
nt|robinswr: 2nt shows diamonds and longer clubs|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: Who would pas 1@H with East?|pg||
nt|pelu: Pepsi|pg||
nt|robinswr: only 2spades|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Sure it could be right but can more often be wrong I suspect|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Then look at West why would that hand pass 1@H|pg||
pc|sK|nt|robinswr: partner doesn't have five spades|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|s7|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: The game against experts has reached a state where you should assume every card played by declaler is a false card|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h9|nt|robinswr: west had the most he could have and not overcall 1nt|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: wooldridge opened south hand 1N and that ended the auction|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: That wouldnt travel too well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: zia led @S   wooldridge +120|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Hmmm|pg||
nt|robinswr: reason why you'd pass 1heart out|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought Kit might open 14-16 NT  with such weak @H|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: All will be on website momentarily|pg||
nt|robinswr: overtricks will make a differance in the final results|pg||
nt|ahollan1: to appreciate real difference   divide by 17|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
pc|cT|nt|robinswr: will he guess the jack of clbus|pg||
nt|arobson:  Very close between Levin-Weinstein and Stewart-Woolsey|pg||

nt|arobson:  Fred will bid 4@S I think, his style (and mine!)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: As they say the 4@H bidder shopped well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: top 2 contenders both sitting NS|pg||
nt|robinswr: 4@h is a transfer to 4@s|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Scores up to the end of the previous round at http://cavendish.bridgewinners.com/index.php?option=com_content&id=205|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: board 26 looking like the determining factor   levin-weinstein +80    woolsey-steward -110|pg||
nt|robinswr: conservative|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Stewart looked very uncomfortable before passing and now Piekarek the same|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: West will certainly spurn any slam interest shown by partner|pg||
nt|arobson:  Piekarek very aggressive slam bidder. 6@H can make on @DA lead if declarer plays just one trump before trying to ruff diamond. But he's likely to go after clubs.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I see Piekarek's problem he has 2 aces plsu @HAQ what has  partner got for his bid|pg||
nt|robinswr: only needs the jack of diamonds for slam to be good|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought Larry Cohen's first book taught the world   bid 4@S over 4@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sure   Woolsey wasn't even good enough to open 10-12 NT, but still ...|pg||
nt|drewsky: Having checked the results of this round at the other table, Fred and Kit will take the lead from Levin-Weinstein if Smirnow plays 6@H and goes down.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Thanks for the intel seal team 1|pg||
mb|4S!|nt|arobson:  Convincing himself to bid I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|arobson:  Many plays this as natural...|pg||
nt|robinswr: rkc?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: No both sides alerted|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Smirnov looking like a man that regretted opening 4@H right now|pg||
nt|robinswr: rkc would be alerted also|pg||
nt|arobson:  I've opened worse|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Oops oops oops|pg||

nt|caitlin: wow|pg||
nt|ahollan1: um uh  gulp|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Piekrek shrugging his shoulders in disbelief|pg||
nt|arobson:  Wow!!! Has this handed Kit and Steve the event. Big moment!!!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: EW having some choice german sords|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c7|pc|cA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now we know why stewart didn't bid 4@S|pg||
nt|arobson:  Sorry Kit and Fred|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Yes well bid Fred|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|s4|pc|c9|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|robinswr: why bid 4spades when you can defend against 4spades|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|arobson:  Fred Stewart's decision not to bid 4@S has worked in a most unexpected way!|pg||
nt|drewsky: 4@S is a call I would only make if I had a clear agreement or if I was playing with my regular partner who knows my tendencies.|pg||

nt|pelu: this could be 12 x 17 IMP for NS = +204|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I do speak German but will spare you the choice discussion taking place|pg||
nt|arobson:  Now barring disasters Fred and Kit will win|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: I think we have to hand bouquets to Fred Stewart for not bidding 4@S|pg||
nt|robinswr: when you're hot you're hot|pg||
nt|pelu: but Levin-Weinstein has a very good score here: 5@D -1 by EW - EW was in 3NT - but Lev moved to 5@D|pg||
nt|arobson:  Still Levin-Weinstein went plus as N-S on this board so not over yet...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: levin-weinstein +50 here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: You do need some of that luck to win an event like this|pg||
mb|3N|nt|robinswr: you need lots of luck play well hand hope opponents don't|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h2|nt|pelu: could be 17x11 back = 187 - so close again|pg||
pc|h6|nt|arobson:  Hard to see 3NT making here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if memory serves   it was a close finish last year too|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|pg||
nt|drewsky: I think if you asked Steve Weinstein who the one person in the whole world that he would want to win if he couldn't..would be Fred Stewart, who was once his step father.|pg||
nt|robinswr: this should go down easily|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Vugraphzfb: Still not easy for defence|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry - u are right - |pg||
nt|ahollan1: and that's who stewart won the event with  --   twice|pg||
nt|arobson:  South knows declarer can't have @DAK and @SA or he'd cash out|pg||
nt|ahollan1: woolsey won with  ed manfield & neil silverman|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|nt|arobson:  Maybe the indicated defnce is @CA and @S8|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Better indications on the run of the diamonds|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Cost a trick sure but better to get it right|pg||
nt|robinswr: he'll lead a diamond and then another club|pg||
nt|arobson:  Perhaps declarer will play cl;ub back to disguise the position|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: If he runs diamonds defence cannot fail|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: a case of TMI|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|robinswr: if they beat his they'll win for sure|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d9|pc|d4|pc|s3|pg||
nt|arobson:  Declarer may run diamonds - at leasrt he'll be just down one that way 9and make if South has @SA|pg||
pc|d8|pc|c2|nt|Vugraphzfb: Thats it bare the club so you cant go wrong|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in context of Smith echoes   IFF  @C play is Smith  what does north need to encourage after @H8 denies an honor??|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s4|pc|d7|nt|robinswr: now they have to beat it unless they revoke|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|dT|pc|sT|pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wondering if Kit might try to drop @HQ|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|c4|mc|8|nt|Vugraphzfb: OK hang around for results|pg||
nt|drewsky: This is what we call in horse racing as a photo finish between Fred-Kit and Robert-Steve.......and even if the final results come in, there could be appeals committes, so nothing ...|pg||
nt|drewsky: is official until it is official.|pg||
nt|drewsky: Barring appeals committes, it appears that Fred and Kit are slightly ahead.|pg||
nt|arobson:  26 is a pick up for Levin-Weinstein|pg||
nt|arobson:  But 27 is so huge for Woolsey-Stewart that you'd have to back them.|pg||
nt|arobson:  Stewart's decision not to bid 4@S on 27 was crucial|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Waiting Waiting Waiting|pg||
nt|arobson:  In a Master Solvers I think most experts would bid 4@S...but then perhaps E-W would have bid on to 6@H...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: There is a poolside presentation to follow|pg||
nt|ahollan1: overall pays 10 places   there are also awards for the session  1st & 2nd  maybe 3rd|pg||
