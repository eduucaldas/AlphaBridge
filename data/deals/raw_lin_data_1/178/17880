nt|joest: Of course Reese (by legend) didn't react when a naked woman walked through a room either|pg||
nt|brolucius: Which was indeed a legend, presumably.|pg||
nt|joest: so east-west here are Doug Simson and Walter Johnson, a pair that has known Meckwell for a long time and plays the "Meckwell Precision" system|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|brolucius: Johnson sometimes partners Rodwell, doesn't he?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|joest: north-south Alan Sontag and Dave Berkowitz, a partnerhip entering their second year, both of whom are well known around the world|pg||
nt|joest: at time he does yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: Playing Precision (with a limited opener), Johnson has a clear 3@h bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@H is limited by East not opening with a strong 1@C.|pg||
nt|mikam1: Stopped just in time too|pg||
pc|cK|nt|joest: David Berkowitz' long time former partner, Larry Cohen, retired from bridge but has been dragged back out for thsi event.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Otherwise West would certainly consider a raise.|pg||
nt|mikam1: Yes, and Larry is playing on the Wolfson team here|pg||
nt|joest: Should David's team and Larry's team both win today, they will oppose each other tomorrow|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||
nt|brolucius: Cashing the other club will allow an overtrick (by ruffing the thrid round with dummy's @HJ).|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|pc|s3|pc|s8|pg||
nt|brolucius: Berkowitz correctly sees no percentage in covering with the @SK.|pg||
nt|mikam1: Johnson will probably bang out trumps here (after some thought)|pg||
nt|joest: i suspect Johnson will play another club back, threatening a ruff|pg||
nt|joest: or trumps yeah|pg||
nt|joest: even simpler|pg||

nt|sybarra: hi Joe :) |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: NS - standard - EW = precision|pg||
nt|hawe45: hi|pg||
nt|peachy: Thanks operators, appreciated information|pg||
nt|hawe45: Excuse me - can one play precision and be late for the start...?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: No you haven't|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Now you have|pg||
nt|hawe45: This board was played two hours ago|pg||
nt|hawe45: 100 % sure - director|pg||
nt|andreasw:  good hands to start with tho.. what happend on the board?|pg||
nt|iceak:  JÃ³n and ÃorlÃ¡kur both world champions from Yokohama 1991|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridge.is/meistarastig/20102011/magiccontest.htm  for running scores|pg||
nt|iceak:  SÃ¦var and Karl have both often represented in open teams for Iceland|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I think we start with board 1 in this room|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 15 and 126 in the open|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 15-16|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Sry folks, need to restart|pg||
nt|iceak:  JÃ³n and ÃorlÃ¡kur play relay system|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Good morning everyone|pg||
nt|sybarra: gm Liz and all:)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: East is my partner from the Mixed Teams in Rhodes :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and hello to Isak our operator |pg||
nt|sybarra: great so you will know proclivities |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: hi - 2@d, 2@h and 2@s are same for both pairs - multi and 9-12|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Unfortunately he agreed to play my system, so I cannot help much with his|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty |pg||
nt|sybarra: nt ranges?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Hello everyone. Welcome to the 11th round of Icelandic Championship Finals|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello folks|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|psyck: This is the last round & finals from tomorrow?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: N-S are strong favorites to winning the title in tomorrows 4 team finals|pg||
nt|psyck: ah, thanks|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: E-W will need to be quite lucky to crawl into top 4|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Live score:  http://www.bridge.is/meistarastig/20102011/magiccontest.htm|pg||
nt|ady: just short of a slam for n/s|pg||
nt|ady: aeven with K@C onside would still need favourable trump split    and diamond split 4-3|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: velcome all - your operator is Isak Orn Sigurdsson|pg||
nt|ady: good morning all|pg||
nt|ady: hi Orn|pg||
nt|ady: there is the chance that should n.s reach 6@S  east might lead A@H  which would set up 2 heart tricks for 12   or also  otherwise there is a possibility of east being end played|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We need our operator to shut down and reconnect|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But not much luck when I ask him to|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: both pairs play standard their version|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: aker-richter playing short 1C with transfers and unbal 1d|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: Good bidding - up to now|pg||
nt|peachy: operator seems to have some practicing session going, no cards :)  Hang on, I'm sure we will be on shortly|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Hmmm....|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: The bidding has not been like this :)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: You need to redeal to a board first|pg||
nt|Walddk5: You can't bid with a blank screen|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: I have the board|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Isak?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ianmcc: hi Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Ian |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 14-16|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like strong nt for e/w |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Please read on your screen|pg||
mb|2C|nt|hawe45: Good luck to everybody|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Looks normal to reach 4@S here, but game is off on top. So unfair|pg||
mb|d|nt|mgb81: That's an odd choice of take out double from south I must say- makes it hard to express her hand type|pg||
nt|athene: yet another good hand for the "4333 plays in notrumps" rule|pg||
nt|psyck: EW 6th with 159|pg||
nt|psyck: NS joint 2nd with 175|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: E-W play Precision with 14-16 NT. N-S play 2/1 with unbalanced @D and transfer responses to 1@C|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks, welcome back to the final round of the Icelandic team championship.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Both pairs are playing Precision with quite unusual 2nd level|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
nt|lml: hi|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Peter|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3H|nt|dburn: well, if it gets them to 3NT...|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt looks as though it definitely ought to have chances|pg||
nt|mgb81: NS have the chance for a brilliancy by bidding 3NT...seems a bit far fetched though|pg||
nt|athene: i am amazed how well 3nt scores over 4major when you have a 4333|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: more system details available from the teams pages off the www.usbf.org site|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 2@S was not obligatory|pg||
nt|lml: hi Mark|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Mark|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: a not so easy 3 nt|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Early evening here in Bath|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sybarra: we will probably see smolen in use |pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @H showing 4 H! and 5 @S |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Smolen|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Indeed - I think we just did. if East bids 3NT now West should trust him|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: North has seen his partner's 1@H bids before|pg||
nt|psyck: :)|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@h some king of positive response i guess, maybe with bal hand too?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 4@H seemed to be natural vs. a more solid citizen|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: gordon/aker exchanging scribbles regarding 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdh: The theme of today has been favourable slam layouts|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: North can try eliminating and messing around a bit but with everyone balanced there isn't any chance of a defensive screw up|pg||
nt|athene: you really want to be facing a 1-suiter though - not so good if the long spades are part of a 2-suiter|pg||
nt|mgb81: or is there...?|pg||
nt|copeyj: @DA lead should eliminate the problems at trick 1, 2 and 3 Michaerl|pg||
nt|copeyj: or even Michael|pg||
nt|dburn: well, the defence can begin with three rounds of diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn: and if they get endplayed after that, they deserve to get endplayed|pg||
nt|ianmcc: a bit desperate if @h led|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello folks|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome David and Warren|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: you could endplay them after that and force them to give a ruff and discard :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and ht it is (was certainly likely) |pg||
nt|santyclz: I would have led a @c, probably the only lead that lets it make.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: i think the only way it might make is if west somehow loses her clubs and then east gets squeezed in hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|peachy: Thanks for coming to cheer for your favorites|pg||
nt|pelu: looks like down 1|pg||
nt|lml: I think 4@H is a touch pushy especially nv. |pg||
nt|lml: yes it will take very careful defence to let 4@H make|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: muted voices from the next table.  we are curtained off in the corner of a large ballroom here|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|psyck: don't need to preempt opps when they tend to do it themselves i guess|pg||
pc|s7|nt|cuttysark: Oh well - worried about the clubs, does not know where partner's shortage is|pg||
nt|xenya: well we all have been in worse slams i believe|pg||
nt|psyck: I can understand a try with 5@d, but 6@d looks to be a bit of a gamble.  This is a decent slam though, unfortunate as it needs nothing more than a finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: The problem with the West hand is that it is only worth a GF in NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Sry - was following the board|pg||
nt|ady: hi Roland    Warren|pg||
nt|warrens:  hi all.  |pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|santyclz: And another potential slam hand.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sybarra: this will go down (Unfortunately) on the club ruff |pg||
nt|ady: not a great slam    but could make with wrong lead   either club or heart|pg||
nt|warrens:  S has to decide if he has enough for another bid here.  his Kx of @H's and only 3 trumps was not enough|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Here we have a making grand slam, which you would not want to bid though|pg||
nt|santyclz: 7 on a finesse.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Easy -1 if N doesn´t cover @sQ!@sJ|pg||
pc|h8|nt|vugraphzdh: A double of 2@H, showing some 5-7 HCP had maybe worked better|pg||
nt|ady: now should be 12 tricks|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mgb81: In the other room it looks like Susannah Gross pulled off a pseudo squeeze as Ruth Connelly sitting west pitched two clubs, squeezing her partner|pg||
nt|hawe45: @H - @D-ruff - and then @S from the defence|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|iceak:  could have a chance because of favourable @d lay|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Unless, of course, as here, when you need a 23-7 victory|pg||
nt|santyclz: This is very likely to be the standings link:   http://www.bridge.is/meistarastig/20102011/magiccontest.htm|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Then perhaps, if you find out that nothing is missing except the king of trumps, you might take the action to bid 7|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: As you can see in the running scores, Grant Thornton has a comfortable leading margin of 15 VP, so 10 VP is enough for them to defend their title|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: director pops in to write down the lineups|pg||
pc|c8|nt|vugraphzdh: I guess that Jón Baldursson's @S2 in first trick meant that he wanted a @C switch|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: They play udca, so low card is usually encouraging, which in the case of a singleton in dummy usually calls for a trump|pg||
nt|iceak:  difficult not to find a trump switch|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|nt|athene: but since west hasn't got anything to keep but her clubs....|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|ianmcc: don't like that @h8 but still 5 tx for defence|pg||
nt|pelu: now sown 2: 3x@C and @S-ruff|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hawe45: @D Jack was a partner-test..|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mgb81: However declarer then claimed one down, so maybe the play record is inaccurate.|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, but even this requires some good breaks (which work).|pg||
nt|santyclz: They are certainly trying for a grand and have bypassed rck so...|pg||
nt|santyclz: But they stop at the sensible contract.|pg||
nt|friggi: then best one|pg||
pc|h5|nt|friggi: the|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hawe45: @S now, what else could work well?|pg||
nt|iceak:  declarer maybe on his way|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: But it is very common to play Lavintahl when dummy shows with a singleton|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all sorry I am late |pg||
nt|suketbombi: hi all|pg||
nt|iceak:  hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: High @S would have called for @D, small for @C, middle for more @S or trump|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Shirley Ybarra|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and Dima Nikolenkov|pg||
nt|dima:  Hi all :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Hi there :)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: HI Dima Isak & Shirley:)|pg||
nt|iceak:  hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: The defence stands no chance now, should I tell Þorlákur :)|pg||
nt|dima:  Do pairs use some special systems?|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hawe45: Claim|pg||
nt|hawe45: Trump back would have defeated this contract|pg||
pc|d3|nt|iceak:  EW use relays|pg||
nt|psyck: Actually, if 2@h denied @h stopper in addition to showing a balanced positive, 6@d bid looks much better|pg||
nt|friggi: home run|pg||
pc|hT|nt|dima:  Ina strong clubs context?|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|athene: the problem with stripping side-suits and hoping for some elimination is that it's always really obvious what you are doing|pg||
nt|athene: so opps know to throw their kings brilliantly from Kx and stuff like that when it's needed|pg||
nt|ianmcc: looks like making now|pg||
nt|santyclz: @s pitch may have let it through.|pg||
nt|lml: so first imps go to Aker|pg||
pc|s4|pc|hA|nt|peachy: Well, the hearts come in so I don't think so|pg||

nt|joest: 1@d = 2+|pg||
mb|1N|nt|joest: would the panelists double or overcall 1NT as West|pg||
nt|brolucius: Sontag opens 1@D because he is playing a strong club system. The old idea of opening 1@D even with a natural sustem (to ease your rebid) has died a merciful death.|pg||
nt|mikam1: Not obvious is it?|pg||

nt|joest: note that Johnson doubles for takeout, not for penalty|pg||
nt|mikam1: He got to do everything!|pg||
nt|joest: he's described his hand very well now: with these two bids combined|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|joest: Im not sure how one works out whether to pass or correct here in a club sytem|pg||
nt|brolucius: Berkowitz can perhaps expect five clubs for this rebid, and since South might hold only 4 diamonds, he should pass.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|othered1: I personally like the takeout double, but some would play it penalty-oriented over the @C bidder|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mikam1: Not an easy lead for Johnson|pg||
nt|mikam1: Everything is horrible|pg||
nt|joest: thsi contract will not play as miserably as it could|pg||

pc|d6|pc|dJ|pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||

nt|joest: otherwise declarer has the timing to make this|pg||
nt|mikam1: I think you're right Jack...even now is ok|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer has two cards to knock out, and will run out of trumps on a spade attack now.|pg||
nt|joest: much easier to see looking at all four hands|pg||
nt|joest: David you were right: they did blast away into 4@h on board 1 in the other room|pg||
nt|mikam1: Yes, but he "knows" partner doesn't have 5 spades, so it's probably right|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes. Allowing dummy to score the @SK does not cost anything, as it happens (with declarer holding K-Q-J of hearts).|pg||
pc|sA|nt|joest: he doesn't know declarer's suit lengths either|pg||

nt|mgb81: we can see that the defence lost its way in the other room|pg||
nt|mgb81: 4S looks booked for at least two down but west played ace and another diamond and declarer got a club away|pg||
nt|santyclz: And a quick lead for the team I'll not try to type.|pg||
nt|peachy: Then he does not lose the DK to ruff, tricky hand to defend|pg||
nt|hawe45: One @H to the 10, @D-ruff and trump|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think especially at pairs you want your systems in working order |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Yes E-W play strong @C, N-S standard 2/1|pg||
nt|iceak:  Think strong club |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Yes, I think 6@D was quite reasonable|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: east played the @D5 on the ace|pg||
nt|mgb81: with 5H cold (North is squeezedin the minors on an unlikely trump lead) there are several ways for this to gain a swing to England|pg||
nt|mgb81: will kelly bid 4S or 1S?|pg||
nt|athene: 3NT overcall definitely a bit whimsical|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe we can just call them SS |pg||
nt|dima:  ok|pg||
nt|ady: 6@H   an excellent spot     but may fail  |pg||
mb|1C!|nt|ianmcc: or pronounce|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: asking partner to have an ace out of the blue is a bit much|pg||
nt|santyclz: (It being only 7:15 here my fingers aren't awake yet.)|pg||
nt|psyck: 1N probably artificial|pg||
nt|ady: 6@S   has only 1 top loser    but not enough tricks   especially on a trump lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdh: 20-21|pg||
nt|sybarra: some of us up much earlier watching the royal wedding :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: N/s could maybe make 4@s|pg||
mb|1S|nt|santyclz: I figured since they didn't invite me I wasn't obligated to watch.|pg||
nt|peachy: Often the defense indeed does well to start trumps early, the reason they play in trump contract is so they can ruff something :)|pg||
nt|hawe45: Exactly|pg||
nt|dima:  looks like negative double will get NS to 4@h|pg||
nt|iceak:  How strong is NS NT?|pg||
nt|dima:  likely 12-14 :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: N-S use weak NT in 1st and 2nd|pg||
nt|ady: 2@C   shows diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: this is interesting|pg||
nt|ady: 3@C   natural   |pg||
nt|santyclz: 6@s on a low @h lead...|pg||
nt|santyclz: A truly awful contract.|pg||
nt|friggi: yes - but very unlikely to get there|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mgb81: what????????|pg||
nt|athene: hmmmm|pg||
nt|sybarra: making 5 moving right along |pg||
nt|iceak:  no problems to win this|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 6@H actually can be made on this one|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: And Sævar has a bit of a problem, because he does not quite know partners hand type|pg||
nt|iceak:  My guess he will pass|pg||
nt|dima:  surely they would have some slam try bid (like 4@d) on the way available|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Does he have 15-17 balanced? Even 18-19? Or maybe 14-17 unbalanced?|pg||
nt|psyck: or not :|pg||
nt|friggi: 3NT is the deal here|pg||
nt|santyclz: Needs the 10,8 doubleton of @ss just for starters.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the rise to 2@s from W is for me a strong hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: literally what on earth is going on|pg||
nt|athene: west has decided that she can get lots of heart ruffs|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe South really bid 4@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: I remember the grant thornton team from prior tourneys,  SS we saw in an early round |pg||
nt|chessmaste: South has a decent hand, but North's pass made it clear to go quietly|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: why would you ever reopen with a double on the east cards?|pg||
nt|athene: best would be an SOS redouble from north|pg||
nt|ianmcc: howcome they left you out?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think being vul, N/S do not get in|pg||
nt|psyck: I would have prefered a mixed raise instead|pg||
nt|psyck: (mixed raise, 6-9, by passed hands or in competition)|pg||
nt|psyck: anyway, with the @da well placed this should also make|pg||
nt|cuttysark: East can afford to be brave at the vulnerability|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I am not sure you can ever make 6 with a @D lead |pg||
nt|sybarra: I just dont see that,, unless you are talking about judging the spade position immediately|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Double dummy you can, by finessing @S at first opportunity|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You can't|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Does not help|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: A painful pass from East|pg||
nt|warrens:  tough call for S now.|pg||
nt|friggi: right|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3N not bad|pg||
nt|friggi: and then the rest to be good|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: E-W's 2 of a major opening is quite unique. |pg||
nt|santyclz: Welcome to Germ Kemper.|pg||
nt|friggi: they must just used it when unvul or what StefánÐ|pg||
nt|friggi: ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: And I have noticed that the frequency is really high|pg||
nt|friggi: sry I have US keyboard|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: They use it all vulnerabilities|pg||
nt|kemperg: bit late, was on another table |pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk4: West has 3 trumps and 2 spades|pg||
nt|suketbombi: y|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Then use entries to play @Cs twice|pg||
nt|Walddk4: How do you get your diamond loser away in time?|pg||
nt|psyck: though 5@c clearly superior|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@s, 2@h, 3 trump losers or so|pg||
nt|friggi: welcome |pg||
nt|kemperg: much used in Holland those 2 openings|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: south might decide to float that too|pg||
nt|mgb81: well this looks to be 7 tricks on accurate defence i think|pg||
nt|copeyj: is this definitely the auction, operator?|pg||
nt|Walddk1: I fear it is|pg||
nt|mgb81: I just cant imagine what goes through the mind of someone that wants to double 1S for take out when they are 7-4|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: it definitely is :)|pg||
nt|copeyj: thanks Stephen|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: :):)|pg||
nt|athene: well, received wisdom is that you strain to re-open with double as often as possible, but "possible" doesn't cover 0-7-2-4|pg||
nt|mgb81: I'm not sure why youre smiling Stephen - looks painful to me|pg||
nt|santyclz: An oversight, I'm sure.|pg||
nt|ady: 6@H  can be made  by playing a low club towards the jack  and if west takes the king   get the heart right|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|pg||
nt|sybarra: afraid to push them to game maybe |pg||
nt|cuttysark: 3@S already rather high - even if he gets spades right there are problems|pg||
nt|ady: if west does not play the king  the clubs can be ruffed out as they lay and south then loses only a trump trick     but that is an obscure double dummy play   |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sybarra: seems like it should make 6 but I guess that needs the @H's played correctly|pg||
nt|hawe45: No double? - but undertricks "en masse" as they say in France|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@D in OR - and very friendly defense: @D to J, @C to 9, @D to K @C to A|pg||
nt|pelu: - so prob making|pg||
nt|lml: the @HJ seems an odd card|pg||
pc|h5|nt|copeyj: he is smiling because he is scottish|pg||
nt|copeyj: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: absolutely|pg||
nt|hawe45: E/W will come closer to 9 tricks than North...|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 1@c 11-14 bal or nat|pg||
nt|ady: e/w  may save|pg||
nt|warrens:  now East faces the problem of having bid 5@S|pg||
pc|h3|nt|dima:  In Imps seems to be pretty easy board|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Can make - the clubs are kind and he can establish a long heart|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap asks: upsisdedown signals, richter nods, aker says there are a couple of exceptions|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hawe45: Come on, North - take some tricks|pg||
nt|peachy: Perhaps there was some misunderstanding in NS auction|pg||
nt|psyck: about the same as allowing NS to make 1@s|pg||
pc|hA|nt|steshome:  Passing the double with the West hand is a bit odd though|pg||
nt|athene: that's one way of putting it, yes|pg||
nt|mgb81: yes it's the bid of someone who is going for the quick kiil|pg||
nt|mgb81: hoping partner is 2524 with a goodish hand say|pg||
nt|warrens:  safety first|pg||
nt|ady: this will only go down 1   unless a trump lead|pg||
nt|warrens:  trump lead looks right, since your side has all three side suits there should be no hurry|pg||
nt|santyclz: What are they?  5 card suit, not 5332, 8-12?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|friggi: 8-10 - ugly|pg||
nt|kemperg: 5major + 4+ minor|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 8-10, 5-card with 2-3 other major, can be balanced or side suit minor|pg||
nt|kemperg: 6-10|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|ady: well done    might still be down 2  without a trump lead    west can ruff 3 hearts  but would hacve to give up a club and as long as south ducks the first club  north can with the ...|pg||
nt|ady: 2nd club with the jack and play a trump|pg||
nt|ady: as it stands   9 trump tricks and K@C|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks Stefan.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: They only variation is that in 3d and 4th they are not so strict about 2-3 other major|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap now leaning over the table, chin in palm|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap closes the screen, whispers some questions to richter|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: apparently about shapes that would open 1C vs 1D|pg||
nt|ralfwil: playing another @h from dummy looks obvious|pg||
nt|lml: Spades are fine too|pg||
nt|lml: not much bad can happen if you lead spades that I can think of|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap inquires NS 1NT range: 15-17|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: trying to deduce what hands aker can/can't have|pg||
nt|lml: 1@C shows either clubs or balanced|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sybarra: but he has to draw trump also |pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|nt|cuttysark: East sensibly preserving his trump|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lml: if balanced any shape in the minors|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|nt|mgb81: Declarer is going to bash out a few trumps now and make her 7 top tricks|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: aker did give some thought to a takeout double of 1@S.  not sure if that was evident through the screen|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: first hand pratap thought a while at trick 1 then the rest of the play went quickly|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Vugraphzfd: this time he called quickly at trick 1 and has been contemplating at every trick|pg||
pc|c7|nt|peachy: 2NT seems like transfer to clubs, meybe they were not on same page asto what bid "likes clubs"|pg||
nt|hawe45: Do´nt forget, that the lead gave one trick away from the defence!|pg||
pc|cT|nt|dima:  If West overtakes to return a trump East is sqeezed in black suits|pg||
nt|ady: it was very tough for east to sit 6@H  when non vul against vul|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|psyck: more pain|pg||
nt|xenya: N will be pleased to score all his trumps|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mgb81: west should have count now and not uck the diamond|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h7|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|mgb81: often its the vul overtrick that really costs. -790 when teammates make 620 isnt a disaster but -990 is|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: takes and replaces @DA|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|pc|d7|pc|d2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap gets around to recording contract on his private score|pg||
nt|lml: so looks like another 5 imps and aker will have an 11 imp lead after two seemly innocent looking deals|pg||
nt|ralfwil: very slow now - in a partscore|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: aker nods nods and nods|pg||

mb|2H|mb|d|nt|brolucius: It was a difficult hand to defend, because West did not know which way round South's minors were.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other rooms visible via http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
nt|mikam1: For sure...if Sontag had 5 diamonds, 4 clubs this might have been right|pg||
nt|joest: this is a great hand for 'slow approach shows a stopper' in response to the double.  Bid 2NT, then 3@h cue bid to show four spades plus a heart stopper|pg||
nt|mikam1: I suspect a quick 3N from East here|pg||
nt|joest: This is 'lebensohl' which many pairs play after a weak two|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikam1: Sorry - didn't see the 4 card spade suit|pg||
mb|3N|nt|joest: yeah that's the issue|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mikam1: Neither did Doug :)|pg||
nt|joest: 3NT is certainly practical.  It just doesn't work so well on this hand.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|joest: now it works great!|pg||
nt|brolucius: Reasonable to go to 3NT instead of looking for a spade fit, on that hand. There is a greater chance than normal of a 4-1 spade break after South's weak 2@H.|pg||
nt|joest: I agree.  I'm not faulting 3NT.  I'm just saying some would bid it more 'scientifically' rightly or wrongly|pg||
nt|joest: and if you bid it authoritatively enough... :)|pg||
nt|mikam1: Non heart lead may cost here|pg||
nt|joest: of course 4@s doesn't make as West either|pg||
nt|mikam1: On a heart lead declarer had no practical chance....now this could make|pg||
nt|brolucius: On a heart lead, it seems that declarer has four spades, three clubs (with two finesses), one heart and no time to develop a diamond trick before the defenders make merry in ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: hearts.|pg||
nt|mikam1: This is very complicated from here...declarer has 4 spades, 3 clubs (with finesses) and 1 diamond on top|pg||
nt|mikam1: He needs either a heart or another diamond...timing is key here|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is always a narrow target to lead a non-heart from a collection such as South's. You hope that partner will get in and that a single lead of hearts through declarer will then ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: beat the contract.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|s5|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|pc|cQ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|mikam1: Now queen of diamonds?|pg||
nt|joest: that seems reasonable|pg||
nt|mikam1: If he believes spades are 3-2 and club finesse is really on (likely)...that seems indicated|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@S could go down on a trump promotion. Ace of diamonds, heart, heart and a 3rd heart.|pg||
nt|joest: on board  2, east-west competed to 2@s and made that so Gordon was plus in both rooms|pg||
nt|mikam1: Yes, trump promotion for sure|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, East had a chance to bid 2@S here after West's re-opening double.|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|sT|pg||
nt|brolucius: But, of course, 3NT might well have gone down too.|pg||
nt|joest: unblocking the nine, to give himself possibly 3 entries to dummy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: holding East hand   Gordon bid 4@S where Simson bid 3N|pg||
nt|brolucius: Straight away?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yep|pg||
nt|brolucius: I don't like that much. West does not promise 4@S and 3NT was always likely to be playable.|pg||
nt|joest: Doesn't a double promise four cards in the other major in England, David?  :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Only among gentlemen.|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d8|pc|d2|nt|mikam1: Too late now|pg||
nt|joest: for the defense?|pg||
nt|mikam1: No - if David ducks might beat it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Simson has choice where he wins 4th @S|pg||
nt|mikam1: Defense can set up club trick as 5th |pg||
nt|joest: yes|pg||
nt|mikam1: Doug slightly mistimed by taking the club finesse again before playing the diamond queen|pg||
nt|joest: seems like that might have waited|pg||
nt|mikam1: I think David may figure this out too...may|pg||
nt|joest: even if he ducks and Doug continues @ds he's still make|pg||
nt|mikam1: Ah - true|pg||
nt|joest: Sontag is almost heart tight already|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|mikam1: Yes, let's see if Doug figures it out|pg||
nt|ahollan1: against 4@S  Aker led @D  but Richter ducked  no trump promotion  but the hand isn't over yet|pg||
nt|mikam1: Incidentally, I believe Pratap is East and Gordon West in the other room|pg||
nt|brolucius: Surprising duck of the @DA, in that case. His partner had opened 2@D and had every chance of holding @HA-Q.|pg||
nt|joest: if Sontag had had the fourth club Simson might have been in mortal danger|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|dT|nt|mikam1: Good play|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h8|nt|mikam1: So this will make after all|pg||
nt|brolucius: So, it seems that both games will make, where both games should have gone down. (And we would expect them to go down with 'normal defense').|pg||

nt|vugraphzaw: was also the auction...lol|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Don't tell anybody|pg||
nt|santyclz: For those new to BBO:  To see how a board was played at the other table, click "Movie", then "(other) Room", |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Karl claimed the overtrick on squeeze |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: For me, the south hand is a 3@H opening|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: when you have a 7-4 as opener on that sort of auction do you just lose the 4-card suit?|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: too late|pg||
nt|santyclz: then highlight the board you wish to review by clicking on it and click the "Next" button to step though the play.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: lots for N/S here|pg||
nt|ady: 2 available slams for n/s|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: so opener just bids 4@H or something over 1@S?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 14-16 NT|pg||
nt|santyclz: A "two-strike" multi -- side ace, side void.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: yes Bill|pg||
nt|athene: these actions aren't discussed much - e.g. what is a cue-bid by opener|pg||
nt|mgb81: it looks like declarer mistimed the play in the other room here. She allowed north to pitch her diamond and ruff away the ace|pg||
nt|hawe45: Here the spot is 3 NT - to avoid cross-ruffing defence|pg||
nt|sybarra: E will open |pg||
nt|ralfwil: important to play 4@s on E|pg||
nt|lml: east has a good hand after the double.  But 3NT or spade?|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@s cant make - 3NT in OR - down on @H-lead but S found @s6 - and now peob making|pg||
nt|pelu: 3NT now a practical bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: music wafts in from somewhere|pg||
nt|lml: it is the kind of call you like to think about|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @d lead is needed to defeat 4@s on E|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: gordon arranging his box.  pratap studying his hand|pg||
mb|4S|nt|dima:  He had a complete count here West turned up with 6-3 in reds and rhe position of club ace was known|pg||
nt|psyck: x generally played as asking for @s here|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Interesting situation. The X sometimes asks for @S, sometimes for shorter Major|pg||
nt|psyck: they may run to 5m|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Looking at the E-W cards only, you would have nothing against playing 4@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: decides to protect the H honors|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Is the grand biddable?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: One way to find the queen of trump is never to play the suit :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: :)|pg||
nt|psyck: 4 i mean|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: South had a pretty clear escape, no doubt|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: West took my advice|pg||
nt|psyck: should be a routine -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: What do you call AQJ9xxxx?  Trumps!|pg||
nt|Walddk1: even ith one card less|pg||
nt|athene: yes 4@H doesn't look too tricky|pg||
nt|copeyj: can just get a @C trick in the bank and cross ruff|pg||
nt|copeyj: i think|pg||
nt|athene: make four tricks in the side suits and some number of trumps on a crossruff|pg||
nt|mgb81: this will be a good text of alice and bryonys temperament if they can get back on te horse and get a solid game under lock and key|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap: "getting a workout over here"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: gordon: "I like it, get to sit in my rocking chair"|pg||
nt|lml: tough choice  |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap at @SAKQ: "was wondering where those were"|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ianmcc: North seems intent|pg||
nt|santyclz: If that is exclusion s should bid it.|pg||
nt|sybarra: voidwood |pg||
nt|sybarra: or exclusion |pg||
nt|ianmcc: 2@s was an ask. Could 5@c be an answer?|pg||
nt|sybarra: alerted at voidwood |pg||
nt|santyclz: N chose not to answer the "ask", that shows a suit whose loser(s) can be determined by b'wood.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: :) will they get to this 4@S difficult tho but a 10 card fit is such an Asset|pg||
nt|iceak:  Favorable lay|pg||
nt|warrens:  6@C is easier to play and a better contract|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: asks about leads.  3/5|pg||
nt|pelu: strange that Sontag didnt leed @H against 3NT - if pd has a singleton prob no defense|pg||
nt|lml: you have to be in this game and if they find the diamond lead then thats unlucky|pg||
pc|d2|nt|peachy: Quite reasonably|pg||
nt|sybarra: @D position (in south) values fully |pg||
pc|d4|nt|sybarra: I think S has to bid it |pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well |pg||
nt|hawe45: Without pre-empt, 4 @H is the normal contract to bid - not to make|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 4th lead, udca|pg||
nt|sybarra: W has nice hand but the flatness of it .....|pg||
nt|psyck: S doesn't know N's hand, & opps x cannot always be trustede|pg||
nt|ady: 6@C might make with the hearts 4-1 so is a little better|pg||
nt|warrens:  some players play a bid to show a double fit over 3@C (such as 4@D), which would make it much easier to find this slam|pg||
nt|warrens:  nevertheless, if N makes a try, I expect S will get excited |pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|warrens:  do they play 3@C as natural and GF or just an artificial GF?|pg||
nt|kemperg: down start|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Declarer would really like an entry to his hand, to throw his @C loser|pg||
nt|lml: woops|pg||
nt|lml: maybe north expects really bad hearts from partner|pg||
nt|lml: that defence is "sleepy"|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: people sometimes panic when they hit a 5-0 trump break|pg||
nt|copeyj: they shouldnt find out about ot until it doesnt matter|pg||
nt|copeyj: just cash winners and x ruff|pg||
nt|ianmcc: agree, source of tricks|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes should make this without any problem|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think I expected North to re-open then - in my experience Icelandic players do not pass much|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: gf|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sybarra: but they only bid 6 in the other room so a push|pg||
nt|santyclz: Well, it's easy to bid from up here but they didn't find it at either table.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sybarra: I was expecting same |pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2@D 1@S 1@C and at least 6 trumps|pg||
nt|athene: sure|pg||
nt|athene: but playing one round of trumps would have been ok if declarer had then remembered rule 1 of crossruffing (take side suit tricks early)|pg||
nt|lml: he can "see" one down if he wins it if his partner has hearts|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|nt|psyck: but here if was a fairly clear choice i guess|pg||
pc|s5|nt|warrens:  this is a very tough way to start a match, with slam auctions on every hand|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: lead consistent with @HAQ but perhaps also @HAJ|pg||
pc|c7|nt|iceak:  not communication to pick up trumps|pg||

nt|brolucius: Pretty good 12-count and partner is vulnerable.|pg||
nt|joest: Again the 3@h rebid is in the context of a club system. West is limited to fewer than 16 or 17|pg||
nt|mikam1: After 1S opener, though he probably downgraded|pg||

nt|brolucius: With 15-count 5-4 hand, he would not be worth a jump at all, it seems.|pg||
nt|joest: that is way too boring :)|pg||
nt|joest: I agree David|pg||
nt|mikam1: I suspect Doug is about to "lose" the heart finesse|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually   with 15 count 55 majros they might open 1@C|pg||
nt|brolucius: Better to bid 1@S and 3@H, as I see it, avoiding the risk of pre-emption.|pg||
nt|joest: Another reason to raise hearts is so that everyone can get to dinner on time|pg||
nt|mikam1: :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, my wife is delaying our dinner so I can watch this. If they continue at this speed, I will not dare keep her waiting.|pg||

nt|brolucius: Have the players been set a strict target of 4 hands per hour?|pg||
nt|joest: don't whether Berk and Sonty play upside down so I don't know how that trick one "4" looked |pg||

nt|copeyj: and another good result for England from next door here|pg||
nt|copeyj: E/W got way overboard and Sally Brock told them it wasn't making|pg||
nt|athene: ok a classic misunderstanding here i think|pg||
nt|athene: if you double then bid a new suit that should not be natural and strong|pg||
nt|suketbombi: another 10 card fit|pg||
nt|psyck: NS have a 4@s sacrifice, but not findable|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: The double asked for shorter/weaker major|pg||
nt|psyck: ok thx|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: When my partners double like that, I lead my doubleton @H and find the ops have missed a 9 card fit there|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Where as my natural @S lead from Kxxx would have hit partner with AQJTx|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: gordon: "I never get the colors right" pratap: 620|pg||
nt|pelu: so games i both room - could be defeated - but making|pg||
nt|lml: all around the heart suit :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: because with a strong shapely hand you start by bidding your suits not by neg Xing|pg||
nt|mgb81: ouch|pg||
nt|athene: so nash's 4@C really caused a lot of problems|pg||
nt|athene: probably interpreted as a cue bid supporting diamonds|pg||
nt|copeyj: according to the movie Gross as south doubled 7@D|pg||
nt|copeyj: I doubt it :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to find 3 nt here for e/w ?|pg||
nt|ady: I think better to play 3 of any other suit after transfer  game forcing   but natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: well its less likely that Sally passed it as north!|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ianmcc: N/S probably 10 tx in @h but not enough in high cards to bid it|pg||
nt|hawe45: Here we might have our fun|pg||
nt|suketbombi: would you open that hnad?|pg||
nt|warrens:  3nt makes, but better stay away from 4@S.  most likely E will get the suit in first|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: Solid 1 @S - I love it...!|pg||
nt|sybarra: best if W plays it but bidding wont permit that |pg||
nt|psyck: lol true, 1NT - 3N can come with wide ranging hands|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT a spot for n/s|pg||
nt|warrens:  S passing, hoping to defend a doubled contract|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mgb81: "I didn't want to push the opponents into 7NT partner"|pg||
nt|dima:  South rates his hand as too good for 2@h overcall|pg||
nt|cuttysark: They sort of have the values, but its a bit of a misfit|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 'Its Bridge Jim, but not as we know it.'|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: Alice Kaye will do well to take the low road and bid 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: well everyone will remember a 7@D not too long ago where the defender with the @DA had to double to gain on the board|pg||
nt|athene: and it wasn't at a humble level either|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Or the 7@D this EW pair bid against Scotland earlier today|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Made on a finesse|pg||
nt|copeyj: Well it was a quasi marked finesse Roland|pg||
nt|copeyj: the hand under AQ@S had overcalled a vulnerable @S|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Yes, they surely knew that :)|pg||
nt|dburn: very good auction, that was|pg||
nt|mgb81: one of the juniors watching has just quoted the old rhyming adage "Misfit -time to quit"|pg||
nt|copeyj: Let's not talk about slams anyway after the one in the first stanza of the day today|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Simon forgets to tell that the hand with @HQxxx bid the grand slam although her partner never cuebid hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk1: But she found a void opposite|pg||
nt|dburn: her partner had guaranteed first-round control in hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk1: When did she do that?|pg||
nt|Walddk1: She never bid hearts|pg||
nt|mgb81: is Alice really still in the tank?|pg||
nt|athene: 6@D looks pushy here and east hasn't got any easy way to just invite it based on the diamond suit quality, has she?|pg||
nt|Walddk1: She jumped from 3NT to 6@C|pg||
nt|dburn: when she bid six clubs as a grand slam try opposite a partner who had cue-bid 4@s when she could have cue-bid 4@h|pg||
nt|steshome:  Bill tries unsuccessfully to get us back on track|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Well, not much action right now, Sarah :)|pg||
nt|athene: there is a lot of action|pg||
nt|athene: but it's all in east's mind at the moment|pg||
nt|athene: she sees a big, fat 920 at the end of the rainbow|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Palli is agressive - was thinking of bidding 4@s|pg||
mb|2N|nt|hawe45: Par is 5 @S doubled 9 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: may get to 4 hearts here |pg||
nt|dima:  West opening is very aggressive, but he's protected by big club structure|pg||
nt|psyck: may have thought, but unlikely to act on it vul :)|pg||
nt|ady: not so easy for south|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdh: West will want to play the hand because of his KJ of @D|pg||
nt|santyclz: His 7 @ss might be an influence too.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Good thing for him that East has a powerful singleton in @S|pg||
nt|santyclz: He really can't afford to make a non-forcing, non-game bid with a 3 loser hand.|pg||
nt|kemperg: looks if 2@S was forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Yes, seems like it|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sybarra: nothing breaks, best to stay low  |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Gazzili in one of its many forms. Presuably East needs 9HCp to give a positive with 2@D|pg||
nt|pelu: but defense is - as i have seen so often - the most difficult disciplin in bridge|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: sorry 1370 even|pg||
nt|mgb81: as predicted she wheels out the woolley cue bid|pg||
nt|steshome:  East's first Lady Milne, I do believe, and the first of many, I'm sure|pg||
nt|copeyj: true speak Sarah|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Absolutely, she is only 24|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphzdh: E-W open every 11 count and most 10 counts :)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Much more dangerous to re-open in the no fit auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: N did not think - my fault|pg||
nt|ady: the bidding has not suggested  solid 7 card suit with north     maybe 3@D better 2nd turn|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I prefer 3@h from W, for me showing a rather good 5-5|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: gordon reached for pass card and withdrew|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: likely to be duplicate auction in other room |pg||
nt|santyclz: You wouldn't really want to be there seeing both hands single dummy, even vul at imps.|pg||
nt|dima:  Not much of a problem in the play again.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: ok:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: The leas of the Queen show either King or Jack|pg||
nt|ady: still a hard call for south  to bid 3NT|pg||
nt|warrens:  now S has to worry about not having a double club stopper as well as having enough running tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: Surprising, that South with 10  HCP and an opening bid from partner, just sells out to 4 @S undoubled|pg||
nt|warrens:  West comes alive.|pg||
nt|ady: hand 1     6@S was bid and made OR    A@H led|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: yes East was a reserve last year just misisng out on her first lady milne but this year she and Bryony qualified comfortably in the trials|pg||
nt|mgb81: good work|pg||
nt|athene: now east still might not want to bid 4@D because that might sound as though she looked for 3nt, didn't find a stop, and gave up|pg||
nt|diumraid: For Live IN RUNNING LADY MILNE SCORES - http://bridge.silvertexter.eu  then browse results then 1o3.txt|pg||
nt|athene: and partner might sometimes pass it or something horrible|pg||
nt|hawe45: He must have seen many bad openings from partner|pg||
nt|hawe45: One more  @H from North  = 620|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: I prefer a direct 4@S bid on the East hand. Don't want the ops to find out about both strength and fit|pg||
nt|kemperg: np here|pg||
pc|h3|nt|santyclz: Needs @ds and @hs both 3-3.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Quite common in Iceland only to lead King vs. NT with a stronger combination, asking for count or unblocking|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Perhaps in this case the queen asked for unblocking|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap: "not much for you, good luck"|pg||
nt|lml: quite enough on the cards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: after commenting on richter's constancy he now seems slightly rattled|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Walddk1: Scotland currently +23 against Wales|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: forearms twitching|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: had a eureka moment when the @H position on  3 was revealed|pg||
pc|hK|nt|warrens:  oh, I hate that 4@D bid.  if North wanted to bid again, why not 3@S, giving partner a chance to bid 3NT?|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: EW in the other room will be hoping that their counterparts bid 6@D, of course|pg||
nt|sybarra: well they never are for me|pg||
nt|ady: if North is going to bid diamonds so many times    better to have jumped to 3@D 2nd roiund   or maybe open 3NT|pg||
nt|warrens:  he's the only one who knows his @D's are solid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: gordon asks about leads and carding.  aker: trumps could be anything|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|nt|athene: 2 down in a grand isn't always so bad|pg||
nt|copeyj: Scotland are currently 33 up|pg||
nt|athene: it's rarely a cause for celebration, of course|pg||
nt|copeyj: not 23|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Someone surely knows how many IMPs Scotland need if England get 23, 24, 25 VPs|pg||
nt|diumraid: For Live IN RUNNING LADY MILNE SCORES - http://bridge.silvertexter.eu  then browse results then 1o3.txt|pg||
nt|dburn: 23 IMPs is 19-11 - Scotland need to win 18-12 to be sure of the Lady Milne|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ady: this can go down if they find spade ruff|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|hawe45: Agree|pg||
pc|s7|nt|peachy: Anything might have worked at this table where N and S were rather timid|pg||
nt|hawe45: Squeeze...|pg||
nt|suketbombi: they will cash there 2 tricks in good time once in witha @C|pg||
pc|s2|nt|steshome:  East did well on this hand, I think|pg||
nt|hawe45: They should have "killed" dummy´s @C 4|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|cuttysark: South decided to cut out the heart ruffs - but has helped decalrer avoid a second trump lose|pg||
nt|psyck: W knew the @h position, but hoped to 2 entries with nothing better to do|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|nt|dburn: she did indeed|pg||
pc|h2|nt|pelu: EW in OR in 3NT?? - 1@S - 1Nt - 3@H - 3NT|pg||
nt|lml: this is all going so well for declarer he has fallen asleep on this card|pg||
nt|pelu: 1NT only semi-forcing on 12 HCP?|pg||
nt|lml: he has 10 tricks now but that seems to make people play more slowly|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: detaches something, puts it back|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|s3|nt|santyclz: (Or jx of @hs.)|pg||

nt|brolucius: Not that you would recognise.|pg||
nt|mikam1: hehe|pg||
nt|joest: as I said...from the opening lead|pg||
pc|h9|nt|brolucius: Her idea of 'planning the contract' was scanning the dummy, looking for A-Q combinations where she might try a finesse.|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|d9|nt|joest: wow, Walter let me down :(|pg||

pc|d3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well  if he can sneak 1@D trick, then @C hook for 12|pg||
nt|mikam1: Well, he's (unfortunately for us) hoping for a diamond duck, then a squeeze thing|pg||
nt|joest: and if it loses he is back to ten|pg||
nt|ahollan1: funny game isn't it|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not at the moment.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :) :)|pg||
nt|joest: of course there is the small matter of what he is pitching from dummy as he runs hismajor winners|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, that will be interesting (yawn...)|pg||
nt|mikam1: Double dummy he can probably make 6 now...squeeze David between diamonds and the club ten - without the count|pg||
nt|joest: This has served one important purpose: it has reminded me of a Thursday appointment with my dentist|pg||

nt|ady: n/s may play a part score in hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|suketbombi: but not much of a fit:)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: an easy 3nt on EW|pg||
mb|2N|nt|Walddk1: http://www.bridgeguys.com/VGlossary/VictoryPointsConversion.html  for a VP scale. Use the 32 column|pg||
nt|copeyj: 4@S is pretty spicy at unfavourable vulnerability|pg||
nt|mgb81: Will North take another bid?|pg||
nt|mgb81: She barely has an opening bid as it is|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfd: Pratap coughs a few times|pg||
mb|4S!|nt|vugraphzdh: West will not stop below slam|pg||
nt|pelu: if East open - then 6NT -1|pg||
nt|lml: I play that as a slam force.  I hope they dont|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: grabs a cough drop.  gordon: "use the Ricola I gave you".  aker: "codeine, that'll take the edge off"|pg||
nt|ralfwil: any idea about 4@s?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: scribble says "...quant raise"|pg||
nt|pelu: looks like asking for max or min - with max bid best minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: With a source of tricks and controls in all 3 suits not bidding slam would be huge position.|pg||
nt|kemperg: does not know E has a lot more than a minimum|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: East has to worthless kings, he has 4 important cards = 14 working HCP|pg||
nt|lml: it is either slam invitation or force asking partner to bid suits|pg||
mb|4N|nt|sybarra: different drury sequence here |pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks quantitative for me|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdh: 2@S by East simply means he does not accept game invitation|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@s showing a minimum here i guess|pg||
nt|psyck: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Does not promise 6 of them. West has shown approx. (9)10-11 I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: 3-card limit raise - looks as if West had a no-cost double, but that might have been takeout of hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: 4@S was perhaps a bit much with that moth-eaten suit, but it did put pressure on West|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridge.is/meistarastig/20102011/magiccontest.htm|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I know the relays here|pg||
nt|dima:  So East is going to relay 4 times to finish in 3NT or 4@s?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Every bid by East is asking relay, West is describing his shape|pg||
nt|sybarra: not an easy hand btw |pg||
nt|ady: this may be uncomfortable|pg||
nt|warrens:  I know S has a good hand, but I would not overcall that suit vul at the 2-level|pg||
nt|lml: the invitational one ... good for them|pg||
nt|lml: to bid suits if accepting usually|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sybarra: for lack of a better lead |pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: director peeks in to see what board they are on and announces to the room "approx half the time is gone."  |pg||
nt|brolucius: Hurray!|pg||
nt|mikam1: Perhaps thinking of underleading...which would lead to a claim |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: at least we have comparisons|pg||
nt|brolucius: If declarer held 3 hearts, he would have only 1 diamonds and might have taken a discard on that suit.|pg||

nt|sybarra: didnt and can not blame him |pg||
nt|iceak:  interesting deal|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Jón Baldursson said when he claimed: "I do not have the courage to finesse @H, but I know it works" :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: :)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: But he did not need the club ruff after all :)|pg||
nt|psyck: decent 6@h, not easy to get to|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: E-W did well (or were lucky) to stay out of a 50% game there|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Still, if partner has 22 you might have a play|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: aker asked:" which way do we do it" and richter answered: "4S is the weaker one"|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 20-22, perhaps a little bit wide?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: that may have been specifically a mild invite|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: Sorry I just dont believe you|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Our operators never make mistakes. Commentators make plenty|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: OK...now I'm cross...lol|pg||
nt|mgb81: That's what happens when you let Scottish bbo oeprators loose on the English match|pg||
nt|hawe45: Result board 5, pls?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridge.is/meistarastig/20102011/magiccontest.htm|pg||
nt|warrens:  big...|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|vugraphzdh: 1@c standard opening|pg||
nt|kemperg: what was 2@D,  @H's?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: No 2@D was natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: SOme scoers in now from boards 1&2: EW played 3NT on 1, but Baldursson brought home 4@S on 2, so all square|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: I think N-S want to stay out of slam here|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|sybarra: tartan usualy 5/5,  maybe  a diam. in with his clubs? |pg||
nt|kemperg: Ah was alerted|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: the "precision" 2 @C |pg||
nt|ady: if east was playing west for a singleton diamond  there was no hurry for the heart   diamond ruff first    |pg||
mb|2C!|nt|warrens:  on board 2, West doubled by 6@C and 6@H, which helped declarer find the right line|pg||
nt|lml: 1@H was a transfer response showing spades|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: gordon puts on his glasses to read aker's explanation|pg||
nt|lml: 2@C showed he had real clubs|pg||
nt|lml: and supposedly a real opening bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: with the pad exposed I can see it says "weaker quant raise" re:4@S last time|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: Difficult bid for North now|pg||
nt|peachy: Bow North has a lot of info to convey, perhaps the only choice at this point is heart cuebid|pg||
nt|peachy: *Now|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: The Law is not protecting E-W very well here, 9 card fit but even 2@H might be expensive|pg||
nt|hawe45: Yes|pg||
nt|psyck: not likely to get there with a key card & trump Q missing|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: North has only promised invitational values, I think, 10+|pg||
nt|psyck: but still possible due to 9 card fit|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|suketbombi: in the context of their earlier opening this East hand is a super max:)|pg||
nt|iceak:  4@s has no chance|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Hard to picture E-W making a game here|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: No wonder when they have only 20 HCP and a misfit|pg||
nt|sybarra: bold 2 @D|pg||
nt|cuttysark: He is a passed hand - an Icelandic passed hand, even|pg||
nt|xenya: but 9 trumps -- an eternal problem|pg||
nt|kemperg: but then he knew the @H length with partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdh: Sævar is thinking. Shall I check if he has hair on the cheast? :)|pg||
nt|peachy: :)|pg||
nt|hawe45: Easily 200 in 2 @H D|pg||
nt|hawe45: Maybe more|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 3NT seems to be reasonable|pg||
mb|2S|nt|copeyj: 1NT 18-19 Bal|pg||
nt|mgb81: This is why you should play 1C 1H X as take out without 4 spades - you have to make stupid passes like the one hre|pg||
nt|dima:  4@c - 4@h - 4@s - pass?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: It would be nice if that were penalties, and when West has denied a major maybe it should be|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: However she came to the party on the next round which is good|pg||
nt|copeyj: in fact you should play X as 4+@S and 1@S as takeout with 4@S in truth Michael :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 3NT looks OK despite poor guard in @c|pg||
nt|hawe45: I vote for 500|pg||
nt|peachy: S takes the plus, not unreasonable these colors|pg||
nt|iceak:  Both think their had is good - but no fit|pg||
nt|psyck: were short of values too anyway to try seriously|pg||
nt|ady: very flat opening east    |pg||
mb|4S|nt|sybarra: cards friendly for declarer |pg||
nt|ianmcc: which red suit would you go for?|pg||
nt|hawe45: When you double hard - defend well|pg||
nt|iceak:  hand|pg||
nt|dima:  BTW was 2@s forcing?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 2@S is forcing, yes|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes must have been|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Probably 3@H was forcing, but not promising another bid|pg||
nt|iceak:  better chance in @c|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: He might take a safety finesse in trumps to get only 11|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|steshome:  The play isn't going to be very interesting here|pg||
nt|hawe45: This is about the first penalty double, I´ve seen for months|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: 4@S played the best way round|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 2@C = "natural, usually < 3 spades"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap: "it's your lead partner"|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mgb81: bah that's too modern for me|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Has partner one diamond, or two?|pg||
nt|frankaus: 2@D did the trick here|pg||
nt|cuttysark: provided he ducks|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome to Frank Budai, Australia |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: EW: 3/5 leads, standard carding|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap: what's the lightest he'd open? what's your style?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: richter: 11? 6-card club suit, 11|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: richter holds his finger up and writes something on the pad|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: aker shifts in his chair, sitting sideways, legs crossed|pg||
nt|pelu: have to plan the play - we can see that almost all cards well placed for Aker - but he dont know|pg||
nt|lml: this isnt that simple|pg||
nt|chessmaste: True, but hard to find a losing line|pg||
nt|ralfwil: win on dummy and play @c10|pg||
nt|lml: he has few entries to the south hand and he doesnt know who has the CA|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|nt|Walddk1: They have a system they are comfortable with and that's what matters|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Sedcude by @D7|pg||
nt|ady: will have to play well    ruff 1 spade low   and 1 with A@H    and combined wirh club finesse|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|peachy: Low level doubled partscore is a rare bird at IMP scoring|pg||
nt|hawe45: East has no way to his hand for playing @H|pg||
pc|cT|nt|dima:  North goes for forcing game with his 4 trumps|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Or even seduced|pg||
pc|c3|nt|warrens:  he can make this if he ruffs in his hand, harder this way|pg||
nt|lml: I like the line Ralf suggested and declarer took|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphzdh: Yes, as much as I fancy to lead my singleton no matter what, this was the moment to hide the singleton @C with the trumps :)|pg||
nt|psyck: only 3@s, 2@h, 2@c for dec due to lack of communication|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|mgb81: Indeed it is playing a natural system where you can raise clubs, but it feels like having to pass th west cards after 1C (1H) isn't a good idea.|pg||
nt|hawe45: This @D Jack is candidate to worse defence in april 2011|pg||
nt|hawe45: Now North can not play @S|pg||
pc|d6|nt|dima:  nice play the @h 8|pg||
nt|psyck: wow, 3N= on deal 5 other table|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hawe45: We might be close to 670 instead of safe 500|pg||
nt|frankaus: @D K  was not well thought out|pg||
pc|dT|nt|frankaus: @DJ|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|hawe45: But the 200 will be the result|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Declarer still has to work on @Cs|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: If South stays away from them|pg||
nt|pelu: 2x! and @D-ruff|pg||
nt|pelu: 2x@s|pg||
nt|chessmaste: On some hands of this type it might be right to play four rounds of diamonds pitching hearts - this was not one of them because of the lack of a side entry to hand|pg||
pc|cK|nt|peachy: he has to open up the clubs now, to get another entry, well done|pg||
nt|dima:  loses to H9x offside otherwise gains|pg||
nt|dima:  Well unless South is brilliant to duck @h AK|pg||
nt|iceak:  expects to go down - minimizing damages|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: I don't think Jón Baldursson ever expects to go down :)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ianmcc: I think he's in trouble|pg||
nt|santyclz: @ds need qx, 10x or 3-3, plus it's easier to pitch three times from dummy, so I'd of course do the opposite of what the world class players do.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|suketbombi: has to hope the !L is with North and restrict trump losser to 1 no other chance |pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks safe peter. If W can overruff he have to give S an entry|pg||
nt|pelu: and @D 5 6 = odd Number - so no Overruff|pg||
pc|s5|nt|suketbombi: @HK|pg||
nt|sybarra: surprised he didnt pitch the @D |pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra: have to sort of untangle this hand |pg||
nt|frankaus: if pd has lead stiff then its irrelavant - id pd has XX then dec must have AK@D tight|pg||
pc|sA|nt|cuttysark: If partner has a stiff diamond you give declarer a cheap trick which might be his ninth - much eaiser for us watching|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like defence will untangle it for  declarer |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|nt|ady: plays itself now |pg||
nt|ady: north will show out 2nd round of trumps|pg||
nt|santyclz: Decided not to stake it all on @sqxx onside.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|ianmcc: he'll have to play @c off|pg||
pc|d9|nt|hawe45: If they get 500, I´m sure they had 800|pg||
nt|iceak:  seems 2 off|pg||
nt|suketbombi: he wanted to come back to his hand witha @D ruff if the dream layout was there|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|s9|nt|ianmcc: I think the defence told him the truth and a @c it should be|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Valid point from a kibitzer - perhaps West more likely to pass 2@DX with AKx|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Clubs not blocked when they break 2-2, so all is well|pg||
nt|ady: now club finesse   and exit|pg||
nt|kemperg: still can do|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|pc|h4|pc|c7|pg||

pc|h4|nt|joest: were you that commentator? :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Weak twos are played much weaker over here than in the US. Players often open three on a sound weak-two bid.|pg||
nt|Walddk3: We will be broadcasting from 2 matches today and tomorrow in the Round of 16, all 4 matches in the quarter-finals Thursday and Friday|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h7|pc|h5|pg||
nt|joest: north-south had some different weapon at the other table.  2NT by the passed hand. then 3@c and 3@h.  Notsure what it meant but it was right this time with teh diamond ace offside|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|mikam1: Of course, it actually helps to have values in the right places...AQ of clubs opposite singleton was not lucky|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: perhaps the 3@C bid in the other room was shortness|pg||
nt|mikam1: David is making it hard for the defense here...tempting to shift to a diamond now|pg||
nt|joest: that's a good guess|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is the "round of 16" but only 14 teams playing right now     15 entered, Diamond has Bye into Round of 8|pg||
nt|mikam1: Doug has a very hard play...this could take awhile|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mikam1: nice play|pg||
nt|mikam1: He must have worked out that with Berkowitz not going after clubs, he should be short|pg||
nt|brolucius: West will have given a count signal on the first round of spades. It is unlikely that declarer would risk playing on the suit wiithout drawing trumps if he held four spades, so ...|pg||

nt|dburn: useful result for ENgland, this - East-West can make 3NT, and North-South can make 1NT|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: "brady, what'd you tell him?" richter: "clubs" aker:"it's hearts and clubs"|pg||
nt|pelu: some would open 2@S in West|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mgb81: England have got another brucey bonus board coming on 24, but all the imps in the world wont matter unless scotland lose some|pg||
nt|athene: there is at least 1/2 hcp's worth of advantage in opening 1nt, after all - surely more?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: learn to love your aces - hands with none are never great hands :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzdh: Well, for South, this is an obvious "maximum" for a 9-15 opening |pg||
pc|s9|nt|ianmcc: not much of interest here|pg||
nt|kemperg: spec tells opening 9-11 and 2@D good rais|pg||
pc|s5|pg||

nt|vugraphzdh: Exiting contract, not clear how declarer will play|pg||

pc|s8|pc|sK|nt|chessmaste: Or 2@D|pg||

nt|ralfwil: as NS have 5-4 in trumps, I prefer a trumph lead from E |pg||
pc|d2|nt|mgb81: 2d is a pretty ineligant contract for ew but it should make comfortably|pg||

pc|d5|pg||
nt|psyck: this will be a costly misunderstanding with a vul game|pg||
nt|ady: 2@S  udca    but throwing a trick|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but this will perhaps work....:)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|henryb:  North will lose her @cA if she does not take it|pg||
nt|peachy: A lot of 2/1 players use 3C here as invitational with long clubs, passable or bid 3NT |pg||
pc|dT|nt|peachy: But to be clear, I am not familiar with their method of course|pg||
nt|iceak:  10 tricks most surely|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: And North liked his ace of @C after partners trial bid, but forgot to dislike his bad shape and probably @S king or @D queen not working|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|hawe45: In fact, 6 @C is no bad contract. Without a @H-lead, it might succeed even with a bad @C-break|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 10 top trick now for declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: And 11 by squeezing East|pg||

nt|joest: so down one and 6 to Aker|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: Doug might have helped him along|pg||
nt|mikam1: East-West didn't bid enough in the closed room here|pg||
nt|brolucius: It was an ambitious raise to game by North in the first place, but these players bid forwardly and that causes pressure on the defenders. |pg||
nt|joest: +230 is never a fun score to enter|pg||
mb|1D|an|2+|mb|1S|nt|mikam1: Yes, you're right Jack... Doug could have helped |pg||
mb|d|nt|joest: Now what does Walter bid over the negative X?  2@d?  2@s doesn't quite give thehand justice|pg||
nt|brolucius: These hands fit very well, unlike the hands on the last board.|pg||
mb|2C|an|cue bid (transfer)|nt|joest: 3@c fit showing is possible but you want to have four spades to do that|pg||
mb|2D|nt|joest: so his 2@c was a transfer to 2@d, treating ishand like a limit/constructive raise in spades|pg||
nt|mikam1: In the other room, mixed raise by west and signoff by east...club fit was never disclosed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the 'transfer' response leaves room for later @C bid   that would definitely help Simson evaluate his hand|pg||
nt|brolucius: Difficult hand for East to evaluate. He has a good point-count but no shape.|pg||
mb|p|an|encouraging|nt|mikam1: Actually diamond bids by N-S will help the opposition|pg||
mb|3D|nt|brolucius: Pass is forcing, since they are forced to 2@S at least.|pg||
nt|joest: I don't understand 'pass encouraging'.  Could it go all pass even conceivably?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|brolucius: Probably not, onmce West has shown a sound raise to 2@S.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: stronger than 2@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|joest: fair enough|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: I have had some partners where pass meant 'let's forget all about 2@s" :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|brolucius: I was going to say 'well bid', but in truth it is a game that any pair would be sad to miss.|pg||
nt|mikam1: Good judgment by E-W|pg||
nt|mikam1: I said it for you David|pg||
nt|brolucius: I can understand why you are using the past tense for such partners, Jack.|pg||
nt|joest: I like to play pass is encouraging here as well|pg||
nt|brolucius: When you are forced to 2@S, bidding that contract is the weakest action. (But many play it the other way, where a Pass is weaker)|pg||
nt|mikam1: Not clear how to play this one...ruff and then what?|pg||
nt|joest: wondering that myself.  suffice it to say they did well to make SIX in the other room|pg||
nt|mikam1: Perhaps club to the jack?  Might even do well to lose the finesse.|pg||

nt|mgb81: So in the other room Ruth Connelly, who is somewhat of an agressive bidder, bid 1C, then 2C and gave herself 5C when 4S came back to her|pg||
nt|mgb81: Sally Brock though long and hard whether to bid 5S, but after some though she doubled for penalties.|pg||
nt|athene: if west really wanted to bid over 4@H then at least bid 4NT so partner can choose diamonds when it's right|pg||
nt|hawe45: There is a faster method to get 660 - just claim after the lead|pg||
nt|iceak:  4@h shaky|pg||

nt|mgb81: It doesnt even look like 4S is that easy - if south plays ace, king and ruff s diamond low east can overuff the 7 with the 8 and bang another turmp back|pg||
nt|sybarra: some part score here|pg||
nt|ianmcc: thin 4@s here|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: gordon grimaces|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|mgb81: Moya Kelly as south had a few choices after 1C P 1H - she could double, bid 2NT, or just 1S.|pg||
nt|steshome:  Um, I'm with Simon on this one|pg||
nt|athene: the problem is if you show the 5-5 you can't really show the values - 2nt would usually be weaker|pg||
nt|copeyj: Why Sarah, what does Simon think? :)|pg||
nt|ady: wonder if east will compet   4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: can they get to it (nad do you want to be in it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: This way he got to bid both Dima :) 1 and 3 @H|pg||
nt|iceak:  south bids 4@h most likely|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe it is like opening 2 nt? |pg||
nt|ady: must be north 3NT|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: she doesn't know but she knows you will be right|pg||
nt|athene: i'm with you too|pg||
nt|ianmcc: no & no|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: eeek|pg||
nt|steshome:  Yes, you're right Bill made the 4NT comment.  But of course I'm with you in any event|pg||
nt|Walddk1: It does not help England's cause that the Welsh are committing suicide at the moment|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: South was in a scary balancing position|pg||
nt|friggi: but, against weak NT dbl should be 12+|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: on non @h lead dec has to find @s fin to make|pg||

nt|lml: the cards are very friendly|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: not sure what 3@D was meant to be.  jump cue as mixed raise is popular treatment|pg||
nt|pelu: u are right, Linda|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: gordon excuses himself from the enclosure|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mgb81: eek! I can understand both of EW actions (unlike -360 against 1S X) but this is going to get murdered on a trump lead|pg||
nt|dima:  :)|pg||
nt|dima:  seems natural to play double finesse in @d|pg||
nt|iceak:  Karl probably plays low @s and JÃ³n low @d|pg||
nt|iceak:  SÃ¦var sry|pg||
nt|kemperg: but N has a bad 12|pg||
nt|friggi: right|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: time for north to get out the big stick of justice|pg||
nt|athene: the 5-level is no time to volunteer 2-card support|pg||
nt|mgb81: this will probably be 1100 as well|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but a big mistake missing at least 4@s|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap asks him to bring water when he returns|pg||
pc|c3|nt|peachy: Wish I knew their methods, but I dont|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Showing 4@H and 5+ @C|pg||
nt|peachy: There is alert on 3C|pg||
nt|sybarra: well... |pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: 6-5 come alive, yes - but only when you actually have a trump fit in one of your long suits|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 3@C probably puppet to 3@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: tought to time this one |pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think a balanced 18-19 was included in 2@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: it was|pg||
nt|sybarra: hence the 2 @S alert |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Then one uses all sorts of transfers and relays and ends in 3NT|pg||
nt|lml: 6 is not a good contract but 4 is|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: west has followed the rule "6-2 come alive"|pg||
nt|athene: or perhaps it should be "6-2 in the glue"|pg||
nt|Walddk1: I think we all agree that 3@H was an overbid|pg||
nt|mgb81: how about "6-5-2, that wont do"|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: people often bid too aggressively when they have shortage in opps' suit but not that big a fit for partner|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Friendly defence may keep this to 800|pg||
nt|athene: these hands are really difficult to control|pg||
nt|athene: when the ruffing value is with only 2 trumps - even with 3 trumps it can get out of hand very easily|pg||
nt|mgb81: Alice can get pout for 800 now - it looks like she can cross ruff but the 7 of hearts will come into play|pg||
pc|d8|nt|santyclz: LOTT say 16 tricks, looks more like 18 to me.|pg||
nt|santyclz: (says)|pg||
nt|sybarra: low spade and ?|pg||
nt|dima:  now low @d and he has to guess |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Actually a trump from West kills the contract|pg||
nt|dima:  true heart is better as specs mention|pg||
nt|sybarra: scary spot,  |pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure it can be made |pg||
pc|d4|nt|ady: takes Q@D lead   and a diamond ruff to beat 4 hearts motre than 1|pg||
pc|s7|nt|santyclz: Perhaps only 17.|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|sA|nt|peachy: ok, then 3NT after that apparently showed the clubs?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Attitude lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: club return easy,  @D a guess, (with good guess will bring it home) hts and messes up communication |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Defenders must take care not to set up that long club - maybe had to switch to hearts|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: clubs 4/4  is that enough?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk1: Scotland let a 4@S through that should have gone down as the play went, so +29 only now|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry a @C lead - impossible to find - will defeat 6@s :):)|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: north would have done better to keep the spades|pg||
nt|mgb81: hello|pg||
nt|mgb81: this looks like she's in the game now....|pg||
nt|athene: just let a little club go - what use is that?|pg||
nt|mgb81: that is a very expensive slip from south - turned 800 into 300 if declarer reads it right|pg||
nt|athene: if north had kept all her spades this was 1100 just the same|pg||
nt|athene: just ace and a trump, end of story|pg||
nt|mgb81: now eats has virtually claim on a cross ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk1: This is the board where Wales were allowed to make 4@S|pg||
nt|steshome:  Bit barking to play at the 5-level on a grotty 8-card fit.  Mind you, the opponents played at the 5-level on a grotty 7-card fit |pg||
nt|sybarra: opps|pg||
nt|iceak:  @h Q could drop - declares does not know|pg||
nt|cuttysark: With the heart finesse|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: north wondering whether to ruff ace in other to return that desperately-needed trump, i suppose|pg||
nt|sybarra: true|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
nt|friggi: at persent time weak NT is very popular in Iceland|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|mgb81: Who do you think was more wild on this hand then Sarah? East or West?|pg||

pc|s3|pg||
nt|pelu: or a stronger drink? :)|pg||
nt|lml: the simple double worked out well|pg||
mc|12|nt|lml: he could have been all over the auction in diamonds and he avoided that|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: aker also excuses hiimself to get water as gordon has not returned|pg||
nt|pelu: but S only know that his pd has 3-4 card @D - so X is the normal bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap mutters "my fault", asks richter if he had @HK|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap: "230.  I had a 5323 14-count.  two little diamonds.  your hand was a monster.  I like 4@S more than 3@D if you're going to take one bid"|pg||

nt|lml: I find the @HK a bit confusing.  I like to save that kind of card for something other than just a higher ranking suit please|pg||
nt|pelu: why signal for @D - if defense has a @D-trick it can¨'t go away|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: gordon left the @HA faced a while deciding what @HK was about|pg||
nt|lml: the one thing he doesnt want is another heart|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: director announces "45 minutes remain"|pg||
nt|lml: but I dont think Gordong will lead a heart no matter what he thinks the @HK is|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: should be able to play 5 1/2 boards in 45 minutes but we've been well behind that pace|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: oops, 6 1/2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: gordon sighs, crosses his arms.  not at all rushed by the announcement|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the safe play is to try to get 2 @c tricks first. If not E must have a @d trick|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: gordon scratches his head, hovers over his cards|pg||

nt|vugraphzaw: 13 imps this set...|pg||
nt|Walddk1: hmmm|pg||
nt|Walddk1: I am talking VPs, you IMPs|pg||
nt|mgb81: I the other room I'm afraid Ruth has started to tilt by opening a completely normal weak 2 hand with 3H|pg||
nt|mgb81: It didn't lead her to any harm though this time|pg||
nt|hawe45: 6 @D seem better than 6 @H here|pg||
nt|sybarra: Henry or Liz have you even been to this tourney?|pg||
nt|psyck: quite a hand here|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|ady: then 9 back  on 5th board|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: And Sparisjóður Siglufjarðar are fithting all they can|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Leading 22-8 in the other match|pg||
nt|friggi: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: They need to get up to 25 and hope that Grant Thornton go down to 10|pg||
nt|friggi: it is a lot of hope:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: This has been a well played, low scoring, match so far|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: aker: "how are the clubs?" pratap: "4-4.  4-3 or whatever"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: gordon: "I had 2"|pg||
nt|pelu: Johnson-Simon bid 5@H - and NS 5@S in OR :(|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap: "Par was achieved.  scary, but achieved"|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: 9 boards 12 imps so far, this has been good bridge.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Walddk1: it's like comparing apples and oranges|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 3 or 4 @S?|pg||
nt|psyck: 3|pg||
nt|pelu: so 5 IMP more for Aker|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mgb81: Ah I didnt actually see she was 3rd in seat I thought she was first|pg||
nt|hawe45: No need for finding the @C Queen|pg||
nt|iceak:  guess 1NT|pg||
mb|d|nt|cuttysark: Not this one - they have a festival in Ferbuary which I attended once - highly recommended|pg||
nt|henryb:  Well not this one for sure, which is an Iceland championship; I was invited once to the Festival but forced to decline because of work conflicts|pg||
nt|psyck: 4 at nv|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: Now it's more understandable|pg||
nt|mgb81: same as here|pg||
nt|iceak:  wrong as expected|pg||
nt|sybarra: got to get you invited back now Henry :)|pg||
nt|friggi: go bidding by Hrólfur|pg||
nt|santyclz: 8 bds 11 imps.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Dangerous N-S hands|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Can easily get to high|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: east might have considered 3@C|pg||
nt|athene: that has to be a fit bid as a passed hand|pg||
nt|mgb81: Ah - I am now told that the actual auction was 2H (2S) 3H all pass|pg||
nt|sybarra: N finding the 1 @S call "interesting" |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: I think E-W will not bid slam unless N-S push them by 1 more @S bid?!?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Sorry - I am behind the times - the Festival is in January now. |pg||
nt|pelu: looks like cheap insurence - but cost 5 + 5 = 10 IMP|pg||
mb|d|an|ostensibly takeout|nt|Walddk1: Good poin Bill|pg||
nt|Walddk1: point even|pg||
nt|santyclz: How many for a 2@s bid on 1st round?|pg||
nt|jbennet: again at this situations its good to have 2 ways to bid spades.|pg||
nt|jbennet: N now faces a guess. does South have full valus or does he only competing?|pg||
nt|dima:  2@d is likely to be a constructive @h raise - 7-9 or so with 2@h raise reserved for really junky hands|pg||
nt|jbennet: the same should be applied to NS.|pg||
nt|iceak:  seems 4 no more than 9 tricks in @s|pg||
nt|jbennet: so 2H and 2 sp both show spade suit.|pg||
nt|dima:  North might try 3@h as gametry in @s|pg||
nt|sybarra: brrrrrrrrr |pg||
nt|cuttysark: No, it was great!|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: East was wise not to double|pg||
nt|psyck: cheaply bought, EW make some 11 tricks in @s probably|pg||
nt|xenya: E's pass looks strange|pg||
nt|ady: 13 tricks for n/s    but  needs 2 3-3 splits|pg||
nt|ady: may settle for game|pg||
nt|friggi: dbl is min 4@H + values|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: North was hoping the opponents would bid 4@S, not his partner :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: had anyone of you tried 3nt as W?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 3NT too rich but I liked 3@H over 1@H|pg||
mb|4S|nt|vugraphzdh: But this might easily be a double game swing|pg||
nt|pelu: agree with 3@H, John|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: aker writes: "X = ?", gordon shrugs|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south might double here rather than bidding 3@S? |pg||
nt|hawe45: I would never bid 3 @S in this situation - just helping opponents|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Well, depends on what 2@S meant|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: I am quite confident, that East knows, who is in position of the @C Queen = 680|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 2@S was 8-13 balanced, no @S stopper|pg||
nt|henryb:  you stay inside where it is warm and well lit -- always dark outside|pg||
mb|5C|nt|athene: so as not to overstate the support|pg||
nt|mgb81: NS can't make very much either a club ruff or a heart trick for the second undertrick|pg||
nt|steshome:  Double's probably game-try|pg||
nt|jbennet: yes but of south only had competing valus 3 sp is likely to be too high|pg||
nt|dima:  Oh well he makes Sandra Landy game try - bid it first then try to make it|pg||
nt|sybarra: LOL|pg||
nt|iceak:  Favorable @c|pg||
nt|dima:  They might know each others 3rd seat opening bids |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Friendly @C layout might see this home|pg||
nt|dima:  brilliant small @h lead?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: A small @H lead would have been killing|pg||
nt|iceak:  JÃ³n more likely to play small @c|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Seems that declarer might be tempted to work on @D which will not work|pg||
nt|henryb:  and I understand the hospitality is fantastic|pg||
nt|friggi: but a nice slam try by Oddur|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Impossible, in my opinion, not to give it a shot|pg||
nt|pelu: many IMP on stake here|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: lucky not to get hit in this|pg||
nt|athene: east might well consider double if really in need of imps|pg||
nt|jbennet: seems 4 sp too high.|pg||
nt|jbennet: but lucky break makes it possible.|pg||
nt|ady: difficult  even to be confident of a small slam |pg||
mb|5D|nt|psyck: E had some defensive cards in @h, but the rest of his hand was massively offensive|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: smooth 5@D from pratap|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: East thought there might be game if partner had some heart support - when he does not, screeching brakes|pg||
nt|sybarra: a spec told me:  16 cm of snow fell last night - hasn't snowed this much in may for 24 years in Iceland|pg||
nt|warrens:  6@H looks like the right contract.  has many chances (either suit 3-3 or a spade ruff in dummy overruffed by the hand with 4 @H's or clubs setting up)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: might be expecting more than A6 from the double|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: well e/w are missing some spots in @D,   |pg||
nt|sybarra: I do not see a way to make this|pg||
nt|ianmcc: -100 probably good going|pg||
nt|iceak:  plays @h to K - for a trump|pg||
nt|friggi: not imp 50%|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not a bad slam except the 1 minor flaw...|pg||
nt|pelu: Gordon found the winning bid - but his X confused - or mislead partner|pg||
nt|ralfwil: cannot understand 5@d from E . W didn´t bid 4nt|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: other room has caught up and johnson did bid 3@H with the west hand|pg||
nt|lml: I am not a big fan of the double anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: no Ralf but he X 3@S - 5@C now sh be 6-4 i minor|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap picks up his cards rather than putting out another green one|pg||
pc|sK|nt|psyck: sure did not expect the biddingto die down before 4@s|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|steshome:  With a 10-count opposite a weak two?  Nah|pg||
nt|psyck: a loser in each suit here...|pg||
nt|xenya: i think E had a clear raise to 4 -- as a double shot at least|pg||
nt|psyck: true|pg||
nt|santyclz: It violates Burn's Rule of 8.|pg||
nt|friggi: nice bidding by N-S|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|lml: interesting|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: that explains that|pg||
nt|ralfwil: don´t agree. in that case W has at least 7-4 with 5@c|pg||
nt|lml: -300 or 400 is still going to lose quite a few imps|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: richter never put out the final pass.  the red X on top misled me|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but landed cheaper than in 5@cX|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Vugraphzfd: undoubled.  sorry for the confusion|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hawe45: 3 @S X = 800, better than game|pg||
nt|jbennet: i think though best bet is too draw trumps ending in dummy and then start the clubs|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mgb81: East does best to switch to hearts and then if north finesses she can give a club ruff for 3 down|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Declarer might get fatally shortened when West gets his @D trick|pg||
nt|kemperg: trump start was better|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: If declarer goes for @D he might make it|pg||
nt|friggi: we do not like rules in Iceland:)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Burn's Rule of 8:  Subtract the number of aces the opps hold from 8.  Don't bid to that level.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: That's an excellent rule :)  I will try to memorize that|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: He might try a ruffing finesse in @D|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: well yes, only a 10 count, but 3 very likely tricks|pg||
nt|pelu: but Ralf for sure West sh have 4 card @D for his X - dont u agree?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|psyck: yes, he has too much work to do with too many cards unfav|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d6|nt|iceak:  propably vins |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: West's 3@S bid was not effective|pg||
nt|friggi: yes|pg||
nt|kemperg: nice rule|pg||
nt|lml: 4 down is 11 imps to aker|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|xenya: should persevere with diamonds for 1 off|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 1@S or 4@S would have worked better on this hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: But with a passed partner 3@S is a reasonable shot|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Then when 4@H comes to him undoubled, perhaps he should consider 4@S|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mgb81: I suppose it's a bit fancifl to think that north will play ace of trumps and sprun the diamond finesse to get out for down two anyway|pg||
nt|psyck: did E pass 4@h smoothly?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Burn's Laws.  3 of them:  http://www.blakjak.demon.co.uk/burn_law.htm|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|s7|nt|dima:  well done|pg||
nt|henryb:  16 cm is much more impressive than 6 inches isn't it|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|kemperg: only has to ruff 3@C's|pg||
nt|lml: 5 down is worth just 1 more imp|pg||
nt|lml: however you look at it the doubled served no purpose except to confuse partner|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mgb81: NIBU is the Northern Ireland Bridge Union, in effect the Northern Ireland second team|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Seems nobody tries to draw trump here - can't have any embankments to walk|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mgb81: added to make up the round robin to an even number|pg||
nt|mgb81: this will be 3 down and 4 imps to England|pg||
nt|athene: are england allowed to give some of their imps to wales for this match?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|pelu: agree 100%, Linda|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: gordon faced dummy one card at a time.  pratap visibly taken back by the sight of it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: aker fidgety at the table|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hJ|nt|sybarra: does he have the count?  I think so |pg||
pc|d5|pc|h5|pg||
nt|mgb81: uh oh|pg||
nt|lml: -500 (-400+-100) is worth 11 imps.  You can see the imp scale by hovering over the players names|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mgb81: now she's in a mess - King from east and a diamond and i think she will be 4 down?|pg||
nt|pelu: in CR the bidding - as u can see by pointing on contract: 1@H and 3@H by West - 3Nt and NS never found the @S-suit in bidding|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: except pratap-gordon's teammates were +100|pg||
nt|lml: right|pg||
nt|pelu: not the best defense - but never mind - +Imps for NS|pg||
nt|lml: so the spec who said 7 iimps got it right if they do go 4 down|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: extracts @D9 and puts it back|pg||
pc|h9|nt|Walddk1: England leading now. Scotland only 11 ahead against Wales; that is 16-14 VP|pg||

nt|Walddk1: It does not matter much what happens at this table from now on. It is being decided in the Scotland-Wales match|pg||

nt|Walddk1: Poetry in motion|pg||
nt|hawe45: A @H-contract now, possibly|pg||
nt|dima:  Pretty strong set for NS so far - that 4@h on N8 was a bit of a stretch but could have also made|pg||
nt|iceak:  4@s or 5@d seems|pg||
nt|psyck: I would probably have hesitated a bit on 4@h, & having hesitated, bid 4@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: East did not hesitate much, anyway we are playing on screens|pg||
nt|psyck: aah, ok thx|pg||
nt|friggi: sure it was|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but 3@h - 3nt or a direct 3nt was a winning decision (-1 in 3nt)|pg||
nt|lml: the last 4 boards have been rather unpleasant for Gordon.  They obviously need to play faster|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: aker apologizes for something, gordon asks about pratap's hand, richter shakes his head|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: nice 4 @H  likely makng +1 for e/w|pg||
nt|hawe45: The @S 10 in East is the only card to defeat 7 @H, but also a @S-lead kills it|pg||
nt|hawe45: Black squeeze against West|pg||
nt|friggi: Hrólfur is a very good player|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: save in 4 @S?  a trick in every suit  |pg||

nt|hawe45: Now East can really "disturb" the slam-bidding|pg||
nt|sybarra: here is that bid again |pg||
nt|henryb:  another hand (see board 1) where 3N is best despite the void|pg||
nt|sybarra: 18-19 balanced|pg||

mb|1C|nt|Walddk1: Investigating|pg||
nt|athene: spade lead very costly in the other room|pg||
nt|hawe45: But the more E/W bid @D, the more South will be happy for partners values - showed in controls allready|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Well, East seems to think that 2@D was a takeout of @Ds!|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Yet another slam possibly|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: I did not note the time when director announced 45 min|pg||
nt|ralfwil: even 5 peter|pg||

nt|hawe45: Good practical bid by South|pg||
nt|cuttysark: The one we just saw has been flattened|pg||
nt|psyck: but it also depends on their preemptive style|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: after 2nt they are likely to end in 4@H the same in here|pg||
nt|athene: then east just has to lead a diamond rather than a spade|pg||
nt|sybarra: right, didnt notice the club ruffs|pg||
nt|ralfwil: more than 20 minutes ago|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: nominal schedule says 1000-1210 for this quarter|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdh: I actually wondered if he would open 6@H|pg||
nt|sybarra: S 2 @S looked like a 2 suited (tartan type) bid |pg||
nt|iceak:  no reason to find play to loose 2 trump tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: some call it Muiderberg|pg||
nt|sybarra: tartan's are 5/5  and muiderberg can be 5/4+  |pg||
mb|2N|nt|santyclz: Many play 3@c to be good w/@hs.|pg||
nt|hawe45: @D-lead - let´s see Søvar make the overtrick - but he will probably put his money on a @C-finesse. But with spectators, one is obliged to make the squeeze|pg||
nt|sybarra: I guess 2 @H says nothing about hts? |pg||
nt|friggi: sure it is|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Not sure, but I think 1NT asks for controls (A = 2, K = 1)  2@D showing 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: cards fit well for EW here|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Sequences over the mult-strong-meaning 2@C must be quite complex|pg||
nt|ady: south using evasive action   intending to pass any reply to stayman|pg||
mb|3D|nt|vugraphzdh: Claim on a @C finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: sorry strong with hts|pg||
nt|psyck: compare this with the deal 9 2@c opening :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Yes, this one is quite more normal|pg||
mb|3H|nt|psyck: pther table did not bother to investigate grand on deal 9 either|pg||
nt|friggi: they should reach 6@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|psyck: right|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: I am told that Maida Grant has just found the onlylead to beat a game against Wales that her team-mates missed|pg||
nt|athene: there's surely a good case for just bidding 4@H over 2nt with that north hand?|pg||
nt|mgb81: so it might be 6 to Scotland instead of a possible 10 to Wales|pg||
nt|ady: this looks down 1  on top   I think n/s will be happy to conceed 50|pg||
nt|ady: have we got stuck?|pg||
mb|p|nt|steshome:  Checking back for the 4-4 spade fit - might play better|pg||
nt|sybarra: Isak (our operator) is doing a great job of showing the alerts |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Indeed he is :) It's a fiddly process, but maybe he knows ahen they are coming|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Wonder if they have worked out who is on lead yet|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think he would agree, you get used to it as operator|pg||
nt|henryb:  standard transfer auction|pg||
nt|kemperg: in the wrong hand then:(|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 3@D possibly showed @D control, which slows South down|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdh: This is why I like to lead a low trump from quack doubleton :)|pg||
nt|friggi: yes - must be|pg||
nt|pelu: 15 boards - normal time id 15 x 7,5 + 15 min for the screens = 128 min|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: auction is correct.  sorry for the glitch while checking the web page|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mgb81: Here North south employ a common treatment whereby 3S is forcing with 4 spades and 4 or 6 hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk1: No one seems to know how they break a tie. I asked 5 'competent' people|pg||
nt|dima:  next case|pg||
nt|sybarra: need take the club or they dont get it|pg||
nt|dima:  might try to steal a heart trick but if it must be 5-5 then unlikely to work|pg||
nt|warrens:  a reasonabl play by North, hoping to pitch 2 @H's from dummy on his clubs if this held|pg||
nt|ady: now worried about losing 3 heart tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: lot of thinking about defense|pg||
nt|pelu: so 130 min is sceduled = still 15 min|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: @ST shows J or shortness|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: aker corrects himself: when dummy shows strong balanced hand leads are standard|pg||
nt|pelu: play @D in trick 2 = 12 tricks|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: someone tell gordon or we'll be here all day|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: sitting back with his arms crossed|pg||

pc|s6|nt|mgb81: with 5H and 4S north bids 3H waiting to hear a 4 card spade suit from south|pg||

nt|friggi: 1S slam is better|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: director announced "20 mins" a minute ago.  doubt we'll even be on board 15 by then.  curious whether they take it away|pg||

pc|h7|nt|mgb81: Oh apparently the Scots have just let through the game....|pg||
nt|mgb81: This means Wales have pulled to within 1imp|pg||
nt|athene: i have quiet confidence in wales to do what needs to be done|pg||
nt|dima:  With KJx in trumps it did not really look that one WANTS to ruff|pg||
nt|iceak:  sure - but in this|pg||
nt|kemperg: no was not looking good|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mgb81: and England are Leading the Lady MIlne for the first time this tournament!!!|pg||
nt|Walddk1: 54-0 to Wales over the last 8 boards, two of which were flat|pg||
nt|mgb81: Mean while in 4H North had no way to avoid losing 3 trumps to go with the king of spades and another completely wasted ten imps to England|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|henryb:  I think the right (and on this hand successful) line is two rounds of trumps, cash the @dA, and three rounds of spades|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|cuttysark: It looks as if 2@D was a transfer and 3@D showed 4-5, but last time he transferred into a 4card spade suit.....|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|nt|xenya: this will go down 2, but 4@S NS appears to be makeable|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||

pc|d3|pc|dT|nt|psyck: I guess NS play upside down carding|pg||

nt|mgb81: I really wish the players would hurry up and finish so we can switch to the Wales match!|pg||
nt|mgb81: Here 4S is off in top tricks on a heart lead..but not if east switches at trick 2 as happened in another match|pg||
nt|hawe45: Slam without a @C-lead here|pg||
nt|jbennet: if singleton lead then club loser goes away.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: The lead does not matter. If you lead singleton @D you loose the @C trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 4@H should make E-W here, allthough the trumps are weak|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: gordon asks what were the colors again, complains about the team scoresheet (where vul is at the bottom in small type)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|henryb:  I think 2@d showed gf values opposite 18-19 and 2@h showed 18-19, then 3@d was a transfer and 3@h showed 3 hearts and not 4@s|pg||

nt|vugraphzdh: Grant Thornton is now only leading by 4 VP|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: N-S have a makable 4@H here|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: The theory is to save room with the stronger hand for a game try.  I'm not convinced there is any real advantage.|pg||

nt|xenya: tough to get there though?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mgb81: Off for east not to respond - at green I'd have though 1H had some appeal|pg||

mb|p|nt|psyck: yes|pg||
nt|psyck: W hand not improved by 2@d overcall either|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: West is close to a maximum Precision @S opening.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: We can't say how they break a tie because there doesn't seem to be anything in the regulations|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Which is very strange|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 4@s doubled will be interesting|pg||
nt|jbennet: another case for lebensohl 1NT response.|pg||

nt|dima:  11-13|pg||
nt|sybarra: club system e/w |pg||
nt|jbennet: 3 clubs asks: "where"|pg||
nt|psyck: no @d cue meaning they should not crosss 5@c level|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|psyck: but with the @c break...|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: The fact that North did not double 4@H might help South on the lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: sometimes the players let me read their explanation pads, sometimes not|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk1: Stephen, can we leave the table open for confirmed results, please?|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: ok|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe W should not have raised with a purely defensive hand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Running scores at  http://www.bridge.is/meistarastig/20102011/magiccontest.htm  |pg||
pc|d8|nt|santyclz: So both significant swings so far have gone against Vestri.  |pg||
nt|hawe45: 4 @H|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|jbennet: "3NT i have weak doubleton in clubs"|pg||
nt|dima:  One might need mirrors to make this one|pg||
nt|psyck: so play 4@hx as do not lead @h|pg||
nt|psyck: *some...|pg||
nt|pelu: some pairs use 2@D here to let W decide|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphzdh: South now knows about 2-2 in @Cs|pg||
nt|hawe45: 4 @S can make 620 - "can"|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: And he actually knows that 4@D is most likely the "right spot"|pg||
nt|hawe45: 4 @S is he right spot|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: But vulnerable at IMPS he will guess some game|pg||
nt|dima:  ok one problem solved|pg||
nt|iceak:  first problem solved|pg||
pc|c4|nt|peachy: I would rather try a Moysian than 4D|pg||
nt|jbennet: OK then ; then 4 major is no longer an option. EK stiff oppsite xx creates too many loseres in 4 major.|pg||
nt|sybarra: lead is helpful |pg||
nt|henryb:  well worth 10-12|pg||
nt|cuttysark: North hoping that South has the singleton|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Aðalsteinn is world champion from Yokohama 1991|pg||
nt|psyck: oh well|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c7|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mgb81: Declarer made a unusual play when she ducked the club lead in both hands|pg||
nt|peachy: if ten tricks are makeable some way|pg||
nt|hawe45: Why did South NOT support partners 3 @S - instead of bidding what he had allready showed|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Well bid by N-S I think|pg||
nt|lml: still I think 2@H will likely make|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mgb81: had she ducked the second club from dummy she would have made 2 tricks which would have been enough. as it is a spade switch will lead her to down one I think|pg||
nt|cuttysark: As are his pair in the other room, I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: right you are McGowan|pg||
nt|sybarra: this was the team that was the surprise winner |pg||
nt|psyck: quite normal to see a lot of overbidding in the final stages i guess, they even got to 6@hx OR in the 5@hx-2 deal |pg||
pc|c2|nt|peachy: After AK clubs located and now SK, the HQ will not be hard to locate as with opening hand, E likely would have said something on 1D|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: South has no reason to think that @S are better than @H, the @H fit is actually much better|pg||
nt|ady: dont exit wirh small spade|pg||
nt|santyclz: Lovely suit for a vul overcall.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: director peeks in, frowns, departs|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|sybarra: W is likely to take the @H hook |pg||
nt|iceak:  No reason to do othervise|pg||
nt|jbennet: so if playong a good system, EW reaches 3 NT which is as everybody can see.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: thanks to all of you who've stayed with us|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap calls for heart and has second thoughts when he sees @H7|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk1: Unofficially, we have a tie now. Scotland winning by 11 IMPs, just enough for 17-13 VPs|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Exciting|pg||
pc|h4|nt|santyclz: I'd be tempted to double finesse the @ss on the auction.|pg||
nt|psyck: As Stefan suggested, S got the lead right|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ady: even then could not make|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|lml: thanks :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: chorus of beeping clocks|pg||
nt|lml: thanks|pg||
pc|h6|nt|hawe45: Might be right, but WHY did´nt North bid 4 @H himself, South brought no new info|pg||
nt|psyck: easier in 6 than 5 though|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: This will not be pretty|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: In 6 the ace of @D lead stands out|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Holding a likely trump trick|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sybarra: I wonder if you would |pg||
nt|sybarra: the lead was an obvious singleton |pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jbennet: far better than 4 spades.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|santyclz: So putting n on lead is no danger.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk1: For newcomers ....|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|psyck: 2 trumps as it turned out|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|hJ|pc|dT|nt|Walddk1: Unofficially, we have a tie now. Scotland winning by 11 IMPs, just enough for 17-13 VPs|pg||
nt|sybarra: unless S had and entry|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|pelu: they are now on last board in OR - so also late there|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: has aker pinpointed or concealed position of @SQ and @DK?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: they lead 2nd from sequences so @DK seems marked in N|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with souths defense, E should realise that trumps are not so well placed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap in no hurry|pg||
nt|lml: hoping for clock to run out?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: director patrias returns to look on disapprovingly|pg||
pc|s3|nt|peachy: But nothing saves this hand for declarer|pg||
nt|lml: we used to say he is playing for an earthquake|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|iceak:  @d and @h back|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s5|pc|s2|nt|Walddk1: We will keep this table open for confirmed results|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: PA: "well into overtime  now"|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h5|pc|sT|nt|mgb81: it looks like east is squeezed but she is didscarding after declarer so shes ok|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c8|nt|mikam1: This will be a tricky hand to play no doubt|pg||
nt|joest: this will be tricky|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C didn't promise a 4-card major|pg||
nt|joest: you beat me|pg||
nt|mikam1: :) |pg||
nt|joest: it just denied a five card one|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right   and 3@H said   4@S, not 4@H|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mikam1: Declarer may fear losing to North's (presumed) spade honor...then getting overruffed in clubs|pg||
nt|joest: that argues for banging out ace and another spade|pg||
nt|mikam1: If the defense wins and continues clubs that is|pg||
nt|mikam1: Yes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Simson asks about spot cards leads and Berk says "standard"  -- then adds 3rd and 5th, which I guess is standard these days|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|mikam1: Now, that particular fear is gone|pg||
nt|mikam1: Of club overruffs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unless you're from eastern europe  where 2nd/4th rules|pg||
nt|mikam1: Declarer doesn't know the club situation...Alan might have J98(x)|pg||
nt|joest: in which case he might try ruffing clubs himself|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|mikam1: True...and he may fear heart ruffs in North...once again, well guessed by Doug|pg||
nt|mikam1: Now, if he only knew that hearts are breaking and diamond king is onside :)|pg||
nt|mikam1: But I think all roads will lead to Rome now...I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so much easier for players     commentators must use energy to ignore knowing all 4 hands|pg||
nt|mikam1: With south having no third club, he can never run declarer out of trumps and then cash one|pg||
nt|mikam1: Agreed|pg||

nt|Walddk1: And to our many excellent commentators over the three days|pg||

nt|ianmcc: 1@s doubled?|pg||
nt|jbennet: EW punished by playing an inferiour system.|pg||
nt|iceak:  EW use to have a good system|pg||
nt|sybarra: back to 14 |pg||
nt|jbennet: passing is showing some weakness in personality and causes a lower status in the hiearchy . |pg||
nt|sybarra: and we will come back to 16 as last bd |pg||
nt|sybarra: some early thank you's are in order |pg||
nt|iceak:  Interesting how SÃ¦var will bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think Ideland celebrated for at the year |pg||
nt|cuttysark: They were 'quite pleased' :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  and all four players in the other room are on the Iceland team for this year's Bermuda Bowl|pg||
nt|xenya: was it really 4? |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Very uncareful play by declarer. South's double should have warned him|pg||
nt|psyck: y, lost a @s too|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: He lost 2@D, 2 trump and a @S|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: bidders game|pg||
nt|santyclz: Yep.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Difficult to stay out of game here.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: director: "you guys are seriously late" but departs without taking any boards with him|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap: "sorry, could have held it to down 2"|pg||
mb|1N|nt|xenya: i see|pg||
nt|psyck: that will even the match|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Could have ruffed that @S loser|pg||
nt|ady: duplication in clubs here|pg||
nt|chessmaste: And this is not so simple|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|sybarra: N could well sit |pg||
nt|santyclz: We say 1@sx'd after an overcall with n's @s suit go for 1100 yesterday.|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes about to say the same Santy |pg||
nt|peachy: 1@H = 11-15|pg||
nt|sybarra: Many thanks, to our operator Stefan Jonsson. A job well done! |pg||
nt|cuttysark: But Baldursson has just mistimed the play in 4@H on Board 11 and Grant Thornton have quite a big lead now|pg||
nt|sybarra: transfer to 1 nt as I recall |pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  no, shirley, just denies a 4 card major|pg||
mb|2H|nt|hawe45: North could also open 1 @H 11-15|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok|pg||
nt|santyclz: 13 bds, 14 imps!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: if they were all like 4NT claim 11 no one would watch|pg||
nt|pelu: nice play by Simson in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  Opener will rebid 1N with a sub-1NT balanced hand|pg||
nt|psyck: Sarpisj still comfortable to make it to the finals though|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mgb81: I have to say this is the most exciting Lady Milne I've ever seen|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt is a possible overcall for north, i think|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Finally, our gratitude to Bridge Great Britain (Sandra Claridge) and the NIBU (Robin Burns) for ensuring that this fine event was brought to BBO. Greatly appreciated by bridge fans ...|pg||
nt|Walddk1: all over the world|pg||
nt|mgb81: 1NT? is that a joke bill?|pg||
nt|athene: err....wasn't meant to be|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: not at the moment everyone has left but I will find the scores and be back|pg||
nt|ianmcc: the educated lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: why, is it so bad?|pg||
nt|santyclz: (saw)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|jbennet: easy to get too high here.|pg||
nt|friggi: 3@H|pg||
nt|friggi: 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: 8 tricks on a @S-lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Hard to say, if declarer goes for @Cs, he's doomed.|pg||
nt|dima:  Karl is feeling well now :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: with 100 for honours in spades? a 14 count and two suits wide open?|pg||
nt|hawe45: Undo, pls|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Thin intervention by North, looks likely -1|pg||
nt|psyck: Malning will be inching towards the 4th spot maybe|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mgb81: yes its so bad!|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H should make    3NT easier|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: looks roughly like a 1nt overcall to me, but ok|pg||
nt|hawe45: Small @H now = only hope|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jbennet: but if souths now signs off then North should respect that.|pg||
nt|iceak:  Sees @d fit|pg||
nt|sybarra: he did have 15  (but flattish)|pg||
nt|henryb:  If he had kept quiet would have gone plus defending 1N|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|dima:  Is 2@s GF or only RF?|pg||
nt|dima:  Ok answered|pg||
nt|jbennet: 2NT was probably telling "i am week"|pg||
nt|kemperg: still wins 3 imps|pg||
pc|d6|nt|hawe45: @D now to the Jack - and SMALL!!! from North = best defence|pg||
nt|hawe45: But as the @H´s are cleared, normal defence also works|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|nt|jbennet: north respected it.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: With both opponents bidding it is quite dangerous, but then you have to remember what they bid on|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Grant is reigning team champions in Iceland |pg||
nt|henryb:  indeed, but sometimes silence is golden|pg||
nt|xenya: but it was Malning who went 4 off...|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|psyck: oops yes|pg||
pc|c5|nt|santyclz: Best defense would seem 500.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|iceak:  SparisjÃ³Ã°ur lost 11 on 11 by playing 5@d instead of 4@s|pg||
nt|jbennet: on a bad day even 3 D is -1|pg||
nt|iceak:  2NT was most surely showing a weak hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: West has to find a @D switch now, which is far from obvious|pg||
nt|friggi: right|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: The ship has sailed for Málning. Probably making 10 tricks in a partscore on this board|pg||
nt|psyck: W surely had an invite|pg||
nt|psyck: A & intermediaries|pg||
pc|h4|nt|santyclz: Cash 4 @cs and exit with @ha, @h.|pg||
nt|ady: 1 spade loser    the other spade goes on the 4th diamond |pg||
pc|h6|nt|mgb81: anyway ns have come to rest in a partscore|pg||
nt|peachy: crucial moment|pg||
nt|iceak:  3@d would have been GF and strong|pg||
pc|hA|nt|santyclz: Wd.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: GT can afford to lose by 23 IMPs and still win the championship, regardless of how Sparisjodur fares. 2 boards to go after this|pg||
nt|friggi: luck|pg||
nt|kemperg: still 1 off|pg||
nt|friggi: yes|pg||
nt|kemperg: @D start would have helped|pg||
nt|friggi: sure it would have done|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|pc|cQ|nt|mgb81: south can lay a top club|pg||
nt|mgb81: and its one down|pg||
nt|mgb81: if she goes for disvcards west ruffs and cashes the heart so thats 2 down i think|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Don't go too far away, specs. Stephen will come back with the official results when the teams have scored up. Should not be long|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|henryb:  When Kitty decided she wanted to become a better player, I told her to practice saying pass for ten minutes every morning|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s9|nt|lml: I like not overruffing in this position|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: had @H7 half an inch out then folded his cards again|pg||
nt|pelu: harder on @C-lead - as in OR|pg||
nt|lml: the @H7 seems right.  |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: voices from hallway as other matches compare|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: aker busy at the table again, can't sit still, talking silently to himself|pg||
nt|lml: at this point whatever south does the spade position will be more or less known|pg||
nt|chessmaste: A club lead ducked by North gives declarer every chance to go wrong|pg||

pc|c7|pc|cT|pc|s7|nt|chessmaste: Just pitch the heart now|pg||

pc|hJ|pg||
nt|lml: then you control trump|pg||
nt|lml: nice defence|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Well done|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sybarra: N will still get tucked in |pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s5|nt|hawe45: Endplay North|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: North kept all the @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Threw a @S|pg||

pc|d9|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: thnx all|pg||
nt|steshome:  Just a reminder to spectators that we are keeping this table open for confirmed results|pg||
nt|mgb81: A little spillage at the end but still a convincing win for England and the title. |pg||
nt|Walddk1: Joined title likely|pg||
nt|dburn: or at any rate half of it|pg||
nt|athene: i thought it was likely a tie?|pg||
nt|athene: right|pg||
nt|dburn: we believe so|pg||
nt|eamongall: England will win because of the direct match|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Cut the trophy into two, nothing else to do|pg||
nt|steshome:  I don't think it's ever been tied before - what do you think David?|pg||
nt|highshore: don't England win on a split|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  regulation say 'Where there is a tie in Victory Points both teams receive the award for winning.'|pg||
nt|dburn: there is no split tie - the trophy is jointly held|pg||
nt|Walddk1: No Eamon, we found the tie-break in the regulations|pg||
nt|mgb81: Well even if its officially a tie, England feel like the winners as they beat Scotland in the head to head match.|pg||
nt|athene: well, just take half from each word - take the "ENG" from england and the "LAND" from scotland|pg||
nt|athene: put them together|pg||
nt|eamongall: ok there is no split tie .. ENGSCOT win the lady milne |pg||
nt|Walddk1: No, never a tie in the LM, England and Scotland tied twice in the Camrose|pg||
nt|highshore: whatever the result nice to have it go to the wire|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: Seems to be confirmed as a tie...thnx all|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|s5|nt|othered1: perhaps double 2@S, but this isn't a very common auction, so maybe only metaagreements apply . . . |pg||
pc|c9|pc|sA|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|pc|s6|pc|c4|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mikam1: Well, 2H did not go well for declarer on board 13, so 5 imps to Aker|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|cT|pc|c5|pg||

nt|ahollan1: scores will be posted at  http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_vugraphs&event=USBC2011|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: simpson saying he should have passed 2@S and then bid 3@S, as commentators suggested|pg||

nt|henryb:  It worked|pg||
nt|henryb:  as you know|pg||
nt|ady: is this session 16 hands?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: yes|pg||
nt|pelu: decl missed the chance - sh take 1 more @h|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: director called "find your places please" for second segment.  not sure when this match will resume|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: did we skip 14?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzdh: Yes, missing 14|pg||
nt|jbennet: well after 1 NT opening; 1 should should be able to find 44 fit in majors|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok |pg||
nt|dima:  BOOM!|pg||
nt|jbennet: but still be able to choose 3NT.|pg||
nt|jbennet: stupid bid.|pg||
nt|iceak:  But bid at both tables|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Well, it is very hard to teach the scorpion not to bite|pg||
nt|jbennet: we all hate to be preempted.|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: looks like 4M both ways|pg||
mb|2S|nt|henryb:  that is a brave double by Bjarni|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@c now|pg||
mb|3C|nt|cuttysark: Or not|pg||
nt|pelu: and I am signed up for Nickell nexi match - no time for tea :(:(|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mgb81: Welcome everyone to the final set of the Lady Milne|pg||
nt|mgb81: the current score as we just saw see Scotland only 1VP ahead of England|pg||
nt|mgb81: so there is literally everything to play for|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Hello Sarah, Michael and Bill|pg||
nt|mgb81: here north has made an inverted minor suit raise and south indicated a weak no trump hand|pg||
nt|steshome:  Hello Roland! |pg||
nt|mgb81: north might be thinking of a slam, but even the 5 level might be too high.|pg||
nt|sybarra: now S has to make it |pg||
nt|iceak:  SparisjÃ³Ã°ur seems to be winning back|pg||
nt|jbennet: very well put. |pg||
nt|henryb:  I would not find it|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Lebesohl, probably the first step in showing 4hearts and game values|pg||
nt|kemperg: 10 tricks in OR, much|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: on a club lead however |pg||
nt|dima:  no play|pg||
nt|jbennet: everybody has a "reptile brain" ; which is governed by emotions not by common sense and judgement|pg||
nt|sybarra: you put it more succinctly dima|pg||
nt|iceak:  9 tricks|pg||
nt|jbennet: if one should randomize a lareg number of layouts consistent with south:s opening bid.|pg||
nt|dima:  N does have a touching trust in his partner's suit quality preempt, but still 4@s is unLAWful and will lose IMPs here|pg||
nt|jbennet: then everybody would find that to enter with 4H is a huge huge losing bid..|pg||
nt|sybarra: could get very ugly if he goes up with K|pg||
nt|dima:  you have 8 trumps , opponents rate to have at most 9 so ..|pg||
nt|jbennet: and 4 spades was also a stupid action.|pg||
nt|iceak:  No reason to go up with K|pg||
nt|dima:  It could be from Q87 or so he preys ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: South is a very solid citizen, so North definately imagined 4@S as a rather good contract|pg||
nt|jbennet: but again the "repitle brain" caused a losing call. |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: "Only" needing the ace of @C with the 4@H bidder|pg||
nt|jbennet: yes but if now 4 spades makes.|pg||
nt|jbennet: the 4 h is surely likely to be 3 off at least.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: But a double seems to stand out at IMPs. Collecting a safe 300-800, instead of a 50% 620|pg||
nt|dima:  How in the world do you come to 10 tricks? Even opposite AK10xxxx + side King you need more then ONLY Ace onside|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: a misguess in spades is all it takes to go one down, as the two discards are useless to the south hand|pg||
nt|mgb81: ah thats a practical shot|pg||
nt|sybarra: alerfted leb |pg||
nt|sybarra: *alerted |pg||
nt|psyck: only 3 levels lower than other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  slow shows the major. fast denies the major|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: That was peaceful|pg||
nt|santyclz: This is the penultimate deal of the event.  Thanks to the Icelandic Bridge Federation, particularly Olof for allowing us to visit here.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks to our operator, Stefan Jonsson, great job!|pg||
nt|lml: it will be fun to watch though|pg||
nt|pelu: yes|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: this is penultimate bd of this set |pg||
nt|santyclz: N didn't find that lovely @c preempt and e-w got to 6@s-1 for Vestri's 1st big score.|pg||
nt|sybarra: told you .... |pg||
nt|sybarra: was playing to make it |pg||
nt|jbennet: but bidding is a sort of "alfa male" action.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|cuttysark: 3NT perfectly makeable, but scary|pg||
nt|henryb:  a treatment invented (or at least first shown to me) by Helgemo|pg||
nt|cuttysark: If you were sure that you wanted to play in 3NT you would bid it right away|pg||
nt|henryb:  in contrast to showing the stopper|pg||
nt|sybarra: will E make one more try? |pg||
nt|henryb:  No, bidding 3N directly (in this method) says I do not have hearts|pg||
nt|cuttysark: West has his think: if @CKJ were @CA slam is cold|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Aðalsteinn seems to be in pain|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I mean East (sorry)|pg||
nt|henryb:  get him a couple of Tylenol|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Is that a variant of lebensohl too?|pg||
nt|henryb:  yes. Instead of "slow shows a stopper" it is "Slow shows the other major"|pg||
nt|henryb:  stopper is shown by whether you bid 3N or cue bid|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
nt|ady: routine 4@S    on a lucky day could make 6    |pg||
nt|warrens:  this can make 6 with everything working|pg||
nt|pelu: here 4@S on @HK - prob "fast" down 1|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: director watching seems to have hurried gordon a little|pg||
pc|cA|pc|s2|nt|mgb81: One of the kibbitzers has suggested north might raise to 4NT, but if souths bid 6NT with something like KQJx, KJx, J10xx, Kx there will be a small problem in the ace department|pg||
nt|sybarra: that is disapointment |pg||
pc|cT|pc|c7|pg||
nt|peachy: 2NT is often played in this auction as "two places to play"|pg||
nt|psyck: 1 level higher than the other room, but unlikely that anyone was getting any higher|pg||
nt|henryb:  when W shows 0 or 3, will E think W has 3?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks to my co-commentators, Fridrik Vigfusson and Germ Kemper.|pg||
nt|lml: nothing has been fast but nice try|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ianmcc: @s now?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Or @c?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Horrible bidding by E-W leads to a horrible contract :)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|peachy: hehe, NS have 4H|pg||
nt|peachy: as the cards lie|pg||
nt|henryb:  sorry, 1 or 4|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra: (the 5 @D ibid showing 1 or 4 so can only be 1  key card|pg||
nt|henryb:  and he knows not 4|pg||
nt|psyck: Rabbi's will make the rest|pg||
nt|psyck: by dropping the kingleton|pg||
nt|friggi: ditto Joe:)|pg||
nt|kemperg: How do you find the time to give all that comments Stefan, I am impressed|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks to BBO for providing this platform and Roland Wald who works tirelessly to manage these vg sessions. |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|warrens:  on  board 10 at the other table, they bid 7@S! in their 5-2 fit!|pg||
nt|ady: thats unbelievable|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk1: I have Scotland and England tied on 88 VPs before the last 16 boards|pg||
nt|ianmcc: now 9|pg||
nt|psyck: Yes, Stefan was doing that in earlier sessions too, he is great :)|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s5|pc|c8|pg||
nt|peachy: The ace just could not be right|pg||
nt|pelu: down 2 now|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphzdh: N-S actually made 4@H in the open room !|pg||
nt|friggi: Stefán has many "hands"|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk1: Can you confirm, Simon?|pg||
nt|iceak:  if from 78Q - loosing 1@s and 2@c|pg||
nt|kemperg: thank you all and also the specs |pg||
nt|santyclz: And finally thanks to you, the kibs, who drive the whole process.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
nt|peachy: difficult with such a trump break and a side ace to dislodge|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Declarer is rather lucky to make from now on|pg||
nt|santyclz: Nice of them to provide a nothing hand for me to put out all those.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|pelu: too fast play :)|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|pc|c6|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h6|nt|lml: I think he can set up diamonds for 1 down|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|lml: not this way though|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|pc|s8|pc|h5|pg||
nt|pelu: or he can setup the 4. @D for down 1|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c9|nt|lml: too fast play is right|pg||
pc|s9|mc|8|nt|pelu: hi all see u later :)@H@H|pg||
