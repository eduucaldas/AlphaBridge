nt|Walddk4: Moss-Gitelman are not on the Ivatury team|pg||
nt|daman: Where there is Fred...there is Uday|pg||
nt|daman: Zia/Hamman play 2/1   with Flannery :)|pg||
nt|daman: I am not familiar at all with the NS pair|pg||
nt|andyv:  that's a dirty word among certain Danes living in England, George|pg||
nt|daman: Roger Lee is a junior from Cal Tech|pg||
nt|daman: Chan is also from Cal Tech|pg||
nt|daman: as was Julius Robert Oppenheimer|pg||
nt|daman: EW carding is attitude|pg||
nt|daman: this may be the first time NS have played together|pg||
nt|daman: Welcome back everyone|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  good afternoon friends and colleagues across the pond|pg||
nt|daman: NS are a new partnership   |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  good evening fellow Europeans |pg||
nt|athene: hi good evening everyone|pg||
nt|daman: EW have a complex system    we will try to keeppace with it'|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  NS are playing http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=807&pid=168|pg||
nt|daman: re Bill     Hi Julian|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Hello we are back and ready to go|pg||
nt|daman: EW have a mini Flannery|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Ew are playing http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=743&pid=210|pg||
nt|daman: to begin|pg||
nt|davidstern: Hi All|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: I have confirmed that Roger Lee is the first place team for the U26 to represent the US in the World Juniors|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: So after the excitement of the Cavendish we are down to the US Teams Trials|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Hi David was just yesterday and your back in Aussie already :)|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|daman: 2NT must be some form of @H raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Looks like Rodwell wrote Limit|pg||
nt|daman: like jacoby|pg||
nt|athene: is 1nt a psyche or Comic Notrump?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  is 1NT gardener style - either genuine or a WJO?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: My eyes are not the greatest and there is a terrible glare on the table|pg||
nt|daman: put on your glasses|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: I will try to tell you alerts as best as possible|pg||
mb|1D|nt|yorkbeach:  4@h a good game without @s4-1|pg||
nt|athene: several specs say 1nt is a psyche, not systemic|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: north will feel obliged to bid 5@C now though surely|pg||
mb|d|nt|davidstern: 4@S EW seems possible|pg||
nt|benjent: Hi everybody, welcome to segment 4 of the USBC round of 16|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|davidstern: Not in Aus yet in Phoenix leaving tomorrow|pg||
nt|benjent: Scores through segment 3 are at http://www.usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2011/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof16|pg||
mb|3N|nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  5@c seems cold|pg||
nt|davidstern: This will fail by one trick but not much compensation for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: Hi Krishna|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yup|pg||
nt|daman: frigid|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: a good contract    too bad it goes down|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  match very close on the 1st stanza|pg||

pc|cK|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Andy Vinock and Andrew Webb|pg||
pc|c3|nt|tejjyid: Hi all|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: still, it's reasonable for NS to end in 5@C somehow or other in the other room|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|davidstern: The auction does seem odd|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d7|nt|davidstern: I cant imagine that West bid 2@S or that East would pass that|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I guess maybe East got to make a T/O double at some stage|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi all|pg||
nt|tejjyid: maybe West downgraded his hand becasue of the @H values|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Lee leans in and Hamman says I have problems|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|pc|dK|pc|c6|pg||
nt|davidstern: Th defence scored their diamond ruff for -2 and 200 which will compensate a spade partscore but nor a game if it is bid and made|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|c8|pc|s2|pc|s9|pg||
nt|benjent: Meckstroth has to ditch his @c guard ... which is ok because Henner can't get to the board|pg||

nt|othered1: Zia has an interesting call here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: probably 3nt, the alternative seems to be 5@D, is anything else possible|pg||
nt|othered1: 3N likely requires 9 running tricks.  Pass will get a nice penalty, but is far from automatic, since among other things, partner won't have a trump to lead|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: Meckstroth has called the director|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|athene: three passes then the strong club i imagine|pg||
nt|davidstern: Declarer may make 2-1-2-4 tricks here depending on the view he takes in clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: upside down count and attidtude|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: hello good evening everyone|pg||
nt|psyck: @c lead likely|pg||
nt|daman: Hi William|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|psyck: the ruff sets this normal contract|pg||
nt|psyck: Hi Bill|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi all:)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Hi Phillip|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Marshall|pg||
nt|davidstern: Hi Marshall, Andrew and others|pg||
nt|davidstern: And Andy|pg||
nt|andyv:  some work to be done here but favorable location of @c suit should help N get thru this|pg||
nt|benjent: Good result for Nickell ... 3@s is going to dribble off, but NS have a (mildly fortunate) game on|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|nt|athene: should be a flat board |pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: North asks 3Hearts?|pg||
nt|athene: even if north bid diamonds and got a diamond lead, he could cash the @CA and switch to a spade to beat the contract|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, there were no real alternative in the bidding & defense using standard methods|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H just a normal 3-card limit raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: screen down and Lee asks Hamman a ?|pg||
nt|athene: the only way things might go differently is if an EW pair play 1nt semi-forcing|pg||
nt|athene: but people rarely put their 3-card limit raises into 1NT if it's not totally forcing - they have some other special bid for them|pg||
nt|daman: Lee is seeking a ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Zia asks to see Hamman's convention card has to change something on it|pg||
nt|daman: he will cash the @D Ace    and then  @S K and a @S |pg||
nt|psyck: I do that with several pd's :)  1N NF & the only way for 3 card LR...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Lee is thinking the ace of clubs auto play by the computer when the queen was played|pg||
pc|hA|nt|daman: Hamman cannot have 4@Ss   (Flannery)|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose someone might take a way-out view and respond 3@C with west if that's an invitational jump shift|pg||
nt|athene: but that would be quite a view with three hearts|pg||
nt|psyck: Yes, I paly 3@c as inv, but denies @h fit|pg||
nt|athene: a spec points out that 3@C is going to go down in practice as declarer will lose two trump tricks - i guess there is no trump coup there|pg||
nt|athene: south would be ruffing in on a heart|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Zia is making out a new convention card|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|athene: hamman does his best to jam the defenders' signals in clubs by concealing the @C3|pg||
nt|daman: someone says EW don't play Flannery any more    I thought I saw them playing it on Sunday|pg||
nt|athene: if playing 3/5th leads, though, north must know declarer can't have a singleton club|pg||
nt|athene: south would not lead the 7 from 108732|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3@d looks like a transfer|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 2nt about 22-23 i think (opening 2nt is 19-21)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3@s looks natural but it has an alert|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  does anyone have a link to a better Meckwell card than the one on the USBF site?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The 2011 USBC will select USA2 for the 2011 Bermuda Bowl to be held Oct. 15-29 in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. USA1, chosen at the 2010 USBC, will be the Fleisher team ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: (Fleisher-Kamil, Levin-Weinstein, Martel-Stansby). |pg||
nt|athene: if any specs are wondering about the director call - yes, psyches are legal, but if a partnership makes a habit of a certain sort of psyche that can be frowned on because they may ...|pg||
nt|athene: build up undisclosed agreements|pg||
pc|h6|nt|andyv:  hi David|pg||
pc|hK|nt|davidstern: So this will lose to the jack and then running the @C7 will ensure 4 club tricks and the contract|pg||
pc|h2|nt|daman: Debbie says   EW announced they play Flannery to the opps     so much for that rumo(u)r|pg||
nt|athene: so not the best trump shift there|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|daman: my guess is roger knows the rules|pg||
nt|athene: so at the very least if e.g. you make a habit of overcalling 1nt with a minor-suit pre-empt, your partner will eventually comes to realise this and opps have a right to know about ...|pg||
nt|athene: it too|pg||
nt|daman: Rodger|pg||
nt|davidstern: Nice careful play in the club suit by declarer|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphzfe: std count ? in the middle of the hand|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: std signals and regular smith|pg||
nt|athene: @DJ holding is nice but the contract was never in danger anyway|pg||
nt|athene: four clubs, two diamonds, spade, and declarer can easily build a second heart|pg||
nt|athene: it's just a mild struggle for the 11th trick or so|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c4|pc|sT|nt|athene: of course south doesn't know who has the @C3, but surely, if declarer needed a discard he would have taken it when in dummy|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: maybe south just goes along with his partner's line of defence, thinking he would never return a trump if wanting a ruff|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|nt|daman: tilt|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North's @d could be better than they are|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: and hamman goes along with it too for the same reason :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: but that was all a bit weird|pg||
nt|benjent: Rodwell would like to stop South from ruffing, but with no entry to the board, he couldn't get enough spades out of the way fast enough|pg||
pc|c5|nt|yorkbeach:  that is why South was trying to grab the lea|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|athene: ah yes sorry i mis-saw the clubs|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @c finesse is normal with this combo|pg||
nt|athene: of course declarer would not necessarily be finessing the @C10, but still, north has to lead something, and it will help declarer|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: basically there's no way the contract is going down|pg||
pc|d6|pc|sJ|pc|s6|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s9|pc|s7|pc|c6|pg||
nt|benjent: As it happens, Rodwell has a deep @h loser anyway|pg||

nt|andyv:  a good score for NS|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|vugraphzfe: someones cell phone just went off|pg||
mb|2D|nt|athene: of course if he had drawn trumps it was still a big view to finesse the @C9|pg||
nt|daman: it is a lot of fun to watch Meckwell play|pg||
mb|p!|nt|daman: North might enter the arena|pg||
nt|daman: they have very few green cards in their bidding boxes|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: lots of writing|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: but I can not see anything|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  one each?|pg||
nt|davidstern: A nobody can make much hand|pg||
mb|2H|nt|davidstern: Here|pg||
nt|andyv:  N may run to 2@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: some play transfers on 3 level intervention of 1NT|pg||
nt|athene: a good method to play transfers over a 3@C overcall|pg||
nt|psyck: aah, they do here too|pg||
nt|psyck: only after undo|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  :)|pg||
nt|athene: i have an old convention card for EW which says 2@C is non-forcing here|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: rightsides AND lets you stop in 3 of a major|pg||
nt|psyck: generally shows Inv+ hand on 3@c intervention|pg||
nt|athene: of course, it slightly inconveniences the diamond suit, but who cares about a minor suit anyway?|pg||
nt|athene: but not sure they play that any more|pg||
nt|athene: they do tweak the system fairly often|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzfe: Chan asking if 3hearts promises 3|pg||
nt|daman: 2@C was probably probably a negative free bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: This is one of those all-fall-down partscores|pg||
mb|3C|nt|psyck: 3@h generally min hands, max hand or good fitting hands would bypass 3@h|pg||
nt|athene: i have to say i am a little surprised at 3@H - sure, only 15 hcp, but his cards all look good, so he might have tried game|pg||
nt|daman: first blood to Ivatury   they made 3@H in the OR on board 2|pg||
nt|athene: i guess he feels that 4333 is still the shape that fell into a big vat of ugly|pg||
nt|daman: They may want to take a screen shot of the monitor for posterity|pg||
nt|athene: you mean the moment they were ahead of Nickell?|pg||
nt|daman: yep|pg||
nt|athene: naaa, almost every team is ahead of nickell until the last set|pg||
nt|tejjyid: surely not..that woudl be a shocking bid|pg||
nt|davidstern: 2@H quickly looks like -1|pg||
nt|marlowepi: need to stand ground in those situations....default is for E to bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl is take out|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: and almost none of them after it :)|pg||
nt|davidstern: 2-1-1-2 as a minimum loss|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: No one is making much of anything, and the trick is not to be left holding the baby at the end of the auction|pg||
mb|p|pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|yorkbeach:  sensible contract|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  4@s would be down even with @s3-3|pg||
nt|davidstern: On the first Board EW did in fact bid and make 4@S and 6 imps to Ivatury|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Sorry pd says Meckstroth and thanks by Rodwell|pg||
nt|benjent: Especially when you're vulnerable ... |pg||
pc|h5|nt|daman: looks like another minus for EW|pg||
nt|davidstern: Against the 3@H at this table -2|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  X must show a top @h|pg||
nt|athene: south can happily underlead in hearts to avoid blocking the suit|pg||
nt|athene: after the double of 2@H, showing a top honour|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  could to have partnership trust like that|pg||
nt|athene: maybe @H, @H, trump is best|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|psyck: hmm, didn't take them long to get into higher territories|pg||
nt|athene: then they can stop a spade ruff and come to two hearts and two spades|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  though the underlead would be more useful if South had a tenace somewhere|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: screen down and Chan is asking questions|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  did North really play the 8?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: YES|pg||
nt|andyv:  I was talking about N's dbl|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|psyck: to bad dummy comes up with the wrong pointed King|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: yes, if the lead is 5th best, he knows east can't have a bigger one|pg||
pc|h6|nt|benjent: Meckstroth's red suit holdings argue quite strongly against balacing. Sorry is a fair call :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|psyck: oh, dec, i thought they were in 6@d|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|hK|nt|davidstern: Excellent switch needed before declarer can get dummy's diamond loser away on spade|pg||
pc|hT|nt|yorkbeach:  leads are 3rd and 5th|pg||
nt|athene: A,K,J,6 are the only ones higher than the 5 and south has to have them all|pg||
nt|athene: of course you have to have trust that partner didn't pull the wrong card :)|pg||
nt|benjent: Ivatury signalling his lack of interest in the @s suit, just in case pard was wondering|pg||
pc|d6|nt|davidstern: Excellent defence spot on|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  had not seen the 3@c at the time :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  dod we think 3@c is any game force?|pg||
nt|athene: i guess he feels there is not that much need to bid his minor length honestly as they are very unlikely to want to play in a minor|pg||
nt|athene: especially after south didn't rebid 2minor over 1@S|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if he does not intend to play in spades even when he gets a spade preference, what is the point of 3@c?|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he feels that after being rebuked for the comedy 1nt overcall, it's important to show he isn't feeling bad about things :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I agree with South's 2@h|pg||

pc|h8|nt|yorkbeach:  I know some who believe in raising partner's suit on any hand with 3 trumps and a singleton|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: some might open 4@S with the 7-4 if NV, but vul i guess 3 is enough|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|nt|vugraphzfe: Chan says good luck partner|pg||

nt|ritong: wow|pg||
mb|2H|nt|benjent: That's some serious cojones by Ivatury|pg||
nt|ritong: indeed|pg||
mb|3C|nt|athene: ten tricks on a very fortunate black-suit layout|pg||
nt|athene: strong club, 2@C = positive with diamonds|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  system says they need 12 to open when balanced |pg||
nt|athene: 2@D shows hearts|pg||
nt|benjent: Red, square, and both opponents bidding. And both opponents known to have itchy trigger fingers|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: meckwell don't play relays - they do just bid suits to try to find a fit|pg||
nt|athene: but they bid artificially to save space|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I understand why responder is making a transfer but why opener?|pg||
nt|davidstern: Diamond Diamond and heart through may get the defence an extra trick|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 3NT a more creative bid by SOuth|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with no disrespect to Ivatury team, playing against Nickell it could prove very beneficia; to open 4S with S hand. no need to tell me how it could work out badly instead|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: not more effective though...|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: well the idea is they think ok, what suits would opener most want to show?|pg||
nt|davidstern: So this is boards 31 to 45 of a total 120 boards|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: let's use the lowest bid for that|pg||
nt|athene: and the idea is that opener will more often want to show hearts than diamonds, so they use 2@D to show hearts|pg||
nt|athene: 3@C artficial showing a heart fit and a bad hand i think, just steps|pg||
nt|benjent: Helpful lead ... Henner a good shot to drop the @cq now|pg||
nt|mildredb: this works in her favor - won't finesse now|pg||
nt|benjent: snap :)|pg||

pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Now he is shaking his head and hum|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: opens hand and closes hand and now reopening|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer cannot pick up the trumps without blocking the @d|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: leaning on the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: playing with the 5 hearts|pg||
nt|andyv:  contract normal enough|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h5|pc|cT|nt|tejjyid: OK, a shaper spectatro points out that after 3 rounds of @D this is cold|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  so long as diamonds are no worse than 4-2, declarer can give up a heart|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|nt|davidstern: Declarer played this correctly as the cards lie but would have egg on his face of East had @HK-5|pg||
nt|davidstern: Yes as West would be endplayed on a club towards dummy|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: finessing the trumps gains against KQx or Hx onside, loses only to singleton honour offside|pg||
nt|tejjyid: right - personally I think not being in 4@H is poor bidding, but it's certainly hard to get there|pg||
nt|davidstern: No doubt Rodwell will cash @HK|pg||
nt|davidstern: Yes 4@H could be cold while 4@S could fail on any 4-2 spade break|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|daman: that is his plan|pg||
nt|tejjyid: exactly - but it's tough to shake off a solid-ish 7 card suit|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|athene: yes, just give up a trump to make sure you can run the diamonds without interruption|pg||
nt|davidstern: Dont anybody doubt that the @HK will be cashed he is just thinking|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s2|pc|h3|pc|s3|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h6|nt|athene: this is basically the one time you want to lose a tempo to draw the master trump|pg||
nt|athene: or the most common time by far anyway|pg||
pc|h7|nt|yorkbeach:  still 10 tricks even if @d were 5-1 - miscounted|pg||
nt|athene: you can't afford to have the defender ruff in and strand the winners in dummy|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|benjent: So let's give Ivatury some credit. East is a passed hand, and West's 1@d is limited. So he knows his side probably shares the values, and he's the one with (relative) shortage, so ...|pg||
nt|benjent: he has the responsibility to act|pg||

mb|3S|nt|fabsayc: 3@H here implies a spade fit else would have transferred initially|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|fabsayc: could be either a 4333 hand or slam try|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c4|nt|fabsayc: the main point is you can use 3@H to plug whatever holes in your nt structure|pg||

nt|ritong: playing four handed will likely be a handicap in the end of the match, but leading at that point against this monster team is an achievement in itself|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: correct|pg||
nt|ritong: go Uman go go|pg||
nt|benjent: Some hidden punishment for Rodwell too ... opening his 10 count got his opponents bidding. At the other table, everyone passed their 10 count|pg||
nt|benjent: Crazy, I know, but it does happen from time to time :)|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|daman: S is counting points for distribution|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: not sure if chan had a weak 2-suited opener available - you would expect him to use it if so|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|daman: and struck the Mother Lode|pg||
nt|daman: Meckwell are deadly when they get involved in their stong club auctions|pg||
nt|athene: i think it's strange for south to overcall this time but not on the previosu hand|pg||
nt|athene: he should definitely have come in last time, in my opinion|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  better suit this time|pg||
nt|athene: if everyone would only agree to pass meekly whenever you opened a strong club, there would be no doubt it was the best method|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  perhaps he did not have a way to show a 3 suiter|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  is pass 0-4?|pg||
nt|benjent: 1NT is 14-16|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: well, he can use his imagination then :)|pg||
nt|athene: and show whatever 2-suiter he desires|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: Zia says I know you can't make it|pg||

nt|benjent: The 4-1 @h break is going to stop Henner from cashing up all of her @s winners, which she has to be able to do to get rid of all her @d losers|pg||
nt|ritong: meck has a natural beat if he reads the position|pg||
nt|benjent: EW can't play @d from either side, so they're going to have to be patient|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: slight risk opps might run the minors if you do that, i suppose|pg||
nt|athene: ok, no problem now|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: with both spades right i don't see how declarer can have a problem here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  did well to avoid @c lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: 4th best upside down count and attitude and I didn't hear if they play any smith|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: sometimes you rise with the @SK on the second spade - but only if you think west has @SQxx and you want to block the suit|pg||
nt|athene: and that's impossible here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer might have to guess whether East has Q10 or AQ|pg||
nt|daman: good lead by Rodwell|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: screen down|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  likley to get righton bidding|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the clue is that South has denied a major|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can cash the @DQ and then lead the jack|pg||
nt|athene: and when west follows, he can overtake as east is known to have 2+ diamonds|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West assumes that North has hearts because he can see only 2@h|pg||
nt|athene: so they must be breaking when west follows to the second one|pg||
nt|daman: he's not going down in this contract|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if he takes the @c finesse, the extra entry will be a mixed blessing|pg||
nt|athene: he will surely lead a heart to the king first|pg||
nt|daman: automatic|pg||
pc|s2|nt|yorkbeach:  declarer can hold up in @c anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: reverse smith|pg||
nt|daman: passed the first hurdle :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  rehi|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vugraphzfe: rehi|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lots of problems here|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h8|pc|hK|pg||
nt|ritong: he goes for a kind of mixed strategy|pg||
nt|benjent: 3rd @s has two advantages ... may get a trump promo, and may kill a crucial trick|pg||
nt|benjent: Henner will be thinking "cool, I can draw trumps ending on the board, cash some @s's and get the @d's right"|pg||
nt|benjent: then she'll be thinking "no way is that Meckstroth defending so softly if that's working ... hmmm"|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|c3|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: ok, he doesn't feel he needs two dummy entries|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South not as trusting of EW as he was of his partner|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  like that in a partner - trust me rather than oppo|pg||
nt|marlowepi: curse of scotland perhaps ill-advised|pg||
nt|marlowepi: = @D9|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|c7|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: with some strong clubbers you couldn't be sure east didn't have a singleton diamond|pg||
nt|athene: but meckwell play 2@D to show a 3-suiter, singleton/void diamond|pg||
nt|benjent: Interesting choice|pg||
pc|dK|nt|marlowepi: spec points out that nine of D may have been chosen to preserve the beer card|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
nt|benjent: An option was to stop after 2 rounds of @h and lead a @s winner to ditch the @cK|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|nt|daman: the table are pitching Clubs|pg||
nt|daman: is*|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  more testing if West keeps clubs|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might be lining up to go down here - i wonder if he took the @SQ at face value ( no @SA) and hence thinks the club finesse is a sure thing?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes but wont East have to break the @s at the end?|pg||
nt|athene: yes rodwell should have kept more clubs i think|pg||
nt|daman: has to be tough to be  juniors up against this pair|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: is everyone still awake|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: four of us are yawning|pg||
nt|athene: if declarer takes the club finesse, then he will know who has the @SA :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if West has the @sA, he could have the @s10 too|pg||
pc|d8|nt|vugraphzfe: the flies would have been sad|pg||
nt|andyv:  I'm sure that was the main reason|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|athene: ok, heart to king and another heart, let the defence do something in a black suit|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  low @s from E?|pg||
nt|daman: he is on the right road now|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he hopes meckstroth came down to @HAx, when there is no more worry|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this event is not the Beer Trials though|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|nt|benjent: hmmm ... needed to draw the 3rd trump and then play out @s's I think|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|nt|andyv:  down 2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: unauthorized info here, when Meckstroth has to open 1D but doesnt want the suit led, he plays as "East"|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|athene: of course declarer might have felt very silly if the @CK were onside and rodwell had @SA10 :) but all in all i think he took a good line to try to avoid having to guess|pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: zia will surely move here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  NS are playing a 14-16 1NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  if NS weren't vul, would have invited with the S hand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: ok, they play transfer into opp's suit as stayman?|pg||
nt|benjent: NS make a few spades, but Ivatury may find it hard to stop|pg||
mb|3S|nt|psyck: this is probably a stayman w/o stopper|pg||

mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  so 1@c shows 17+ if balanced|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  do we know what 1@h shows?|pg||
nt|ritong: correct auction identical to hamzia's one|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphzfe: Zia says try for one plus score|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: yes, he can take three spades, @HAK, one in each minor, but that's all he ought to get|pg||
nt|psyck: guess he is not happy that there are no scores on their side, but they have not had any really bad boards yet|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Lee asks Hamman NT range?|pg||
nt|athene: on the other hand the defence might not realise that diamonds are declarer's weak spot|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  1@c is Precision style (RM)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  whatever (RM) means|pg||
nt|athene: rm usually means rodwell mecsktroth|pg||
nt|marlowepi: see ? no D lead:)|pg||
nt|benjent: I play 3@s there as GF, and Ivatury may also, but Henner definitely doesn't :)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||
nt|athene: RM-precision is their form of strong club|pg||
nt|daman: RM = Rodwell/Meckstroth|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|benjent: Even so, this looks like a bid too far|pg||
pc|h9|nt|yorkbeach:  apols|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  had wrong card open|pg||
nt|athene: this is a bit pushy give a 4-1 trump break is almost assured|pg||
nt|mildredb: no dif what Rodwell does here|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|daman: they are trying to make a statement|pg||
nt|athene: (X of 1@H tends to really have 4 cards in both unbid suits, yes really)|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|daman: they picked up 7 IMPs on Board 6  |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  or did it just show 3@h?|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|nt|yorkbeach:  XX showed the 3@h|pg||
nt|daman: that happened to me once against Rubin/Becker    I overcalled 1@S on KQJ10 of @Ss    the final contract?    4@S by them    making|pg||
nt|daman: the had that crazy relay system|pg||
nt|athene: ultimate club?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: half way mark of this segment|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes after the 8th auction :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  not used to play sets with an odd number of boards :)|pg||

nt|athene: ok, as expected north returned his partner's suit but now hamman is up to 8|pg||
nt|psyck: with no prayer for the 9th|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s9|pc|sT|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Chan playing with heart now|pg||
nt|athene: even if hamman sneaks one diamond through and then manages to endplay north with the @DA it doesn't help him|pg||

nt|daman: rodwell did not pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: A few have asked ... I play 4th suit as invitational (plus) in that sort of auction for just this sort of hand, so that I can go 1@d-1@s-2@c-2@h then 2@s (step) is all minimums and ...|pg||
nt|benjent: I'm out at 2@s|pg||

nt|athene: 3@H directing a lead against spades?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes|pg||
nt|benjent: yes, it won't have been 7 down. 2, maybe 3, down looks more like it.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: yes this is the auction|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: or just showing the shape and inviting east to compete over 4@S?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or just description in case D game on|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: here comes an extra dummy entry|pg||
nt|athene: well south in the other room passed too|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  presumably South's system did not suit is hand|pg||
mb|p|pc|sT|nt|athene: maybe the low heart is upside down suit preference for a diamond back rather than a club|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: rusinow leads|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: upside down count and attitude|pg||
nt|mildredb: anyone know what the alert of 1@S was?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: reverse smith|pg||
nt|ritong: i suppose infers 4+@cs|pg||
nt|benjent: Good lead ... dummy's 2nd suit is often the weak point, and Meckstroth's @d holding isn't so attractive to lead from|pg||
nt|benjent: On this sort of auction, @d can easily be (and is) declarer's real suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: i am finding out 1 spade|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: 1S=natural showing real clubs as well|pg||
nt|mildredb: ty Debbie|pg||
nt|ritong: yw|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: your welcome|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: reasonable auction - north doesn't have great shape facing hearts but with 7 hcp you have to do something|pg||
nt|athene: if the @C5 were a little heart i think he would have bid 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: well, declarer is wondering if he should finesse the @H10|pg||
nt|daman: he has HCP and a bit of shape but his suits are feeble|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: normally 2-suiters with a 5-card major sort of fall into the hands you can bid, don't they?|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: if your only concern is making 5 heart tricks then yes you do, but it's rarely that simple|pg||
nt|athene: basically if you finesse hearts and it loses, that's a huge disaster - you are totally dead|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, I doubt he will finesse with chances in black suits|pg||
nt|athene: but you might try to fiddle around|pg||
nt|athene: and make tricks in the black suits|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The 2011 USBC will select USA2 for the 2011 Bermuda Bowl to be held Oct. 15-29 in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. USA1, chosen at the 2010 USBC, will be the Fleisher team ...|pg||

pc|h5|nt|athene: although the bidding makes a diamond so much more natural anyway, i am not sure if there is any s/p inference there|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: it's things like 1-4-3-5 that are hard|pg||
nt|daman: not on this side of the pond     we are not afraid to defend|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|hK|nt|athene: he leaves diamond right to the end and may eventually lead to the @H10 as a last desperate chance|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if you are just playing 2@c  majors and everything else natural, South has no good bid|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|benjent: The simple line is to assume you have 5@c tricks and go about setting up 2@h's for 9|pg||
nt|benjent: Kinda falls at the first today, but a reasonable stab|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: meckstroth has his hands on a club|pg||
nt|benjent: Rodwell's @s6 looks vaguely disouraging, but the @h5-6 sequence looks reverse-smithly-encouraging|pg||
nt|benjent: We haven't missed anything with that snap drop-out. No surprise, this is a tough problem for Meckstroth|pg||
nt|ritong: the only thing he knows for sure is that declarer had 4@h KQ|pg||
nt|ritong: and even that is not certain|pg||
nt|ritong: might be 5|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: leaves heart right to the end sorry|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: now he knows he needs nine tricks without using the spades at all|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: well if you have a singleton, you normally expect partner to lead it, but admittedly when it's a singleton king that is less of a disaster maybe|pg||
nt|marlowepi: they are indeed one of the few who play U/d s/p|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|psyck: but he does not get black suit count, so may well play for drop|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: still i would not want to pass this out|pg||
pc|d9|nt|yorkbeach:  Rodwell is making serverla more tricks than in the other room|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2@s would have no great success|pg||
nt|athene: yes, he looks like a friendly fellow with a mustache, but he will make 1nt if you don't watch him|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: break|pg||
nt|daman: habits of a lifetime|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South's @s switch was a bit of a disaster|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  a bit unlucky I suppose to find West with AKJ|pg||

pc|c4|nt|athene: ok, well throwing the heart was just giving up|pg||
pc|c8|nt|vugraphzfe: 15 boards half way at this time a small|pg||
nt|athene: he is just going to knock out the @SA and let hamman cash his diamond i suppose|pg||
nt|psyck: the % paly for 5 @h tricks was to finesse (baring other considerations)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Poor Roger he has just finished looking at the hand and drops all the cards from his hand on the table|pg||
