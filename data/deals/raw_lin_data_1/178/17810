nt|Vugraphzfb: Hi all |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Levin and Weinstein leading. there's a shock|pg||
nt|sybarra: do we have scores posted yet David?|pg||
mb|3D|mb|d|mb|p|nt|sybarra: as Roland said why do we play these bds|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://cavendish.bridgewinners.com/index.php?option=com_content&id=203|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|Vugraphzfb: this is always a murky auction. Not clear whether EW are making a slam try or offering choice of black suits|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|nt|chorush: Declarer had better be a good guesser to make this|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes even to make 5 |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: this is strange|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: waiting to see someones hand|pg||
nt|chorush: I find it hard to believe that Krekorian bid 5|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure why the 5 @S, unless Krekorian, this W bid is stronger|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: how about someone go to another room and check to see if this is same hand please|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: i am told hand correct|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: possibly not correct here|pg||
nt|chorush: It is the same hand as in the other rooms|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: indeed that is the dummy . no reaction from anyone|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Levin asking what 5@s showed|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Levin asks to  see the trick again|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: lotta noise here as someone wheels in a trolley |pg||
pc|h7|nt|chorush: I think that it is barely possible that the auction went 3D-P-P-3S-4D-4S but i can't imagine that if it did Krekorian would do anything but pass|pg||
nt|chorush: Nonetheless, this contract CAN be made|pg||
nt|chorush: He has to decide if he can handle AQx in south hand. If he decides probably not, he will make it|pg||
nt|chorush: The ace is definitely in south|pg||

nt|chorush: Many players nowadays play transfers strting with 1NT when a major suit opening is doubled|pg||

nt|chorush: this seems to be a complicated position|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Perhaps declarer might have tried for a @d ruff in hand|pg||
nt|chorush: if he ruffs a club and leads a heart, I think he can make it|pg||
