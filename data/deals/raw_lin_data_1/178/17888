nt|swanson: West will eventually have to decided between 3@S and 4@S.  The latter a fortunate make.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Ivatury asks about the Pass over DBL and Hamman shrugs|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chorush: I think they can take 10 tricks in spades with appropriate guessing|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|geot: looks like, but some work to do. Need to get to West several times to play diamonds, finesse clubs and spades|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|geot: but the defenders must play something as well...|pg||
nt|swanson: The West hand lacks an immediate entry for the club finesse (after the spade finesse) but the defense can't keep from providing one.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Ivatury: "I got nothing"|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|hA|nt|swanson: I agree with him (for the raise to game).|pg||
nt|geot: maybe a direct finesse in spades is best, not the king first, to keep the king as later entry|pg||

nt|daman: NS are a new partnership   |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  good evening fellow Europeans |pg||

nt|daman: EW have a complex system    we will try to keeppace with it'|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  Ew are playing http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=743&pid=210|pg||
nt|daman: to begin|pg||
nt|davidstern: Hi All|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: I have confirmed that Roger Lee is the first place team for the U26 to represent the US in the World Juniors|pg||
mb|2H|nt|davidstern: So after the excitement of the Cavendish we are down to the US Teams Trials|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Hi David was just yesterday and your back in Aussie already :)|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3H|nt|daman: 2NT must be some form of @H raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Looks like Rodwell wrote Limit|pg||
nt|daman: like jacoby|pg||
nt|athene: is 1nt a psyche or Comic Notrump?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  is 1NT gardener style - either genuine or a WJO?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: My eyes are not the greatest and there is a terrible glare on the table|pg||
nt|daman: put on your glasses|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: I will try to tell you alerts as best as possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  4@h a good game without @s4-1|pg||
nt|athene: several specs say 1nt is a psyche, not systemic|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: north will feel obliged to bid 5@C now though surely|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: 4@S EW seems possible|pg||
pc|d7|nt|davidstern: Not in Aus yet in Phoenix leaving tomorrow|pg||
pc|dA|nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  5@c seems cold|pg||

nt|athene: yup|pg||
nt|daman: frigid|pg||

pc|dT|pc|d9|pc|hJ|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|davidstern: I cant imagine that West bid 2@S or that East would pass that|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I guess maybe East got to make a T/O double at some stage|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi all|pg||
nt|tejjyid: maybe West downgraded his hand becasue of the @H values|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vugraphzfe: Lee leans in and Hamman says I have problems|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
mc|7|nt|davidstern: Th defence scored their diamond ruff for -2 and 200 which will compensate a spade partscore but nor a game if it is bid and made|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|athene: hello good evening everyone|pg||
nt|psyck: @c lead likely|pg||

nt|tejjyid: Hi Phillip|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Marshall|pg||
nt|davidstern: Hi Marshall, Andrew and others|pg||
nt|davidstern: And Andy|pg||
nt|andyv:  some work to be done here but favorable location of @c suit should help N get thru this|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cK|nt|athene: should be a flat board |pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: North asks 3Hearts?|pg||
nt|athene: even if north bid diamonds and got a diamond lead, he could cash the @CA and switch to a spade to beat the contract|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, there were no real alternative in the bidding & defense using standard methods|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H just a normal 3-card limit raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: screen down and Lee asks Hamman a ?|pg||
nt|athene: the only way things might go differently is if an EW pair play 1nt semi-forcing|pg||
nt|athene: but people rarely put their 3-card limit raises into 1NT if it's not totally forcing - they have some other special bid for them|pg||
nt|daman: Lee is seeking a ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Zia asks to see Hamman's convention card has to change something on it|pg||
nt|daman: he will cash the @D Ace    and then  @S K and a @S |pg||
nt|psyck: I do that with several pd's :)  1N NF & the only way for 3 card LR...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Lee is thinking the ace of clubs auto play by the computer when the queen was played|pg||
pc|cA|nt|daman: Hamman cannot have 4@Ss   (Flannery)|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose someone might take a way-out view and respond 3@C with west if that's an invitational jump shift|pg||
nt|athene: but that would be quite a view with three hearts|pg||
nt|psyck: Yes, I paly 3@c as inv, but denies @h fit|pg||
nt|athene: a spec points out that 3@C is going to go down in practice as declarer will lose two trump tricks - i guess there is no trump coup there|pg||
nt|athene: south would be ruffing in on a heart|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Zia is making out a new convention card|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: hamman does his best to jam the defenders' signals in clubs by concealing the @C3|pg||
nt|daman: someone says EW don't play Flannery any more    I thought I saw them playing it on Sunday|pg||
nt|athene: if playing 3/5th leads, though, north must know declarer can't have a singleton club|pg||
nt|athene: south would not lead the 7 from 108732|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3@d looks like a transfer|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 2nt about 22-23 i think (opening 2nt is 19-21)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3@s looks natural but it has an alert|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  does anyone have a link to a better Meckwell card than the one on the USBF site?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The 2011 USBC will select USA2 for the 2011 Bermuda Bowl to be held Oct. 15-29 in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. USA1, chosen at the 2010 USBC, will be the Fleisher team ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: (Fleisher-Kamil, Levin-Weinstein, Martel-Stansby). |pg||
nt|athene: if any specs are wondering about the director call - yes, psyches are legal, but if a partnership makes a habit of a certain sort of psyche that can be frowned on because they may ...|pg||
nt|athene: build up undisclosed agreements|pg||
pc|c3|nt|andyv:  hi David|pg||
pc|s5|nt|davidstern: So this will lose to the jack and then running the @C7 will ensure 4 club tricks and the contract|pg||
pc|cT|nt|daman: Debbie says   EW announced they play Flannery to the opps     so much for that rumo(u)r|pg||
nt|athene: so not the best trump shift there|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|daman: my guess is roger knows the rules|pg||
nt|athene: so at the very least if e.g. you make a habit of overcalling 1nt with a minor-suit pre-empt, your partner will eventually comes to realise this and opps have a right to know about ...|pg||
nt|athene: it too|pg||
nt|daman: Rodger|pg||
nt|davidstern: Nice careful play in the club suit by declarer|pg||
pc|sT|nt|vugraphzfe: std count ? in the middle of the hand|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|pc|sA|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: std signals and regular smith|pg||
nt|athene: @DJ holding is nice but the contract was never in danger anyway|pg||
nt|athene: four clubs, two diamonds, spade, and declarer can easily build a second heart|pg||
nt|athene: it's just a mild struggle for the 11th trick or so|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c5|pc|c4|nt|athene: of course south doesn't know who has the @C3, but surely, if declarer needed a discard he would have taken it when in dummy|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Zia did not show much for his 1NT. I back Henner to get it right|pg||
nt|swanson: South is left with nothing but the @CQ (in addition to the @HK) for his response.  Declarer will not have a problem with the trump queen.|pg||

nt|andyv:  a good score for NS|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|athene: of course if he had drawn trumps it was still a big view to finesse the @C9|pg||
nt|daman: it is a lot of fun to watch Meckwell play|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: North might enter the arena|pg||
nt|daman: they have very few green cards in their bidding boxes|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: lots of writing|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: but I can not see anything|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  one each?|pg||
nt|davidstern: A nobody can make much hand|pg||
mb|d!|nt|davidstern: Here|pg||
nt|andyv:  N may run to 2@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: some play transfers on 3 level intervention of 1NT|pg||
nt|athene: a good method to play transfers over a 3@C overcall|pg||
nt|psyck: aah, they do here too|pg||
nt|psyck: only after undo|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  :)|pg||
nt|athene: i have an old convention card for EW which says 2@C is non-forcing here|pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: rightsides AND lets you stop in 3 of a major|pg||
nt|psyck: generally shows Inv+ hand on 3@c intervention|pg||
nt|athene: of course, it slightly inconveniences the diamond suit, but who cares about a minor suit anyway?|pg||
nt|athene: but not sure they play that any more|pg||
nt|athene: they do tweak the system fairly often|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: Chan asking if 3hearts promises 3|pg||
nt|daman: 2@C was probably probably a negative free bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|psyck: 3@h generally min hands, max hand or good fitting hands would bypass 3@h|pg||
nt|athene: i have to say i am a little surprised at 3@H - sure, only 15 hcp, but his cards all look good, so he might have tried game|pg||
nt|daman: first blood to Ivatury   they made 3@H in the OR on board 2|pg||
nt|athene: i guess he feels that 4333 is still the shape that fell into a big vat of ugly|pg||
nt|daman: They may want to take a screen shot of the monitor for posterity|pg||
nt|athene: you mean the moment they were ahead of Nickell?|pg||
nt|daman: yep|pg||
nt|athene: naaa, almost every team is ahead of nickell until the last set|pg||
nt|tejjyid: surely not..that woudl be a shocking bid|pg||
nt|davidstern: 2@H quickly looks like -1|pg||
nt|marlowepi: need to stand ground in those situations....default is for E to bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl is take out|pg||
mb|3C|nt|athene: and almost none of them after it :)|pg||
nt|davidstern: 2-1-1-2 as a minimum loss|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dT|nt|yorkbeach:  sensible contract|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  4@s would be down even with @s3-3|pg||
nt|davidstern: On the first Board EW did in fact bid and make 4@S and 6 imps to Ivatury|pg||
pc|d6|nt|daman: looks like another minus for EW|pg||
nt|davidstern: Against the 3@H at this table -2|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|yorkbeach:  X must show a top @h|pg||
nt|athene: south can happily underlead in hearts to avoid blocking the suit|pg||
nt|athene: after the double of 2@H, showing a top honour|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  could to have partnership trust like that|pg||
nt|athene: maybe @H, @H, trump is best|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|psyck: hmm, didn't take them long to get into higher territories|pg||
nt|athene: then they can stop a spade ruff and come to two hearts and two spades|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  though the underlead would be more useful if South had a tenace somewhere|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: screen down and Chan is asking questions|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  did North really play the 8?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: YES|pg||

pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|psyck: to bad dummy comes up with the wrong pointed King|pg||

pc|d2|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|davidstern: Excellent switch needed before declarer can get dummy's diamond loser away on spade|pg||
pc|sK|nt|yorkbeach:  leads are 3rd and 5th|pg||
nt|athene: A,K,J,6 are the only ones higher than the 5 and south has to have them all|pg||
nt|athene: of course you have to have trust that partner didn't pull the wrong card :)|pg||

mb|4H|nt|tejjyid: time for a coffee...brb|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  had not seen the 3@c at the time :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  dod we think 3@c is any game force?|pg||
nt|athene: i guess he feels there is not that much need to bid his minor length honestly as they are very unlikely to want to play in a minor|pg||
nt|athene: especially after south didn't rebid 2minor over 1@S|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if he does not intend to play in spades even when he gets a spade preference, what is the point of 3@c?|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he feels that after being rebuked for the comedy 1nt overcall, it's important to show he isn't feeling bad about things :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I agree with South's 2@h|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|davidstern: Declaler makes at least 3-4-1-2 with chances for extra tricks in club = Cappuccino here it is \_/?|pg||

nt|marlowepi: 3N best spot tho:)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|yorkbeach:  I know some who believe in raising partner's suit on any hand with 3 trumps and a singleton|pg||

nt|davidstern: That was in NT in hearts losing two red tricks perhaps|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||

nt|athene: strong club, 2@C = positive with diamonds|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  system says they need 12 to open when balanced |pg||
nt|athene: 2@D shows hearts|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: meckwell don't play relays - they do just bid suits to try to find a fit|pg||
nt|athene: but they bid artificially to save space|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I understand why responder is making a transfer but why opener?|pg||
nt|davidstern: Diamond Diamond and heart through may get the defence an extra trick|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 3NT a more creative bid by SOuth|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with no disrespect to Ivatury team, playing against Nickell it could prove very beneficia; to open 4S with S hand. no need to tell me how it could work out badly instead|pg||
pc|d4|nt|tejjyid: not more effective though...|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: well the idea is they think ok, what suits would opener most want to show?|pg||
nt|davidstern: So this is boards 31 to 45 of a total 120 boards|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|athene: let's use the lowest bid for that|pg||
nt|athene: and the idea is that opener will more often want to show hearts than diamonds, so they use 2@D to show hearts|pg||
nt|athene: 3@C artficial showing a heart fit and a bad hand i think, just steps|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|sJ|nt|tejjyid: OK, a shaper spectatro points out that after 3 rounds of @D this is cold|pg||
pc|h8|nt|yorkbeach:  so long as diamonds are no worse than 4-2, declarer can give up a heart|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|c5|nt|davidstern: Declarer played this correctly as the cards lie but would have egg on his face of East had @HK-5|pg||
nt|davidstern: Yes as West would be endplayed on a club towards dummy|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: finessing the trumps gains against KQx or Hx onside, loses only to singleton honour offside|pg||
nt|tejjyid: right - personally I think not being in 4@H is poor bidding, but it's certainly hard to get there|pg||
nt|davidstern: No doubt Rodwell will cash @HK|pg||
nt|davidstern: Yes 4@H could be cold while 4@S could fail on any 4-2 spade break|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|nt|daman: that is his plan|pg||

nt|daman: Meckwell are deadly when they get involved in their stong club auctions|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  better suit this time|pg||
nt|athene: if everyone would only agree to pass meekly whenever you opened a strong club, there would be no doubt it was the best method|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  is pass 0-4?|pg||

mb|p|mb|3S!|mb|p|nt|athene: 1@D can be as short as two so he won't be all that eager to lead one|pg||

nt|athene: ok, no problem now|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: with both spades right i don't see how declarer can have a problem here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  did well to avoid @c lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: 4th best upside down count and attitude and I didn't hear if they play any smith|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: sometimes you rise with the @SK on the second spade - but only if you think west has @SQxx and you want to block the suit|pg||
nt|athene: and that's impossible here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer might have to guess whether East has Q10 or AQ|pg||
nt|daman: good lead by Rodwell|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: screen down|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  likley to get righton bidding|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the clue is that South has denied a major|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can cash the @DQ and then lead the jack|pg||
nt|athene: and when west follows, he can overtake as east is known to have 2+ diamonds|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West assumes that North has hearts because he can see only 2@h|pg||
nt|athene: so they must be breaking when west follows to the second one|pg||
nt|daman: he's not going down in this contract|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  presumably South's system did not suit is hand|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h6|pg||
nt|athene: maybe the low heart is upside down suit preference for a diamond back rather than a club|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: reasonable auction - north doesn't have great shape facing hearts but with 7 hcp you have to do something|pg||
nt|athene: if the @C5 were a little heart i think he would have bid 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: well, declarer is wondering if he should finesse the @H10|pg||
nt|daman: he has HCP and a bit of shape but his suits are feeble|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: normally 2-suiters with a 5-card major sort of fall into the hands you can bid, don't they?|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||

nt|daman: not on this side of the pond     we are not afraid to defend|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h2|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|athene: he leaves diamond right to the end and may eventually lead to the @H10 as a last desperate chance|pg||

pc|c7|pc|c4|pg||

nt|marlowepi: if clubs shows clbs and hearts or certain other hands, one might usefully play double of 2D as this S hand  -- spades with heart playability|pg||

nt|athene: well, you could play X of 2@D just t/o, asking for partner's other suit, and 2@H showing real hearts - lots of possibilities|pg||
nt|davidstern: I would however X 3@D here as takeout - partner bid freely over 2@D|pg||

pc|h7|pc|hK|pc|h9|nt|athene: natural 4nt will end the auction|pg||
nt|psyck: this should be a good result for EW here|pg||
nt|athene: 6nt would have made but only very luckily|pg||
nt|psyck: not easy to stay out of slam once W openes & you also find a fit|pg||
nt|athene: well he has poor trumps|pg||
nt|athene: also only a 4-4 fit and no obvious trick source|pg||
nt|psyck: true, well judged|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wouldnt pass 1S even if barred:)|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|athene: i imagine zia will win in dummy and run the @S10|pg||
nt|daman: seems logical|pg||
nt|athene: rodwell underleads three honours because declarer has length in the suit|pg||
nt|athene: so he doesn't want to block them if his partner turns up with something useful |pg||
nt|athene: of course meckstroth has just signalled with a heart which might potentially prove useful for leading through declarer :)|pg||
nt|athene: but maybe he has decided he is never getting in, so it can't really cost|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a bit surprising S did not bid game|pg||
nt|davidstern: Spade to dummy and run @D10|pg||
nt|davidstern: OK I know I can see all four hands|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think laying clubs first is more likely|pg||
nt|davidstern: The @H9 was very indiscrete by Meckstroth|pg||
nt|andyv:  9@h may turn out to be costly|pg||
nt|davidstern: Tick|pg||
nt|athene: 7 hcp not enough to bid game on its own but those are some nice club spots that might well play a part in 3nt|pg||
nt|davidstern: That @H9 is a very surprising card indeed now stops defence from cashing four hearts|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i wasnt counting walrus points, but looking at D queen, potentially huge, and the nice club potnetial|pg||
nt|davidstern: Silverstein Leads Wolfson by 3|pg||
nt|athene: sure, @DQ isn't any old doubleton queen|pg||
nt|marlowepi: only if E could get in would it make a difference|pg||
nt|davidstern: That @DJ shouldnt be discounted|pg||
nt|andyv:  match tied up as 3N was made in OR|pg||
nt|davidstern: Or the club jack for that matter|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|psyck: a faily lucky 12 tricks with @sQx|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: now all three of meckstroth's jacks are potential entries and he might be regretting that @H9|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if he hadnt spent the jack, declarer might have palyed differently|pg||
nt|marlowepi: spade pictures in dummy mean declarer will have the transport to perform avoidance against E knaves|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so reasonable for E to believe he wouldnt be getting in|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|psyck: *fairly|pg||

mb|3S|nt|athene: you could say something loud like "please put that king with the rest of your clubs, it looks so untidy"|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@c generally a mixed raise in competition|pg||

mb|d|nt|psyck: (if so, 7-9 5 card @c here)|pg||

mb|5D|mb|p|nt|athene: will he just give this a sixth, or try 5@S along the way?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in this situation, is 5N GSF?|pg||
nt|athene: no-one ever seems to use 5nt as GSF any more - it's always "pick-a-slam"|pg||
mb|5S!|mb|p|mb|6C!|nt|athene: north obviously assumes that 43@S by a passed hand has to have a diamond fit|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S|pg||

mb|7D|nt|athene: if opps have a 9-card fit, you are guaranteed to have at least an 8-card fit yourself|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: of course finding it might be another matter :)|pg||
nt|athene: ok, 5@S is exclusion keycard|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: ah, the old "spill your water and in the confusion change the contract to 3@DX" trick|pg||
nt|daman: like Ed Norton would do|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: useful bid to have available|pg||
nt|athene: meckwell think that slams mostly just need a keycard ask and some sort of exclusion - they don't cue all that much|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: Meckstroth says he love "your bid"|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|swanson: This 'back-in' bidding strategy is not a favorite of mine but that doesn't mean it won't be successful sometimes.|pg||
mb|5C|mb|5H|nt|Jacki: ok I'll help you, what's the silent player's name?|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|swanson: Zia may have a tough time not taking a swing at this.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chorush: this should end on an exciting note with EW +850 and 2 imps, so Nickell will lead by 10|pg||
nt|swanson: This will be +850 for E-W and another exciting 2IMP pickup.|pg||
nt|geot: I think Nickell should have had 1 imp on board 44, so 91 in total (Zia made +170?)|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: last board of this section|pg||
nt|daman: Zia is an old rubber player    most rubber player would bid 2@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: asks how much time left in this segment|pg||
nt|andyv:  I like N's actions because it shows that they are playing their game and not being influenced by the opps.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: all laugh when says 42 minutes|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: this is the final board of this session|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: On the hand where 4@S failed with East on lead giving partner heart ruffs in the OR South was declarer so no heart lead for ruff and 13 imps|pg||
mb|1D|nt|psyck: Last deal.  Thanks Bill & George.  Good job Debbie.  Thanks to the kibs for joining us & for their inputs.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|yorkbeach:  and almost back to where we started with the score|pg||
nt|davidstern: Last hand of this segment hence the laughter|pg||
mb|d|nt|daman: here is the vugraph sked for future sessions     http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|athene: south might have arrived at a spade lead by a process of elimination, i suppose|pg||
nt|athene: yes zia decided his 14 count really wanted to be a notrump|pg||
mb|4C|nt|psyck: 3NT = I have about 13 cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Hamman is writing notes to Lee  but I can't see what he is asking|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt might be a bit more scientific than just that|pg||
nt|athene: it might be actually showing a 4red bid but also offering a safe to partner if he is very pure|pg||
nt|athene: offering a save to partner|pg||
nt|davidstern: Official website http://www.usbf.org/|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Chan is opening and closing his hand|pg||
mb|d|mb|4H|nt|athene: whereas if zia had just bid 4@D or 4@H right away that might be simply trying to jam the auction and not suggesting a save|pg||
nt|daman: on Board 11    EW are in 5@D|pg||
nt|daman: in the OR|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Hamman has gotten up and left the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Zia asks what happen|pg||
nt|athene: hamman thinks he is dummy in 3nt?|pg||
nt|athene: seems unlikely :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Lee says to Zia he's tired of you|pg||
nt|psyck: 5@d should be ok, 1@s, 1@d losers|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: All are laughing |pg||
nt|athene: 7@S isn't such a bad contract is it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Security is very tight in this room|pg||
nt|psyck: that 5@d comment was about deal 11 other room of course|pg||
nt|daman: that's what I said   5@D in the OR|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: He'ss back|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Hamman says "he's sorry"|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: 10 minutes left|pg||
nt|athene: leading from four-card suits headed by the ace isn't all that appealing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: usually 74 should lay in the long suit. not keen on N bidding plan here|pg||
nt|andyv:  with no @d control this will stop at 4@h|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS may continue|pg||
mb|5C|nt|davidstern: The US U26 team for the U26 Championship in Coratia has been decided following an online tournament and will be Roger Lee - Dan Wolkowitz plus Jeremy Fournier - Mitch Towner plus ...|pg||
nt|davidstern: Kevin Dwyer - Owen Lien|pg||
nt|athene: lee might decide the double showed a club raise, in which case he will bid 5@C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: club raise? what clubs had been bid to raise?|pg||
nt|davidstern: Here are the entries http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_entries&event=20&task=list|pg||
nt|andyv:  the dbl of 4@c|pg||
nt|davidstern: 15 teams entered|pg||
nt|athene: a raise of north's putative club suit :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Lee points to club to Meckstroth and when ask the x shows the 4 spade bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i am not a huge fan of this sort of bidding (3nt then 5@D)|pg||
nt|athene: just bid 5@D first time, take a bit of room away|pg||
nt|psyck: I would guess that they will stop in 6 here|pg||
nt|daman: he is trying tio create some action|pg||
nt|athene: against very innocent opponents you can sow some confusion, maybe even get yourself doubled in 4@D|pg||
nt|athene: but asking a bit much to find innocence in this event?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Lee keeps reaching for bidding box|pg||
nt|daman: he wishes he could ask for aces|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: grabbing the box now|pg||
nt|davidstern: Here the scores for all the round of 16 matches before this set http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2011/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof16|pg||
mb|5D|nt|yorkbeach:  would rather lead a major than minor|pg||
nt|andyv:  i guess the support wasn't good enough|pg||
nt|davidstern: A trump lead will make this a little painful|pg||
mb|d|nt|andyv:  this could go for 800|pg||
nt|athene: if 4nt over 4@H would have been offering minors then 5@C should be a strong statement i.e. 6 or 7 clubs|pg||
nt|athene: but i guess no-one really knows what 4nt over 4@H would mean|pg||
nt|davidstern: Most people play 2 places to play but here???|pg||
nt|andyv:  or xruff (cash A@s first)|pg||
nt|andyv:  6@c goes only for 500|pg||
nt|davidstern: Club ruff spade to the ace and another club ruff spade ruff and now a trump|pg||
nt|davidstern: Problem then is that the spade and diamond seven are both entries|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Lee is shaking his head|pg||
nt|andyv:  so I hate to admit but Marshall seems to be right to not liking N's actions|pg||
nt|davidstern: As noted Might be hard for W to imagine void when opps pulled from @C to @D...|pg||
nt|davidstern: But on the @SA lead suit pref from East may guide defence|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: Now Zia is thinking|pg||
nt|daman: a successful operation by EW|pg||
nt|psyck: N chooses a practical option with no sure means of investigating anything else|pg||
nt|daman: if Zia pushed them to the Grand Salami?????       fireworks will start|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Zia picks up his cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: CLAIM|pg||
nt|daman: we have to remember    NS is not an established partnership    we need to cut them some slack|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think it's easy and most natural lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: What is?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Rodwell and Chan are talking to each other|pg||
pc|sA|nt|daman: see you for the next session|pg||
nt|psyck: they could have tried something different maybe, thet they were in unknown territories|pg||
nt|psyck: *but they...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: There is 22 minutes left in this round and there will be a 10 to 15 minute break|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: thanks by Chan|pg||
nt|davidstern: I think we will see the spade 2 from Meck|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there are downsides to 3C opener but it also has upsides. nothing clear there. but over 1H the X was opening a can of worms.  the whole N bidding plan reflected a thirst for play ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in spades. but esp when the hand is weak i am a firm adherent  of Reese's dictum "swans should play in the long suit"  (swan = 74 shape)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|d2|pc|cK|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  feel the same about four-card suits with ace but do not like Jxx either|pg||
pc|s5|nt|davidstern: That will likely be the same in their methods|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d4|pc|s8|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|pc|d8|pc|cA|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|pc|d6|pc|s9|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|pc|s2|nt|davidstern: @DJ now and another trick for the defence|pg||
nt|davidstern: -1100|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|h2|nt|davidstern: Sorry no more -800|pg||
