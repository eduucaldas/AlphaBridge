mb|4H|nt|Vugraphzfb: Hurd sticking it to them|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chorush: I would predict 4NT here|pg||
nt|drewsky: Both Levin and Weinstein have been competing in bridge nationals since their mid teens.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: actually 6 Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Made doubled with an overtrick by Schermer in one room|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: 6@D|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, but bidding 6 is unreal|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|nt|Vugraphzfb: Heres the deal if you make five you make six if you dont make six you wont make 5|pg||
mb|5H|nt|Vugraphzfb: Nice competitive auction here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: So this will be -2 versus a shakey 5@C|pg||
nt|henryb:  5@h goes 2 down|pg||
mb|d|nt|chorush: Weinstein is ooking askance at that KQx of clubs for this bidding, but will take the money|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Wooldridge thinking about ????|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I have a suspicion that we may see the emergence of the blue card here|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: Nope|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: Phew|pg||
nt|drewsky: Well judged by everyone...and not so easy to do after a high level preeempt.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Well judged by both sides|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Stevie Weinstein doesnt seem too phased but then again he never does|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|cT|pc|c4|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|nt|chorush:  Levin Weinstein play upside down attitude and standar count|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|henryb:  The "blue card" is redouble: in bidding boxes Pass is green, double red, and redouble dark blue|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Some don't have pass cards, they keep bidding|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c5|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sK|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|d5|mc|9|nt|chorush: 1st hand of this match between 1st and second gets par resut|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk4: This won't be dull either|pg||
mb|1S|nt|chorush: Im sure Levin would prefer some 4-3-3-3 16 counts|pg||
nt|henryb:  There used to be a tv show in England called "Mastermind" where contestants answered really difficult questions first on general knowledge and then on some abstruse subject. |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: terday is the dealing machine on LSD|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: As somebody asked yesterday|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Still there, Henry|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|Vugraphzfb: Nice Pass by Wooldridge|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Let me guess 1NT not natural|pg||
nt|chorush: Sonny Moyse would have had some hard words for 1NT 40 years ago|pg||
nt|curtis: good result on last board for Hurd. In other rooms making 5m x|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Heart blockage unfortunate|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  At the end of a series of questions the MC would announce "John Smith, on that round you had X points and Y passes."|pg||
mb|3N!|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: All true except that the specific subject comes first|pg||
nt|henryb:  I had a partner who routinely would have hands with 8 points and no passes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: This is where Levin Weinsteins seem to get the marbles - they have very much right sided this from the lead point of view|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: 3NT showed 6 spades balanced or treated as balanced|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|Vugraphzfb: Sorry Joel - Guess I should have played the @D5 says Levin|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d4|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|c5|pc|c9|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Goodbye to his hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Some people are a pleasure to do VG for - Weinstein hands me an explanation of the bidding|pg||
pc|d5|nt|henryb:  sort of unlucky, first @d are 5-0 and then the @cQ does not drop|pg||
nt|drewsky: Many pairs use this 3NT call to show this type of hand, but I doubt very many of them have agreed to follups.|pg||
nt|drewsky: followups.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: or goodbye to dummy if he prefers. Not often you get that option|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Best now is @HQ to the ace another heart and then spade|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Easier for us|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Hurd holding the @HQ in the air for 10 seconds then back into his hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Again it is in the air|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But North's shape should be known now|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|hK|pg||
pc|hT|pc|d7|pc|hJ|pc|h3|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|Walddk4: Perfect defense|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|henryb:  Apparently Mastermind is still alive, or alive again because it went dead for a couple of seasons when Magnus Magnusson retired|pg||
mc|6|nt|Vugraphzfb: Levin bemused to find East had @HQJ andd West didnt bid|pg||
pg||

nt|drewsky: In any event, north-south would fail in 5 of either minor|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|Vugraphzfb: Levin musing that all he needed was queen doubletoin club|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 12 tricks here but the slam can hardly be bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hT|nt|Walddk4: If you are in slam you make it. When you are not you may not make 12 tricks (heart lead)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Getting old and doing VG is no fun when you need one pair of glasses for the computer and another to see the play GRRR!!!|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|Walddk4: Can't get all in one in Oz?|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h9|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|drewsky: David, may I suggest either tri-foculs or Lasek ?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: OK; so 12 tricks anyway|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|pc|d5|pc|d4|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: All those suggestions are good but not recommended by my Opthalmologist|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|henryb:  I think E opened 1@d and W responded 1@s|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Must be those glasses|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Hope Weinstein does not take Levin too seriously|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: No scores are EVER published during the session for the cavendish. The VG opeartors receive the leaderboard after the second last round i.e. with one round to go|pg||
nt|chorush: this auction is not correct|pg||
nt|henryb:  East really passed ????|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  better|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: OK s I am a male and can only SOMETIMES multitask :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Walddk4: When you don't get a trump lead on an auction like this there is a good chance that they break 5-0|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: And the inverse is possibly true too|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Normal case for a trump lead|pg||
nt|chorush: Some players use 2H/1D as 5s with 4+ hearts limited; those players will reach 4 hearts|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: As that famous song goes - "Wehere do I begin"|pg||
nt|chorush: So some swings are possible|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Spade up now is good if South has the @SA as no trump continuation is possible and  it sets up a trick|pg||
nt|Walddk4: @C4 and the deal would have hit the papers and magazines|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Oh what a twisted mind you have sometimes Roland to be thinking about these things|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's not as silly as it may look|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: It may also make its way to other quarters too|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|Vugraphzfb: Nice pick|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Heart now is good too|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Happy mother's day to all the mums out there|pg||
nt|warrens:  now a @H to get that in?  then start a crossruff?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Yep Warren that would be my plan|pg||
