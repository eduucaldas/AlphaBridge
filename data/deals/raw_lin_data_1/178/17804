mb|p|mb|1H!|mb|p|mb|3N!|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: I guess West believes he has diamonds reasonably stopped|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, but that's about it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: They certainly seem to have the style for this event down pat|pg||
nt|scotty: Pretty short of tricks here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Jeff Sapire|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Leaderboard during this round and entire list after the session at this table which will remain open pending those scores|pg||
pc|s6|nt|scotty: Not sure why East didn't double 1@d - maybe because of the vul, he preferred not to try for a number at the 1-level|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Nice lead for defence|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Yeah well nowehere nice for N/S to run to|pg||
nt|scotty: Attitude lead - with !J and something in clubs, he leads a high spot|pg||
nt|scotty: Declarer may rise at trick one because spade spot suggests N does not have QJ|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|fann4: Perhaps West couldn't (or didn't want to) rebid 1@S here, so the 4-4 @S fit got lost.|pg||
