mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|psridhar: Opening 1N ( 15-17) with a 5 card Maj is common ; but a weak NT opg is debatable -may even be a long discussion; i personally prefer 1Maj in pref to 1NT weak|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: now this can be interesting|pg||
nt|josj: only a @H lead causes trouble in 3nt|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|andyv:  in this case, E hand just looks like it should be opened 1NT|pg||
nt|josj: well, getting his partner to bid probably was not what E intended with his X but 2@H is as good a contract as anything|pg||
nt|vugraphzec: Eddy ask Suci what X next pass|pg||
nt|josj: EW suddenly seizing away the initiative from NS|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|pc|c8|nt|jcwla: A gift of 13 to Prima Timah A on 16 as the OR E bid the 5-5-minors 15-count all the way to 4@C sua sponte, W finally raised, and N had the answer for that to the tune of 800.|pg||
