nt|poohbear: Can bid 2@h 1@s or 2@c drury|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Levin searching for his glasses - actually his mother is - her mothers day present is to watcjh him play bridge i guess|pg||
mb|2C|an|Alerted|nt|poohbear: she is his designated dummy player|pg||
mb|3C|nt|poohbear: has been watching the whole event|pg||
nt|poohbear: smoker's remorse|pg||
mb|3D|an|Hand wave semi alert|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|poohbear: Fleisher's 3@c bid aggressive|pg||
nt|poohbear: I wouldnt do it|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|poohbear: I need a singleton|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Cant say I am a huge fan of Fleisher's 3@C bid here|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|poohbear: or as pointed otu GOOD TRUMPS|pg||
nt|poohbear: has more merit if the opps havent found a fit yet|pg||
nt|nubmaster: But 3@c might also be preparing to sacrifice if NS bids the game and Wests hand is good vs Easts... He only got one chance|pg||
nt|poohbear: Now Weinstein has to worry about bad breaks|pg||
nt|poohbear: like I said. I need a singleton|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: OK lineups for last round are This Table Levin Weinstein vs Pszcola and Lev|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Sorry That will be VG3|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: VG1 will be Stewart Woolsey vs Piekarek Smirnov|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: and VG2 will be Hurd Wooldridge vs Hamman Mamood|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer is reasonably sure @cs not 7-1|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Why bid 3@d to tell opponents the lie of the cards if you're going to bid 4@h anyway?|pg||
nt|poohbear: Fleisher woulda preempted|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Scores at the Cavendish are NEVER published during the session except before the last round|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|pc|c9|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer going for 1@d ruff and hope one red suit breaks well|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: And even those arent made avaialbel to the players only posted when they come out from the last round pending the final scores being posted|pg||
nt|pelu: yes the players has to be seated for last round before results|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|pc|c6|pc|cA|pg||
nt|arobson:  Hi all, will help commentate|pg||
nt|poohbear: Hi andy|pg||
nt|cavendish: welcome andrew|pg||
nt|arobson:  This 3@C bid has given South headaches|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Somebody asked Levin Weinstein System Card try http://www.usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=265&pid=194|pg||
nt|arobson:  I think Steve bid 3@D because (a) he might have a slam facing the red aces but more likely (b) he may need his side to judge over 4@S or 5@C|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|h4|pc|d5|pg||
nt|arobson:  South worried about 4-1 hearts. he thinks East needs a singleton for his bid (as e did!)|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: Hard to judge but I will have the leaderboard with one round to go half way throuygh the next set|pg||
nt|arobson:  Will North balance after 2@H P 2@S P P ?|pg||
nt|poohbear: Well Smith and Cohen who were about 700 behind had a 350 imp swing against Levin Weinstein on one board|pg||
mb|2H|nt|arobson:  Really?|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: they defended 5@c while levin Weinstein defended cold 7@s|pg||
nt|arobson:  wow|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I suspect that this is no lock for L/W|pg||
nt|poohbear: they seem to have the best of the boards I have watched them play as well|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|nt|arobson:  That was some 3@S bid from East|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|pg||
nt|arobson:  His cards are good...but there aren't that many of them|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|pc|h5|pc|d6|pg||
nt|pelu: but if 2@D promise @S-fit why bid 2@H with a passed partner?|pg||
pc|d8|pc|sJ|nt|arobson:  West looking for perfecto, East thinking he is better than he might be. Both somewhat overbidding.|pg||
pc|c7|pc|dT|pg||
nt|poohbear: why cant came be cold opp some @h cards and a dbltn @d?|pg||
nt|arobson:  Not hard to find a 2@D bid that gives West a play for game. I think East is mainly at fault here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Levin not enjoying thee slow pace of this hand|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|pelu: just a gift for Levin - Weinstein :) - W must be looking for finishline |pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: Weinstein wont be too worried about spade stoppers|pg||
nt|poohbear: they are all teammates too|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: these 4 will be US 1 in the upcoming bermuda bowl|pg||
pc|h5|nt|poohbear: but Fleisher will be playing with Kamil and Martel with Stansby|pg||
nt|poohbear: Fleisher and martel have been playing the Cavendish pairs together for quite a few years|pg||
nt|arobson:  Much will depend on declarer's view in clubs|pg||
nt|pelu: hope for US that his card-play will improve in Bermuda Bowl :)|pg||

mb|2H|mb|2N!|nt|arobson:  And Steve's Bridge Winners is really good for the game|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: Yes and they know the system - from A to Z !|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d8|nt|arobson:  I should say Bridge Winners is Gavin Wolperts really (who is fabulous), Steve is a major contributor (especially given the online poker restrictions these days)...|pg||
