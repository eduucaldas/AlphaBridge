mb|1S|mb|p|nt|chorush: This should be an intersting matchup. Wooldridge had the best record at the recent Spring nationals in the US and has been ver hot lately|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: hi ira|pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|gosia: hello :)|pg||
nt|chorush: H+H were the 2nd highest bid pair in the Calcutta and rightly so, but they have not had things go their way- yet|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|chorush: Hi Marge|pg||
nt|gosia: hi Ira|pg||
nt|bigtrain: hi marge|pg||

nt|vugraphzfp: It's always a great feeling as dummy when partner claims on or before the first trick to a slam :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: of which there are few|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chorush: Hellness has 17 HCP and Helgemo will not have a picnic in 3NT|pg||

pc|d2|pc|h5|nt|vugraphzfp: Helgemo now asking about leads and carding|pg||
nt|gosia: as am I :)|pg||
nt|chorush: I think that he will rise to lead heart toward Q|pg||
nt|chorush: If they lead 2nd from poor suits |pg||
nt|gosia: and can make |pg||
nt|gosia: if ups play rho for KJ @h|pg||
nt|gosia: we wait with baited breath :)|pg||
nt|chorush: Even if clubs are 4-4 and he loses 2 diamond tricks he only has 8 Would need a squeeze, which also seems to work|pg||
nt|gosia: 3 @h 2 @s 2 @d 2 @c's|pg||

nt|gosia: still bait|pg||
nt|gosia: we can see that low @h to Q then finesse 10 on way back :)|pg||
nt|chorush: which would also work against Kxx or KJx in Wooldrige's hand|pg||

nt|bigtrain: KNR is a hand evaluation engine created by edgar kaplan and jeff rubens|pg||
nt|gosia: how do you get to 5@c's- we will watchand learn :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi|pg||
mb|3C|nt|chorush: depends on modern tendency to not worry about extra values for free bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|gosia: 2nt with 5 @h makes no sense to ?me - perhaps a 3@C jump q|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|gosia: give them the 3 level for nothing with 10 trumps|pg||
nt|bigtrain: usually jump Q is used for another hand type like mixed raise|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|chorush: very nice decision by Hurd|pg||
nt|bigtrain: also allows YOU to have trial bids opposite a limit raise|pg||
nt|gosia: 7-9 HCP and 4/5 trump ?|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gosia: yes Johnny be good :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|gosia: South hand not a limit raise to me - I would bid 1-2 constructive over 1 @h opener|pg||

nt|vugraphzfp: If you highlight the alerted bid with your mouse you can see that 2NT was 4+@H and 6+hcp =)|pg||
