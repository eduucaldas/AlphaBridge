nt|Walddk2: 3 obvious losers. This will be flat'ish around the room I predict|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: there's no scope really in the play here - we can all forceast 10 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Although 5@H only goes for 300. Not much in it|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pjs_ch: oops - meant a 4@H bid|pg||

mc|10|nt|pelu: 1-2 pairs will play from N - and make 12 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You may even get 500 against 5@H|pg||

nt|Walddk2: and easy 5@D here?|pg||
mb|2S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|pelu: for sure not easy to bid :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: More trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|pjs_ch: I guess only the vulnerability stopped N bidding 3@S last time|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Will depend what Fleisher does here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But you need 2 spade ruffs|pg||
nt|pelu: if Lebensohl is on here - and sh be - then 3@D is constructiv and East can bid 35@d|pg||
nt|Walddk2: N-S can prevent that|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Yes a trump lead becomes problematic|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: there is a case for 2N over that double being non-natural; if your choice is Lebensohl then 3@D would show a positive attitude, if not some values|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I doubt East will bid 35 diamonds but 5 may be possible but not now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: for sure 3@D was not contructiv for EW - would u play Lebensohl here?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Fleisher asked if 3@D was constructive and Martel says no just so opps are not disadvantaged|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Would you have found a trump against 5?|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: Leb usually right if you have a possibility of game on - feels like that should be true here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: dummy reversal?|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: might depend on your willingness to make a takeout X of 1@S quite weak|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: set up king of hearts|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|pjs_ch: will this be strong with hearts or strong balanced?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: although 3NT can also make if you play on hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|pjs_ch: yep - but 3N won't be a common choice with only 3 spades between them !|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Next up this table Levin/Weinstein vs Fleisher/Martel other tables Hurd/Wooldridge vs Fredinn/Wrang and Stewart/Woolsey vs L'Ecuyer/Krekorian|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch: not sure how strong 2@H is meant to be, but I'd like it to be stronger than that |pg||
nt|Walddk2: In 3NT you cash @CAK first in case the queen falls. If not you finesse hearts|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: I think that a 1@H opener will be more common|pg||
nt|pelu: I prefer 4( 4½) loser not 5-5½ as here|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch: Martel has quite a good hand in this context - I can see him proceeding beyond 4@H|pg||
