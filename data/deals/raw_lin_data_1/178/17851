nt|henryb:  heart still pumping madly. I noticed that one pair bought Board 15 (the 6-5 club fit where E-W had a 12 card @s fit) in 6@c, but apparently misguessed the clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzfp: Thomas asked Woolsey about carding and 1st trick carding, Kit answers 1st trick is suit preference and after that is count|pg||

mc|12|nt|ahollan1: hence  "perfecta"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: defense took 1st 4 tricks against 4@H  but this is much better|pg||
