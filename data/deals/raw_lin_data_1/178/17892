nt|sybarra: hi Joe :) |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: NS - standard - EW = precision|pg||
nt|hawe45: hi|pg||
nt|peachy: Thanks operators, appreciated information|pg||
nt|hawe45: Excuse me - can one play precision and be late for the start...?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: No you haven't|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Now you have|pg||
nt|hawe45: This board was played two hours ago|pg||
nt|hawe45: 100 % sure - director|pg||
nt|andreasw:  good hands to start with tho.. what happend on the board?|pg||
nt|iceak:  JÃ³n and ÃorlÃ¡kur both world champions from Yokohama 1991|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridge.is/meistarastig/20102011/magiccontest.htm  for running scores|pg||
nt|iceak:  SÃ¦var and Karl have both often represented in open teams for Iceland|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I think we start with board 1 in this room|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 15 and 126 in the open|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 15-16|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Sry folks, need to restart|pg||
nt|iceak:  JÃ³n and ÃorlÃ¡kur play relay system|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Good morning everyone|pg||
nt|sybarra: gm Liz and all:)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: East is my partner from the Mixed Teams in Rhodes :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and hello to Isak our operator |pg||
nt|sybarra: great so you will know proclivities |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: hi - 2@d, 2@h and 2@s are same for both pairs - multi and 9-12|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Unfortunately he agreed to play my system, so I cannot help much with his|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty |pg||
nt|sybarra: nt ranges?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Hello everyone. Welcome to the 11th round of Icelandic Championship Finals|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello folks|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|psyck: This is the last round & finals from tomorrow?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: N-S are strong favorites to winning the title in tomorrows 4 team finals|pg||
nt|psyck: ah, thanks|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: E-W will need to be quite lucky to crawl into top 4|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Live score:  http://www.bridge.is/meistarastig/20102011/magiccontest.htm|pg||
nt|ady: just short of a slam for n/s|pg||
nt|ady: aeven with K@C onside would still need favourable trump split    and diamond split 4-3|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: velcome all - your operator is Isak Orn Sigurdsson|pg||
nt|ady: good morning all|pg||
nt|ady: hi Orn|pg||
nt|ady: there is the chance that should n.s reach 6@S  east might lead A@H  which would set up 2 heart tricks for 12   or also  otherwise there is a possibility of east being end played|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We need our operator to shut down and reconnect|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But not much luck when I ask him to|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: both pairs play standard their version|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: aker-richter playing short 1C with transfers and unbal 1d|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: Good bidding - up to now|pg||
nt|peachy: operator seems to have some practicing session going, no cards :)  Hang on, I'm sure we will be on shortly|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Hmmm....|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: The bidding has not been like this :)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: You need to redeal to a board first|pg||
nt|Walddk5: You can't bid with a blank screen|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: I have the board|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Isak?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: hi Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Ian |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 14-16|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like strong nt for e/w |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Please read on your screen|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Jill/Jill were waiting outside the enclosure for EW to show up|pg||
mb|1N|an|14+ to 17|nt|hawe45: Good luck to everybody|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Looks normal to reach 4@S here, but game is off on top. So unfair|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good evening all|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: this table was late finishing first segment.  donn-goren in a hurry to start, other table wasn't up yet|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: That's an odd choice of take out double from south I must say- makes it hard to express her hand type|pg||
nt|athene: yet another good hand for the "4333 plays in notrumps" rule|pg||
nt|psyck: EW 6th with 159|pg||
nt|psyck: NS joint 2nd with 175|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: E-W play Precision with 14-16 NT. N-S play 2/1 with unbalanced @D and transfer responses to 1@C|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks, welcome back to the final round of the Icelandic team championship.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Both pairs are playing Precision with quite unusual 2nd level|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
nt|lml: hi|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Peter|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: good evening all :)|pg||
nt|dinos1: hello|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: heavy mixed raise I'd say|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: hello commentators and specs|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: well, if it gets them to 3NT...|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt looks as though it definitely ought to have chances|pg||
nt|mgb81: NS have the chance for a brilliancy by bidding 3NT...seems a bit far fetched though|pg||
nt|athene: i am amazed how well 3nt scores over 4major when you have a 4333|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: more system details available from the teams pages off the www.usbf.org site|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 2@S was not obligatory|pg||
nt|lml: hi Mark|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Mark|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now, is that 5@C exclusion roman key-card for spades.....|pg||
nt|psyck: NS play Precision, EW 2/1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: scores thru 3 of 8 15 board segments at  http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2011/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof16|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there are only 7 matches in this Round of 16      Diamond has Bye into Round of 8|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sybarra: a not so easy 3 nt|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Early evening here in Bath|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hello Mike, Ed and CK|pg||
nt|dinos1: I wd bid 2@s as suit+fit, if they play it|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hi John|pg||
nt|Walddk5: and welcome to Sergey and Glen|pg||
nt|glen: agreed, fit showing jump better |pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: we will probably see smolen in use |pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @H showing 4 H! and 5 @S |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Smolen|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Indeed - I think we just did. if East bids 3NT now West should trust him|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: North has seen his partner's 1@H bids before|pg||
nt|psyck: :)|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@h some king of positive response i guess, maybe with bal hand too?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 4@H seemed to be natural vs. a more solid citizen|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: gordon/aker exchanging scribbles regarding 2@S|pg||
nt|othered1: HI, everyone|pg||
nt|mdgraham: HI all|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: NS play a lot of unusual methods and gave me a copy of their CC so I can try to follow along|pg||
nt|glen: now @S Q is worth 13 points (or is that in the game of @Hs?)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Rosenthal pulls the tray through, 3@H slides off the pile, Silverstein rushes to put it back|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphzdh: The theme of today has been favourable slam layouts|pg||
nt|othered1: West must have prety high standards for an opening|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|mgb81: North can try eliminating and messing around a bit but with everyone balanced there isn't any chance of a defensive screw up|pg||
nt|athene: you really want to be facing a 1-suiter though - not so good if the long spades are part of a 2-suiter|pg||
nt|mgb81: or is there...?|pg||
nt|copeyj: @DA lead should eliminate the problems at trick 1, 2 and 3 Michaerl|pg||
nt|copeyj: or even Michael|pg||
nt|dburn: well, the defence can begin with three rounds of diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn: and if they get endplayed after that, they deserve to get endplayed|pg||
nt|ianmcc: a bit desperate if @h led|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello folks|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome David and Warren|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: you could endplay them after that and force them to give a ruff and discard :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and ht it is (was certainly likely) |pg||
nt|santyclz: I would have led a @c, probably the only lead that lets it make.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: i think the only way it might make is if west somehow loses her clubs and then east gets squeezed in hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|peachy: Thanks for coming to cheer for your favorites|pg||
nt|pelu: looks like down 1|pg||
nt|lml: I think 4@H is a touch pushy especially nv. |pg||
nt|lml: yes it will take very careful defence to let 4@H make|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: muted voices from the next table.  we are curtained off in the corner of a large ballroom here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, easy 1M rebid over a 1@D response|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but this looks like a good reward|pg||
nt|dinos1: easier for N to evaluate the game, easier to defend if EW overbid|pg||
pc|hA|nt|psyck: don't need to preempt opps when they tend to do it themselves i guess|pg||
nt|ahollan1: system summary forms for all participants under  http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_entries&event=20&task=list|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Oh well - worried about the clubs, does not know where partner's shortage is|pg||
nt|xenya: well we all have been in worse slams i believe|pg||
nt|psyck: I can understand a try with 5@d, but 6@d looks to be a bit of a gamble.  This is a decent slam though, unfortunate as it needs nothing more than a finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: The problem with the West hand is that it is only worth a GF in NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Sry - was following the board|pg||
nt|ady: hi Roland    Warren|pg||
nt|warrens:  hi all.  |pg||
nt|Walddk5: Other match scores are now up at http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_vugraphs&event=USBC2011|pg||
pc|h9|nt|santyclz: And another potential slam hand.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sybarra: this will go down (Unfortunately) on the club ruff |pg||
nt|ady: not a great slam    but could make with wrong lead   either club or heart|pg||
nt|warrens:  S has to decide if he has enough for another bid here.  his Kx of @H's and only 3 trumps was not enough|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Here we have a making grand slam, which you would not want to bid though|pg||
nt|santyclz: 7 on a finesse.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Easy -1 if N doesn´t cover @sQ!@sJ|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzdh: A double of 2@H, showing some 5-7 HCP had maybe worked better|pg||
nt|ady: now should be 12 tricks|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|mgb81: In the other room it looks like Susannah Gross pulled off a pseudo squeeze as Ruth Connelly sitting west pitched two clubs, squeezing her partner|pg||
nt|hawe45: @H - @D-ruff - and then @S from the defence|pg||
pc|hT|nt|iceak:  could have a chance because of favourable @d lay|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Unless, of course, as here, when you need a 23-7 victory|pg||
nt|santyclz: This is very likely to be the standings link:   http://www.bridge.is/meistarastig/20102011/magiccontest.htm|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Then perhaps, if you find out that nothing is missing except the king of trumps, you might take the action to bid 7|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: As you can see in the running scores, Grant Thornton has a comfortable leading margin of 15 VP, so 10 VP is enough for them to defend their title|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: director pops in to write down the lineups|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzdh: I guess that Jón Baldursson's @S2 in first trick meant that he wanted a @C switch|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: They play udca, so low card is usually encouraging, which in the case of a singleton in dummy usually calls for a trump|pg||
nt|iceak:  difficult not to find a trump switch|pg||
pc|s3|pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: but since west hasn't got anything to keep but her clubs....|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other rooms visible via http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ianmcc: don't like that @h8 but still 5 tx for defence|pg||
nt|pelu: now sown 2: 3x@C and @S-ruff|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hawe45: @D Jack was a partner-test..|pg||
nt|psyck: EW System: http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=768&pid=151|pg||
nt|psyck: NS System: http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=800&pid=458|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap contemplating the defense again.  very contemplative the first set as well|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: leans back, shakes head, leans forward, rubs his forehead...|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mgb81: However declarer then claimed one down, so maybe the play record is inaccurate.|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, but even this requires some good breaks (which work).|pg||
nt|santyclz: They are certainly trying for a grand and have bypassed rck so...|pg||
nt|santyclz: But they stop at the sensible contract.|pg||
nt|friggi: then best one|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|friggi: the|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: but each match playing a different set of boards|pg||
pc|s6|nt|hawe45: @S now, what else could work well?|pg||
nt|iceak:  declarer maybe on his way|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: But it is very common to play Lavintahl when dummy shows with a singleton|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all sorry I am late |pg||
nt|suketbombi: hi all|pg||
nt|iceak:  hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: High @S would have called for @D, small for @C, middle for more @S or trump|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Shirley Ybarra|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and Dima Nikolenkov|pg||
nt|dima:  Hi all :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Hi there :)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: HI Dima Isak & Shirley:)|pg||
nt|iceak:  hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: The defence stands no chance now, should I tell Þorlákur :)|pg||
nt|dima:  Do pairs use some special systems?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: The 2011 USBC will select USA2 for the 2011 Bermuda Bowl to be held Oct. 15-29 in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. USA1, chosen at the 2010 USBC, will be the Fleisher team ...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: (Fleisher-Kamil, Levin-Weinstein, Martel-Stansby). |pg||
pc|s4|nt|Vugraphzfd: cashing HQ for the uppercut not obvious|pg||
nt|psyck: Cashing @hq & playing @d would have allowed another trick with trump promoted|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|hawe45: Claim|pg||
nt|hawe45: Trump back would have defeated this contract|pg||
pc|c2|nt|iceak:  EW use relays|pg||
nt|psyck: Actually, if 2@h denied @h stopper in addition to showing a balanced positive, 6@d bid looks much better|pg||
nt|friggi: home run|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Cohen: well done, we saved|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|dima:  Ina strong clubs context?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: the problem with stripping side-suits and hoping for some elimination is that it's always really obvious what you are doing|pg||
nt|athene: so opps know to throw their kings brilliantly from Kx and stuff like that when it's needed|pg||
nt|ianmcc: looks like making now|pg||
nt|santyclz: @s pitch may have let it through.|pg||
nt|lml: so first imps go to Aker|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|nt|peachy: Well, the hearts come in so I don't think so|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|glen: this is a Weinstein vs. Levin match, but not the two who already qualfied for the worlds|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: cant tell the players without a program|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|glen: any move by S and N will be in game|pg||
nt|marlowepi: fairly conservative so far. N is very close t 3 card LR, and S very close to just bdding 4S|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|d8|pc|dQ|pg||

nt|marlowepi: all roads led to same spot of course|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: these NS though open pretty much any 11 (the first board here notwithstanding)|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d7|pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in that case it is useful to use a 2C response as 2-way:  either a 3 card LR or a natural GF|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that kees 1S-2S from having too wide a range, while still allowing you to subside at 2S |pg||

nt|mgb81: we can see that the defence lost its way in the other room|pg||
nt|mgb81: 4S looks booked for at least two down but west played ace and another diamond and declarer got a club away|pg||
nt|santyclz: And a quick lead for the team I'll not try to type.|pg||
nt|peachy: Then he does not lose the DK to ruff, tricky hand to defend|pg||
nt|hawe45: One @H to the 10, @D-ruff and trump|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think especially at pairs you want your systems in working order |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Yes E-W play strong @C, N-S standard 2/1|pg||
nt|iceak:  Think strong club |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Yes, I think 6@D was quite reasonable|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Wolfson: that [3@D] doesn't show extras, does it?  Cohen: a ittle|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: east played the @D5 on the ace|pg||
nt|mgb81: with 5H cold (North is squeezedin the minors on an unlikely trump lead) there are several ways for this to gain a swing to England|pg||
nt|mgb81: will kelly bid 4S or 1S?|pg||
nt|athene: 3NT overcall definitely a bit whimsical|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe we can just call them SS |pg||
nt|dima:  ok|pg||
nt|ady: 6@H   an excellent spot     but may fail  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Garner in 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: or pronounce|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: easier if gordon cashes @HK and plays @H across|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, on very tentative auction, picking up speed at the end|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|athene: asking partner to have an ace out of the blue is a bit much|pg||
nt|santyclz: (It being only 7:15 here my fingers aren't awake yet.)|pg||
nt|psyck: 1N probably artificial|pg||
nt|ady: 6@S   has only 1 top loser    but not enough tricks   especially on a trump lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdh: 20-21|pg||
nt|sybarra: some of us up much earlier watching the royal wedding :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: N/s could maybe make 4@s|pg||
mb|2S|nt|santyclz: I figured since they didn't invite me I wasn't obligated to watch.|pg||
nt|peachy: Often the defense indeed does well to start trumps early, the reason they play in trump contract is so they can ruff something :)|pg||
nt|hawe45: Exactly|pg||
nt|dima:  looks like negative double will get NS to 4@h|pg||
nt|iceak:  How strong is NS NT?|pg||
nt|dima:  likely 12-14 :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: N-S use weak NT in 1st and 2nd|pg||
nt|ady: 2@C   shows diamonds|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Jill L  treating hand more aggressively|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: this is interesting|pg||
nt|ady: 3@C   natural   |pg||
nt|santyclz: 6@s on a low @h lead...|pg||
nt|santyclz: A truly awful contract.|pg||
nt|friggi: yes - but very unlikely to get there|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mgb81: what????????|pg||
nt|athene: hmmmm|pg||
nt|sybarra: making 5 moving right along |pg||
nt|iceak:  no problems to win this|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 6@H actually can be made on this one|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: And Sævar has a bit of a problem, because he does not quite know partners hand type|pg||
nt|iceak:  My guess he will pass|pg||
nt|dima:  surely they would have some slam try bid (like 4@d) on the way available|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Does he have 15-17 balanced? Even 18-19? Or maybe 14-17 unbalanced?|pg||
nt|psyck: or not :|pg||
nt|friggi: 3NT is the deal here|pg||
nt|santyclz: Needs the 10,8 doubleton of @ss just for starters.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the rise to 2@s from W is for me a strong hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: literally what on earth is going on|pg||
nt|athene: west has decided that she can get lots of heart ruffs|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe South really bid 4@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: I remember the grant thornton team from prior tourneys,  SS we saw in an early round |pg||
nt|chessmaste: South has a decent hand, but North's pass made it clear to go quietly|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and rightly so|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: why would you ever reopen with a double on the east cards?|pg||
nt|athene: best would be an SOS redouble from north|pg||
nt|ianmcc: howcome they left you out?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think being vul, N/S do not get in|pg||
nt|psyck: I would have prefered a mixed raise instead|pg||
nt|psyck: (mixed raise, 6-9, by passed hands or in competition)|pg||
nt|psyck: anyway, with the @da well placed this should also make|pg||
nt|cuttysark: East can afford to be brave at the vulnerability|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I am not sure you can ever make 6 with a @D lead |pg||
nt|sybarra: I just dont see that,, unless you are talking about judging the spade position immediately|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Double dummy you can, by finessing @S at first opportunity|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You can't|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Does not help|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: A painful pass from East|pg||
nt|warrens:  tough call for S now.|pg||
nt|friggi: right|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3N not bad|pg||
nt|friggi: and then the rest to be good|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: E-W's 2 of a major opening is quite unique. |pg||
nt|santyclz: Welcome to Germ Kemper.|pg||
nt|friggi: they must just used it when unvul or what StefánÐ|pg||
nt|friggi: ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: And I have noticed that the frequency is really high|pg||
nt|friggi: sry I have US keyboard|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: They use it all vulnerabilities|pg||
nt|kemperg: bit late, was on another table |pg||
nt|mdgraham: I don't know if NS do it, but some pairs who play this 2-way 2@c response rebid 2@d as an artificial game-force|pg||
nt|psyck: 1@h was 10-15, so 3@h may have been an inv only, not sure|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: donn's pad seems to say 2@H = 4+@D|pg||
nt|glen: its nice to see a Levin at the other table even though Levin-Weinstein were barred from this event (along with Fleisher, Kamil, Martel and Stansby)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: without @D lead  --  declarer might need to peek|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: EW leads 3/5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so for once, Levin & Weinstein disagree:)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Walddk4: West has 3 trumps and 2 spades|pg||
nt|suketbombi: y|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Then use entries to play @Cs twice|pg||
nt|Walddk4: How do you get your diamond loser away in time?|pg||
nt|psyck: though 5@c clearly superior|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@s, 2@h, 3 trump losers or so|pg||
nt|friggi: welcome |pg||
nt|kemperg: much used in Holland those 2 openings|pg||
nt|psyck: well, clearly 3@h was gf i guess now|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: south might decide to float that too|pg||
nt|mgb81: well this looks to be 7 tricks on accurate defence i think|pg||
nt|copeyj: is this definitely the auction, operator?|pg||
nt|Walddk1: I fear it is|pg||
nt|mgb81: I just cant imagine what goes through the mind of someone that wants to double 1S for take out when they are 7-4|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: it definitely is :)|pg||
nt|copeyj: thanks Stephen|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: :):)|pg||
nt|athene: well, received wisdom is that you strain to re-open with double as often as possible, but "possible" doesn't cover 0-7-2-4|pg||
nt|mgb81: I'm not sure why youre smiling Stephen - looks painful to me|pg||
nt|santyclz: An oversight, I'm sure.|pg||
nt|ady: 6@H  can be made  by playing a low club towards the jack  and if west takes the king   get the heart right|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|pg||
nt|sybarra: afraid to push them to game maybe |pg||
nt|cuttysark: 3@S already rather high - even if he gets spades right there are problems|pg||
nt|ady: if west does not play the king  the clubs can be ruffed out as they lay and south then loses only a trump trick     but that is an obscure double dummy play   |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: wolfson has lost a screw from his glasses|pg||
nt|glen: not much to this board, except for the lost screw|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: seems like it should make 6 but I guess that needs the @H's played correctly|pg||
nt|hawe45: No double? - but undertricks "en masse" as they say in France|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@D in OR - and very friendly defense: @D to J, @C to 9, @D to K @C to A|pg||
nt|pelu: - so prob making|pg||
nt|lml: the @HJ seems an odd card|pg||
pc|c5|nt|copeyj: he is smiling because he is scottish|pg||
nt|copeyj: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: absolutely|pg||
nt|hawe45: E/W will come closer to 9 tricks than North...|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 1@c 11-14 bal or nat|pg||
nt|ady: e/w  may save|pg||
nt|warrens:  now East faces the problem of having bid 5@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: goren mutters something before facing dummy|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: using symmetrical cards with the odd heart pip split diagonally|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|dima:  In Imps seems to be pretty easy board|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Can make - the clubs are kind and he can establish a long heart|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap asks: upsisdedown signals, richter nods, aker says there are a couple of exceptions|pg||
pc|d6|nt|hawe45: Come on, North - take some tricks|pg||
nt|peachy: Perhaps there was some misunderstanding in NS auction|pg||
nt|psyck: about the same as allowing NS to make 1@s|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|steshome:  Passing the double with the West hand is a bit odd though|pg||
nt|athene: that's one way of putting it, yes|pg||
nt|mgb81: yes it's the bid of someone who is going for the quick kiil|pg||
nt|mgb81: hoping partner is 2524 with a goodish hand say|pg||
nt|warrens:  safety first|pg||
nt|ady: this will only go down 1   unless a trump lead|pg||
nt|warrens:  trump lead looks right, since your side has all three side suits there should be no hurry|pg||
nt|santyclz: What are they?  5 card suit, not 5332, 8-12?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|friggi: 8-10 - ugly|pg||
nt|kemperg: 5major + 4+ minor|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 8-10, 5-card with 2-3 other major, can be balanced or side suit minor|pg||
nt|kemperg: 6-10|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|ady: well done    might still be down 2  without a trump lead    west can ruff 3 hearts  but would hacve to give up a club and as long as south ducks the first club  north can with the ...|pg||
nt|ady: 2nd club with the jack and play a trump|pg||
nt|ady: as it stands   9 trump tricks and K@C|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks Stefan.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: They only variation is that in 3d and 4th they are not so strict about 2-3 other major|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap now leaning over the table, chin in palm|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap closes the screen, whispers some questions to richter|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: apparently about shapes that would open 1C vs 1D|pg||
nt|ralfwil: playing another @h from dummy looks obvious|pg||
nt|lml: Spades are fine too|pg||
nt|lml: not much bad can happen if you lead spades that I can think of|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap inquires NS 1NT range: 15-17|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: trying to deduce what hands aker can/can't have|pg||
nt|lml: 1@C shows either clubs or balanced|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good @D shift    can Meyers guess @H now?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sybarra: but he has to draw trump also |pg||
pc|dT|nt|Vugraphzfd: sounded like "...screwed this one up, good lucj"|pg||
pc|d3|nt|cuttysark: East sensibly preserving his trump|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lml: if balanced any shape in the minors|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mdgraham: always important to get your excuses in first|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mgb81: Declarer is going to bash out a few trumps now and make her 7 top tricks|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: aker did give some thought to a takeout double of 1@S.  not sure if that was evident through the screen|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: first hand pratap thought a while at trick 1 then the rest of the play went quickly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe if @CJ still available  [or @D at trick 2]   tougher for declarer |pg||
pc|h4|nt|Vugraphzfd: this time he called quickly at trick 1 and has been contemplating at every trick|pg||
pc|hT|nt|peachy: 2NT seems like transfer to clubs, meybe they were not on same page asto what bid "likes clubs"|pg||
nt|hawe45: Do´nt forget, that the lead gave one trick away from the defence!|pg||
pc|hA|nt|dima:  If West overtakes to return a trump East is sqeezed in black suits|pg||
nt|ady: it was very tough for east to sit 6@H  when non vul against vul|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|psyck: more pain|pg||
nt|xenya: N will be pleased to score all his trumps|pg||
nt|dinos1: could be 6@c with 5@c down 1 if W had a little different hand|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mgb81: west should have count now and not uck the diamond|pg||
nt|psyck: other table just bid 4|pg||
nt|dinos1: with 3N-1*|pg||
nt|glen: i love the format of this event, no round robin, just 120 board matches, who ever wins this will deserve it|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sQ|pc|d2|pg||
nt|mgb81: often its the vul overtrick that really costs. -790 when teammates make 620 isnt a disaster but -990 is|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: takes and replaces @DA|pg||
nt|psyck: ...4@h on 3@h, strange that the precision pair tried more here|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: if @CJ really gone   too many winning options     and  Meyers gets it right|pg||
mc|10|nt|Vugraphzfd: rubin took a while and deliberately played @CJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: garner hasn't played to trick 2 yet|pg||

nt|mgb81: are you sure it's 8 tricks?|pg||
nt|athene: if you go all the way round the bend, that's 360 degrees isn't it :)|pg||
nt|dburn: sure - East didn't overtake @cQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: yes...I'm sure :)|pg||
nt|dburn: so a heart loser went away|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: Still sure...|pg||
nt|copeyj: I think we should just rely on Stephen to have it right :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: was also the auction...lol|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Don't tell anybody|pg||
nt|santyclz: For those new to BBO:  To see how a board was played at the other table, click "Movie", then "(other) Room", |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Karl claimed the overtrick on squeeze |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: For me, the south hand is a 3@H opening|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, they can generally afford to, with already limited hands|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: quick discussion through the screen, couldn't make out all of it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: goren: "sorry, going to sleep here.  good thing this isn't on vugraph"|pg||
nt|glen: note that the "Green Valley Ranch" where the event is being held, is not another ranch in the vegas area|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: I am not sure what that means in their partnership or if he didn't imagine @CA could be from AQxx|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: when you have a 7-4 as opener on that sort of auction do you just lose the 4-card suit?|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: too late|pg||
nt|santyclz: then highlight the board you wish to review by clicking on it and click the "Next" button to step though the play.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: lots for N/S here|pg||
nt|ady: 2 available slams for n/s|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: so opener just bids 4@H or something over 1@S?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 14-16 NT|pg||
nt|santyclz: A "two-strike" multi -- side ace, side void.|pg||
nt|glen: now for a fun board|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: cohen surreptitiously looks at the W hand from the last board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=10-15 HCP, maybe 4@S and any longer suit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: no discussion after the hand, just on to the next board|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk1: yes Bill|pg||
nt|athene: these actions aren't discussed much - e.g. what is a cue-bid by opener|pg||
nt|mgb81: it looks like declarer mistimed the play in the other room here. She allowed north to pitch her diamond and ruff away the ace|pg||
nt|hawe45: Here the spot is 3 NT - to avoid cross-ruffing defence|pg||
nt|sybarra: E will open |pg||
nt|ralfwil: important to play 4@s on E|pg||
nt|lml: east has a good hand after the double.  But 3NT or spade?|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@s cant make - 3NT in OR - down on @H-lead but S found @s6 - and now peob making|pg||
nt|pelu: 3NT now a practical bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: music wafts in from somewhere|pg||
nt|lml: it is the kind of call you like to think about|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @d lead is needed to defeat 4@s on E|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: gordon arranging his box.  pratap studying his hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: The 800 was flat. Two relieved NS pairs at set end |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: goren had alerted 2@H as 6+ on his side of the screen, asked after the hand, then shook his head realizing he was wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|dima:  He had a complete count here West turned up with 6-3 in reds and rhe position of club ace was known|pg||
nt|psyck: x generally played as asking for @s here|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Interesting situation. The X sometimes asks for @S, sometimes for shorter Major|pg||
nt|psyck: they may run to 5m|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Looking at the E-W cards only, you would have nothing against playing 4@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: decides to protect the H honors|pg||
nt|mdgraham: So EW here did need that 1100 that they could have got  |pg||
nt|dinos1: 2@h - asking stopper or what?|pg||
nt|glen: you have a spell checker on or just can type surreptitiously quickly and correctly?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: the latter|pg||
mb|1N!|an|semiforcing|nt|santyclz: Is the grand biddable?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: One way to find the queen of trump is never to play the suit :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: :)|pg||
nt|psyck: 4 i mean|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: South had a pretty clear escape, no doubt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW system called   Ultimate Canape|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: West took my advice|pg||
nt|psyck: should be a routine -1|pg||
mb|2C!|an|5+|nt|Walddk1: What do you call AQJ9xxxx?  Trumps!|pg||
nt|Walddk1: even ith one card less|pg||
nt|athene: yes 4@H doesn't look too tricky|pg||
nt|copeyj: can just get a @C trick in the bank and cross ruff|pg||
nt|copeyj: i think|pg||
nt|athene: make four tricks in the side suits and some number of trumps on a crossruff|pg||
nt|mgb81: this will be a good text of alice and bryonys temperament if they can get back on te horse and get a solid game under lock and key|pg||
nt|sybarra: drury  |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Drury, I guess|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap: "getting a workout over here"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: gordon: "I like it, get to sit in my rocking chair"|pg||
nt|lml: tough choice  |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap at @SAKQ: "was wondering where those were"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: could hardly bid 3NT himself|pg||
nt|glen: will W risk 5@D pick a major?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: and on the topic of spelling, Silverstein's last name is too long for the software|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Wolfson's eyes flicker between his hand and the tray|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: North seems intent|pg||
nt|santyclz: If that is exclusion s should bid it.|pg||
nt|sybarra: voidwood |pg||
nt|sybarra: or exclusion |pg||
nt|ianmcc: 2@s was an ask. Could 5@c be an answer?|pg||
nt|sybarra: alerted at voidwood |pg||
nt|santyclz: N chose not to answer the "ask", that shows a suit whose loser(s) can be determined by b'wood.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: :) will they get to this 4@S difficult tho but a 10 card fit is such an Asset|pg||
nt|iceak:  Favorable lay|pg||
nt|warrens:  6@C is easier to play and a better contract|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: asks about leads.  3/5|pg||
nt|pelu: strange that Sontag didnt leed @H against 3NT - if pd has a singleton prob no defense|pg||
nt|lml: you have to be in this game and if they find the diamond lead then thats unlucky|pg||
nt|psyck: South may have trouble guarding rounded suits in 5@d|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: director overseeing table again|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: with his glasses askew all the while|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C= 4+@S & 5+@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Quite reasonably|pg||
nt|sybarra: @D position (in south) values fully |pg||
nt|othered1: Also possibility of strip and endplay in @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I think S has to bid it |pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well |pg||
nt|hawe45: Without pre-empt, 4 @H is the normal contract to bid - not to make|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 4th lead, udca|pg||
nt|sybarra: W has nice hand but the flatness of it .....|pg||
nt|psyck: S doesn't know N's hand, & opps x cannot always be trustede|pg||
nt|ady: 6@C might make with the hearts 4-1 so is a little better|pg||
nt|warrens:  some players play a bid to show a double fit over 3@C (such as 4@D), which would make it much easier to find this slam|pg||
nt|warrens:  nevertheless, if N makes a try, I expect S will get excited |pg||
nt|psyck: yes, on non @h lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: could be 4-5 or 4-6, even 5-6|pg||
pc|c3|nt|warrens:  do they play 3@C as natural and GF or just an artificial GF?|pg||
nt|kemperg: down start|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Declarer would really like an entry to his hand, to throw his @C loser|pg||
nt|lml: woops|pg||
nt|lml: maybe north expects really bad hearts from partner|pg||
nt|lml: that defence is "sleepy"|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: people sometimes panic when they hit a 5-0 trump break|pg||
nt|copeyj: they shouldnt find out about ot until it doesnt matter|pg||
nt|copeyj: just cash winners and x ruff|pg||
nt|ianmcc: agree, source of tricks|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes should make this without any problem|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think I expected North to re-open then - in my experience Icelandic players do not pass much|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: gf|pg||
nt|glen: N will be happy to see the @C King pop up|pg||
nt|dinos1: now @hA - N has @d stiff from the bidding|pg||
nt|dinos1: @h* stiff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and minimum   in context of limited opening bid|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sybarra: but they only bid 6 in the other room so a push|pg||
nt|santyclz: Well, it's easy to bid from up here but they didn't find it at either table.|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|sybarra: I was expecting same |pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm why double? Gives the opponents so many extra bids|pg||
nt|othered1: played by east, @H lead gives contract away immediately|pg||
nt|ahollan1: strong hands start with 1@C|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: when ekeblad was defending he removed the tray from the table.  now as declarer leaves it on|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: ekeblad whispering something to rubin about the auction|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: levin has her chair well back from the table, studying her hand, glancing at dummy|pg||
pc|sT|nt|copeyj: 2@D 1@S 1@C and at least 6 trumps|pg||
nt|athene: sure|pg||
nt|athene: but playing one round of trumps would have been ok if declarer had then remembered rule 1 of crossruffing (take side suit tricks early)|pg||
nt|lml: he can "see" one down if he wins it if his partner has hearts|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|nt|psyck: but here if was a fairly clear choice i guess|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|warrens:  this is a very tough way to start a match, with slam auctions on every hand|pg||
nt|psyck: aah right, just assumed W would play with those lovely trumps :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: meyers has her hand folded, looking around the enclosure|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: curtained off in the corner of the ballroom here|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Vugraphzfd: lead consistent with @HAQ but perhaps also @HAJ|pg||
pc|hT|nt|iceak:  not communication to pick up trumps|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 3@H-1 but better than defending 2@S :)|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|ady: difficult to reach 6@C  if not natural way to show a 2nd suit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Whenever you lead from KQ10, there is ALWAYS Jxx in dummy|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ralfwil: be careful with your entries|pg||
nt|lml: yes but what is he playing for|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|cK|pg||
nt|warrens:  in this cash, artificiality hurt them (imho)|pg||
nt|warrens:  in this case...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: I wonder if they rented this space when they expected a round-robin for these dates|pg||
nt|ahollan1: rowenthal in 1N west|pg||

nt|copeyj: E/W got way overboard and Sally Brock told them it wasn't making|pg||
nt|athene: ok a classic misunderstanding here i think|pg||
nt|athene: if you double then bid a new suit that should not be natural and strong|pg||
nt|suketbombi: another 10 card fit|pg||

nt|vugraphzdh: The double asked for shorter/weaker major|pg||

nt|Walddk5: wb Martin|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: ekeblad going on about what 2@D or 2@H would have been over 2@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: because with a strong shapely hand you start by bidding your suits not by neg Xing|pg||
nt|mgb81: ouch|pg||
nt|athene: so nash's 4@C really caused a lot of problems|pg||
nt|athene: probably interpreted as a cue bid supporting diamonds|pg||
nt|copeyj: according to the movie Gross as south doubled 7@D|pg||
nt|copeyj: I doubt it :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to find 3 nt here for e/w ?|pg||
nt|ady: I think better to play 3 of any other suit after transfer  game forcing   but natural|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi folks|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mgb81: well its less likely that Sally passed it as north!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W perhaps slightly annoyed to be in 4th seat...|pg||

nt|hawe45: Here we might have our fun|pg||
nt|suketbombi: would you open that hnad?|pg||
nt|warrens:  3nt makes, but better stay away from 4@S.  most likely E will get the suit in first|pg||
nt|glen: ew cc: http://usbf.org/docs/2011usbc/acblcards/CohenWolfson.bmp|pg||
nt|dinos1: hi|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15   0+@D    could be 4@D & 5+@C/@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: rubin thought things were different because he was a passed hand and bidding would have been invitational|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: I did not get all the details|pg||
mb|2H|nt|hawe45: Solid 1 @S - I love it...!|pg||
nt|sybarra: best if W plays it but bidding wont permit that |pg||
nt|psyck: lol true, 1NT - 3N can come with wide ranging hands|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT a spot for n/s|pg||
nt|warrens:  S passing, hoping to defend a doubled contract|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: optimistic takeout double facing a passed hand|pg||
mb|d|nt|mgb81: "I didn't want to push the opponents into 7NT partner"|pg||
nt|dima:  South rates his hand as too good for 2@h overcall|pg||
nt|cuttysark: They sort of have the values, but its a bit of a misfit|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 'Its Bridge Jim, but not as we know it.'|pg||
mb|2S|an|2+|nt|mgb81: Alice Kaye will do well to take the low road and bid 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: well everyone will remember a 7@D not too long ago where the defender with the @DA had to double to gain on the board|pg||
nt|athene: and it wasn't at a humble level either|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Or the 7@D this EW pair bid against Scotland earlier today|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Made on a finesse|pg||
nt|copeyj: Well it was a quasi marked finesse Roland|pg||
nt|copeyj: the hand under AQ@S had overcalled a vulnerable @S|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Yes, they surely knew that :)|pg||
nt|dburn: very good auction, that was|pg||
nt|mgb81: one of the juniors watching has just quoted the old rhyming adage "Misfit -time to quit"|pg||
nt|copeyj: Let's not talk about slams anyway after the one in the first stanza of the day today|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Simon forgets to tell that the hand with @HQxxx bid the grand slam although her partner never cuebid hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk1: But she found a void opposite|pg||
nt|dburn: her partner had guaranteed first-round control in hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk1: When did she do that?|pg||
nt|Walddk1: She never bid hearts|pg||
nt|mgb81: is Alice really still in the tank?|pg||
nt|athene: 6@D looks pushy here and east hasn't got any easy way to just invite it based on the diamond suit quality, has she?|pg||
nt|Walddk1: She jumped from 3NT to 6@C|pg||
nt|dburn: when she bid six clubs as a grand slam try opposite a partner who had cue-bid 4@s when she could have cue-bid 4@h|pg||
nt|steshome:  Bill tries unsuccessfully to get us back on track|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Well, not much action right now, Sarah :)|pg||
nt|athene: there is a lot of action|pg||
nt|athene: but it's all in east's mind at the moment|pg||
nt|athene: she sees a big, fat 920 at the end of the rainbow|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Palli is agressive - was thinking of bidding 4@s|pg||
nt|psyck: reasonable with passed pd & fav vul|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=invitational  good 6+@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'd ruled out that choice :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: Par is 5 @S doubled 9 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: may get to 4 hearts here |pg||
nt|dima:  West opening is very aggressive, but he's protected by big club structure|pg||
nt|psyck: may have thought, but unlikely to act on it vul :)|pg||
nt|ady: not so easy for south|pg||
nt|mdgraham: optimistic is one of those BBO words that can mean a large number of things|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdh: West will want to play the hand because of his KJ of @D|pg||
nt|santyclz: His 7 @ss might be an influence too.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Good thing for him that East has a powerful singleton in @S|pg||
nt|santyclz: He really can't afford to make a non-forcing, non-game bid with a 3 loser hand.|pg||
nt|kemperg: looks if 2@S was forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Yes, seems like it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: transfers to a lead-directing double|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: nothing breaks, best to stay low  |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Gazzili in one of its many forms. Presuably East needs 9HCp to give a positive with 2@D|pg||
nt|pelu: but defense is - as i have seen so often - the most difficult disciplin in bridge|pg||
nt|glen: hi Martin|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S could be singleton  without DBL   not sure about after DBL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahhhh  thanks   it is 2+ now :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: meyers asks about difference between 2@S and passing.  rubin answers: "I'm guessing, ask Russ".|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: ekeblad gives the same answer he gave levin that passing would suggest a stiff spade|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2S shows the 2 of spades|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: sorry 1370 even|pg||
nt|mgb81: as predicted she wheels out the woolley cue bid|pg||
nt|steshome:  East's first Lady Milne, I do believe, and the first of many, I'm sure|pg||
nt|copeyj: true speak Sarah|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Absolutely, she is only 24|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: optimistic to think it is your hand when pard passed playing light limited openers and you have no 4+ major|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzdh: E-W open every 11 count and most 10 counts :)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Much more dangerous to re-open in the no fit auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: N did not think - my fault|pg||
nt|ady: the bidding has not suggested  solid 7 card suit with north     maybe 3@D better 2nd turn|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I prefer 3@h from W, for me showing a rather good 5-5|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: gordon reached for pass card and withdrew|pg||
nt|glen: no acbl format cc for ns|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sybarra: likely to be duplicate auction in other room |pg||
nt|santyclz: You wouldn't really want to be there seeing both hands single dummy, even vul at imps.|pg||
nt|dima:  Not much of a problem in the play again.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: ok:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: The leas of the Queen show either King or Jack|pg||
nt|ady: still a hard call for south  to bid 3NT|pg||
nt|warrens:  now S has to worry about not having a double club stopper as well as having enough running tricks|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|hawe45: Surprising, that South with 10  HCP and an opening bid from partner, just sells out to 4 @S undoubled|pg||
nt|warrens:  West comes alive.|pg||
nt|ady: hand 1     6@S was bid and made OR    A@H led|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: and if it is not your hand, X only helps opponents to declare|pg||
nt|othered1: Didn't Edgar Kaplan used to distinguish between effectively aggresive and foolhardy by results?|pg||
nt|psyck: double dummy, 4@s can make i think|pg||
nt|psyck: (say by playing @ct 1st chance or something)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: really I am not qualified to judge these players or I would be in one of their chairs and not mine|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mgb81: yes East was a reserve last year just misisng out on her first lady milne but this year she and Bryony qualified comfortably in the trials|pg||
nt|mgb81: good work|pg||
nt|athene: now east still might not want to bid 4@D because that might sound as though she looked for 3nt, didn't find a stop, and gave up|pg||
nt|diumraid: For Live IN RUNNING LADY MILNE SCORES - http://bridge.silvertexter.eu  then browse results then 1o3.txt|pg||
nt|athene: and partner might sometimes pass it or something horrible|pg||
nt|hawe45: He must have seen many bad openings from partner|pg||
nt|hawe45: One more  @H from North  = 620|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: I prefer a direct 4@S bid on the East hand. Don't want the ops to find out about both strength and fit|pg||
nt|kemperg: np here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: gordon: sorry if we're too high.  pratap: we'll soon find out|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, one of the differences is that we can see 52 cards and they can't |pg||
nt|psyck: running this to T, double finessing @c, & ruffing a @d is a possible line now|pg||
pc|c7|nt|santyclz: Needs @ds and @hs both 3-3.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Quite common in Iceland only to lead King vs. NT with a stronger combination, asking for count or unblocking|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Perhaps in this case the queen asked for unblocking|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap: "not much for you, good luck"|pg||
nt|lml: quite enough on the cards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: after commenting on richter's constancy he now seems slightly rattled|pg||
nt|psyck: for an o/t|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk1: Scotland currently +23 against Wales|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: forearms twitching|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: had a eureka moment when the @H position on  3 was revealed|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this seems like a very light jump shift, based on the 3 card heart fit|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|warrens:  oh, I hate that 4@D bid.  if North wanted to bid again, why not 3@S, giving partner a chance to bid 3NT?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: EW in the other room will be hoping that their counterparts bid 6@D, of course|pg||
nt|sybarra: well they never are for me|pg||
nt|ady: if North is going to bid diamonds so many times    better to have jumped to 3@D 2nd roiund   or maybe open 3NT|pg||
nt|warrens:  he's the only one who knows his @D's are solid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: gordon asks about leads and carding.  aker: trumps could be anything|pg||
pc|c4|nt|dinos1: good layout for dcl|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 5@D is simpler, whether better i can't say, since 4@H is very complicated|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: 2 down in a grand isn't always so bad|pg||
nt|copeyj: Scotland are currently 33 up|pg||
nt|athene: it's rarely a cause for celebration, of course|pg||
nt|copeyj: not 23|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Someone surely knows how many IMPs Scotland need if England get 23, 24, 25 VPs|pg||
nt|diumraid: For Live IN RUNNING LADY MILNE SCORES - http://bridge.silvertexter.eu  then browse results then 1o3.txt|pg||
nt|dburn: 23 IMPs is 19-11 - Scotland need to win 18-12 to be sure of the Lady Milne|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ady: this can go down if they find spade ruff|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hawe45: Agree|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|peachy: Anything might have worked at this table where N and S were rather timid|pg||
nt|hawe45: Squeeze...|pg||
nt|suketbombi: they will cash there 2 tricks in good time once in witha @C|pg||
pc|sK|nt|steshome:  East did well on this hand, I think|pg||
nt|hawe45: They should have "killed" dummy´s @C 4|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|d4|nt|cuttysark: South decided to cut out the heart ruffs - but has helped decalrer avoid a second trump lose|pg||
nt|psyck: W knew the @h position, but hoped to 2 entries with nothing better to do|pg||
nt|dinos1: in 4@h dcl shd play @c's to disc @s on 4th @c|pg||
nt|fabsayc: when as here they are in 44 fit, i like partners signal to focus on continueing suit rather than suit preference|pg||
nt|fabsayc: sorry i meant 43 fit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 4-4?|pg||
nt|dinos1: or they use middle as encouraging|pg||
nt|glen: Q about live scores, what we have is: http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2011/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof16|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: rosenthal can see that tapping dummy creates a second trump trick for himself.  but good idea in general|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mdgraham: so, naturally, all out lines of play and defence are 100% double-dummy perfect, just like at the table, of course |pg||

pc|d9|pg||
nt|pelu: EW in OR in 3NT?? - 1@S - 1Nt - 3@H - 3NT|pg||
nt|lml: this is all going so well for declarer he has fallen asleep on this card|pg||
nt|pelu: 1NT only semi-forcing on 12 HCP?|pg||
nt|lml: he has 10 tricks now but that seems to make people play more slowly|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: detaches something, puts it back|pg||
nt|psyck: this will fectch him his contract with trumps splitting|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap called "Queen?" as if expecting it to lose|pg||
nt|psyck: he will still be expecting trumps to not split on the bidding|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there's a pragmatist - expects his finesses to lose|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: goren shuffling his played cards|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|nt|santyclz: (Or jx of @hs.)|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: rubin staring at the chandelier or something|pg||
nt|marlowepi: one of those mirrored ones?:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wondering if only 1 @S loser missing AK??|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: no, they're not|pg||
mb|4H|nt|santyclz: With a source of tricks and controls in all 3 suits not bidding slam would be huge position.|pg||
nt|kemperg: does not know E has a lot more than a minimum|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: East has to worthless kings, he has 4 important cards = 14 working HCP|pg||
nt|lml: it is either slam invitation or force asking partner to bid suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: different drury sequence here |pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks quantitative for me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@H asks for Q  [i think]      |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: I have played in a ballroom with mirrored ceilings - at Sacramento regional I think - where no one seemed to realize|pg||
mb|5C!|nt|vugraphzdh: 2@S by East simply means he does not accept game invitation|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@s showing a minimum here i guess|pg||
nt|psyck: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Does not promise 6 of them. West has shown approx. (9)10-11 I think|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, the transfer method isn't so popular - most here would just bid 3@h|pg||
nt|psyck: a reasonable game on the auction, too bad @cK off|pg||
nt|othered1: That's different|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: rosenthal confirms explanation with cohen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: btw   01122  means   0 KC, 1KC no Q, 1KC+Q, 2KC no Q, 2KC + Q|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: 3-card limit raise - looks as if West had a no-cost double, but that might have been takeout of hearts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, of course|pg||
nt|dinos1: 2@h @c and 2 trumps to lose|pg||
mb|6S|nt|Walddk1: 4@S was perhaps a bit much with that moth-eaten suit, but it did put pressure on West|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridge.is/meistarastig/20102011/magiccontest.htm|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I know the relays here|pg||
nt|dima:  So East is going to relay 4 times to finish in 3NT or 4@s?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Every bid by East is asking relay, West is describing his shape|pg||
nt|sybarra: not an easy hand btw |pg||
nt|ady: this may be uncomfortable|pg||
nt|warrens:  I know S has a good hand, but I would not overcall that suit vul at the 2-level|pg||
nt|lml: the invitational one ... good for them|pg||
nt|lml: to bid suits if accepting usually|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: for lack of a better lead |pg||
nt|ralfwil: a fast claim:)|pg||
nt|othered1: I must run.  thanks all and by for now.|pg||
nt|psyck: thx Ed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: what I meant was that 3@h in this lind of auction is not necessarily an independent suit |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Bye Ed|pg||
nt|psyck: Right Mike|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and here, @HJ was the best lead. Defence can take four hearts and sit back and wait|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Donn studying dummy, glancing at his hand, back to dummy|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: squints, scratches his cheek|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap removes his jacket|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: Not to be underestimated|pg||
nt|lml: do you guys think an invitation is a bit pushy?  Flat hand and all|pg||
nt|fabsayc: double dummy he can make|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i did too, but they were like carnival mirrors so i kept overbidding my hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: because bridge players seek divine guidance by looking DOWN|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: rubin's explanation of 4@D was not 0 keycards|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hawe45: I vote for 460|pg||
nt|peachy: EW play Precision so NT could be 14-16 I think|pg||
nt|kemperg: @DK good value|pg||
nt|santyclz: W can't count 12 tricks but this has to have some play.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Of course, if East held xx in @D this was a noplay|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Moderate at best|pg||
nt|mdgraham: play another heart, North - South might have five|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hawe45: To me, the West hand is too strong for being a 14-14 - and yes, I am able to count and calculate|pg||
nt|hawe45: 14-16|pg||
nt|cuttysark: can't afford to draw trump, again|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but holding @CK, North can see that it doesn't matter very much|pg||
pc|d8|nt|hawe45: My 460 were based on a @S-lead|pg||
nt|suketbombi: rational of these tranfer positives with wrong sided Nt often has a huge Disadvantage I feel|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: West has shown 6-4 Majors and 8+ HCP, East has just shown 16+|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|dima:  Well you can't have it all - most of the time and especially on slam hands 1@c opener is going to finish at the helm|pg||
pc|s3|nt|psyck: 4@h contract on deal 17 prduced a swing when declarer other table short trumped himself after non @c lead|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Vugraphzfd: elects to go down hard|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|dima:  And most of the time you'll make the game on power|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and now this can go six off :) |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: perhaps thinking @H were 1-5|pg||
nt|psyck: esp vul, should have cashed @d 1st|pg||
nt|dinos1: how? not enuff entries for trump endplay|pg||
nt|fabsayc: with a trump endplay|pg||
nt|fabsayc: true he may need help from defense|pg||

nt|ahollan1: well who you going to believe?|pg||
mc|11|nt|ady: A@H   not good in this case|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if you are going to end in 6S on this lot, infinitely better to blast it than to bid KC and still get there|pg||

nt|sybarra: didnt and can not blame him |pg||
nt|iceak:  interesting deal|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Jón Baldursson said when he claimed: "I do not have the courage to finesse @H, but I know it works" :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: :)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: But he did not need the club ruff after all :)|pg||
nt|psyck: decent 6@h, not easy to get to|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: E-W did well (or were lucky) to stay out of a 50% game there|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Still, if partner has 22 you might have a play|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: aker asked:" which way do we do it" and richter answered: "4S is the weaker one"|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 20-22, perhaps a little bit wide?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: that may have been specifically a mild invite|pg||

nt|Walddk1: Our operators never make mistakes. Commentators make plenty|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: OK...now I'm cross...lol|pg||

nt|hawe45: Result board 5, pls?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridge.is/meistarastig/20102011/magiccontest.htm|pg||
nt|warrens:  big...|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdh: 1@c standard opening|pg||
nt|kemperg: what was 2@D,  @H's?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: No 2@D was natural|pg||
mb|2N|nt|cuttysark: SOme scoers in now from boards 1&2: EW played 3NT on 1, but Baldursson brought home 4@S on 2, so all square|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: I think N-S want to stay out of slam here|pg||
nt|glen: now this is a problem for S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: responsive double by south now|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: tartan usualy 5/5,  maybe  a diam. in with his clubs? |pg||
nt|kemperg: Ah was alerted|pg||
nt|fabsayc: next round is the big bidding problem|pg||
nt|glen: unless N finds 3NT here|pg||
mb|3C|nt|sybarra: the "precision" 2 @C |pg||
nt|ady: if east was playing west for a singleton diamond  there was no hurry for the heart   diamond ruff first    |pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  on board 2, West doubled by 6@C and 6@H, which helped declarer find the right line|pg||
nt|lml: 1@H was a transfer response showing spades|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: gordon puts on his glasses to read aker's explanation|pg||
nt|lml: 2@C showed he had real clubs|pg||
nt|lml: and supposedly a real opening bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: with the pad exposed I can see it says "weaker quant raise" re:4@S last time|pg||
mb|3H|nt|hawe45: Difficult bid for North now|pg||
nt|peachy: Bow North has a lot of info to convey, perhaps the only choice at this point is heart cuebid|pg||
nt|peachy: *Now|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: The Law is not protecting E-W very well here, 9 card fit but even 2@H might be expensive|pg||
nt|hawe45: Yes|pg||
nt|psyck: not likely to get there with a key card & trump Q missing|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: North has only promised invitational values, I think, 10+|pg||
nt|psyck: but still possible due to 9 card fit|pg||
nt|dinos1: 4@c by N - and now problem :) Raise or not to raise|pg||
nt|fabsayc: undo, pass missed|pg||
nt|dinos1: no - 4@c by N)|pg||
nt|glen: undo, N bid 4@C not W|pg||
mb|p|nt|suketbombi: in the context of their earlier opening this East hand is a super max:)|pg||
nt|iceak:  4@s has no chance|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Hard to picture E-W making a game here|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: No wonder when they have only 20 HCP and a misfit|pg||
nt|sybarra: bold 2 @D|pg||
nt|cuttysark: He is a passed hand - an Icelandic passed hand, even|pg||
nt|xenya: but 9 trumps -- an eternal problem|pg||
nt|kemperg: but then he knew the @H length with partner|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphzdh: Sævar is thinking. Shall I check if he has hair on the cheast? :)|pg||
nt|peachy: :)|pg||
nt|hawe45: Easily 200 in 2 @H D|pg||
nt|hawe45: Maybe more|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 3NT seems to be reasonable|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: 1NT 18-19 Bal|pg||
nt|mgb81: This is why you should play 1C 1H X as take out without 4 spades - you have to make stupid passes like the one hre|pg||
nt|dima:  4@c - 4@h - 4@s - pass?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: It would be nice if that were penalties, and when West has denied a major maybe it should be|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mgb81: However she came to the party on the next round which is good|pg||
nt|copeyj: in fact you should play X as 4+@S and 1@S as takeout with 4@S in truth Michael :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 3NT looks OK despite poor guard in @c|pg||
nt|hawe45: I vote for 500|pg||
nt|peachy: S takes the plus, not unreasonable these colors|pg||
nt|iceak:  Both think their had is good - but no fit|pg||
nt|psyck: were short of values too anyway to try seriously|pg||
nt|ady: very flat opening east    |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: sorry, distracted trying to find URL for the 2/8 scores.  yes, they're up at usbf.org|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: cards friendly for declarer |pg||
nt|ianmcc: which red suit would you go for?|pg||
nt|hawe45: When you double hard - defend well|pg||
nt|iceak:  hand|pg||
nt|dima:  BTW was 2@s forcing?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 2@S is forcing, yes|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes must have been|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Probably 3@H was forcing, but not promising another bid|pg||
nt|iceak:  better chance in @c|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: He might take a safety finesse in trumps to get only 11|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: a strange 1N, maybe experimenting in 4th seat|pg||
mb|p|nt|steshome:  The play isn't going to be very interesting here|pg||
nt|hawe45: This is about the first penalty double, I´ve seen for months|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: donn raises screen not quite high enough to stick and it crashes back down|pg||
nt|mdgraham: :)|pg||
nt|psyck: The tables are certainly coming alive, they attacked a player previous session too|pg||
nt|ahollan1: spec points out   on last hand  6@C makes unless defense leads  @S @S   wouldn't that have been a fortitous bidding error|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E has no cause for complaint about the NS destination|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: rubin asked who was on lead, meyers answered and interrupted ekeblad's think|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|chessmaste: 4@S played the best way round|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 2@C = "natural, usually < 3 spades"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap: "it's your lead partner"|pg||
nt|glen: i posted it b4: http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2011/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof16|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: someone else can paste the URL|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: thanks|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mgb81: bah that's too modern for me|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Has partner one diamond, or two?|pg||
nt|frankaus: 2@D did the trick here|pg||
nt|cuttysark: provided he ducks|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome to Frank Budai, Australia |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: EW: 3/5 leads, standard carding|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap: what's the lightest he'd open? what's your style?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: richter: 11? 6-card club suit, 11|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: richter holds his finger up and writes something on the pad|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: aker shifts in his chair, sitting sideways, legs crossed|pg||
nt|pelu: have to plan the play - we can see that almost all cards well placed for Aker - but he dont know|pg||
nt|lml: this isnt that simple|pg||
nt|chessmaste: True, but hard to find a losing line|pg||
nt|ralfwil: win on dummy and play @c10|pg||
nt|lml: he has few entries to the south hand and he doesnt know who has the CA|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|pg||
nt|Walddk1: They have a system they are comfortable with and that's what matters|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Sedcude by @D7|pg||
nt|ady: will have to play well    ruff 1 spade low   and 1 with A@H    and combined wirh club finesse|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3nt was a whole lot easier, whether north should have bid 3nt is debatable however|pg||
pc|sA|nt|peachy: Low level doubled partscore is a rare bird at IMP scoring|pg||
nt|hawe45: East has no way to his hand for playing @H|pg||
pc|s5|nt|dima:  North goes for forcing game with his 4 trumps|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Or even seduced|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: odd|pg||
nt|psyck: risky duck with @d open|pg||
pc|s3|nt|warrens:  he can make this if he ruffs in his hand, harder this way|pg||
nt|lml: I like the line Ralf suggested and declarer took|pg||
nt|mdgraham: defence needs to be careful here |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Yes, as much as I fancy to lead my singleton no matter what, this was the moment to hide the singleton @C with the trumps :)|pg||
nt|psyck: only 3@s, 2@h, 2@c for dec due to lack of communication|pg||
nt|psyck: get away with murder|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: hard for goren to pick what has happened|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @dQ needed now|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mgb81: Indeed it is playing a natural system where you can raise clubs, but it feels like having to pass th west cards after 1C (1H) isn't a good idea.|pg||
nt|hawe45: This @D Jack is candidate to worse defence in april 2011|pg||
nt|hawe45: Now North can not play @S|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|dima:  nice play the @h 8|pg||
nt|psyck: wow, 3N= on deal 5 other table|pg||
pc|s6|nt|hawe45: We might be close to 670 instead of safe 500|pg||
nt|frankaus: @D K  was not well thought out|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but declarer has played well, concealing the @s2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: they lead 4th vs NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: presumably donn would show it at trick 2 if he held it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: if 1NT is 15-17 then donn can hardly hold @DATxx on top of @SJ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: very true|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what about D lead?|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|frankaus: @DJ|pg||
pc|h7|nt|hawe45: But the 200 will be the result|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Declarer still has to work on @Cs|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: If South stays away from them|pg||
nt|pelu: 2x! and @D-ruff|pg||
nt|pelu: 2x@s|pg||
nt|chessmaste: On some hands of this type it might be right to play four rounds of diamonds pitching hearts - this was not one of them because of the lack of a side entry to hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe wrong but i see only 11 in 6C on D lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: ruff @H early, claim 13?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 11 tricks|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|peachy: he has to open up the clubs now, to get another entry, well done|pg||
nt|dima:  loses to H9x offside otherwise gains|pg||
nt|dima:  Well unless South is brilliant to duck @h AK|pg||
nt|iceak:  expects to go down - minimizing damages|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: I don't think Jón Baldursson ever expects to go down :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ianmcc: I think he's in trouble|pg||
nt|santyclz: @ds need qx, 10x or 3-3, plus it's easier to pitch three times from dummy, so I'd of course do the opposite of what the world class players do.|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|suketbombi: has to hope the !L is with North and restrict trump losser to 1 no other chance |pg||
nt|ahollan1: good shift to @H  [but is Q better??]    is it enough?      would declarer have done better to duck @S at trick 2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: ok, I will stick to the present hand|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ralfwil: looks safe peter. If W can overruff he have to give S an entry|pg||
nt|pelu: and @D 5 6 = odd Number - so no Overruff|pg||
pc|sK|nt|suketbombi: @HK|pg||
nt|sybarra: surprised he didnt pitch the @D |pg||
nt|mdgraham: so this might make up for the previous board, which cost 12 imps |pg||
nt|fabsayc: this seems the % play and duly found|pg||
nt|dinos1: S has perfect cards for 3N - exactly for 9 quick tricks|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sybarra: have to sort of untangle this hand |pg||
nt|frankaus: if pd has lead stiff then its irrelavant - id pd has XX then dec must have AK@D tight|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|cuttysark: If partner has a stiff diamond you give declarer a cheap trick which might be his ninth - much eaiser for us watching|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like defence will untangle it for  declarer |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|pc|h3|nt|ady: plays itself now |pg||
nt|ady: north will show out 2nd round of trumps|pg||
nt|santyclz: Decided not to stake it all on @sqxx onside.|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: rosenthal-silverstein stopped in 5@S on 50|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ianmcc: he'll have to play @c off|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|hawe45: If they get 500, I´m sure they had 800|pg||
nt|iceak:  seems 2 off|pg||
nt|suketbombi: he wanted to come back to his hand witha @D ruff if the dream layout was there|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I think the defence told him the truth and a @c it should be|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Valid point from a kibitzer - perhaps West more likely to pass 2@DX with AKx|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Clubs not blocked when they break 2-2, so all is well|pg||
nt|ady: now club finesse   and exit|pg||

nt|Walddk1: 2nd best|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Scotland +35|pg||
nt|copeyj: Well Scotland are winning handsomely at the moment - and whilst that is the case they will win the Lady Milne|pg||
nt|santyclz: The got the "interesting" @Hk lead at the other table.|pg||
nt|hawe45: Here a somewhat sporty 6 @C|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: It was -2|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: I fixed the score|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 3 they played 3 @H making in the other room |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Baldursson strikes again  - it looked one down to me :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: he opened the hand with 1 @D and was easy from there after pard's neg X |pg||
nt|kemperg: no this was better|pg||
nt|santyclz: This was q(any) onside.|pg||
nt|santyclz: A with @ds sitting differently might have been an endplay.|pg||
nt|pelu: :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap mutters: "you guys did well"|pg||
nt|Walddk5: The 2011 USBC will select USA2 for the 2011 Bermuda Bowl to be held Oct. 15-29 in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. USA1, chosen at the 2010 USBC, will be the Fleisher team ...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: (Fleisher-Kamil, Levin-Weinstein, Martel-Stansby). |pg||
nt|mdgraham: which will be the 9th trick|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: silverstein, smiling after facing his claim: "I should have bid three no"|pg||
mb|p|nt|steshome:  Boo|pg||
nt|santyclz: (They)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Such opening bids are not recommended, really |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: donn/pratap sharing a quiet laugh|pg||
mb|1H|nt|hawe45: Even 7|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Stefan |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: ballroom on the casino level of the green valley ranch resort|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk1: What? They are your neighbours|pg||
nt|Walddk1: We love the Swedes|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Mult-way strong 2@C, dbl probably showing the majors....|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: Is North playing a weak or strong no trump?|pg||
nt|hawe45: But 7 ir by far more sporty|pg||
nt|psyck: declared appeared to have guess @d & squeeze North to make 9 in that 3N|pg||
nt|chessmaste: A good team |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: aker reaches for something and withdraws|pg||
mb|2C|nt|hawe45: is|pg||
nt|iceak:  1D doubled?|pg||
nt|ady: this can be held to 3 tricks|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: beeps go off somewhere in the room.  halftime?  can't see a clock here behind the curtains|pg||
nt|lml: that shouldnt really turn north on|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: director on PA confirms "should be halfway through"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: facing passed hand, double somewhat less dangeorus|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from webcam of cavendish   i  just know  very ugly pinkish carpet|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if partner unpassed    would you do something other than DBL??|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: *And|pg||
nt|mdgraham: these matches are 120 boards, so the deficit, although substantial, is not insurmountable   |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Donn with this big Joker grin|pg||
nt|fabsayc: really?|pg||
nt|glen: That T3 is some stopper|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: really.  if some Leb...OK, Cohen: "we play lebensohl" and  shrugs|pg||
mb|2H|nt|copeyj: 15-17 I believe|pg||
nt|copeyj: I am with you Michael|pg||
nt|henryb:  It is bad for the home internationals for the same team to win on all occasions|pg||
nt|dburn: useful result for ENgland, this - East-West can make 3NT, and North-South can make 1NT|pg||
nt|copeyj: would definitely open 1|pg||
nt|mgb81: The north hand feels worht an upgrade given the good suit and quality of the controls|pg||
nt|dburn: or at any rate, did make 1NT|pg||
nt|dinos1: why not? S didnt raise, N hardly has @hAKQ :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Silverstein, seeing dummy: "that was the bid you were looking for - or pass!"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: rubensohl hand, where he can bid 3@C showing diamonds, then 3@H asking stopper|pg||
nt|marlowepi: kokish would|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: typically busy casino carpet|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: can't figure out why 3@d instead of @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: seems misunderstanding|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 3NT looks a practical shot from South|pg||
nt|psyck: need to set up @d's soon|pg||
nt|psyck: before 1 goes on @c|pg||
mb|3C|nt|athene: i think it is ok to open either 12-14 OR 15-17 NT with that north hand|pg||
nt|athene: it's right on the borderline and the extra tactical advantage for 1nt opener means you bend it as necessary|pg||
nt|santyclz: To view more than one table at a time: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/  Open 1 browser window per table.|pg||

nt|ady: east has done well not to compete  |pg||
nt|pelu: so ½  boAard late :) - 15 borads in sektion|pg||
nt|glen: will N avoid @H lead "knowing" W has @H king|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: has to be South playing it for sure |pg||
nt|cuttysark: North contemplating slam, East wondering how cheap a save might be|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: N showing facial expressions - looking to the air|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Lack of aces should put him off|pg||
nt|warrens:  3 discards should allow E to let his partner know he has nothing but @S's|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Rubin just loving this auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Koach is online now   [probably not thinking about impending induction into ACBL Hall of Fame]|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: swirls and flowers.  mostly tan/gold though, not pink|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 15+ foot high ceiings with wroughtiron? chandeliers|pg||
mb|5C|nt|dima:  Trumps structure is not good enough to convert|pg||
nt|sybarra: one would thing |pg||
nt|kemperg: 3@C a bit "strong"|pg||
nt|psyck: actually, a @h will go on @c instead|pg||
mb|p|nt|dima:  9 tricks next case|pg||
nt|sybarra: this may make declarer play the clubs right |pg||
nt|psyck: *as 1@c need...|pg||
nt|sybarra: *think|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: South can probably not be sure pd has 5@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Allthough he denied 4@H himself, his partner might be weak in @D|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: "brady, what'd you tell him?" richter: "clubs" aker:"it's hearts and clubs"|pg||
nt|pelu: some would open 2@S in West|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: England have got another brucey bonus board coming on 24, but all the imps in the world wont matter unless scotland lose some|pg||
nt|athene: there is at least 1/2 hcp's worth of advantage in opening 1nt, after all - surely more?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: learn to love your aces - hands with none are never great hands :)|pg||
nt|psyck: nice shify|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdh: Well, for South, this is an obvious "maximum" for a 9-15 opening |pg||
nt|psyck: *shift|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ianmcc: not much of interest here|pg||
nt|kemperg: spec tells opening 9-11 and 2@D good rais|pg||
nt|psyck: @d knocks out dummy entry now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: halfway beeps ringing|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: again EW have not found the best spot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@S off AK of trump had better chance than this|pg||
nt|sybarra: this may not be best spot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and it had NO chance|pg||
nt|marlowepi: look in newest edition of Encyclopedia under "inelegant contract". the illustrative picture  will be this hand diagram|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: meyers: mm-hmm-hmm|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzdh: A @D lead seems natural|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Exiting contract, not clear how declarer will play|pg||
nt|ady: 10@H should tell the storry|pg||
pc|hT|nt|vugraphzdh: Unfortunate lead, now declarer has 2 entries to set up and enjoy @Cs|pg||
nt|kemperg: e|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|chessmaste: Or 2@D|pg||
nt|psyck: E can now be endplayed with a @d though|pg||
nt|psyck: so dec may still avoid @h loser if he reads well|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugraphzdh: East had a chance to duck|pg||
nt|kemperg: 9-15 |pg||
nt|lml: like it better not vul or not in second chair|pg||
nt|ralfwil: as NS have 5-4 in trumps, I prefer a trumph lead from E |pg||
pc|c2|nt|mgb81: 2d is a pretty ineligant contract for ew but it should make comfortably|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: cohen laughs after @D position revealed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there is something or other to be said for ,emtioning AK9xxx at some point.  E actually fairly lucky that nothing makes|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|santyclz: Time for a caffeine run. |pg||
nt|psyck: that was premature however & he should go down now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: might get a heart away on @CQ|pg||
pc|h2|nt|psyck: this will be a costly misunderstanding with a vul game|pg||
nt|ady: 2@S  udca    but throwing a trick|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but this will perhaps work....:)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|henryb:  North will lose her @cA if she does not take it|pg||
nt|peachy: A lot of 2/1 players use 3C here as invitational with long clubs, passable or bid 3NT |pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|peachy: But to be clear, I am not familiar with their method of course|pg||
nt|iceak:  10 tricks most surely|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: And North liked his ace of @C after partners trial bid, but forgot to dislike his bad shape and probably @S king or @D queen not working|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Weinstein North rebid 2@H    Silverstein introduced 3@D  so should be able to avoid 5@C    [sarcasm]|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hawe45: In fact, 6 @C is no bad contract. Without a @H-lead, it might succeed even with a bad @C-break|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap shaking his head|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: ekeblad writing something on the pad|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vugraphzdh: 10 top trick now for declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: And 11 by squeezing East|pg||
nt|lml: especially because there didnt figure to be a diamond ruff with south having nine cards in  two other suits|pg||
nt|psyck: oh well, def started so well, but these low level contracts are tough to play & defend|pg||
pc|c4|nt|cuttysark: I would enjoy a claim - instead I shall enjoy a coffee|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: uncertain tone of voice calling @HT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: very difficult to defend these hands|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ianmcc: S squeezed|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphzdh: No, has no entry|pg||
nt|ady: now down 3|pg||
pc|s8|nt|hawe45: Undo|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|dima:  I think he'll make 6+3 and North will pitch diamonds|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ianmcc: squeezable|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|henryb:  makes no difference though|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d2|pg||
nt|sybarra: no entry to his hand |pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|nt|iceak:  almost 4 sevens :)|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c9|pg||
nt|sybarra: but N will have to lead something |pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|nt|fabsayc: now with 9 in heart|pg||
pc|c5|nt|copeyj: this hand being played at record pace :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: essentially E forced to game, and what puts his hand in that range (or close, anyway) is the diamond suit. so mentioning it not out of place  --  esp facing a PH, because then game ...|pg||

nt|copeyj: they are having a horrible time of it|pg||
nt|mgb81: So in the other room Ruth Connelly, who is somewhat of an agressive bidder, bid 1C, then 2C and gave herself 5C when 4S came back to her|pg||
nt|mgb81: Sally Brock though long and hard whether to bid 5S, but after some though she doubled for penalties.|pg||
nt|athene: if west really wanted to bid over 4@H then at least bid 4NT so partner can choose diamonds when it's right|pg||
nt|hawe45: There is a faster method to get 660 - just claim after the lead|pg||
nt|iceak:  4@h shaky|pg||

mb|p|nt|iceak:  much depends on @d|pg||
nt|sybarra: N probably just bids 4 @H  |pg||

nt|Walddk5: We will be broadcasting from 2 matches today and tomorrow in the Round of 16, all 4 matches in the quarter-finals Thursday and Friday|pg||
mb|p|nt|dima:  3@h or 1@h?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@s om EW! can they find it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pass hurts my soul|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ady: multi from west|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry 66@c|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: these players not at all hasty during the play but wasting no time between boards|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: maybe she felt it might help in the play to have concealed the side suit|pg||
nt|mgb81: It doesnt even look like 4S is that easy - if south plays ace, king and ruff s diamond low east can overuff the 7 with the 8 and bang another turmp back|pg||
nt|sybarra: some part score here|pg||
nt|ianmcc: thin 4@s here|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe 2 sp|pg||
nt|sybarra: a bit lite for my style of 2 @C |pg||
nt|ady: might get to 3NT now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: wrong again 6@c|pg||
nt|pelu: no slam bid - a bet, Ralf?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: gordon grimaces|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: Moya Kelly as south had a few choices after 1C P 1H - she could double, bid 2NT, or just 1S.|pg||
nt|steshome:  Um, I'm with Simon on this one|pg||
nt|athene: the problem is if you show the 5-5 you can't really show the values - 2nt would usually be weaker|pg||
nt|copeyj: Why Sarah, what does Simon think? :)|pg||
nt|ady: wonder if east will compet   4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: can they get to it (nad do you want to be in it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: This way he got to bid both Dima :) 1 and 3 @H|pg||
nt|iceak:  south bids 4@h most likely|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe it is like opening 2 nt? |pg||
nt|ady: must be north 3NT|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: she doesn't know but she knows you will be right|pg||
nt|athene: i'm with you too|pg||
nt|ianmcc: no & no|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Bridge is a bidder's game, as we can see here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: not 6@c sry. there is a @s loser |pg||
nt|dinos1: y, in fav S cd enter the bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: you mean S's pass with 5-5?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: yes, with 5-5, at favorable, against a 2@C opening I would be in the bidding even with worse suits than that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow   on 52  EW DID end up in @C     4@C|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: levin's turn to meditate|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: frowns slightly, shifts side to side in her chair|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: eeek|pg||
nt|steshome:  Yes, you're right Bill made the 4NT comment.  But of course I'm with you in any event|pg||
nt|Walddk1: It does not help England's cause that the Welsh are committing suicide at the moment|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: South was in a scary balancing position|pg||
nt|friggi: but, against weak NT dbl should be 12+|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: on non @h lead dec has to find @s fin to make|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: sry|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: misclick|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Vugraphzfd: gordon: "sorry if it's not classic"|pg||
nt|lml: I think they can make 6@S actually from east|pg||
nt|lml: the cards are very friendly|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: not sure what 3@D was meant to be.  jump cue as mixed raise is popular treatment|pg||
nt|pelu: u are right, Linda|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: gordon excuses himself from the enclosure|pg||
nt|psyck: this will not be a success|pg||
nt|ahollan1: here's the real kicker    on 52  East could have played 3@DX|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mgb81: eek! I can understand both of EW actions (unlike -360 against 1S X) but this is going to get murdered on a trump lead|pg||
nt|dima:  :)|pg||
nt|dima:  seems natural to play double finesse in @d|pg||
nt|iceak:  Karl probably plays low @s and JÃ³n low @d|pg||
nt|iceak:  SÃ¦var sry|pg||
nt|kemperg: but N has a bad 12|pg||
nt|friggi: right|pg||
nt|psyck: good lead for team Gordon to possibly make up a few imps|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: levin has said she was tired.  I know that when I'm playing tired I take forever|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: time for north to get out the big stick of justice|pg||
nt|athene: the 5-level is no time to volunteer 2-card support|pg||
nt|mgb81: this will probably be 1100 as well|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but a big mistake missing at least 4@s|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap asks him to bring water when he returns|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not a good contract. North seems a bit light for his actions, but maybe thay have agreements about 2@h at this vulnerability |pg||
pc|h4|nt|peachy: Wish I knew their methods, but I dont|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Showing 4@H and 5+ @C|pg||
nt|peachy: There is alert on 3C|pg||
nt|sybarra: well... |pg||
nt|dinos1: and EW have comfortable road to slam|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: 6-5 come alive, yes - but only when you actually have a trump fit in one of your long suits|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 3@C probably puppet to 3@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: tought to time this one |pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think a balanced 18-19 was included in 2@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: it was|pg||
nt|sybarra: hence the 2 @S alert |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Then one uses all sorts of transfers and relays and ends in 3NT|pg||
nt|lml: 6 is not a good contract but 4 is|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: west has followed the rule "6-2 come alive"|pg||
nt|athene: or perhaps it should be "6-2 in the glue"|pg||
nt|Walddk1: I think we all agree that 3@H was an overbid|pg||
nt|mgb81: how about "6-5-2, that wont do"|pg||
nt|glen: of course if @D king offside, not as comfortable|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this hand won't make the highlight reel either|pg||
nt|dinos1: comfortable road:) didnt say "slam" )|pg||
nt|fabsayc: cue bidding singleton on first bid is a loser in my opinion|pg||
nt|dinos1: 2@c-2@h-pass-4@h...|pg||
nt|glen: i agree martin, i prefer strong 2@C bidder next show value location|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|athene: people often bid too aggressively when they have shortage in opps' suit but not that big a fit for partner|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Friendly defence may keep this to 800|pg||
nt|athene: these hands are really difficult to control|pg||
nt|athene: when the ruffing value is with only 2 trumps - even with 3 trumps it can get out of hand very easily|pg||
nt|mgb81: Alice can get pout for 800 now - it looks like she can cross ruff but the 7 of hearts will come into play|pg||
pc|d6|nt|santyclz: LOTT say 16 tricks, looks more like 18 to me.|pg||
nt|santyclz: (says)|pg||
nt|sybarra: low spade and ?|pg||
nt|dima:  now low @d and he has to guess |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Actually a trump from West kills the contract|pg||
nt|dima:  true heart is better as specs mention|pg||
nt|sybarra: scary spot,  |pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure it can be made |pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: takes Q@D lead   and a diamond ruff to beat 4 hearts motre than 1|pg||
pc|d2|nt|santyclz: Perhaps only 17.|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|h2|nt|peachy: ok, then 3NT after that apparently showed the clubs?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Attitude lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: club return easy,  @D a guess, (with good guess will bring it home) hts and messes up communication |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Defenders must take care not to set up that long club - maybe had to switch to hearts|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: clubs 4/4  is that enough?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: cohen detaches several cards from his hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: above the table no less.  arranging his line of play?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: C7 SK ST DQ|pg||
nt|dinos1: he cant check @cKQx - not enuff entries|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: "I'm going to try to crash the @CKQ, then play you for @DK"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and Silverstein is playing 4-handed|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk1: Scotland let a 4@S through that should have gone down as the play went, so +29 only now|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry a @C lead - impossible to find - will defeat 6@s :):)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Cohen: "without a @H lead it's much better"|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: could be a ploy, like football plater feigning limp|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: north would have done better to keep the spades|pg||
nt|mgb81: hello|pg||
nt|mgb81: this looks like she's in the game now....|pg||
nt|athene: just let a little club go - what use is that?|pg||
nt|mgb81: that is a very expensive slip from south - turned 800 into 300 if declarer reads it right|pg||
nt|athene: if north had kept all her spades this was 1100 just the same|pg||
nt|athene: just ace and a trump, end of story|pg||
nt|mgb81: now eats has virtually claim on a cross ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk1: This is the board where Wales were allowed to make 4@S|pg||
nt|steshome:  Bit barking to play at the 5-level on a grotty 8-card fit.  Mind you, the opponents played at the 5-level on a grotty 7-card fit |pg||
nt|sybarra: opps|pg||
nt|iceak:  @h Q could drop - declares does not know|pg||
nt|cuttysark: With the heart finesse|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: north wondering whether to ruff ace in other to return that desperately-needed trump, i suppose|pg||
nt|sybarra: true|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s4|pg||
nt|friggi: at persent time weak NT is very popular in Iceland|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sybarra: needs the @D finesse now|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mgb81: Who do you think was more wild on this hand then Sarah? East or West?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lml: as a spec pointed out Aker did very well to keep from pushing east-west|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|pelu: or a stronger drink? :)|pg||
nt|lml: the simple double worked out well|pg||
nt|marlowepi: help me out, are we on the 11th day of a 2-week tournament?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lml: he could have been all over the auction in diamonds and he avoided that|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: aker also excuses hiimself to get water as gordon has not returned|pg||
nt|pelu: but S only know that his pd has 3-4 card @D - so X is the normal bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap mutters "my fault", asks richter if he had @HK|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap: "230.  I had a 5323 14-count.  two little diamonds.  your hand was a monster.  I like 4@S more than 3@D if you're going to take one bid"|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mgb81: I am told Wales have started the comeback and gained 12 imps back in 2 boards|pg||

mb|1C|nt|sybarra: wonder if the over call has a 2 suited implication|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Maybe unbeatable in practice|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: does East bid over a negative double??|pg||
mb|d|nt|lml: looks like one of those muidenberg things Mark|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: not alerted.  neither their online system card nor the CC at the table says anything special about 2@S|pg||
nt|lml: its probably just an usual weak 2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: I think it is just bridge though I suppose some players open 1@S instead|pg||
nt|lml: unusual|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2H|nt|iceak:  seems easy|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: predict 6 or 7|pg||
nt|psyck: surely not 7 with @ck missing|pg||
nt|henryb:  Liz @h, Shirley @h|pg||
nt|cuttysark: NS in the other room bid the 2-acer on 7, so 13 imps to Grant Thornton|pg||
nt|lml: I like 2@S in third|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 2@C relay to 2@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: a bit easier from here but he should bring this home |pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: 30 HCP and 3NT a bit uncertain|pg||
nt|psyck: here 3@d should set @d as suit & 3@s/3@h cue for @c|pg||
nt|friggi: 3@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: seeing the cards n/s can make game in hearts and no-trumps   |pg||
nt|mdgraham: This may find the spade fit - if they get to 4@S, will East double?|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: oh well, took a more direct rout|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: A bit unusual @D preempt by North|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, with only 5 & good hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Pushing E-W above comfortable level|pg||
nt|ady: would have to play a low heart 2nd round in both contracts|pg||
nt|friggi: 4@S|pg||
nt|psyck: i guess S showed both majors|pg||
pc|dK|nt|peachy: This may be "J denies, 9 implies" 2 higher honors|pg||
nt|psyck: a little work to do with the minor breaks, but should get home |pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Henry @h|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: if 4@D is fitshowing raise to 4@S it seems strange to float 4@H back around - gives EW too many options|pg||
nt|pelu: would u all pass in N?|pg||
nt|lml: is this a forcing pass do you think?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: gordon pulls up his sleeves|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: director peeks in to see what board we're on|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@s a min hand maybe|pg||
nt|psyck: if 2N was inv|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Donn writes neatly: 2NT = 4-4 majors, INV|pg||
pc|d4|nt|fabsayc: 3nt is only better than 4@H if south has precisely Ax in diamonds|pg||
nt|glen: had to hop @D king as could not afford a @S switch here|pg||
nt|glen: turns out the long @S hand had no entry though|pg||
nt|dinos1: and if 4-4?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: rosenthal digging through his bag while wolfson decides whether to unblock|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sybarra: and W hand with a perfect yarborough|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome|pg||
nt|psyck: but at unfav, many preempt with wide ranging hands|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap chuckles when the out of tempo double comes back, "OK"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: sorry for the interruption caught up now|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Welcome Henry :)|pg||
nt|friggi: 50%|pg||

nt|friggi: nice lead for decl|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ralfwil: this is too slow in my opinion. about 10 minutes/board|pg||
nt|lml: I play it as forcing because we voluntarily bid a vul game but more sophisticated rules might suggest that east cannot force west|pg||
nt|psyck: good to know his writing has improved|pg||
nt|mdgraham: glad N can write decently|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sybarra: the bidding of 1 @D will locate all of the missed high cards|pg||
nt|psyck: sry fav vul|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no, it was the SW writing that was bad|pg||
nt|psyck: aah right|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: gordon fans his cards, folds them again, leans back, studies dummy|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: has to assess whether @D6 is from J|pg||
nt|psyck: 3rd/low vs suits|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||

nt|friggi: and more|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lml: I find the @HK a bit confusing.  I like to save that kind of card for something other than just a higher ranking suit please|pg||
nt|pelu: why signal for @D - if defense has a @D-trick it can¨'t go away|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: gordon left the @HA faced a while deciding what @HK was about|pg||
nt|lml: the one thing he doesnt want is another heart|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: director announces "45 minutes remain"|pg||
nt|lml: but I dont think Gordong will lead a heart no matter what he thinks the @HK is|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: should be able to play 5 1/2 boards in 45 minutes but we've been well behind that pace|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: oops, 6 1/2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: gordon sighs, crosses his arms.  not at all rushed by the announcement|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the safe play is to try to get 2 @c tricks first. If not E must have a @d trick|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: gordon scratches his head, hovers over his cards|pg||
nt|psyck: def should get their 5 tricks whichever path they chose to take|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||
nt|psyck: Deal 7 produced the expected swing to tighten the match|pg||
nt|cuttysark: It's sort of the unbid suit, but I would prefer a major|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ours wasn't the only room to crash :(|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lml: as he has the @SA even a diamond is fairly safe|pg||
nt|pelu: bridge logic: part has a minor K - play @CA and @c - @DK cant go away - and if S singeton @D = no defense|pg||
nt|psyck: *choose|pg||

nt|vugraphzdh: Can easily get to high|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: matches will resume at 10 am PDT tomorrow|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: east might have considered 3@C|pg||
nt|athene: that has to be a fit bid as a passed hand|pg||
nt|mgb81: Ah - I am now told that the actual auction was 2H (2S) 3H all pass|pg||
nt|sybarra: N finding the 1 @S call "interesting" |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: I think E-W will not bid slam unless N-S push them by 1 more @S bid?!?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Sorry - I am behind the times - the Festival is in January now. |pg||
nt|pelu: looks like cheap insurence - but cost 5 + 5 = 10 IMP|pg||
nt|dinos1: 4@c-5@c|pg||
nt|dinos1: knowing N has @h void|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: cohen pulls the pass card face down then plays it|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|Walddk1: Good poin Bill|pg||
nt|Walddk1: point even|pg||
nt|santyclz: How many for a 2@s bid on 1st round?|pg||
nt|jbennet: again at this situations its good to have 2 ways to bid spades.|pg||
nt|jbennet: N now faces a guess. does South have full valus or does he only competing?|pg||
nt|dima:  2@d is likely to be a constructive @h raise - 7-9 or so with 2@h raise reserved for really junky hands|pg||
nt|jbennet: the same should be applied to NS.|pg||
nt|iceak:  seems 4 no more than 9 tricks in @s|pg||
nt|jbennet: so 2H and 2 sp both show spade suit.|pg||
nt|dima:  North might try 3@h as gametry in @s|pg||
nt|sybarra: brrrrrrrrr |pg||
nt|cuttysark: No, it was great!|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: East was wise not to double|pg||
nt|psyck: cheaply bought, EW make some 11 tricks in @s probably|pg||
nt|xenya: E's pass looks strange|pg||
nt|ady: 13 tricks for n/s    but  needs 2 3-3 splits|pg||
nt|ady: may settle for game|pg||
nt|friggi: dbl is min 4@H + values|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: North was hoping the opponents would bid 4@S, not his partner :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: had anyone of you tried 3nt as W?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 3NT too rich but I liked 3@H over 1@H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: to slow down the tray, 4@C bid without hesitation|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdh: But this might easily be a double game swing|pg||
nt|pelu: agree with 3@H, John|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: aker writes: "X = ?", gordon shrugs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: apparently he has seen North's overcalls before|pg||
nt|dinos1: seems so :)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|athene: south might double here rather than bidding 3@S? |pg||
nt|hawe45: I would never bid 3 @S in this situation - just helping opponents|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Well, depends on what 2@S meant|pg||
nt|psyck: good lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: (1700 GMT)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thru 54  ivatury  24-9 set over nickell to lead by  3|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: I am quite confident, that East knows, who is in position of the @C Queen = 680|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 2@S was 8-13 balanced, no @S stopper|pg||
nt|henryb:  you stay inside where it is warm and well lit -- always dark outside|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N loves her hand now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another 60 boards tomorrow to finish these  "Round of 16" matches|pg||
nt|marlowepi: slam looking likely to her|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: she does not look thrilled|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: puts her hand on her hip, leans back in her chair, frowns slightly again|pg||
mb|4C|nt|athene: so as not to overstate the support|pg||
nt|mgb81: NS can't make very much either a club ruff or a heart trick for the second undertrick|pg||
nt|steshome:  Double's probably game-try|pg||
nt|jbennet: yes but of south only had competing valus 3 sp is likely to be too high|pg||
nt|dima:  Oh well he makes Sandra Landy game try - bid it first then try to make it|pg||
nt|sybarra: LOL|pg||
nt|iceak:  Favorable @c|pg||
nt|dima:  They might know each others 3rd seat opening bids |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Friendly @C layout might see this home|pg||
nt|dima:  brilliant small @h lead?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: A small @H lead would have been killing|pg||
nt|iceak:  JÃ³n more likely to play small @c|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Seems that declarer might be tempted to work on @D which will not work|pg||
nt|henryb:  and I understand the hospitality is fantastic|pg||
nt|friggi: but a nice slam try by Oddur|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Impossible, in my opinion, not to give it a shot|pg||
nt|pelu: many IMP on stake here|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: lucky not to get hit in this|pg||
nt|athene: east might well consider double if really in need of imps|pg||
nt|jbennet: seems 4 sp too high.|pg||
nt|jbennet: but lucky break makes it possible.|pg||
nt|ady: difficult  even to be confident of a small slam |pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont think she is considering pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: set trump     always a good plan|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 4C bid slipped off the pile as the tray went through|pg||
mb|4D|nt|psyck: E had some defensive cards in @h, but the rest of his hand was massively offensive|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: smooth 5@D from pratap|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the 1@S bid has done it's job|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if she seems troubled it is because there are so many options and she wants to think carefully|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: levin points at 4@D and mouths something: blackwood?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: East thought there might be game if partner had some heart support - when he does not, screeching brakes|pg||
nt|sybarra: a spec told me:  16 cm of snow fell last night - hasn't snowed this much in may for 24 years in Iceland|pg||
nt|warrens:  6@H looks like the right contract.  has many chances (either suit 3-3 or a spade ruff in dummy overruffed by the hand with 4 @H's or clubs setting up)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: might be expecting more than A6 from the double|pg||
mb|5D!|an|2+void|nt|sybarra: well e/w are missing some spots in @D,   |pg||
nt|sybarra: I do not see a way to make this|pg||
nt|ianmcc: -100 probably good going|pg||
nt|iceak:  plays @h to K - for a trump|pg||
nt|friggi: not imp 50%|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not a bad slam except the 1 minor flaw...|pg||
nt|pelu: Gordon found the winning bid - but his X confused - or mislead partner|pg||
nt|ralfwil: cannot understand 5@d from E . W didn´t bid 4nt|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: other room has caught up and johnson did bid 3@H with the west hand|pg||
nt|lml: I am not a big fan of the double anyway|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@D  shortness, Ace or King, or KeyCard for @C      i'm absolutely sure of that|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: no Ralf but he X 3@S - 5@C now sh be 6-4 i minor|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap picks up his cards rather than putting out another green one|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 2@C alerted as 2+ by S to W but not by N to E.  pratap looks askew at the second club trick|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: closes the window and whispers a question to Donn|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap coughs.  gordon tosses a ricola under the screen.  pratap accepts, says thank you, continues to contemplate his defense|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: roughly 30 minutes remain for 5+ boards|pg||
mb|6C|nt|psyck: sure did not expect the biddingto die down before 4@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|steshome:  With a 10-count opposite a weak two?  Nah|pg||
nt|psyck: a loser in each suit here...|pg||
nt|xenya: i think E had a clear raise to 4 -- as a double shot at least|pg||
nt|psyck: true|pg||
nt|santyclz: It violates Burn's Rule of 8.|pg||
nt|friggi: nice bidding by N-S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: pushed EW to 4 level with only 9 trumps, which has to be a sin|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: interesting|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: that explains that|pg||
nt|ralfwil: don´t agree. in that case W has at least 7-4 with 5@c|pg||
nt|lml: -300 or 400 is still going to lose quite a few imps|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: richter never put out the final pass.  the red X on top misled me|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but landed cheaper than in 5@cX|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: director peeks in to verify it's board 25 on the table|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S willing to wager on location of void|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: rubin asking about auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: question  1     am i on lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 2@D 4th suit GF, 5D 2+void on both sides of screen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 53  Rosenthal bought the hand in 3@H  [Rubin overcalled 4@H]|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: last quarter wolfson and silverstein both seemed to be having fun playing cards|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Vugraphzfd: undoubled.  sorry for the confusion|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: everyone here seems to be agonizing|pg||
pc|d3|nt|hawe45: 3 @S X = 800, better than game|pg||
nt|jbennet: i think though best bet is too draw trumps ending in dummy and then start the clubs|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mgb81: East does best to switch to hearts and then if north finesses she can give a club ruff for 3 down|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Declarer might get fatally shortened when West gets his @D trick|pg||
nt|kemperg: trump start was better|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: If declarer goes for @D he might make it|pg||
nt|friggi: we do not like rules in Iceland:)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Burn's Rule of 8:  Subtract the number of aces the opps hold from 8.  Don't bid to that level.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: That's an excellent rule :)  I will try to memorize that|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: He might try a ruffing finesse in @D|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|athene: well yes, only a 10 count, but 3 very likely tricks|pg||
nt|pelu: but Ralf for sure West sh have 4 card @D for his X - dont u agree?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|psyck: yes, he has too much work to do with too many cards unfav|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice auction Jills   nice try Ron|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|nt|iceak:  propably vins |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: West's 3@S bid was not effective|pg||
nt|friggi: yes|pg||
nt|kemperg: nice rule|pg||
nt|lml: 4 down is 11 imps to aker|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|nt|xenya: should persevere with diamonds for 1 off|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 1@S or 4@S would have worked better on this hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: But with a passed partner 3@S is a reasonable shot|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Then when 4@H comes to him undoubled, perhaps he should consider 4@S|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mgb81: I suppose it's a bit fancifl to think that north will play ace of trumps and sprun the diamond finesse to get out for down two anyway|pg||
nt|psyck: did E pass 4@h smoothly?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Burn's Laws.  3 of them:  http://www.blakjak.demon.co.uk/burn_law.htm|pg||
nt|dinos1: and S X'd on this ground|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s4|pc|cK|nt|dima:  well done|pg||
nt|henryb:  16 cm is much more impressive than 6 inches isn't it|pg||
mc|12|nt|kemperg: only has to ruff 3@C's|pg||
nt|lml: 5 down is worth just 1 more imp|pg||
nt|lml: however you look at it the doubled served no purpose except to confuse partner|pg||

nt|athene: maybe the moral of the story is, don't go raising partner with a doubleton|pg||
nt|Walddk1: It does not matter much what happens at this table from now on. It is being decided in the Scotland-Wales match|pg||
nt|steshome:  Aye <waves a daffodil>|pg||
nt|mgb81: Yes <waves a leek>|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Poetry in motion|pg||
nt|hawe45: A @H-contract now, possibly|pg||
nt|dima:  Pretty strong set for NS so far - that 4@h on N8 was a bit of a stretch but could have also made|pg||
nt|iceak:  4@s or 5@d seems|pg||
nt|psyck: I would probably have hesitated a bit on 4@h, & having hesitated, bid 4@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: East did not hesitate much, anyway we are playing on screens|pg||
nt|psyck: aah, ok thx|pg||
nt|friggi: sure it was|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but 3@h - 3nt or a direct 3nt was a winning decision (-1 in 3nt)|pg||
nt|lml: the last 4 boards have been rather unpleasant for Gordon.  They obviously need to play faster|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: aker apologizes for something, gordon asks about pratap's hand, richter shakes his head|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: gordon once again asks to confirm the score.  seems to forget the hand as soon as it's back in the board|pg||
nt|Walddk5: scores of all matches after 1st segment   http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2011/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof16|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: bah|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: nice 4 @H  likely makng +1 for e/w|pg||
nt|hawe45: The @S 10 in East is the only card to defeat 7 @H, but also a @S-lead kills it|pg||
nt|hawe45: Black squeeze against West|pg||
nt|friggi: Hrólfur is a very good player|pg||
nt|glen: exactly, 4@H right away at least makes NS wonder if W shapely|pg||
nt|marlowepi: they wont be expecting a swing there though|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: save in 4 @S?  a trick in every suit  |pg||
nt|psyck: then yes, W cold consider 4@s|pg||
nt|psyck: *could|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm still placing the blame on E|pg||
nt|psyck: me too :)|pg||
nt|psyck: 5@d for EW, not easy to get to|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mgb81: in the event of a tie....is it the head to head match that counts? |pg||
nt|santyclz: Doubt n-s will get into the auction.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: club ruffs|pg||
nt|hawe45: Now East can really "disturb" the slam-bidding|pg||
nt|sybarra: here is that bid again |pg||
nt|henryb:  another hand (see board 1) where 3N is best despite the void|pg||
nt|sybarra: 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|pelu: do they have 10 min for 4 boards?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal  18+ bal|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: Investigating|pg||
nt|athene: spade lead very costly in the other room|pg||
nt|hawe45: But the more E/W bid @D, the more South will be happy for partners values - showed in controls allready|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Well, East seems to think that 2@D was a takeout of @Ds!|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Yet another slam possibly|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: I did not note the time when director announced 45 min|pg||
nt|ralfwil: even 5 peter|pg||
nt|dinos1: 3@c? or 2?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what does 3@C by west mean at this point instead of 1@S|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sybarra: multi,  then 3 @c weak with hts, etc to 4|pg||
nt|peachy: 2H by E might have caused more problems than 2D|pg||
nt|hawe45: Good practical bid by South|pg||
nt|cuttysark: The one we just saw has been flattened|pg||
nt|psyck: but it also depends on their preemptive style|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N opener is NOT  strong/bal|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N should bid here|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: after 2nt they are likely to end in 4@H the same in here|pg||
nt|athene: then east just has to lead a diamond rather than a spade|pg||
nt|sybarra: right, didnt notice the club ruffs|pg||
nt|ralfwil: more than 20 minutes ago|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: nominal schedule says 1000-1210 for this quarter|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a kind of mini michaels ?!|pg||
mb|2N|nt|vugraphzdh: I actually wondered if he would open 6@H|pg||
nt|sybarra: S 2 @S looked like a 2 suited (tartan type) bid |pg||
nt|iceak:  no reason to find play to loose 2 trump tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: some call it Muiderberg|pg||
nt|sybarra: tartan's are 5/5  and muiderberg can be 5/4+  |pg||
nt|glen: i actually like a jamming 3@H (preemptive) over the XX |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=good 20-22|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Many play 3@c to be good w/@hs.|pg||
nt|hawe45: @D-lead - let´s see Søvar make the overtrick - but he will probably put his money on a @C-finesse. But with spectators, one is obliged to make the squeeze|pg||
nt|sybarra: I guess 2 @H says nothing about hts? |pg||
nt|friggi: sure it is|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Not sure, but I think 1NT asks for controls (A = 2, K = 1)  2@D showing 3|pg||
nt|dinos1: thk weak MM's|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wonder if they ever upgrade a bad 20|pg||
mb|3C|nt|psyck: cards fit well for EW here|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Sequences over the mult-strong-meaning 2@C must be quite complex|pg||
nt|ady: south using evasive action   intending to pass any reply to stayman|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdh: Claim on a @C finesse|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's part of 1N rebid|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sybarra: sorry strong with hts|pg||
nt|psyck: compare this with the deal 9 2@c opening :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Yes, this one is quite more normal|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm 5@d better - depends on lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however, the auction was practical |pg||
nt|fabsayc: disadvantage is it allows north to double, so maybe 3@H better|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: pther table did not bother to investigate grand on deal 9 either|pg||
nt|friggi: they should reach 6@S|pg||
nt|glen: back in the land of 9 tricks|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|psyck: right|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and who needs a spade stopper if (a) the suit is 4-4 and (b) they don't lead one? |pg||
nt|dinos1: not 9, more :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: I am told that Maida Grant has just found the onlylead to beat a game against Wales that her team-mates missed|pg||
nt|athene: there's surely a good case for just bidding 4@H over 2nt with that north hand?|pg||
nt|mgb81: so it might be 6 to Scotland instead of a possible 10 to Wales|pg||
nt|ady: this looks down 1  on top   I think n/s will be happy to conceed 50|pg||
nt|ady: have we got stuck?|pg||
mb|p|nt|steshome:  Checking back for the 4-4 spade fit - might play better|pg||
nt|sybarra: Isak (our operator) is doing a great job of showing the alerts |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Indeed he is :) It's a fiddly process, but maybe he knows ahen they are coming|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Wonder if they have worked out who is on lead yet|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think he would agree, you get used to it as operator|pg||
nt|henryb:  standard transfer auction|pg||
nt|kemperg: in the wrong hand then:(|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 3@D possibly showed @D control, which slows South down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes --  Rubin could have bid Stayman|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: rubin says 20-22 "but we can ask him".  ekeblad says could have 23, free 1NT over 1H would be 19-20|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzdh: This is why I like to lead a low trump from quack doubleton :)|pg||
nt|friggi: yes - must be|pg||
nt|pelu: 15 boards - normal time id 15 x 7,5 + 15 min for the screens = 128 min|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: auction is correct.  sorry for the glitch while checking the web page|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mgb81: Here North south employ a common treatment whereby 3S is forcing with 4 spades and 4 or 6 hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk1: No one seems to know how they break a tie. I asked 5 'competent' people|pg||
nt|dima:  next case|pg||
nt|sybarra: need take the club or they dont get it|pg||
nt|dima:  might try to steal a heart trick but if it must be 5-5 then unlikely to work|pg||
nt|warrens:  a reasonabl play by North, hoping to pitch 2 @H's from dummy on his clubs if this held|pg||
nt|ady: now worried about losing 3 heart tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: lot of thinking about defense|pg||
nt|pelu: so 130 min is sceduled = still 15 min|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: @ST shows J or shortness|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: aker corrects himself: when dummy shows strong balanced hand leads are standard|pg||
nt|pelu: play @D in trick 2 = 12 tricks|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: someone tell gordon or we'll be here all day|pg||
nt|lml: :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: sitting back with his arms crossed|pg||
pc|hK|nt|warrens:  oops|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|mgb81: with 5H and 4S north bids 3H waiting to hear a 4 card spade suit from south|pg||
nt|iceak:  JÃ³n missed his chance bo not leading single @d|pg||
nt|sybarra: so 3 @D was sort of smolen-ish|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if E always shows 2+ stoppers with a free 2N in this situation, i dont think it is that clear to bid stayman with such weak spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 54  Rosenthal-Silverstein playing 4@D   where we saw tame 2@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: agreed Marshall|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Vugraphzfd: goren handles @S4|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jbennet: that would have helped at all|pg||
nt|sybarra: (that was a question) |pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is not zia's law, seems risky|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kemperg: I would play the Q|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|friggi: I would play @D7|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Neither defender can touch @Cs|pg||
nt|kemperg: ops will show they missed a grand:)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jbennet: would not have helped.|pg||
nt|friggi: 1S slam is better|pg||
nt|pelu: as so often before :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: director announced "20 mins" a minute ago.  doubt we'll even be on board 15 by then.  curious whether they take it away|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cQ|nt|lml: it should pick up now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: there seem to be subtleties of the system which are known to ekeblad but opaque to rubin|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: levin buries her head in her hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: which is better, a system with subtleties or one that is dubbed?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as long as Eke's next play is @S   doesn't matter what Levin does [except for overtrick]|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: levin asks ekeblad for his exact range again|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: earlier he had said 2NT over the interference started at 21.  can't hear the answer this time|pg||
nt|marlowepi: to how many decimal places?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe issue is 1 vs 2 overtricks|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: ekeblad lowers the screen, whispers something else to levin.  she nods.  he says "just didn't know" and chuckles|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jbennet: at all|pg||
nt|friggi: @S slam is better then NT|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mgb81: Oh apparently the Scots have just let through the game....|pg||
nt|mgb81: This means Wales have pulled to within 1imp|pg||
nt|athene: i have quiet confidence in wales to do what needs to be done|pg||
nt|dima:  With KJx in trumps it did not really look that one WANTS to ruff|pg||
nt|iceak:  sure - but in this|pg||
nt|kemperg: no was not looking good|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mgb81: and England are Leading the Lady MIlne for the first time this tournament!!!|pg||
nt|Walddk1: 54-0 to Wales over the last 8 boards, two of which were flat|pg||
nt|mgb81: Mean while in 4H North had no way to avoid losing 3 trumps to go with the king of spades and another completely wasted ten imps to England|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think the right (and on this hand successful) line is two rounds of trumps, cash the @dA, and three rounds of spades|pg||
pc|c6|nt|cuttysark: It looks as if 2@D was a transfer and 3@D showed 4-5, but last time he transferred into a 4card spade suit.....|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|nt|xenya: this will go down 2, but 4@S NS appears to be makeable|pg||

pc|sT|pg||
pc|h5|nt|pelu: well TD take a board or give penalty IMPs?|pg||

nt|hawe45: Slam without a @C-lead here|pg||
nt|jbennet: if singleton lead then club loser goes away.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: The lead does not matter. If you lead singleton @D you loose the @C trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 4@H should make E-W here, allthough the trumps are weak|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: gordon asks what were the colors again, complains about the team scoresheet (where vul is at the bottom in small type)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: didn't miss any play, rosenthal just thought for a moment and claimed after @SQ passed|pg||
mb|1C|mb|d|nt|henryb:  I think 2@d showed gf values opposite 18-19 and 2@h showed 18-19, then 3@d was a transfer and 3@h showed 3 hearts and not 4@s|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, a @cJ drops|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbennet: many seems to upgrade 19 counts to 20-21NT.|pg||

nt|ady: part score hand    e/w may play 1NT|pg||

nt|psyck: or 4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@H is a bit rich|pg||

mb|1H|nt|santyclz: The theory is to save room with the stronger hand for a game try.  I'm not convinced there is any real advantage.|pg||

nt|xenya: tough to get there though?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, it could be right|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mgb81: Off for east not to respond - at green I'd have though 1H had some appeal|pg||
nt|henryb:  5@d is cold N-S but hard to reach|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and if South bids 4@s now, West will know what to do |pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: yes|pg||
nt|psyck: W hand not improved by 2@d overcall either|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: West is close to a maximum Precision @S opening.|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk1: We can't say how they break a tie because there doesn't seem to be anything in the regulations|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Which is very strange|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 4@s doubled will be interesting|pg||
nt|jbennet: another case for lebensohl 1NT response.|pg||

nt|sybarra: someone has to get into the bidding  |pg||
nt|henryb:  very normal on BBO|pg||
nt|friggi: but diff to get there|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Say, impossible|pg||
nt|psyck: 4@h a better shot at fav vul, but the 74 shape is tempting|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|xenya: this is 8th trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 8 tricks are makeable, with the @C jack 3d and @H ace onside|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: here we go |pg||
nt|lml: a helpful lead|pg||

mb|3C|nt|mgb81: has Alice Kaye found the winnign bid to tip partner off to a heart lead?....|pg||

nt|dinos1: how to beat?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: That would be a no...|pg||
nt|Walddk1: The winners of the Trophies shall be the countries with the greatest number of Victory Points gained over the series. In theevent of two or more countries gaining an equal number ...|pg||

nt|dinos1: fav position of @dA and @hK|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: A double may have backfired.|pg||

pc|h2|nt|steshome:  Where are we now in terms of VPs, Roland?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: yues I think it's cold|pg||
nt|cuttysark: But remembers some of his partner's opening bids|pg||
nt|henryb:  5@d is actually pretty good: needs either 2-2 @d and @c not worse than 4-2 or 3-3 clubs and @d not worse than 3-1|pg||
nt|friggi: now 10 tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so bye bye the clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks like well timed sequence to me    but would have been interesting to see what happens after  1N-2@H-?|pg||

pc|hK|pg||
nt|santyclz: A good hand to play slowly.|pg||
nt|dinos1: 5@c2@s1@h1@d|pg||
nt|glen: given declarer knocks out @C ace first|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and no entry, depends on timing however|pg||
nt|dinos1: what else shd he do?|pg||
nt|glen: it depends on the CD|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: cohen moves CK, C6 to one end of his hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he has a losing option, if the aces were reversed in NS|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: same motif as the slam where he claimed early|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: asks for silverstein's CC, asks about leads from all small|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: @S4,@S3 might be from 9432 or similar holding|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mgb81: There are 2 boards left to score in the Wales match and Scotland lead by 2 imps I believe|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: that's a view|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: oh the board is wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: they might overbid here|pg||

mb|2C!|nt|ianmcc: vul!|pg||
nt|santyclz: I think we can all agree with that discription of 2nt...|pg||
nt|psyck: W has a practical 3N bid, but E may want to show his @c |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 3@H from West here might promise a good @S raise, so 3NT is a likely bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: gordon asks about 1@C, aker writes detailed answer|pg||
nt|lml: 1@S or some kind of michaels now?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: @C or 12-14 bal or 18-20 any shape|pg||
nt|glen: N's bid depends on the NS light style of opening or not|pg||
nt|glen: if you shrunk the S name to Roth, N would double|pg||
nt|fabsayc: cohen could get ambitious with his hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: I think that doesnt take into acocunt the 1vo slow play fine does it sarah?|pg||
nt|iceak:  4@s sry|pg||
nt|jbennet: tricky hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: director: "five minutes"|pg||
nt|psyck: low to Q was % assuming no other considerations|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: board was placed incorrectly onto tray|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=10-15, 4+@H  could have longer @S  [or 5@H & 5@S]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C  game force relay|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|mgb81: 1vp*|pg||
nt|ady: this might lead to 4@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C = 7@H, min, some shortness|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: in which case they could get overboard as Vladamir suggests|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@C = @Cs or balanced 12-14 or 18-20 - If balanced any shape in minor|pg||
nt|marlowepi: they will soon discover they have no fit, so KC wonlt be an issue here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 7-1 counts as a fit?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@H now?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: ekeblad writes "7@H min, with some shortness" and shows me the slip|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jbennet: good methos need to find the superious 3NT.|pg||
nt|sybarra: sort of a 10 count |pg||
nt|cuttysark: A bit of an upgrade by East for his 6-4 distribution|pg||
nt|sybarra: with the single @D |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: propably counting loosing tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, inclined to agree. South has long spades (North bid 1NT), therefore likely to be shorter in hearts than North  |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 2D = one major|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbennet: methods are:..|pg||
nt|iceak:  how strong is E?|pg||
nt|jbennet: 2NT= "i have a weak doubleton"|pg||
nt|pelu: u were too fast for me, John, :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 19   but 2NT might have worked out better |pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Looks like NS play weak NT first seat? |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Yes. Hard to stay away from hopeless 3NT here|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 4@S might make. Possibly 4@H|pg||
nt|hawe45: Good bidding might lead to 4 ! h - also down|pg||
nt|dima:  11-13|pg||
nt|sybarra: club system e/w |pg||
nt|jbennet: 3 clubs asks: "where"|pg||
nt|psyck: no @d cue meaning they should not crosss 5@c level|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|psyck: but with the @c break...|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: The fact that North did not double 4@H might help South on the lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: sometimes the players let me read their explanation pads, sometimes not|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: wolfson whispers: "mildly invitational", cohen:"he's probably got 14, never seen him refuse"|pg||
nt|glen: a popular style for experts, stayman, then 2@S as an invite|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, 4H clear|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he stole that line from me|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk1: Stephen, can we leave the table open for confirmed results, please?|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: ok|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe W should not have raised with a purely defensive hand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Running scores at  http://www.bridge.is/meistarastig/20102011/magiccontest.htm  |pg||
nt|psyck: MultiLandy/Woolsey style 2@d|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: donn tried to lead from the wrong side|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: before window was lifted.  this board giving everyone vertigo|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he saw it on the chandelier, Al|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: ekeblad has convinced me that he thoroughly knows and understands his system|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thru 58   Ivatury over Nickell by ONE|pg||
pc|dA|nt|santyclz: So both significant swings so far have gone against Vestri.  |pg||
nt|hawe45: 4 @H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: more ancient than nearly any living player|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: how ancient is Stayman itself?  1940s?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: seems like half the ACBL membership is older than Stayman|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jbennet: "3NT i have weak doubleton in clubs"|pg||
nt|dima:  One might need mirrors to make this one|pg||
nt|psyck: so play 4@hx as do not lead @h|pg||
nt|psyck: *some...|pg||
nt|pelu: some pairs use 2@D here to let W decide|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: South now knows about 2-2 in @Cs|pg||
nt|hawe45: 4 @S can make 620 - "can"|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: And he actually knows that 4@D is most likely the "right spot"|pg||
nt|hawe45: 4 @S is he right spot|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: But vulnerable at IMPS he will guess some game|pg||
nt|dima:  ok one problem solved|pg||
nt|iceak:  first problem solved|pg||
pc|h5|nt|peachy: I would rather try a Moysian than 4D|pg||
nt|jbennet: OK then ; then 4 major is no longer an option. EK stiff oppsite xx creates too many loseres in 4 major.|pg||
nt|sybarra: lead is helpful |pg||
nt|henryb:  well worth 10-12|pg||
nt|cuttysark: North hoping that South has the singleton|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Aðalsteinn is world champion from Yokohama 1991|pg||
nt|psyck: oh well|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|pc|h7|pg||
nt|mgb81: Declarer made a unusual play when she ducked the club lead in both hands|pg||
nt|peachy: if ten tricks are makeable some way|pg||
nt|hawe45: Why did South NOT support partners 3 @S - instead of bidding what he had allready showed|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Well bid by N-S I think|pg||
nt|lml: still I think 2@H will likely make|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mgb81: had she ducked the second club from dummy she would have made 2 tricks which would have been enough. as it is a spade switch will lead her to down one I think|pg||
nt|cuttysark: As are his pair in the other room, I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: right you are McGowan|pg||
nt|sybarra: this was the team that was the surprise winner |pg||
nt|psyck: quite normal to see a lot of overbidding in the final stages i guess, they even got to 6@hx OR in the 5@hx-2 deal |pg||
pc|h3|nt|peachy: After AK clubs located and now SK, the HQ will not be hard to locate as with opening hand, E likely would have said something on 1D|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: South has no reason to think that @S are better than @H, the @H fit is actually much better|pg||
nt|ady: dont exit wirh small spade|pg||
nt|santyclz: Lovely suit for a vul overcall.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: director peeks in, frowns, departs|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sybarra: W is likely to take the @H hook |pg||
nt|iceak:  No reason to do othervise|pg||
nt|jbennet: so if playong a good system, EW reaches 3 NT which is as everybody can see.|pg||

nt|Walddk1: And to our many excellent commentators over the three days|pg||
nt|sybarra: *an|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 1@s doubled?|pg||
nt|jbennet: EW punished by playing an inferiour system.|pg||
nt|iceak:  EW use to have a good system|pg||
nt|sybarra: back to 14 |pg||
nt|jbennet: passing is showing some weakness in personality and causes a lower status in the hiearchy . |pg||
nt|sybarra: and we will come back to 16 as last bd |pg||
nt|sybarra: some early thank you's are in order |pg||
nt|iceak:  Interesting how SÃ¦var will bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think Ideland celebrated for at the year |pg||
nt|cuttysark: They were 'quite pleased' :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  and all four players in the other room are on the Iceland team for this year's Bermuda Bowl|pg||
nt|xenya: was it really 4? |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Very uncareful play by declarer. South's double should have warned him|pg||
nt|psyck: y, lost a @s too|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: He lost 2@D, 2 trump and a @S|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: bidders game|pg||
nt|santyclz: Yep.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Difficult to stay out of game here.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: director: "you guys are seriously late" but departs without taking any boards with him|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap: "sorry, could have held it to down 2"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: but the long sessions behind screens and the short break between sessions|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: i see|pg||
nt|psyck: that will even the match|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Could have ruffed that @S loser|pg||
nt|ady: duplication in clubs here|pg||
nt|chessmaste: And this is not so simple|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|sybarra: N could well sit |pg||
nt|santyclz: We say 1@sx'd after an overcall with n's @s suit go for 1100 yesterday.|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes about to say the same Santy |pg||
nt|peachy: 1@H = 11-15|pg||
nt|sybarra: Many thanks, to our operator Stefan Jonsson. A job well done! |pg||
nt|cuttysark: But Baldursson has just mistimed the play in 4@H on Board 11 and Grant Thornton have quite a big lead now|pg||
nt|sybarra: transfer to 1 nt as I recall |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: normal polarity has resumed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: first strong club of the session |pg||
nt|glen: of course juniors have a schedule like: morning ko, online poker, afternoon session, online poker, evening session, midnite ko, online poker (but online poker now banned in US)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|henryb:  no, shirley, just denies a 4 card major|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C artificial game force|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: director checks in.  ekeblad: "2 more.  we got plenty of time"|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: North could also open 1 @H 11-15|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok|pg||
nt|santyclz: 13 bds, 14 imps!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: if they were all like 4NT claim 11 no one would watch|pg||
nt|pelu: nice play by Simson in OR|pg||
mb|2N|nt|henryb:  Opener will rebid 1N with a sub-1NT balanced hand|pg||
nt|psyck: Sarpisj still comfortable to make it to the finals though|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so North is North, and South is South, yes? Good  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N  12-14  likes NT from his side|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: I have to say this is the most exciting Lady Milne I've ever seen|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt is a possible overcall for north, i think|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Finally, our gratitude to Bridge Great Britain (Sandra Claridge) and the NIBU (Robin Burns) for ensuring that this fine event was brought to BBO. Greatly appreciated by bridge fans ...|pg||
nt|Walddk1: all over the world|pg||
nt|mgb81: 1NT? is that a joke bill?|pg||
nt|athene: err....wasn't meant to be|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: not at the moment everyone has left but I will find the scores and be back|pg||
nt|ianmcc: the educated lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no problem, they can still play on english sites|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now it will look like auction over NT opener|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|athene: why, is it so bad?|pg||
nt|santyclz: (saw)|pg||
nt|glen: yes, but they hate playing for crumpets|pg||
mb|d|nt|jbennet: easy to get too high here.|pg||
nt|friggi: 3@H|pg||
nt|friggi: 3NT|pg||
nt|othered1: rehi, all. do  they play 1@H forcing and perhaps artificial?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|hawe45: 8 tricks on a @S-lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Hard to say, if declarer goes for @Cs, he's doomed.|pg||
nt|dima:  Karl is feeling well now :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 1@H 4+|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks forcing, if South felt inclined to bid over it - ah, may have a longer minor |pg||
nt|psyck: re Ed|pg||
nt|othered1: oh, just possible canape -- idea being that partner with a fit and maximum pass may try for game.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL   just gives EW more room to maneuver|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: with 100 for honours in spades? a 14 count and two suits wide open?|pg||
nt|hawe45: Undo, pls|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: donn whispered something to pratap about whether 1@H could be passed but I didn't hear the full sentence|pg||
nt|glen: 3NT could be quite wrong on some layouts|pg||
mb|4C|nt|cuttysark: Thin intervention by North, looks likely -1|pg||
nt|psyck: Malning will be inching towards the 4th spot maybe|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: silverstein: "good hand" as he puts it down|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not the most delicate auction, NS seem to resolve all close decisions in favour of 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: yes its so bad!|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H should make    3NT easier|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: looks roughly like a 1nt overcall to me, but ok|pg||
nt|hawe45: Small @H now = only hope|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbennet: but if souths now signs off then North should respect that.|pg||
nt|iceak:  Sees @d fit|pg||
nt|sybarra: he did have 15  (but flattish)|pg||
nt|henryb:  If he had kept quiet would have gone plus defending 1N|pg||
mb|p|nt|dima:  Is 2@s GF or only RF?|pg||
nt|dima:  Ok answered|pg||
nt|jbennet: 2NT was probably telling "i am week"|pg||
nt|kemperg: still wins 3 imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: @D now to the Jack - and SMALL!!! from North = best defence|pg||
nt|hawe45: But as the @H´s are cleared, normal defence also works|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lost opportunity|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: could land in 6NT cold or 6@S off|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|nt|jbennet: north respected it.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: With both opponents bidding it is quite dangerous, but then you have to remember what they bid on|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Grant is reigning team champions in Iceland |pg||
nt|henryb:  indeed, but sometimes silence is golden|pg||
nt|xenya: but it was Malning who went 4 off...|pg||
pc|hA|nt|psyck: oops yes|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|santyclz: Best defense would seem 500.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: surely 6N with o nly 8 card fit, no ruffing value and double stoppers everywhere|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|nt|iceak:  SparisjÃ³Ã°ur lost 11 on 11 by playing 5@d instead of 4@s|pg||
nt|jbennet: on a bad day even 3 D is -1|pg||
nt|iceak:  2NT was most surely showing a weak hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: West has to find a @D switch now, which is far from obvious|pg||
nt|friggi: right|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzdh: The ship has sailed for Málning. Probably making 10 tricks in a partscore on this board|pg||
nt|psyck: W surely had an invite|pg||
nt|psyck: A & intermediaries|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|santyclz: Cash 4 @cs and exit with @ha, @h.|pg||
nt|ady: 1 spade loser    the other spade goes on the 4th diamond |pg||
nt|ahollan1: still  how likely that other room will even sniff at slam|pg||
mc|11|nt|mgb81: anyway ns have come to rest in a partscore|pg||
nt|peachy: crucial moment|pg||
nt|iceak:  3@d would have been GF and strong|pg||
nt|glen: some expert partnerships play 2NT over 2@H as forcing, since 2NT rarely exactly right spot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 18 opposite MAX of 14 bal|pg||
pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|glen: thanks Joe for being a great operator!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: thanks Glen for guiding us through|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|glen: Q. did jimmy cayne (jec) participate in this event A. no|pg||
mb|d|an|not sure|nt|glen: 4@C was a splinter, and now E would bid 3@S if possible|pg||
mb|4S|nt|glen: i can't imagine what N's double means looking at the actual hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: maybe the double is "don't lead a diamond"|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|nt|glen: spec notes on the results page you can click on team names to see team profiles with pictures|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|s3|pc|c7|pc|c2|pg||

nt|henryb:  It worked|pg||
nt|henryb:  as you know|pg||
nt|ady: is this session 16 hands?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: yes|pg||
nt|pelu: decl missed the chance - sh take 1 more @h|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: director called "find your places please" for second segment.  not sure when this match will resume|pg||
nt|mdgraham: last board. Excellent operating, John|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: director announces ten minutes so we will get our full session break|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: silverstein: can you bid 2NT? it's not quantitative|pg||
nt|glen: no double digit swings this set - good bridge but not dramatic|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: to cohen: the hand we play 2NT forcing for|pg||
nt|marlowepi: by the time EW had disclosed the spade holding, they were virtually at the 4 level and opps had already been able to make a lead-directing double|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|sybarra: did we skip 14?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: strong 1@C   weak 1@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdh: Yes, missing 14|pg||
nt|jbennet: well after 1 NT opening; 1 should should be able to find 44 fit in majors|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok |pg||
nt|dima:  BOOM!|pg||
nt|jbennet: but still be able to choose 3NT.|pg||
nt|jbennet: stupid bid.|pg||
nt|iceak:  But bid at both tables|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Well, it is very hard to teach the scorpion not to bite|pg||
nt|jbennet: we all hate to be preempted.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: thank you. and thanks all for joining us|pg||
nt|psyck: Thanks Mike & Ed.  Very good job John.  Thanks to the kibs for joinnig us.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: all systems have their good and bad situations|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|psyck: looks like 4M both ways|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  that is a brave double by Bjarni|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@c now|pg||
nt|glen: ok, they are just saying that since they looked at my 2NT comment|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: I would say 7@H sacrifices are dramatic|pg||
mb|1H|an|4+ F1|nt|cuttysark: Or not|pg||
nt|pelu: and I am signed up for Nickell nexi match - no time for tea :(:(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H forcing   could be 4@H with longer @C/@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: Welcome everyone to the final set of the Lady Milne|pg||
nt|mgb81: the current score as we just saw see Scotland only 1VP ahead of England|pg||
nt|mgb81: so there is literally everything to play for|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Hello Sarah, Michael and Bill|pg||
nt|mgb81: here north has made an inverted minor suit raise and south indicated a weak no trump hand|pg||
nt|steshome:  Hello Roland! |pg||
nt|mgb81: north might be thinking of a slam, but even the 5 level might be too high.|pg||
nt|sybarra: now S has to make it |pg||
nt|iceak:  SparisjÃ³Ã°ur seems to be winning back|pg||
nt|jbennet: very well put. |pg||
nt|henryb:  I would not find it|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Lebesohl, probably the first step in showing 4hearts and game values|pg||
nt|kemperg: 10 tricks in OR, much|pg||
mb|2C!|an|5-7 not 3 !H or 5 !S|nt|sybarra: on a club lead however |pg||
nt|dima:  no play|pg||
nt|jbennet: everybody has a "reptile brain" ; which is governed by emotions not by common sense and judgement|pg||
nt|sybarra: you put it more succinctly dima|pg||
nt|iceak:  9 tricks|pg||
nt|jbennet: if one should randomize a lareg number of layouts consistent with south:s opening bid.|pg||
nt|dima:  N does have a touching trust in his partner's suit quality preempt, but still 4@s is unLAWful and will lose IMPs here|pg||
nt|jbennet: then everybody would find that to enter with 4H is a huge huge losing bid..|pg||
nt|sybarra: could get very ugly if he goes up with K|pg||
nt|dima:  you have 8 trumps , opponents rate to have at most 9 so ..|pg||
nt|jbennet: and 4 spades was also a stupid action.|pg||
nt|iceak:  No reason to go up with K|pg||
nt|dima:  It could be from Q87 or so he preys ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: South is a very solid citizen, so North definately imagined 4@S as a rather good contract|pg||
nt|jbennet: but again the "repitle brain" caused a losing call. |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: "Only" needing the ace of @C with the 4@H bidder|pg||
nt|jbennet: yes but if now 4 spades makes.|pg||
nt|jbennet: the 4 h is surely likely to be 3 off at least.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: But a double seems to stand out at IMPs. Collecting a safe 300-800, instead of a 50% 620|pg||
nt|dima:  How in the world do you come to 10 tricks? Even opposite AK10xxxx + side King you need more then ONLY Ace onside|pg||
nt|othered1: Thanks all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@S is (probably) one of those things that has to be done|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: a misguess in spades is all it takes to go one down, as the two discards are useless to the south hand|pg||
nt|mgb81: ah thats a practical shot|pg||
nt|sybarra: alerfted leb |pg||
nt|sybarra: *alerted |pg||
nt|psyck: only 3 levels lower than other room|pg||
nt|glen: yes, but you did not entry any 7@H bids in this set|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: no, the action was at the other table where Weinstein came in on the 5-5 over 2@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=5-7 HCP, 0-2@H, 0-4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now what?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would expect most pairs  to sniff at slam and some to get there. E didnt just have "18". he was 5422 with a decent enough suit and three aces|pg||
mb|2S|nt|henryb:  slow shows the major. fast denies the major|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: That was peaceful|pg||
nt|santyclz: This is the penultimate deal of the event.  Thanks to the Icelandic Bridge Federation, particularly Olof for allowing us to visit here.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks to our operator, Stefan Jonsson, great job!|pg||
nt|lml: it will be fun to watch though|pg||
nt|pelu: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: this is penultimate bd of this set |pg||
nt|santyclz: N didn't find that lovely @c preempt and e-w got to 6@s-1 for Vestri's 1st big score.|pg||
nt|sybarra: told you .... |pg||
nt|sybarra: was playing to make it |pg||
nt|jbennet: but bidding is a sort of "alfa male" action.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|cuttysark: 3NT perfectly makeable, but scary|pg||
nt|henryb:  a treatment invented (or at least first shown to me) by Helgemo|pg||
nt|cuttysark: If you were sure that you wanted to play in 3NT you would bid it right away|pg||
nt|henryb:  in contrast to showing the stopper|pg||
nt|sybarra: will E make one more try? |pg||
nt|henryb:  No, bidding 3N directly (in this method) says I do not have hearts|pg||
nt|cuttysark: West has his think: if @CKJ were @CA slam is cold|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Aðalsteinn seems to be in pain|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I mean East (sorry)|pg||
nt|henryb:  get him a couple of Tylenol|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Is that a variant of lebensohl too?|pg||
nt|henryb:  yes. Instead of "slow shows a stopper" it is "Slow shows the other major"|pg||
nt|henryb:  stopper is shown by whether you bid 3N or cue bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@S=natural, forcing 1 round|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: routine 4@S    on a lucky day could make 6    |pg||
nt|warrens:  this can make 6 with everything working|pg||
nt|pelu: here 4@S on @HK - prob "fast" down 1|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: director watching seems to have hurried gordon a little|pg||
nt|othered1: Their style announced on system sheet owns up to very aggressive 1-level defensive actions and that's one of them, suit-wise|pg||
nt|psyck: You can see all the results here in a while: http://www.usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2011/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof16|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Gordon staring at the tray|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: he had 5 LTC which means slam zone facing even a minimum opener|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mgb81: One of the kibbitzers has suggested north might raise to 4NT, but if souths bid 6NT with something like KQJx, KJx, J10xx, Kx there will be a small problem in the ace department|pg||
nt|sybarra: that is disapointment |pg||
nt|mdgraham: little tester for West|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|nt|peachy: 2NT is often played in this auction as "two places to play"|pg||
nt|psyck: 1 level higher than the other room, but unlikely that anyone was getting any higher|pg||
nt|henryb:  when W shows 0 or 3, will E think W has 3?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks to my co-commentators, Fridrik Vigfusson and Germ Kemper.|pg||
nt|lml: nothing has been fast but nice try|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|ianmcc: @s now?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Or @c?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Horrible bidding by E-W leads to a horrible contract :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: which (imho) he has failed  - double must be PENALTIES |pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 58  where Eke held 7@H   Rosenthal in 3N West|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: rubin called for @D8 immediately, played @DA immediately, now tanking|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|peachy: hehe, NS have 4H|pg||
nt|peachy: as the cards lie|pg||
nt|henryb:  sorry, 1 or 4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East being a passed hand or not|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sybarra: (the 5 @D ibid showing 1 or 4 so can only be 1  key card|pg||
nt|henryb:  and he knows not 4|pg||
nt|psyck: Rabbi's will make the rest|pg||
nt|psyck: by dropping the kingleton|pg||
nt|friggi: ditto Joe:)|pg||
nt|kemperg: How do you find the time to give all that comments Stefan, I am impressed|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks to BBO for providing this platform and Roland Wald who works tirelessly to manage these vg sessions. |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap shakes his head, leans back in his chair|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this is getting out of control|pg||
pc|h6|nt|warrens:  on  board 10 at the other table, they bid 7@S! in their 5-2 fit!|pg||
nt|ady: thats unbelievable|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|Walddk1: I have Scotland and England tied on 88 VPs before the last 16 boards|pg||
nt|ianmcc: now 9|pg||
nt|psyck: Yes, Stefan was doing that in earlier sessions too, he is great :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: probably wondering where the partnership desk is|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: donn: my lead? pratap: yeah it's your lead, I never bid clubs|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Vugraphzfd: last board of the set.  next segment scheduled 10 after the hour|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h7|nt|peachy: The ace just could not be right|pg||
nt|pelu: down 2 now|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: N-S actually made 4@H in the open room !|pg||
nt|friggi: Stefán has many "hands"|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk1: Can you confirm, Simon?|pg||
nt|iceak:  if from 78Q - loosing 1@s and 2@c|pg||
nt|kemperg: thank you all and also the specs |pg||
nt|santyclz: And finally thanks to you, the kibs, who drive the whole process.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c2|nt|peachy: difficult with such a trump break and a side ace to dislodge|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Declarer is rather lucky to make from now on|pg||
nt|santyclz: Nice of them to provide a nothing hand for me to put out all those.|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|pelu: too fast play :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: just as well declarer can't take the spade finesse|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: wolfson asks about NS leads|pg||
nt|ahollan1: play might not be as easy in other room  with East as declarer|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: levin asking if rubin has shown extra values|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there is a good case for N ducking the spade smoothly|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: ekeblad giving the full explanation.  didn't hear all of it with his back to me.  "good 17 or higher"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: rubin known to hold AT MOST  1@C|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: does that help??|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: clocks chime to signal the end of the round|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|s7|nt|lml: I think he can set up diamonds for 1 down|pg||
pc|c7|nt|lml: not this way though|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: an improbable diamond lead might have beaten this board|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: cohen checks what board the other table is on and what happened on the 6@S hand|pg||

nt|marlowepi: N has to find hope of beating this, and best chance is to deceive declarer about spade king. ,aybe he will take another finesse and then N can pkay a third one|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Rubin doesn't know both majors splitting  and we're not going to tell him|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|pc|c4|nt|pelu: or he can setup the 4. @D for down 1|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: third segment scheduled to start in 60 mins|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he doesnt have a lot of options does he?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sure  can play North to hold @S10 when suits not breaking|pg||
nt|marlowepi: spade shift less likely if spades are 4=1|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: rubin toyingwith played tricks|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lml: too fast play is right|pg||

nt|ahollan1: on 59  Rosental-Silverstein also in 4@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: almost has to peek from here.  seems to have chosen partial high cross ruff|pg||
nt|marlowepi: has to peek to go down:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: ok, cashing @SJ does seem best|pg||
nt|marlowepi: cross ruff is the headline play, but |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: levin: pick up the boards! I told you not to leave the boards on the floor so the directors have to pick up all the boards|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if it will work, why didnt N lead another spade?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: she says while smiling, first smile I've seen from here all segment|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with @C set up --  @SJ  @H works whenever @S10x  or North holds 3@S|pg||
pc|h5|pc|dT|pc|s9|pc|sT|pg||
