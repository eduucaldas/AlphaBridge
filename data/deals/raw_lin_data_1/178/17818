nt|henryb:  The danger for declarer is that he discovers West is 6-4 in @h and @c and decides to take the odds on @d finesse|pg||
nt|henryb:  I certainly might|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but then might wonder why Wooldridge gave him late entry of @CJ|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: notice that by not ducking the @c West has given declarer a losing option|pg||
