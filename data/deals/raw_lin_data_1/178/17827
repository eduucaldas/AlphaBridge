pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: 6@S is a great contract. Spades 2-2 plus one of two finesses. Much better than mine|pg||

nt|josj: @HK|pg||
pc|d5|nt|psridhar: hi all thx Roland :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jcwla: Steve Robinson said during the Cavendish that it's bad policy to make a bid that goes for 500 at IMPs.  |pg||

pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|josj: and another very quiet partscore hand on which 8 tricks are there for declarer if the defence cash out in time|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|psridhar: was that game swing a 'DONT ' loss? the 2@H bidder gets no 2nd chance as in Landy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@S in the other room seems wrong|pg||

mb|p|nt|psridhar: its worse here this deal :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, North was quite strong - @SQ and @hQ were good cards, but 2@h might have been a 4-3 fit....a bit unlucky imho  |pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h5|nt|jcwla: W might have made a negative double the first round if available.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|andyv:  hi Mike|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Another 5-0 spade break|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jcwla: Meanwhile, no idea what part of the nice @H holding and three only @S's suggested 3@S to N.|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|josj: this time, NS should end up with 12 tricks as spades re 3-3 and @CK right|pg||
nt|josj: more than that is not needed|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|nt|psridhar: poorer spots but Belly heard a 3@C from pd |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Normal but unlucky lead|pg||
nt|jcwla: There is nothing offensively oriented about the N hand that N has not already shown.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: I am told that it is a ridiculous lead|pg||
nt|psridhar: Bd 38 Belly didnt X holding K10942 of trumps-so that 3@C bid makes all the diff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: To be honest, I think any other lead would be ridiculous after partner overcalled the suit at the 3-level|pg||
nt|vugraphzec: okta thing|pg||
nt|mdgraham: why's that? Partner bid the suit at the three-level|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It is a ridiculous lead because one can see all the cards. North does not have the hand records|pg||
