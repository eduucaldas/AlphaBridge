nt|Walddk2: Not often you see him on vugraph|pg||
nt|chorush: Here we go. Nickell is the seond seeded team of the 15 who are competeting. Diamond, which has a bye to the next round, is seeded first|pg||
nt|chorush: On the first board, it seems that EW have a reasonable 5 club contract that would be wrecked by the 4-0 trump break.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That is very unlucky|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5% chance that South has them all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can cope with North having them|pg||
nt|chorush: I think we will see Nickell open 2 hearts and ivatury will likely venture 3 clubs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: EW say they open all balanced 11's and 1NT is really 14-16|pg||

nt|Walddk2: There is of course an issue with @CJ even if trumps had been 3-1|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A promotion|pg||
nt|jcmax: Yes, if the @C10 were in dummy, that might not have a happy ending|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Uday asking Nick if they play weak 2@h bids and Nick says yes and now is explaining something, probably what restrictions they have. I was wondering if Katz dbled because he ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: thought the delayed 2@h would have stuff outside?|pg||

pc|cT|nt|jcmax: In any event getting to 5@C is totally normal. And at least 3NT isn't on. that would really add insult to injury|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Thanks Jan|pg||
nt|jcmax: Are the cc's posted somewhere (other than the system summary form on the usbf site)?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Henner just wrote raise with 3, Ivatury wrote a lot - he has very god hand-writing but then he hid the paper - I know he said 3 hearts and not balanced|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: Unfortunately, not very many players gave me convention cards - the ones that I was given are linked to the System Summary Forms on the USBF website|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jcmax: this would be a nice deal for playing transfers, when 2@D would be linit+ in @H. then one could stop at avery safe level|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A hand for the method one must say, although some would prefer to show the clubs first. However, I suspect that 2@C would be game-forcing for E-W|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Katz had the @d K out but now is studying some more, maybe wondering about that @d 2 from his partner?|pg||
nt|jcmax: ery nice defence by N here. He knows they can only beat 3@H, if they can get a @C ruff|pg||
nt|jcmax: So he plays partner for the @DK|pg||
nt|chorush: If NS don't get their club ruff, will Ivatury interpret Nickells appartent attempts to reach katz as having a singleton club?. Even a trum return would force him to take that view|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jcmax: Surely against 4@H he would not have defended that way and just cashed out|pg||

nt|psyck: Hi Bill|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|athene: should be a flat board |pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: North asks 3Hearts?|pg||
nt|athene: even if north bid diamonds and got a diamond lead, he could cash the @CA and switch to a spade to beat the contract|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, there were no real alternative in the bidding & defense using standard methods|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H just a normal 3-card limit raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: screen down and Lee asks Hamman a ?|pg||
nt|athene: the only way things might go differently is if an EW pair play 1nt semi-forcing|pg||
nt|athene: but people rarely put their 3-card limit raises into 1NT if it's not totally forcing - they have some other special bid for them|pg||
nt|daman: Lee is seeking a ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Zia asks to see Hamman's convention card has to change something on it|pg||
nt|daman: he will cash the @D Ace    and then  @S K and a @S |pg||
nt|psyck: I do that with several pd's :)  1N NF & the only way for 3 card LR...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Lee is thinking the ace of clubs auto play by the computer when the queen was played|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|daman: Hamman cannot have 4@Ss   (Flannery)|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose someone might take a way-out view and respond 3@C with west if that's an invitational jump shift|pg||
nt|athene: but that would be quite a view with three hearts|pg||
nt|psyck: Yes, I paly 3@c as inv, but denies @h fit|pg||
nt|athene: a spec points out that 3@C is going to go down in practice as declarer will lose two trump tricks - i guess there is no trump coup there|pg||
nt|athene: south would be ruffing in on a heart|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Zia is making out a new convention card|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: hamman does his best to jam the defenders' signals in clubs by concealing the @C3|pg||
nt|daman: someone says EW don't play Flannery any more    I thought I saw them playing it on Sunday|pg||
nt|athene: if playing 3/5th leads, though, north must know declarer can't have a singleton club|pg||
nt|athene: south would not lead the 7 from 108732|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|h9|pg||
nt|daman: Debbie says   EW announced they play Flannery to the opps     so much for that rumo(u)r|pg||
nt|athene: so not the best trump shift there|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|hK|pg||
nt|athene: of course south doesn't know who has the @C3, but surely, if declarer needed a discard he would have taken it when in dummy|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|nt|athene: maybe south just goes along with his partner's line of defence, thinking he would never return a trump if wanting a ruff|pg||
pc|cK|pc|hT|pg||
nt|daman: tilt|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|nt|athene: and hamman goes along with it too for the same reason :)|pg||

nt|jcmax: Especially if you know, partner has both black aces!|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Ivatury would really like a cuebid in diamonds from partner|pg||
nt|chorush: Even the 5 level is too high. Seems like trumps want to break 4-0 a lot so far|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Perhaps he should have bid 4@C first to see if would get one|pg||
mb|6H|nt|jcmax: In a way this deal exemplifies the power of intermediates. with better intermediates in the red suits (10s and 9s) slam would be just so much better!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chorush: This looks like a push at 6H -2 in both rooms|pg||
nt|Walddk2: True Sabine, but Uday can see that he does not have any. Then he needs much "stuff" from partner's diamonds if she does not have a control|pg||
nt|jcmax: Entscho Wladow , who plays for Germany, firmly believes that every set of boards has a "theme". He tries to discover that theme early in the set and then plays accordingly the rest ...|pg||
nt|jcmax: of the set.|pg||
nt|chorush: If that is true, the early theme seems to be "don't rely on suits breaking well"|pg||
nt|jcmax: Actually EW in the other room had much less bidding space available over N's 3@C preempt.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Nickell asks for a review with explanations - 3@c showed 4+ @ds, 4@d was a wiggle of the hand and 4@s was a cue bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, diamonds are 3-2, Ira|pg||
pc|c7|nt|Walddk2: Look on the bright side of life|pg||
nt|jcmax: Yes, ira, that is exactly what Entscho would diagnose and he would bid very cautiously the rest of the match.|pg||
nt|jcmax: Shall we try and see whether he would have been right at the end of 16 deals?|pg||
nt|chorush: He would be better off if diamonds were 4-1 with the stiff king and hearts 2-2:)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I think this is a sensible auction|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Henner has nothing to spare and must pass|pg||
nt|jcmax: there should be 12 tricks in NT, 2@S, 3@H, 2@D and 5@C tricks|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: At the beginning of the match, Uday explained that their opening bids can be very light|pg||
nt|henryb:  @sQ doubleton and @dK onside; friendly clubs|pg||
nt|chorush: feels like somewhat under 10%|pg||
nt|jcmax: If W bids on, I think they are likely to end in @D. it's not so easy to visualize, that NT will play better.|pg||
mb|5C|an|0 or 3 keycards|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: How would you interpret 5@C on this auction?|pg||
nt|henryb:  Henner treated 4N as Blackwood with @d agreed|pg||
nt|jcmax: I believe she is trying to show the @CK, which could easily be a veryvaluable card. As it is.|pg||
nt|chorush: Would depend if you were using minorwood (4D is rKC) or redwood (4H is rkc)|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think many "modernists" would play 4@h as "Redwood" in this auction|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If Uday wanted to set diamonds, he would have bid 4@D over 3NT, would he not?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Henner thought a long time before bidding 5@c, so I don't think she thought 4NT was Keycard|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: But I'm wrong, she now says 5@c showed 0 or 3|pg||
pc|sA|nt|chorush: So they must not play redwood or minorwood|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think a case could be made for passing the W hand in first seat|pg||
nt|chorush: a strong case IMO|pg||
nt|chorush: stronger in 2nd seat than in 1st|pg||
pc|sT|nt|jcmax: The partnership has explained that they open very light. so; i don't think any case can be made for passing the W hand.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: Is this Uday the same person as the BBO manager, I am asked. Yes he is. Not so often you see him on vugraph. His comfortable spot is usually behind the scenes |pg||
pc|c5|pc|s7|pc|s9|pg||
nt|henryb:  He has been playing with Crystal off and on for 20 years or so|pg||
nt|chorush: Crystal is the wife of Roy Welland and the sister of Mary Lou Henner, who plaid Elaine on an old television series called Taxi in the US|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Uday is a fine player in his own right and should play more!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Henner put the screen down to ask something, but I'm afraid I can't hear what|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think she will go down: finessing diamonds is very wrong if S has K fourth of diamonds|pg||
nt|henryb:  But if she plays @dA and another, the third spade will produce a trump loser|pg||
