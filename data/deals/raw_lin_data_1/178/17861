nt|Vugraphzfb: Hi Peter|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chorush: hi Peter|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: 3NT EW here perhaps|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@H 11-18|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: Passed the first test|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT a fair shot with a 6-card suit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Fredin saying he is happier with partner bidding 3NT than hearing a double on his left|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://cavendish.bridgewinners.com/   webcam 1  left=fredin  right=piekarek|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
nt|chorush: now he will need very good luck, and will get it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Really needs @CKx onside as limited entries for 2 finesses|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I could scare you and change the picture for one of myself|pg||
nt|ahollan1: anything but THAT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: OK OK I got the message - too early in the morning|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, then we prefer Fredin after all|pg||
nt|jbennet: i wonder fredin is rely unpredictable|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even Fredin can't find anything fancy here one would think|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|nt|Walddk2: he could|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|nt|jbennet: now THAT was not expected.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as cards lie  doesn't really need @CKx onside   works also if either singleton King  or    RHO @CKxx   because no entry to Piek's @S|pg||
pc|sA|nt|chorush: afraid he did|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Fredin is unhappy with the explanaation he got about the lead|pg||
mc|8|nt|jbennet: (i thought he might have played another spade (if he believed spades 53|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What did he get?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or did i miss a duck in @S that maintained communication??|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Smirnov apologising that partner didnt have what his lead promised|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Not clear what he got but whatever it was itt seems inconsistent with @SAT98x|pg||
pg||
qx|o10|st||md|4S8652HA975DKJ4CKT,S4HT64DAQ9CAQ7653,SJ973HKQD532CJ982,SAKQTHJ832DT876C4|sv|b|mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|jbennet: so what if spades arwere indeed 44|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|Vugraphzfb: This must be music to Wrang|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  9  cohler-seamon 3N +630   levin-weinstein -600|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then he only needs 5 club tricks|pg||
nt|jbennet: then hearts were favourite to be 6-1|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C was forcing, multi-purpose    in this case  weak NT|pg||
nt|jbennet: and club king had dropped anyway on 1st or 2nd club trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S could have been 3 card suit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Lucky for Piekarek that he didnt confirm four by bidding 3@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I have a suspicion that 3NT may be cold anybody have any thoughts|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chorush: well we shall see. I don't see how Wrnag will be able to lead toward dummy enough, but the defense also has t lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2 rounds of hearts and a spade back may beat it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: He may be able to make 4 spades, 1 heart and two tricks in each minor - make the defence keep leading|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But why would Smirnov lead a heart|pg||
nt|ahollan1: cohler-seamon 3@C   schermer-chambers 3@D|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I am going to put a penneth on it making|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Walddk2: :)|pg||
nt|chorush: Well, he did get off to a heart|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Certainly best lead for defence but will set up a heart trick declarer may lose just 1 diamond and three hearts to make 3-1-3-2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why would he lead a heat someone said|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: *heart|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I think that was Walddk some number or other|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Vugraphzfb: Test now for declarer|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Diamond best here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: deep finesse even better|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|pc|cQ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Playing on clubs will work too|pg||
nt|jbennet: i think he should have cashed exactly 1 spade and then go for the clubs Kxx onside.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|d6|pc|cK|pg||
pc|c3|nt|chorush: I don't think playing on clubs will work|pg||
pc|c9|pc|d7|nt|Walddk2: How will it work, David?|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: if Piekarek does not continue spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: needed @C33 with king onside for this line|pg||
nt|jbennet: because now defence is easy cash out all the clubs + King of hearts then return a diamond|pg||
nt|chorush: all defender has to do is cash heart, club and lead diamond|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: What can he continue|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D plays needed a lot too   but would have worked|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Cas his winners and exit a diamond?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Does that not beat it?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|h6|pg||
nt|jbennet: defence errored in not cashing excatly another spade after all south a) ded not lead spade and discouraged. |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: They can endplay dummy to beat this|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|dT|pc|s6|pc|c5|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|nt|jbennet: decalrer should have cashed another spade then go for the clubs.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|pg||
pc|c7|pc|sJ|pc|sT|nt|Walddk2: Endplay for down 1|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: levin-weinstein  -130   [3@D made 4!]    cohler-seamon +110 [3@C=]|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h8|pc|h9|pg||
pc|hT|mc|8|nt|jbennet: that line was in fact automatic (if the clubs were 3-3 then nothing would have been lost. but as in this case 4-2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Yes cashing second spade pitching a diamond was probably enough|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Interesting hand|pg||
pg||
qx|o11|st||md|1SAK83HA7DJT98C986,SJ6HJ96542D654CJ4,ST97HQ3DKQ2CKT532,SQ542HKT8DA73CAQ7|sv|o|mb|1C|nt|ahollan1: multi-purpose, forcing 1@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chorush: If he cashed the second spade pitching a diamond and then proceded as he did, the dummy would still get endplayed with a losing heart|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N 7-10|pg||
nt|jbennet: since he decided to go for the clubs ; cashing another spade could never ever had cost anything. but it could be necessary.  (whicvh indeed it was)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Don't be surprised to see 2@H now|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: seamon DBL 1N with east hand  so cohler in 2@H West       levin in 1N North|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Wrang knows that his hand has been bid too|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and passes sensibly|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: So here we have East with the best hand at the table never having taken a bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: s Fredin|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Making 3 says Fredin asking Smirnov if he really wants to play it out|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Vugraphzfb: Sorry if I am too good says Wrang|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Trust me says Fredin you can ever be too good|pg||
nt|chorush: He is just barely good enough!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Smirnov asks if Wrang would play with him in the next tournament|pg||

nt|ahollan1: yet-another  1@C   but i bet from Piek|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now a psyche, why not|pg||
mb|1C|mb|d|nt|chorush: think may it went pass 1C|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: oh   really was Fredin|pg||
nt|pelu: ok|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: andy payback for not letting him display his mug on webcam|pg||
nt|jbennet: with 4333|pg||
nt|jbennet: and no clue.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: 1NT = 19-21 Wrang writes for me|pg||
nt|jbennet: club lead |pg||
nt|pelu: prob @H-lead from S|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Vugraphzfb: Not a destroying lead for declarer|pg||
nt|chorush: However, no lead was going to beat this|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|d7|pc|dK|pg||
nt|po-s: Smirnov is starting the partnership with Wrang...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Not sure why South wanted North on lead here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ROUND 32: Levin-Weinstein s Cohler-Seamon, Hurd-Wooldridge vs Fleisher-Martel, and Cohen-Smith vs Bessis-Bessis|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: That may be the case for the @DK on trick one|pg||
nt|jbennet: a club lead hadnt made any differnece probably but had forced declare not to be careless|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: And Bessis x 2 vs Cohen Smith|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Ah sorry didnt see the last pairing|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|h5|pc|h9|pg||
nt|pelu: why not @HK = sure entry in dummy for @S-trick|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|jbennet: doesnt matter now east will continue sp kung.'|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|pc|d8|nt|chorush: Since he pretty well knows souths hand, a spade followed by diamonds shoul dmake 4|pg||
nt|jbennet: and then set if his 9th trick inhearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: One of the setting on my webcam is smile control - obviously not written by a bridge player|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: in upside-down world    smile is discouraging|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
