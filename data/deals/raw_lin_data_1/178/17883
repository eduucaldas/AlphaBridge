mb|1H|mb|1N|mb|2N!|nt|daman: 2NT must be some form of @H raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Looks like Rodwell wrote Limit|pg||
nt|daman: like jacoby|pg||
nt|athene: is 1nt a psyche or Comic Notrump?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  is 1NT gardener style - either genuine or a WJO?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: My eyes are not the greatest and there is a terrible glare on the table|pg||
nt|daman: put on your glasses|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: I will try to tell you alerts as best as possible|pg||
mb|3N|nt|yorkbeach:  4@h a good game without @s4-1|pg||
nt|athene: several specs say 1nt is a psyche, not systemic|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: north will feel obliged to bid 5@C now though surely|pg||
mb|5C|mb|d|mb|p|nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  5@c seems cold|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: Hi Krishna|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yup|pg||
nt|daman: frigid|pg||
pc|sK|nt|daman: a good contract    too bad it goes down|pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|nt|athene: three passes then the strong club i imagine|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|athene: hello good evening everyone|pg||
nt|psyck: @c lead likely|pg||
nt|daman: Hi William|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: the ruff sets this normal contract|pg||
nt|psyck: Hi Bill|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|athene: should be a flat board |pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: North asks 3Hearts?|pg||
nt|athene: even if north bid diamonds and got a diamond lead, he could cash the @CA and switch to a spade to beat the contract|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, there were no real alternative in the bidding & defense using standard methods|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H just a normal 3-card limit raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: screen down and Lee asks Hamman a ?|pg||
nt|athene: the only way things might go differently is if an EW pair play 1nt semi-forcing|pg||
nt|athene: but people rarely put their 3-card limit raises into 1NT if it's not totally forcing - they have some other special bid for them|pg||
nt|daman: Lee is seeking a ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Zia asks to see Hamman's convention card has to change something on it|pg||
nt|daman: he will cash the @D Ace    and then  @S K and a @S |pg||
nt|psyck: I do that with several pd's :)  1N NF & the only way for 3 card LR...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Lee is thinking the ace of clubs auto play by the computer when the queen was played|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|daman: Hamman cannot have 4@Ss   (Flannery)|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose someone might take a way-out view and respond 3@C with west if that's an invitational jump shift|pg||
nt|athene: but that would be quite a view with three hearts|pg||
nt|psyck: Yes, I paly 3@c as inv, but denies @h fit|pg||
nt|athene: a spec points out that 3@C is going to go down in practice as declarer will lose two trump tricks - i guess there is no trump coup there|pg||
nt|athene: south would be ruffing in on a heart|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Zia is making out a new convention card|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: hamman does his best to jam the defenders' signals in clubs by concealing the @C3|pg||
nt|daman: someone says EW don't play Flannery any more    I thought I saw them playing it on Sunday|pg||
nt|athene: if playing 3/5th leads, though, north must know declarer can't have a singleton club|pg||
nt|athene: south would not lead the 7 from 108732|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3@d looks like a transfer|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 2nt about 22-23 i think (opening 2nt is 19-21)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3@s looks natural but it has an alert|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  does anyone have a link to a better Meckwell card than the one on the USBF site?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The 2011 USBC will select USA2 for the 2011 Bermuda Bowl to be held Oct. 15-29 in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. USA1, chosen at the 2010 USBC, will be the Fleisher team ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: (Fleisher-Kamil, Levin-Weinstein, Martel-Stansby). |pg||
nt|athene: if any specs are wondering about the director call - yes, psyches are legal, but if a partnership makes a habit of a certain sort of psyche that can be frowned on because they may ...|pg||
nt|athene: build up undisclosed agreements|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: Debbie says   EW announced they play Flannery to the opps     so much for that rumo(u)r|pg||
nt|athene: so not the best trump shift there|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: my guess is roger knows the rules|pg||
nt|athene: so at the very least if e.g. you make a habit of overcalling 1nt with a minor-suit pre-empt, your partner will eventually comes to realise this and opps have a right to know about ...|pg||
nt|athene: it too|pg||
nt|daman: Rodger|pg||
pc|dT|nt|vugraphzfe: std count ? in the middle of the hand|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: std signals and regular smith|pg||
nt|athene: @DJ holding is nice but the contract was never in danger anyway|pg||
nt|athene: four clubs, two diamonds, spade, and declarer can easily build a second heart|pg||
nt|athene: it's just a mild struggle for the 11th trick or so|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|athene: of course south doesn't know who has the @C3, but surely, if declarer needed a discard he would have taken it when in dummy|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: maybe south just goes along with his partner's line of defence, thinking he would never return a trump if wanting a ruff|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|nt|daman: tilt|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North's @d could be better than they are|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: and hamman goes along with it too for the same reason :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: but that was all a bit weird|pg||
pc|sT|nt|yorkbeach:  that is why South was trying to grab the lea|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: ah yes sorry i mis-saw the clubs|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @c finesse is normal with this combo|pg||
nt|athene: of course declarer would not necessarily be finessing the @C10, but still, north has to lead something, and it will help declarer|pg||
mc|10|nt|athene: basically there's no way the contract is going down|pg||

mb|1D!|mb|1H|nt|athene: of course if he had drawn trumps it was still a big view to finesse the @C9|pg||
nt|daman: it is a lot of fun to watch Meckwell play|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|daman: North might enter the arena|pg||
nt|daman: they have very few green cards in their bidding boxes|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: lots of writing|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: but I can not see anything|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  one each?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|psyck: some play transfers on 3 level intervention of 1NT|pg||
nt|athene: a good method to play transfers over a 3@C overcall|pg||
nt|psyck: aah, they do here too|pg||
nt|psyck: only after undo|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  :)|pg||
nt|athene: i have an old convention card for EW which says 2@C is non-forcing here|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: rightsides AND lets you stop in 3 of a major|pg||
nt|psyck: generally shows Inv+ hand on 3@c intervention|pg||
nt|athene: of course, it slightly inconveniences the diamond suit, but who cares about a minor suit anyway?|pg||
nt|athene: but not sure they play that any more|pg||
nt|athene: they do tweak the system fairly often|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphzfe: Chan asking if 3hearts promises 3|pg||
nt|daman: 2@C was probably probably a negative free bid|pg||
mb|d|mb|2S|nt|psyck: 3@h generally min hands, max hand or good fitting hands would bypass 3@h|pg||
nt|athene: i have to say i am a little surprised at 3@H - sure, only 15 hcp, but his cards all look good, so he might have tried game|pg||
nt|daman: first blood to Ivatury   they made 3@H in the OR on board 2|pg||
nt|athene: i guess he feels that 4333 is still the shape that fell into a big vat of ugly|pg||
nt|daman: They may want to take a screen shot of the monitor for posterity|pg||
nt|athene: you mean the moment they were ahead of Nickell?|pg||
nt|daman: yep|pg||
nt|athene: naaa, almost every team is ahead of nickell until the last set|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: and almost none of them after it :)|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  sensible contract|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  4@s would be down even with @s3-3|pg||
pc|h5|nt|daman: looks like another minus for EW|pg||
pc|h4|nt|yorkbeach:  X must show a top @h|pg||
nt|athene: south can happily underlead in hearts to avoid blocking the suit|pg||
nt|athene: after the double of 2@H, showing a top honour|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  could to have partnership trust like that|pg||
nt|athene: maybe @H, @H, trump is best|pg||
pc|h8|nt|psyck: hmm, didn't take them long to get into higher territories|pg||
nt|athene: then they can stop a spade ruff and come to two hearts and two spades|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  though the underlead would be more useful if South had a tenace somewhere|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: screen down and Chan is asking questions|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  did North really play the 8?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: YES|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|d4|nt|psyck: to bad dummy comes up with the wrong pointed King|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|nt|athene: yes, if the lead is 5th best, he knows east can't have a bigger one|pg||

pc|c3|pc|s2|pc|c2|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  leads are 3rd and 5th|pg||
nt|athene: A,K,J,6 are the only ones higher than the 5 and south has to have them all|pg||
nt|athene: of course you have to have trust that partner didn't pull the wrong card :)|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  dod we think 3@c is any game force?|pg||
nt|athene: i guess he feels there is not that much need to bid his minor length honestly as they are very unlikely to want to play in a minor|pg||
nt|athene: especially after south didn't rebid 2minor over 1@S|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if he does not intend to play in spades even when he gets a spade preference, what is the point of 3@c?|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he feels that after being rebuked for the comedy 1nt overcall, it's important to show he isn't feeling bad about things :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I agree with South's 2@h|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c3|nt|yorkbeach:  I know some who believe in raising partner's suit on any hand with 3 trumps and a singleton|pg||

nt|mikam1: In fact slam is basically on a heart finesse...basically because they might split 5-0 :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So way too good for 2NT|pg||
nt|pelu: I would never lead @Cs from that hand|pg||
nt|mikam1: Wow - wouldn't have guessed that high, but it makes sense...all the aces, 54 with great suit, etc.|pg||
nt|mildredb: @HT|pg||
nt|mikam1: Agreed Mildred...big card|pg||

pc|cT|nt|Walddk2: Meck is in 4@H|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|warrens:  still, looking at both hands, what contract would you want to be in?  6@D is almost 50%, but 6@H is much worse given the communication problems|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: some might open 4@S with the 7-4 if NV, but vul i guess 3 is enough|pg||

nt|athene: strong club, 2@C = positive with diamonds|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  system says they need 12 to open when balanced |pg||
nt|athene: 2@D shows hearts|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|athene: meckwell don't play relays - they do just bid suits to try to find a fit|pg||
nt|athene: but they bid artificially to save space|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I understand why responder is making a transfer but why opener?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|athene: well the idea is they think ok, what suits would opener most want to show?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: let's use the lowest bid for that|pg||
nt|athene: and the idea is that opener will more often want to show hearts than diamonds, so they use 2@D to show hearts|pg||
nt|athene: 3@C artficial showing a heart fit and a bad hand i think, just steps|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  you need a good memory to play the EW system :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: playing with the 5 hearts|pg||
pc|h9|pg||

nt|athene: finessing the trumps gains against KQx or Hx onside, loses only to singleton honour offside|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|Vugraphzfb: Katz wrote something long that included "to play" - Nickell said "penalty"|pg||

nt|mikam1: Well, you know Meckwell...boring|pg||
nt|fabsayc: henner could redouble now to suggest hearts, but probably wont|pg||
nt|mikam1: Perhaps if Christal was going to run, she might have bid 1N as takeout|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikam1: Then after presumed double, she could always bid 2@D|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Sorry - didn't notice I hadn't put in Henner's pass - Nick has been thinking|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: sort of an extension of the 2nt scramble showing two places to play, here actually 3|pg||

mb|p!|nt|athene: not sure if chan had a weak 2-suited opener available - you would expect him to use it if so|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: and struck the Mother Lode|pg||
nt|daman: Meckwell are deadly when they get involved in their stong club auctions|pg||
nt|athene: i think it's strange for south to overcall this time but not on the previosu hand|pg||
nt|athene: he should definitely have come in last time, in my opinion|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  better suit this time|pg||
nt|athene: if everyone would only agree to pass meekly whenever you opened a strong club, there would be no doubt it was the best method|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  perhaps he did not have a way to show a 3 suiter|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  is pass 0-4?|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: I will fix the results in a minute|pg||
nt|athene: declarer's only concern here is whether to fiddle around for overtricks|pg||
nt|athene: stayman, 3nt, and a lead problem for rodwell|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: 1@D can be as short as two so he won't be all that eager to lead one|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: slight risk opps might run the minors if you do that, i suppose|pg||
nt|athene: ok, no problem now|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: with both spades right i don't see how declarer can have a problem here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  did well to avoid @c lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: 4th best upside down count and attitude and I didn't hear if they play any smith|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|nt|athene: sometimes you rise with the @SK on the second spade - but only if you think west has @SQxx and you want to block the suit|pg||
nt|athene: and that's impossible here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer might have to guess whether East has Q10 or AQ|pg||
nt|daman: good lead by Rodwell|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: screen down|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  likley to get righton bidding|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the clue is that South has denied a major|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can cash the @DQ and then lead the jack|pg||
nt|athene: and when west follows, he can overtake as east is known to have 2+ diamonds|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West assumes that North has hearts because he can see only 2@h|pg||
nt|athene: so they must be breaking when west follows to the second one|pg||
nt|daman: he's not going down in this contract|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if he takes the @c finesse, the extra entry will be a mixed blessing|pg||

pc|c9|pg||
pc|dK|pc|h3|pc|c5|nt|athene: with some strong clubbers you couldn't be sure east didn't have a singleton diamond|pg||

nt|athene: declarer might be lining up to go down here - i wonder if he took the @SQ at face value ( no @SA) and hence thinks the club finesse is a sure thing?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes but wont East have to break the @s at the end?|pg||
nt|athene: yes rodwell should have kept more clubs i think|pg||
nt|daman: has to be tough to be  juniors up against this pair|pg||

nt|athene: well south in the other room passed too|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  presumably South's system did not suit is hand|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|athene: reasonable auction - north doesn't have great shape facing hearts but with 7 hcp you have to do something|pg||
nt|athene: if the @C5 were a little heart i think he would have bid 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: well, declarer is wondering if he should finesse the @H10|pg||
nt|daman: he has HCP and a bit of shape but his suits are feeble|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|athene: normally 2-suiters with a 5-card major sort of fall into the hands you can bid, don't they?|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h4|nt|athene: if your only concern is making 5 heart tricks then yes you do, but it's rarely that simple|pg||
nt|athene: basically if you finesse hearts and it loses, that's a huge disaster - you are totally dead|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, I doubt he will finesse with chances in black suits|pg||
nt|athene: but you might try to fiddle around|pg||
nt|athene: and make tricks in the black suits|pg||

nt|daman: not on this side of the pond     we are not afraid to defend|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h5|pc|h8|pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: he leaves diamond right to the end and may eventually lead to the @H10 as a last desperate chance|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if you are just playing 2@c  majors and everything else natural, South has no good bid|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|nt|athene: leaves heart right to the end sorry|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: now he knows he needs nine tricks without using the spades at all|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|athene: well if you have a singleton, you normally expect partner to lead it, but admittedly when it's a singleton king that is less of a disaster maybe|pg||
pc|h9|pc|c4|nt|psyck: but he does not get black suit count, so may well play for drop|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: still i would not want to pass this out|pg||
mc|9|nt|yorkbeach:  Rodwell is making serverla more tricks than in the other room|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2@s would have no great success|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: break|pg||

nt|athene: 3@H is forcing quite high with no guaranteed fit, but south no doubt is working on the principle that "if opps have a fit, so do we!"|pg||
nt|athene: 3@S sorry|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Lee puts hand down and reaching for bidding box|pg||
mb|d|nt|daman: EW are now playing Frannery for sure|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: Lee keeps raising his hand to the bidding boxes|pg||
mb|5D|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: north obviously assumes that 43@S by a passed hand has to have a diamond fit|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Lee just spilled his glass of water so that produce a jump to get out of the way|pg||
pc|h8|nt|yorkbeach:  I would assume that too :)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: if opps have a 9-card fit, you are guaranteed to have at least an 8-card fit yourself|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: of course finding it might be another matter :)|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|athene: ah, the old "spill your water and in the confusion change the contract to 3@DX" trick|pg||
nt|daman: like Ed Norton would do|pg||

nt|athene: draw trumps then ace and a club?|pg||
nt|athene: you have to assume the @SK is wrong|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West did double 4@s|pg||
nt|athene: partly because of the bidding but also because the defence were so eager to draw trumps|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  good point|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: play will restart at 3:45 here|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: 30 minutes left in this segment|pg||

nt|athene: i guess he didn't fancy it with only 3 hearts|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  EW had the system to play in 2@c in the other room|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: So hard to see their cards as the hold them where their hands cover them|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|4D!|nt|daman: all roads lead to 4@S on this one|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  splinter|pg||
mb|4N|nt|athene: NS's card say they lead king for unblock or count, and ace for attitude|pg||
nt|daman: do weall agree with 2@H?|pg||
nt|athene: maybe south's lead of the @HA suggested to hamman he would not have quite such good hearts|pg||
nt|daman: playing 2/1?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  would they be playing this as precisely 1@d with some other bid to show a void?|pg||
nt|daman: oh wow|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: ? by Chan to Rodwell|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  good thing E has 7 cards in the minors :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Lee reaches for box|pg||
nt|daman: 4NT is a very perilous bid|pg||
mb|d|nt|yorkbeach:  500 as cards lie|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: strange, Zia made a limit raise with 3 card Major support via forcing 1NT earlier this session|pg||
nt|psyck: he did not like his 3 @h rags & 4333 hand here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but East could be less suitable|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: most 2/1 auctions would be 1@H - 1NT - 2@H - 3@H|pg||
nt|athene: interesting that meckstroth passes there|pg||
nt|daman: Meck might have bid 5@C|pg||
nt|athene: rather than bidding 5@D|pg||
nt|athene: 5@C sorry|pg||
mb|5C|mb|d|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  rather than passing?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: well i don't know their exact agreements|pg||
nt|daman: it doesn't matter what you like and don't like    you still need to bid your hand|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he feels that with equal length rodwell will redouble|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: okay lets see if I can get all the plays here|pg||
nt|athene: and if rodwell has 6@D-5@C he will bid 5@D and that will be preferable?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Meckstroth has left the room|pg||
nt|daman: so has Elvis|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  smoking break?|pg||
nt|daman: yes    he smokes|pg||

nt|athene: south might have arrived at a spade lead by a process of elimination, i suppose|pg||
pc|d5|nt|psyck: 3NT = I have about 13 cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Hamman is writing notes to Lee  but I can't see what he is asking|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt might be a bit more scientific than just that|pg||
nt|athene: it might be actually showing a 4red bid but also offering a safe to partner if he is very pure|pg||
nt|athene: offering a save to partner|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|athene: whereas if zia had just bid 4@D or 4@H right away that might be simply trying to jam the auction and not suggesting a save|pg||
nt|daman: on Board 11    EW are in 5@D|pg||
nt|daman: in the OR|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Hamman has gotten up and left the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Zia asks what happen|pg||
nt|athene: hamman thinks he is dummy in 3nt?|pg||
nt|athene: seems unlikely :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: 10 minutes left|pg||
nt|athene: leading from four-card suits headed by the ace isn't all that appealing|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|nt|athene: i am not a huge fan of this sort of bidding (3nt then 5@D)|pg||
nt|athene: just bid 5@D first time, take a bit of room away|pg||
nt|psyck: I would guess that they will stop in 6 here|pg||
nt|daman: he is trying tio create some action|pg||
nt|athene: against very innocent opponents you can sow some confusion, maybe even get yourself doubled in 4@D|pg||
nt|athene: but asking a bit much to find innocence in this event?|pg||
