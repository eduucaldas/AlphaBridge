mb|p|mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=5+@C |pg||
nt|chorush: I have no idea if 3 spades is a splinter but if it is, it seems ideal|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S!|an|Splinter|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: they couldn't have done it without you Ira|pg||
nt|chorush: whatever rkc is seems appropriate|pg||
nt|chorush: probably 4D, maybe 4 clubs|pg||
mb|4D|an|RKC !C's|nt|ahollan1: Grue bid with east hand   declaring 1@SX|pg||
nt|chorush: well he will show a profit over 7 clubs; that is certain|pg||
mb|d|mb|4S!|an|1KC + !D control|mb|d|nt|ahollan1: Stewart treats 5th @C as Queen  opposite known 5+suit|pg||
nt|chorush: I think he just showed one key Al, but not certain|pg||
nt|pelu: RD = 1 control?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfp: Results of the 3rd session only with 1 round to go   http://cavendish.bridgewinners.com/index.php?option=com_content&id=203|pg||

mb|5H!|an|!DK|mb|p|nt|chorush: 5 diamonds is reask, probably showing all controls accounted for. If so, stewart may bid 7|pg||
mb|5S!|an|Looking for !HK|nt|ahollan1: or if only one step gained and   pass/rdbl says something about @S|pg||
mb|p|mb|5N!|an|No !HK, yes to !SK|mb|p|mb|6C|nt|ahollan1: Grue's 1@SX only -300 so shows gain against GAME|pg||
nt|ahollan1: uh oh|pg||
nt|vugraphzfp: The alerts I've typed is what I have from Woolsey/Schermer's side|pg||
nt|chorush: they seem to have messed up the responses. If they got them right Woolsey would have bid 7|pg||
nt|pelu: 6 bidding-rounds -and looks like some misunderstanding|pg||
nt|pelu: but N can still overrule partner and bid 7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems to me  when Woolsey makes grand slam try  Stewart shouldd just go|pg||
mb|p|mb|7C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chorush: Despite Grues result, if they languish in 6 clubs they will lose a fair number of imps|pg||
