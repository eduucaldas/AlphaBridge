nt|rv: yes Barbara, but technically not forcing beyond 3@c|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|babs59: agree|pg||
nt|psridhar: can grand make here rv?|pg||
nt|babs59: this is another potential grand slam|pg||
nt|babs59: need to get the hearts right|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|psridhar: there is gud chance u may get trump lead from South:)|pg||
nt|psridhar: in 7@H|pg||
mb|4C!|mb|p|nt|rv: yes, double dummy, after this 3@c bid by Kamal likley to be made single dummy if bid|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|babs59: Archie took the super safety play to ensure 6H tho|pg||
nt|psridhar: i think NRK will drive to grand here|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|babs59: H2, H4, H5...|pg||
mb|5H|nt|babs59: in case South held  QJ43 in trumps|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S!|nt|psridhar: in grand Iyengar will be 'brutal' B :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: not available in 7H, of course - you just have to get them right|pg||
nt|rv: after 3@c bid, it is odds on to make|pg||
nt|psridhar: wats 5@s?|pg||
nt|rv: this pair may not have discussed what 5@s and 5n mean here?|pg||
nt|psridhar: help wanted for grand?|pg||
nt|babs59: so how do you play this 5S bid, given HQ already denied?|pg||
nt|babs59: what would it mean for you PS and/or RV?|pg||
nt|psridhar: i play 5@s as puppet to 5N to show non-serious grand try and direct 5N as serious grand try|pg||
nt|rv: I play first available bid after keycard ask as queen ask if applicable, else specific kings|pg||
nt|babs59: I play as puppet to 5NT and then you bid where you need help for grand...|pg||
nt|rv: if both are not applicable, then 3rd round control for GS|pg||
nt|psridhar: often u face that problem -need to inform pd all keys avlble and u cant count 13 tricks|pg||
nt|babs59: RV, the HQ already denied|pg||
nt|rv: yes, so specific king ask|pg||
nt|babs59: I still play 5NT for specific kings|pg||
mb|7H|nt|psridhar: rv/B- i have done some research on this- the frequency of need to inform pd "all keys but i cant count 13 " is > need to know specific king|pg||
nt|babs59: seems it is undiscussed, most likely|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar: 11 handy imps to Azure|pg||

nt|jain: small slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|sga1: India Blues starts with 10 imps C/O because of their wins over Azure in Double Round Robin.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|rv: at end of RR1, at this point looks like India Blues vs Azure finals, still 4 more rounds to be played|pg||

nt|ritong: amazing auction|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|jain: is he contemplating to bid 7 or is the connx slow|pg||
mb|6H|nt|sga1: 2NT for minors. Although this is an Intermediate Hand (most play as weak or strong) but for Puneet u can't say.|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: hi & welcome all|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: I presume Gadgil should X this with strong nt variety since Sridharan could have even 10 hcp|pg||
nt|andyv:  rarely do you see both sides playing 2NT|pg||
nt|sga1: Not a good bid.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|sarkar_suk: 3 nt for east west  can make as the card lies :)|pg||

mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|rv: great comeback by Azure, they were nearly down 54-0 three quarters into first segment|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|p|mb|1H!|nt|psridhar: this power relay may lose the @s suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: looks like Iyengar has agreed to play jackson relay with NRK|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|psridhar: no doubt SKi is intending to show his hand as bal 20-21|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|babs59: I think 4S could have failed in CR if they'd switched diamonds after first 3 tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar: 3nt may suffer a set -@h lead and @c shift|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: ok normal super-precision relay here, Iyengar has possibly upgraded his hand to 21-22|pg||
nt|babs59: HA  CK  CA  - diamond  now you have no entry to dummy after 2nd trump|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s9|pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sK|nt|psridhar: no reason to rule out KJXXX in @h with pd|pg||

nt|jain: hi all hi sarkar|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: hi nirmal welcome :)|pg||
mb|1C|nt|jain: last hand W needed to act over 2h for sure but fail to understand why he didnt |pg||
nt|jain: shd b an easy 4 s|pg||
mb|p|nt|sarkar_suk: i think some actiones needed from west on prev deal is it not nirmal with 10 high card pts with 6-4 in minors :)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ritong: he will be disappointed i guess|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: oh ofcourse nirmal|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sga1: Score corrected to -2|pg||
nt|jain: 5h seems a good sacrifice for sure|pg||
nt|jain: but sry trumps r 41 |pg||
mb|1S|mb|1N|nt|ritong: not to win 4 imps|pg||
nt|sga1: NS were entitled for +140 or +170, so loss of 4 imps for Azure max|pg||
nt|alok_daga: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome Alok and Sudhir|pg||
nt|sga1: Hi alok|pg||
nt|jain: nd wld b bid by w|pg||
nt|jain: not easy to finesse spade with @D entry as @D r 4 1|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|alok_daga: the last brd shud be a pick up of 8 IMPS|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: declarer has 8 top tricks with @D suit fetching 4, has to struggle for 9th|pg||
mb|p|pc|hJ|pc|h9|nt|alok_daga: HI Sudhir|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sarkar_suk: yes nirmal 5 @H is good save for east west here :)|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|sga1: Double Dummy Lead of @h A defeats the contract. Can Kamal find it?|pg||
nt|alok_daga: again why not a 4spades?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sga1: He is taking his time. makes the normal lead.|pg||
nt|sga1: Still loss of 1 IMP, only 9 tricks against 4@s making.|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|nt|rv: might have been better to play @SQ and run @DQ|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|nt|andyv:  duck?|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c5|pc|cQ|nt|alok_daga: maybe seeing 52 cards I am commenting but club lead not v inspiring|pg||
nt|jain: i guess E shd bid it as he knows big fit nd a secondary 5c card suit |pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sK|nt|andyv:  9@d should be suit preference|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s4|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d5|pc|dJ|pc|d2|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s5|mc|10|nt|sga1: Now 10 tricks a possibility.|pg||

nt|sarkar_suk: hopefully :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|sga1: He is thinking for void Splinter perhaps|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: Dipak Poddar's regular pd Jitu Solani is in his 50s and hence can't play seniors event|pg||
nt|sga1: Yes it comes, any void splinter.|pg||
nt|alok_daga: void ,4trumps i guess as per their methods|pg||
nt|sga1: 4@c asks, 4@d shows @D void.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|andyv:  poor young kid|pg||
nt|alok_daga: no grand will not be bid with sp Q missing|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|alok_daga: wc 2 Mr Satish Modi|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: Agarwal's regular pd Anand Samant is possibly busy with organizing event|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  this should make 4 easily|pg||
nt|rv: scores at end of Day 1 and RR-1, india blues 86, azure 85,  poddar dev 46 and cabal 42|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rv: there are 5 teams in fray, 5 rounds of 12 brds to be played each day, each team gets a bye and plays only 48 brds which is norm for senior events|pg||
nt|alok_daga: anti %grand Sudhir|pg||

nt|rv: double dummy not very sure, in my view after first 2 tricks declarer can always play for 1 down adopting any civilized line|pg||
nt|babs59: heart contract for NS here?|pg||
nt|psridhar: double dummy surely d1 only but at tbl the position Kamal reached, he needed @h in hand to get set up|pg||
nt|psridhar: anyway we are within 6 imps of striking distance|pg||
nt|babs59: if they play hearts (low enough) here, India Blues will recover a few IMPs|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|rv: NRK'S raise to 7n on brd 47 may come back and haunt Azure in final analysis|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|babs59: or 1S :)|pg||

nt|andyv:  EW can actually make 5@d|pg||
nt|ritong: so, south would do well not to repeat his suit|pg||
nt|rv: India Blues represented by for india blue ashok ruia, archie sequeira, v m lal, subhash gupta & kamal roy|pg||
nt|ritong: assuming west picks 1NT as his first bid|pg||
nt|rv: Azure represented by Hooda (Capt), puneet gangal, kirubaramoorthy, S.K Iyenger, Arun jain and Sunil bhatia|pg||
nt|rv: Subhash Gupta playing for Blues in senior event after losing Open trials with Formidables against DSM|pg||
nt|rv: Kirubakaramoorthy is President of BFI and playing for Hooda's team Azure|pg||
nt|rv: at this moment it is looking like Azure and Blues in tomorrow's finals unless one of these teams really have a move on|pg||
nt|alok_daga: 24 hcp will they stay out of game?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ritong: what would you do after 1@d 1@s with west?|pg||
mb|d|nt|jain: 3s is the par but guess 4s can make on a non club lead or shift|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|andyv:  2@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|andyv:  of course, since 1@d can be as short as 1, 1N probably saner course|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|ritong: down 2 offhand, and counting|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  strange the at both tables, EW couldn't get to 3N or 5@d|pg||
nt|alok_daga: Gud pass Puneet|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  3N is a stretch, but some number of @ds should be reasonable|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar: 6NT= if u have 16 i hv enuf for slam; 7NT= hey i hv more :)|pg||
nt|rv: if he had gone through gamma, further bids would be epsilon which wouldn't be best strategy|pg||

nt|babs59: perhaps they weren't systemic, just brutal?|pg||
mc|12|nt|rv: I think NRK's 2n instead of 2@s gamma was well judged, his 7n wasn't:)|pg||
