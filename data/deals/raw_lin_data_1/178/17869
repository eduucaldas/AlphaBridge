nt|drewsky: Except white vs. red, many players like to have a good suit to premmpt at the 3 level (including moi)|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C!|nt|arobson:  Semi-psyche from East to deter N-S|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|kareno: Equal vulnerability and the threat of slam I think kept it low.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|arobson:  Heart lead will kill 3NT with the ace ofgfisde|pg||
nt|arobson:  But N might dbl 3@S|pg||
mb|d|mb|3N|nt|arobson:  Right, much depends on South's lead - whiuch major?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Hearts until that specious double.|pg||
mb|5D|nt|chorush: in fact 13 imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|arobson:  He will still be tempted to lead a heart, only needs the ten opposite|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: But 5@d is a bid too far.|pg||
nt|arobson:  Ah. This has three fatal flaws (two them non-fatal, the third...)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfp: Weinstein was in the middle of asking Lev questions but Lev insisted on putting the bids back into the boxes to lead already|pg||
