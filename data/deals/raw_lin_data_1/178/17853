mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|d|mb|1S|mb|2C|nt|warrens:  makes 3nt here, though it's not clear if you should play for 4-4 spades or Kx of @C onside|pg||
nt|henryb:  Cohler did not like his @h spots for a 1N overcall|pg||
nt|robinswr: support double here|pg||
mb|d|mb|r|nt|warrens:  now it's clear not to play for 4-4, so if they can get to 3nt, should make it|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3H|nt|robinswr: i think you should make a support double no matter what's your strength|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gosia: why not 1NT overcall by Cohler - or is that Berlin- for the minors :) |pg||
nt|robinswr: cohler probably did not like his heart spots but he did have four of them|pg||

nt|robinswr: a+ result for ew|pg||
nt|gosia: too tired :)|pg||
nt|warrens:  since he can't hold enough @H and @D + the one @S|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|robinswr: one doesn't need a stopper to bid notrump|pg||
mb|p|pc|hK|nt|jcwla: Could see lots of final contracts on this one, from @C or @H partials to various levels of NT.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|robinswr: lots play 2nt as forcing, overcaller retreats to 3clubs with minimum|pg||
pc|h6|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|d|mb|p|nt|robinswr: i like to treat the 1nt response as an opening notrump and use my notrump defense against it|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: Event website: http://cavendish.bridgewinners.com/   Also live table pictures updating every two minutes|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|robinswr: so i would have to bid 2@c |pg||
nt|robinswr: showing a takeout double|pg||
nt|robinswr: its against the Law for woold to pass this|pg||
nt|robinswr: the opponents have an 8-card heart fit |pg||
mb|p|pc|dK|nt|robinswr: not a LAW-ful pass|pg||
pc|d3|nt|warrens:  would you bid 2@S or X? or something else Steve?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jcwla: Seemingly a double should do it.  Can't be extras as would have redoubled.  Without the fourth @S could make a matchpointy 2NT takeout.|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|d2|nt|robinswr: you don't get good results when the opponents play at the 2-level in an 8-card fit|pg||
pc|dA|nt|robinswr: i play double as penalties so i would bid 2spades|pg||

nt|robinswr: if you follow the LAW you'll be right more often than wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: next round we will have hurd wooldridge  vs fleisher  martel|pg||
nt|robinswr: 2nt balancing by south would show 5@d and 3@c|pg||
