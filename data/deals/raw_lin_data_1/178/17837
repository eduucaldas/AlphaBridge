nt|alok_daga: anti %grand Sudhir|pg||

nt|rv: Subhash Gupta playing for Blues in senior event after losing Open trials with Formidables against DSM|pg||

nt|alok_daga: 24 hcp will they stay out of game?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ritong: what would you do after 1@d 1@s with west?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jain: 3s is the par but guess 4s can make on a non club lead or shift|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|andyv:  2@s|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  strange the at both tables, EW couldn't get to 3N or 5@d|pg||
nt|alok_daga: Gud pass Puneet|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  3N is a stretch, but some number of @ds should be reasonable|pg||
