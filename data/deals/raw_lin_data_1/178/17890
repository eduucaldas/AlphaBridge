nt|daman: Zia/Hamman play 2/1   with Flannery :)|pg||
nt|daman: I am not familiar at all with the NS pair|pg||
nt|andyv:  that's a dirty word among certain Danes living in England, George|pg||
nt|daman: Roger Lee is a junior from Cal Tech|pg||
nt|daman: Chan is also from Cal Tech|pg||
nt|daman: as was Julius Robert Oppenheimer|pg||
nt|daman: EW carding is attitude|pg||
nt|daman: this may be the first time NS have played together|pg||
nt|daman: Welcome back everyone|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  good afternoon friends and colleagues across the pond|pg||
nt|daman: NS are a new partnership   |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  good evening fellow Europeans |pg||
nt|athene: hi good evening everyone|pg||
nt|daman: EW have a complex system    we will try to keeppace with it'|pg||

nt|daman: re Bill     Hi Julian|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Hello we are back and ready to go|pg||
nt|daman: EW have a mini Flannery|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Ew are playing http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=743&pid=210|pg||
nt|daman: to begin|pg||
nt|davidstern: Hi All|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: I have confirmed that Roger Lee is the first place team for the U26 to represent the US in the World Juniors|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: So after the excitement of the Cavendish we are down to the US Teams Trials|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Hi David was just yesterday and your back in Aussie already :)|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|daman: 2NT must be some form of @H raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Looks like Rodwell wrote Limit|pg||
nt|daman: like jacoby|pg||
nt|athene: is 1nt a psyche or Comic Notrump?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  is 1NT gardener style - either genuine or a WJO?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: My eyes are not the greatest and there is a terrible glare on the table|pg||
nt|daman: put on your glasses|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: I will try to tell you alerts as best as possible|pg||
mb|1D|nt|yorkbeach:  4@h a good game without @s4-1|pg||
nt|athene: several specs say 1nt is a psyche, not systemic|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: north will feel obliged to bid 5@C now though surely|pg||
mb|d|nt|davidstern: 4@S EW seems possible|pg||
nt|benjent: Hi everybody, welcome to segment 4 of the USBC round of 16|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|davidstern: Not in Aus yet in Phoenix leaving tomorrow|pg||
nt|benjent: Scores through segment 3 are at http://www.usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2011/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof16|pg||
mb|3N|nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  5@c seems cold|pg||
nt|davidstern: This will fail by one trick but not much compensation for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: Hi Krishna|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yup|pg||
nt|daman: frigid|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: a good contract    too bad it goes down|pg||

pc|c3|nt|tejjyid: Hi all|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: still, it's reasonable for NS to end in 5@C somehow or other in the other room|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d7|nt|davidstern: I cant imagine that West bid 2@S or that East would pass that|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I guess maybe East got to make a T/O double at some stage|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi all|pg||
nt|tejjyid: maybe West downgraded his hand becasue of the @H values|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Lee leans in and Hamman says I have problems|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|pc|dK|pc|c6|pg||
nt|davidstern: Th defence scored their diamond ruff for -2 and 200 which will compensate a spade partscore but nor a game if it is bid and made|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|c8|pc|s2|pc|s9|pg||
nt|benjent: Meckstroth has to ditch his @c guard ... which is ok because Henner can't get to the board|pg||

nt|othered1: Zia has an interesting call here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: probably 3nt, the alternative seems to be 5@D, is anything else possible|pg||
nt|othered1: 3N likely requires 9 running tricks.  Pass will get a nice penalty, but is far from automatic, since among other things, partner won't have a trump to lead|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|athene: three passes then the strong club i imagine|pg||
nt|davidstern: Declarer may make 2-1-2-4 tricks here depending on the view he takes in clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: upside down count and attidtude|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: hello good evening everyone|pg||
nt|psyck: @c lead likely|pg||
nt|daman: Hi William|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|psyck: the ruff sets this normal contract|pg||
nt|psyck: Hi Bill|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi all:)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Hi Phillip|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Marshall|pg||
nt|davidstern: Hi Marshall, Andrew and others|pg||
nt|davidstern: And Andy|pg||
nt|andyv:  some work to be done here but favorable location of @c suit should help N get thru this|pg||
nt|benjent: Good result for Nickell ... 3@s is going to dribble off, but NS have a (mildly fortunate) game on|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|nt|athene: should be a flat board |pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: North asks 3Hearts?|pg||
nt|athene: even if north bid diamonds and got a diamond lead, he could cash the @CA and switch to a spade to beat the contract|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, there were no real alternative in the bidding & defense using standard methods|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H just a normal 3-card limit raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: screen down and Lee asks Hamman a ?|pg||
nt|athene: the only way things might go differently is if an EW pair play 1nt semi-forcing|pg||
nt|athene: but people rarely put their 3-card limit raises into 1NT if it's not totally forcing - they have some other special bid for them|pg||
nt|daman: Lee is seeking a ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Zia asks to see Hamman's convention card has to change something on it|pg||
nt|daman: he will cash the @D Ace    and then  @S K and a @S |pg||
nt|psyck: I do that with several pd's :)  1N NF & the only way for 3 card LR...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Lee is thinking the ace of clubs auto play by the computer when the queen was played|pg||
pc|hA|nt|daman: Hamman cannot have 4@Ss   (Flannery)|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose someone might take a way-out view and respond 3@C with west if that's an invitational jump shift|pg||
nt|athene: but that would be quite a view with three hearts|pg||
nt|psyck: Yes, I paly 3@c as inv, but denies @h fit|pg||
nt|athene: a spec points out that 3@C is going to go down in practice as declarer will lose two trump tricks - i guess there is no trump coup there|pg||
nt|athene: south would be ruffing in on a heart|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Zia is making out a new convention card|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|athene: hamman does his best to jam the defenders' signals in clubs by concealing the @C3|pg||
nt|daman: someone says EW don't play Flannery any more    I thought I saw them playing it on Sunday|pg||
nt|athene: if playing 3/5th leads, though, north must know declarer can't have a singleton club|pg||
nt|athene: south would not lead the 7 from 108732|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3@d looks like a transfer|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 2nt about 22-23 i think (opening 2nt is 19-21)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3@s looks natural but it has an alert|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  does anyone have a link to a better Meckwell card than the one on the USBF site?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The 2011 USBC will select USA2 for the 2011 Bermuda Bowl to be held Oct. 15-29 in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. USA1, chosen at the 2010 USBC, will be the Fleisher team ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: (Fleisher-Kamil, Levin-Weinstein, Martel-Stansby). |pg||
nt|athene: if any specs are wondering about the director call - yes, psyches are legal, but if a partnership makes a habit of a certain sort of psyche that can be frowned on because they may ...|pg||
nt|athene: build up undisclosed agreements|pg||
pc|h6|nt|andyv:  hi David|pg||
pc|hK|nt|davidstern: So this will lose to the jack and then running the @C7 will ensure 4 club tricks and the contract|pg||
pc|h2|nt|daman: Debbie says   EW announced they play Flannery to the opps     so much for that rumo(u)r|pg||
nt|athene: so not the best trump shift there|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|daman: my guess is roger knows the rules|pg||
nt|athene: so at the very least if e.g. you make a habit of overcalling 1nt with a minor-suit pre-empt, your partner will eventually comes to realise this and opps have a right to know about ...|pg||
nt|athene: it too|pg||
nt|daman: Rodger|pg||
nt|davidstern: Nice careful play in the club suit by declarer|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphzfe: std count ? in the middle of the hand|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: std signals and regular smith|pg||
nt|athene: @DJ holding is nice but the contract was never in danger anyway|pg||
nt|athene: four clubs, two diamonds, spade, and declarer can easily build a second heart|pg||
nt|athene: it's just a mild struggle for the 11th trick or so|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c4|pc|sT|nt|athene: of course south doesn't know who has the @C3, but surely, if declarer needed a discard he would have taken it when in dummy|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: maybe south just goes along with his partner's line of defence, thinking he would never return a trump if wanting a ruff|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|nt|daman: tilt|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North's @d could be better than they are|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: and hamman goes along with it too for the same reason :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: but that was all a bit weird|pg||
nt|benjent: Rodwell would like to stop South from ruffing, but with no entry to the board, he couldn't get enough spades out of the way fast enough|pg||
pc|c5|nt|yorkbeach:  that is why South was trying to grab the lea|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|athene: ah yes sorry i mis-saw the clubs|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @c finesse is normal with this combo|pg||
nt|athene: of course declarer would not necessarily be finessing the @C10, but still, north has to lead something, and it will help declarer|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: basically there's no way the contract is going down|pg||
pc|d6|pc|sJ|pc|s6|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s9|pc|s7|pc|c6|pg||
nt|benjent: As it happens, Rodwell has a deep @h loser anyway|pg||

nt|andyv:  a good score for NS|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|vugraphzfe: someones cell phone just went off|pg||
mb|2D|nt|athene: of course if he had drawn trumps it was still a big view to finesse the @C9|pg||
nt|daman: it is a lot of fun to watch Meckwell play|pg||
mb|p!|nt|daman: North might enter the arena|pg||
nt|daman: they have very few green cards in their bidding boxes|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: lots of writing|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: but I can not see anything|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  one each?|pg||
nt|davidstern: A nobody can make much hand|pg||
mb|2H|nt|davidstern: Here|pg||
nt|andyv:  N may run to 2@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: some play transfers on 3 level intervention of 1NT|pg||
nt|athene: a good method to play transfers over a 3@C overcall|pg||
nt|psyck: aah, they do here too|pg||
nt|psyck: only after undo|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  :)|pg||
nt|athene: i have an old convention card for EW which says 2@C is non-forcing here|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: rightsides AND lets you stop in 3 of a major|pg||
nt|psyck: generally shows Inv+ hand on 3@c intervention|pg||
nt|athene: of course, it slightly inconveniences the diamond suit, but who cares about a minor suit anyway?|pg||
nt|athene: but not sure they play that any more|pg||
nt|athene: they do tweak the system fairly often|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzfe: Chan asking if 3hearts promises 3|pg||
nt|daman: 2@C was probably probably a negative free bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: This is one of those all-fall-down partscores|pg||
mb|3C|nt|psyck: 3@h generally min hands, max hand or good fitting hands would bypass 3@h|pg||
nt|athene: i have to say i am a little surprised at 3@H - sure, only 15 hcp, but his cards all look good, so he might have tried game|pg||
nt|daman: first blood to Ivatury   they made 3@H in the OR on board 2|pg||
nt|athene: i guess he feels that 4333 is still the shape that fell into a big vat of ugly|pg||
nt|daman: They may want to take a screen shot of the monitor for posterity|pg||
nt|athene: you mean the moment they were ahead of Nickell?|pg||
nt|daman: yep|pg||
nt|athene: naaa, almost every team is ahead of nickell until the last set|pg||
nt|tejjyid: surely not..that woudl be a shocking bid|pg||
nt|davidstern: 2@H quickly looks like -1|pg||
nt|marlowepi: need to stand ground in those situations....default is for E to bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl is take out|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: and almost none of them after it :)|pg||
nt|davidstern: 2-1-1-2 as a minimum loss|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: No one is making much of anything, and the trick is not to be left holding the baby at the end of the auction|pg||
mb|p|pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|yorkbeach:  sensible contract|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  4@s would be down even with @s3-3|pg||
nt|davidstern: On the first Board EW did in fact bid and make 4@S and 6 imps to Ivatury|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Sorry pd says Meckstroth and thanks by Rodwell|pg||
nt|benjent: Especially when you're vulnerable ... |pg||
pc|h5|nt|daman: looks like another minus for EW|pg||
nt|davidstern: Against the 3@H at this table -2|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  X must show a top @h|pg||
nt|athene: south can happily underlead in hearts to avoid blocking the suit|pg||
nt|athene: after the double of 2@H, showing a top honour|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  could to have partnership trust like that|pg||
nt|athene: maybe @H, @H, trump is best|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|psyck: hmm, didn't take them long to get into higher territories|pg||
nt|athene: then they can stop a spade ruff and come to two hearts and two spades|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  though the underlead would be more useful if South had a tenace somewhere|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: screen down and Chan is asking questions|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  did North really play the 8?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: YES|pg||
nt|andyv:  I was talking about N's dbl|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|psyck: to bad dummy comes up with the wrong pointed King|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: yes, if the lead is 5th best, he knows east can't have a bigger one|pg||
pc|h6|nt|benjent: Meckstroth's red suit holdings argue quite strongly against balacing. Sorry is a fair call :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|psyck: oh, dec, i thought they were in 6@d|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|hK|nt|davidstern: Excellent switch needed before declarer can get dummy's diamond loser away on spade|pg||
pc|hT|nt|yorkbeach:  leads are 3rd and 5th|pg||
nt|athene: A,K,J,6 are the only ones higher than the 5 and south has to have them all|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  dod we think 3@c is any game force?|pg||
nt|athene: i guess he feels there is not that much need to bid his minor length honestly as they are very unlikely to want to play in a minor|pg||
nt|athene: especially after south didn't rebid 2minor over 1@S|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if he does not intend to play in spades even when he gets a spade preference, what is the point of 3@c?|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he feels that after being rebuked for the comedy 1nt overcall, it's important to show he isn't feeling bad about things :)|pg||

nt|ritong: wow|pg||
mb|2H|nt|benjent: That's some serious cojones by Ivatury|pg||
nt|ritong: indeed|pg||
mb|3C|nt|athene: ten tricks on a very fortunate black-suit layout|pg||
nt|athene: strong club, 2@C = positive with diamonds|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  system says they need 12 to open when balanced |pg||
nt|athene: 2@D shows hearts|pg||
nt|benjent: Red, square, and both opponents bidding. And both opponents known to have itchy trigger fingers|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: meckwell don't play relays - they do just bid suits to try to find a fit|pg||
nt|athene: but they bid artificially to save space|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I understand why responder is making a transfer but why opener?|pg||
nt|davidstern: Diamond Diamond and heart through may get the defence an extra trick|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 3NT a more creative bid by SOuth|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with no disrespect to Ivatury team, playing against Nickell it could prove very beneficia; to open 4S with S hand. no need to tell me how it could work out badly instead|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: not more effective though...|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: well the idea is they think ok, what suits would opener most want to show?|pg||
nt|davidstern: So this is boards 31 to 45 of a total 120 boards|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: let's use the lowest bid for that|pg||
nt|athene: and the idea is that opener will more often want to show hearts than diamonds, so they use 2@D to show hearts|pg||
nt|athene: 3@C artficial showing a heart fit and a bad hand i think, just steps|pg||
nt|benjent: Helpful lead ... Henner a good shot to drop the @cq now|pg||
nt|mildredb: this works in her favor - won't finesse now|pg||

pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Now he is shaking his head and hum|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: opens hand and closes hand and now reopening|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer cannot pick up the trumps without blocking the @d|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: leaning on the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: playing with the 5 hearts|pg||
nt|andyv:  contract normal enough|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h5|pc|cT|nt|tejjyid: OK, a shaper spectatro points out that after 3 rounds of @D this is cold|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  so long as diamonds are no worse than 4-2, declarer can give up a heart|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|nt|davidstern: Declarer played this correctly as the cards lie but would have egg on his face of East had @HK-5|pg||
nt|davidstern: Yes as West would be endplayed on a club towards dummy|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: finessing the trumps gains against KQx or Hx onside, loses only to singleton honour offside|pg||
nt|tejjyid: right - personally I think not being in 4@H is poor bidding, but it's certainly hard to get there|pg||
nt|davidstern: No doubt Rodwell will cash @HK|pg||
nt|davidstern: Yes 4@H could be cold while 4@S could fail on any 4-2 spade break|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|daman: that is his plan|pg||
nt|tejjyid: exactly - but it's tough to shake off a solid-ish 7 card suit|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|athene: yes, just give up a trump to make sure you can run the diamonds without interruption|pg||
nt|davidstern: Dont anybody doubt that the @HK will be cashed he is just thinking|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s2|pc|h3|pc|s3|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h6|nt|athene: this is basically the one time you want to lose a tempo to draw the master trump|pg||
nt|athene: or the most common time by far anyway|pg||
pc|h7|nt|yorkbeach:  still 10 tricks even if @d were 5-1 - miscounted|pg||
nt|athene: you can't afford to have the defender ruff in and strand the winners in dummy|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|benjent: So let's give Ivatury some credit. East is a passed hand, and West's 1@d is limited. So he knows his side probably shares the values, and he's the one with (relative) shortage, so ...|pg||

mb|p|nt|daman: correct|pg||
nt|ritong: go Uman go go|pg||
nt|benjent: Some hidden punishment for Rodwell too ... opening his 10 count got his opponents bidding. At the other table, everyone passed their 10 count|pg||
nt|benjent: Crazy, I know, but it does happen from time to time :)|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|daman: S is counting points for distribution|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: not sure if chan had a weak 2-suited opener available - you would expect him to use it if so|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|daman: and struck the Mother Lode|pg||
nt|daman: Meckwell are deadly when they get involved in their stong club auctions|pg||
nt|athene: i think it's strange for south to overcall this time but not on the previosu hand|pg||
nt|athene: he should definitely have come in last time, in my opinion|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  better suit this time|pg||
nt|athene: if everyone would only agree to pass meekly whenever you opened a strong club, there would be no doubt it was the best method|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  perhaps he did not have a way to show a 3 suiter|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  is pass 0-4?|pg||
nt|benjent: 1NT is 14-16|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: well, he can use his imagination then :)|pg||

nt|mildredb: I was taught it as GF|pg||
nt|mildredb: oh|pg||
nt|mildredb: I was way off|pg||
nt|benjent: The 4-1 @h break is going to stop Henner from cashing up all of her @s winners, which she has to be able to do to get rid of all her @d losers|pg||
nt|ritong: meck has a natural beat if he reads the position|pg||
nt|benjent: EW can't play @d from either side, so they're going to have to be patient|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: slight risk opps might run the minors if you do that, i suppose|pg||
nt|athene: ok, no problem now|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: with both spades right i don't see how declarer can have a problem here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  did well to avoid @c lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: 4th best upside down count and attitude and I didn't hear if they play any smith|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: sometimes you rise with the @SK on the second spade - but only if you think west has @SQxx and you want to block the suit|pg||
nt|athene: and that's impossible here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer might have to guess whether East has Q10 or AQ|pg||
nt|daman: good lead by Rodwell|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: screen down|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  likley to get righton bidding|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the clue is that South has denied a major|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can cash the @DQ and then lead the jack|pg||
nt|athene: and when west follows, he can overtake as east is known to have 2+ diamonds|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West assumes that North has hearts because he can see only 2@h|pg||
nt|athene: so they must be breaking when west follows to the second one|pg||
nt|daman: he's not going down in this contract|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if he takes the @c finesse, the extra entry will be a mixed blessing|pg||
nt|athene: he will surely lead a heart to the king first|pg||
nt|daman: automatic|pg||
pc|s2|nt|yorkbeach:  declarer can hold up in @c anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: reverse smith|pg||
nt|daman: passed the first hurdle :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  rehi|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vugraphzfe: rehi|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lots of problems here|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h8|pc|hK|pg||
nt|ritong: he goes for a kind of mixed strategy|pg||
nt|benjent: 3rd @s has two advantages ... may get a trump promo, and may kill a crucial trick|pg||
nt|benjent: Henner will be thinking "cool, I can draw trumps ending on the board, cash some @s's and get the @d's right"|pg||
nt|benjent: then she'll be thinking "no way is that Meckstroth defending so softly if that's working ... hmmm"|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|c3|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: ok, he doesn't feel he needs two dummy entries|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South not as trusting of EW as he was of his partner|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  like that in a partner - trust me rather than oppo|pg||
nt|marlowepi: curse of scotland perhaps ill-advised|pg||
nt|marlowepi: = @D9|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|c7|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: with some strong clubbers you couldn't be sure east didn't have a singleton diamond|pg||
nt|athene: but meckwell play 2@D to show a 3-suiter, singleton/void diamond|pg||
nt|benjent: Interesting choice|pg||
pc|dK|nt|marlowepi: spec points out that nine of D may have been chosen to preserve the beer card|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
nt|benjent: An option was to stop after 2 rounds of @h and lead a @s winner to ditch the @cK|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|nt|daman: the table are pitching Clubs|pg||
nt|daman: is*|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  more testing if West keeps clubs|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might be lining up to go down here - i wonder if he took the @SQ at face value ( no @SA) and hence thinks the club finesse is a sure thing?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes but wont East have to break the @s at the end?|pg||
nt|athene: yes rodwell should have kept more clubs i think|pg||
nt|daman: has to be tough to be  juniors up against this pair|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: is everyone still awake|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: four of us are yawning|pg||
nt|athene: if declarer takes the club finesse, then he will know who has the @SA :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if West has the @sA, he could have the @s10 too|pg||
pc|d8|nt|vugraphzfe: the flies would have been sad|pg||
nt|andyv:  I'm sure that was the main reason|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|athene: ok, heart to king and another heart, let the defence do something in a black suit|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  low @s from E?|pg||
nt|daman: he is on the right road now|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he hopes meckstroth came down to @HAx, when there is no more worry|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this event is not the Beer Trials though|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|nt|andyv:  down 2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: unauthorized info here, when Meckstroth has to open 1D but doesnt want the suit led, he plays as "East"|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|athene: of course declarer might have felt very silly if the @CK were onside and rodwell had @SA10 :) but all in all i think he took a good line to try to avoid having to guess|pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: zia will surely move here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  NS are playing a 14-16 1NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  if NS weren't vul, would have invited with the S hand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: ok, they play transfer into opp's suit as stayman?|pg||
nt|benjent: NS make a few spades, but Ivatury may find it hard to stop|pg||
mb|3S|nt|psyck: this is probably a stayman w/o stopper|pg||

mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  so 1@c shows 17+ if balanced|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  do we know what 1@h shows?|pg||
nt|ritong: correct auction identical to hamzia's one|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphzfe: Zia says try for one plus score|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: yes, he can take three spades, @HAK, one in each minor, but that's all he ought to get|pg||
nt|psyck: guess he is not happy that there are no scores on their side, but they have not had any really bad boards yet|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Lee asks Hamman NT range?|pg||
nt|athene: on the other hand the defence might not realise that diamonds are declarer's weak spot|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  1@c is Precision style (RM)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  whatever (RM) means|pg||
nt|athene: rm usually means rodwell mecsktroth|pg||
nt|marlowepi: see ? no D lead:)|pg||
nt|benjent: I play 3@s there as GF, and Ivatury may also, but Henner definitely doesn't :)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||
nt|athene: RM-precision is their form of strong club|pg||

nt|mildredb: no dif what Rodwell does here|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|daman: they are trying to make a statement|pg||
nt|athene: (X of 1@H tends to really have 4 cards in both unbid suits, yes really)|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|daman: they picked up 7 IMPs on Board 6  |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  or did it just show 3@h?|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|nt|yorkbeach:  XX showed the 3@h|pg||

nt|psyck: true, well judged|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: i imagine zia will win in dummy and run the @S10|pg||
nt|daman: seems logical|pg||
nt|athene: rodwell underleads three honours because declarer has length in the suit|pg||
nt|athene: so he doesn't want to block them if his partner turns up with something useful |pg||
nt|athene: of course meckstroth has just signalled with a heart which might potentially prove useful for leading through declarer :)|pg||
nt|athene: but maybe he has decided he is never getting in, so it can't really cost|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a bit surprising S did not bid game|pg||
nt|davidstern: Spade to dummy and run @D10|pg||
nt|davidstern: OK I know I can see all four hands|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think laying clubs first is more likely|pg||
nt|davidstern: The @H9 was very indiscrete by Meckstroth|pg||
nt|andyv:  9@h may turn out to be costly|pg||
nt|davidstern: Tick|pg||
nt|athene: 7 hcp not enough to bid game on its own but those are some nice club spots that might well play a part in 3nt|pg||
nt|davidstern: That @H9 is a very surprising card indeed now stops defence from cashing four hearts|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i wasnt counting walrus points, but looking at D queen, potentially huge, and the nice club potnetial|pg||
nt|davidstern: Silverstein Leads Wolfson by 3|pg||
nt|athene: sure, @DQ isn't any old doubleton queen|pg||
nt|marlowepi: only if E could get in would it make a difference|pg||
nt|davidstern: That @DJ shouldnt be discounted|pg||
nt|andyv:  match tied up as 3N was made in OR|pg||
nt|davidstern: Or the club jack for that matter|pg||
nt|benjent: In a sense, Henner's might have been the better shot, giving EW a bit of room to talk themselves out of game. Nothing doing here of course|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|psyck: a faily lucky 12 tricks with @sQx|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: now all three of meckstroth's jacks are potential entries and he might be regretting that @H9|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if he hadnt spent the jack, declarer might have palyed differently|pg||
nt|marlowepi: spade pictures in dummy mean declarer will have the transport to perform avoidance against E knaves|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so reasonable for E to believe he wouldnt be getting in|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|psyck: *fairly|pg||

mb|d|nt|athene: you could say something loud like "please put that king with the rest of your clubs, it looks so untidy"|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@c generally a mixed raise in competition|pg||
nt|athene: if north jump raises Meckstroth might start picturing ideal 6-counts opposite|pg||
nt|athene: like, @DAQ|pg||
nt|athene: and get excited|pg||
mb|p!|nt|psyck: (if so, 7-9 5 card @c here)|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H is forcing quite high with no guaranteed fit, but south no doubt is working on the principle that "if opps have a fit, so do we!"|pg||
nt|athene: 3@S sorry|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Lee puts hand down and reaching for bidding box|pg||
nt|andyv:  7@h or 7@d here|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: asking what is x|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dont think he needs a jumpby foe to get excited|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: EW are now playing Frannery for sure|pg||
nt|daman: not*|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  is everyone bidding 4@h with the East cards?|pg||
nt|daman: sure|pg||
nt|Walddk4: scores of all matches after 1st segment   http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2011/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof16|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Lee keeps raising his hand to the bidding boxes|pg||
nt|benjent: Zia made the only bid in the OR - a slightly off-centre  but eminently sensible 3rd seat 1NT|pg||
mb|2D|nt|benjent: 1NT openings have a useful pre-emptive effect - even strong 1NT's|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: will he just give this a sixth, or try 5@S along the way?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in this situation, is 5N GSF?|pg||
nt|athene: no-one ever seems to use 5nt as GSF any more - it's always "pick-a-slam"|pg||
nt|benjent: EW can make 2-3@h, and maybe as much as 4@s if everything goes well|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|athene: north obviously assumes that 43@S by a passed hand has to have a diamond fit|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Lee just spilled his glass of water so that produce a jump to get out of the way|pg||
mb|4H|nt|yorkbeach:  I would assume that too :)|pg||
nt|athene: also known as "this auction has gone seriously off the rails, i don't have a clue what to bid" :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: shows one ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if opps have a 9-card fit, you are guaranteed to have at least an 8-card fit yourself|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: of course finding it might be another matter :)|pg||
nt|athene: ok, 5@S is exclusion keycard|pg||
nt|ritong: ...?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Ivatury is asking a ?|pg||
nt|ritong: ah|pg||
nt|benjent: Rodwell's a bit unlucky here. He's vul with a sound opener, so he's always angling for game after Meckstroth opens|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: whatever it was the answer was NO|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: ah, the old "spill your water and in the confusion change the contract to 3@DX" trick|pg||
nt|daman: like Ed Norton would do|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Ivatury set his hand down and now can't find it|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: useful bid to have available|pg||
nt|athene: meckwell think that slams mostly just need a keycard ask and some sort of exclusion - they don't cue all that much|pg||
nt|marlowepi: cues give specific info|pg||
nt|marlowepi: cues help leader|pg||
nt|marlowepi: cues good for bidding cold slams|pg||
nt|andyv:  this one just needed support ..interesting that @h suit was never mentioned by E|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Rodwell says nice hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: bad for making ones that hang in the balance|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphpl3: thank you for being with us, that's all for today|pg||
nt|vugraphpl3: we'll be back tomorrow at 9 AM (teams)|pg||
nt|vugraphpl3: goodnight:)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if I am reading the EW card rightm, they lead 3rd and low|pg||
nt|mildredb: lol|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|benjent: Once pard has no @d stopper, he suspects game is probably going down, but improve Meckstroth's @h holding a tad and 4@h is fair|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|nt|psyck: true, NS did well to find it in spite of opps taking auction high|pg||
pc|d3|nt|daman: http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=743&pid=210|pg||
nt|athene: interesting decision for lee|pg||
nt|athene: draw trumps then ace and a club?|pg||
nt|athene: you have to assume the @SK is wrong|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West did double 4@s|pg||
nt|athene: partly because of the bidding but also because the defence were so eager to draw trumps|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  good point|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: leads 3/5  Meckstroth says yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: play will restart at 3:45 here|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: 30 minutes left in this segment|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Rodwell cannot really duck the @s because Meckstroth could hold the @cA rather than the @cK |pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: time here is 2 :30|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d9|pc|dT|nt|athene: i guess no reason not to just take the spade finesse|pg||
nt|marlowepi: when would he mention it?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|athene: not sure i would have doubled 3@S with east - i would be worried partner would be passing it too much|pg||
nt|benjent: "director, I counted my cards and got to zero" :)|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|nt|athene: and rodwell can't really duck it|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|psyck: the other table also stretched to 3N on deal 8 on slim values|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugraphzfe: I can not see Rodwell's pitches|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Meckstroth says okay|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s7|pc|s4|pc|s8|pg||
pc|s6|nt|benjent: no point playing the 2nd @h ... he'll just get shortened again|pg||
nt|benjent: This line aims to rub out the @c finesse. Or put some positional pressure on Henner's trump holding|pg||
nt|benjent: Or both|pg||
nt|mildredb: seems like all roads lead to -1|pg||
pc|c2|pc|sK|pc|sT|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pc|c8|nt|benjent: Yeah, sometimes you just have to accept your fate and try to minimise the pain|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|benjent: Ivatury probably wondering if anything he does can lead to pard getting caught in a trump coup|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|benjent: As it happens, the answer is no, but it's certainly worth thinking it through|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: We have sorted hand again|pg||
nt|athene: this is an EW auction|pg||
nt|psyck: Thanks Debbie, for bringing the table to life :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: double makes sense if you are willing to pass 3N. |pg||
nt|andyv:  by opening 1@c is how the @h suit didn't get mentioned|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Meckstroth says he love "your bid"|pg||
nt|mildredb: any word on result on bd 54?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Rodwell asks if pass is forcing, yes , what would you have done?|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: Rodwell is going to find the auction on this board ... disappointing|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: good to have an agreed partnership style for these sort of situations - do you "only leave these doubles in with a massive trump stack" or "leave them in with any balanced hand" or ...|pg||
nt|athene: anything in between?|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Lee is asking Meckstroth his shape on the last hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  only leave them when it's right:)|pg||
nt|athene: yes, that's a good rule|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: 3@C mixed raise, i imagine|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|athene: now zia might just go with the gentle 3@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but he decides to push it a bit|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: I wonder what X was. I guess it wasn't majors, or Henner would have bid 2@s over 1NT|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: of course rodwell had a lot of bids that pretty much have to be heart raises there|pg||
nt|athene: given he couldn't say anything over 1@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: some one just went arrrgh very loudly in the room|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: i don't know if 2@H is an artificial force or just a bit of invention to buy a tempo in a future 3nt|pg||
pc|s8|nt|psyck: 2@h a lead non directing bid?|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  neither side find their best fit|pg||
nt|benjent: Discouraging @s8|pg||
nt|mildredb: i would guess majors - does seen strange Cristal didn't bid 2@S if it was|pg||
nt|benjent: Henner will now hate everyone single one of her choices.|pg||
nt|benjent: She has to lead something up to declarer, she doesn't know what, and anything she does could be giving away the contract|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|nt|vugraphzfe: 2 hearts is more or less game force|pg||
nt|athene: west has a pretty good hand facing rebiddable diamonds|pg||
nt|daman: Nickell takes the lead for the first time|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West suspects @s are not breaking|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  hard to see what else you do but knock out the @cA|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Rodwell says sorry|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  are all the apologies typical?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: no|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||
nt|benjent: I expect there was a shoulder shrug just before the @d shift|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: he doesn't need much from partner for 3nt to have a good chance|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, has to try at vul|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphzfe: regular smith|pg||
nt|athene: hamman will run the diamonds and then take the spade finesse i guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Sorry it is difficult to see both Rodwell and Meckstroth's cards|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  NS play standard count but do not always give it|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: MR have 4 tricks and CL have 4|pg||
pc|dT|pc|h6|pg||
nt|daman: seems logical|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, not much options for declarer here|pg||
nt|athene: i don't see how he will be sure enough the @SK is wrong not to give it a go|pg||
nt|athene: as it's the only sensible chance to make the game|pg||
nt|psyck: having discouraged with @h2, N now Smiths to show interest as he has 4 @h's|pg||
nt|psyck: sry, will Smith on @d's|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|marlowepi: is that a legal call?|pg||
nt|andyv:  well this will be over quickly|pg||
nt|andyv:  perhaps E should have cashed the A@h before giving the ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Rodwell looks at his watch and says sorry|pg||
pc|dK|nt|yorkbeach:  surely East played a high club|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|pc|s5|pg||
nt|daman: did he reall do that? |pg||
nt|daman: y|pg||
nt|benjent: Rodwell will play this out just in case NS want to endplay themselves and give him an 8th trick|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|psyck: hmmm, quite a view to duck @c|pg||
nt|athene: i don't believe it|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: YES|pg||
nt|athene: ok ok :)|pg||
nt|daman: geez|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Lee is using his finger on the table to count|pg||
nt|athene: you feel silly if they now run the hearts and the @SK was right all the time|pg||
nt|athene: but hamman might be reasoning|pg||
nt|psyck: Smith Echo - high low in suit played by declarer = I like your lead pd.  Reverse Smith is Low-High|pg||
nt|athene: that if south had the @HAKJ and @SK he would often be doing something over 1@D|pg||
nt|daman: he would feel very rueful|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Meckstroth says what took so long what are you playing around|pg||

pc|hJ|pg||
nt|mildredb: that is only if bd 54 was a push|pg||
pc|c9|nt|daman: Ivantury retook the lead|pg||
nt|daman: NS were in 4H and not 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: katz-nickell failed to bid 3nt :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Chan has his fingers on the ten of spades|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: now has put it back|pg||
nt|daman: My Mother would cah the setting trick|pg||

nt|athene: i guess he didn't fancy it with only 3 hearts|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  EW had the system to play in 2@c in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: if he had 3-4-4-2 he probably would have done|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: So hard to see their cards as the hold them where their hands cover them|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mildredb: can't get any more exciting than this |pg||
mb|1N|nt|daman: all roads lead to 4@S on this one|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  splinter|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: NS's card say they lead king for unblock or count, and ace for attitude|pg||
nt|daman: do weall agree with 2@H?|pg||
nt|athene: maybe south's lead of the @HA suggested to hamman he would not have quite such good hearts|pg||
nt|daman: playing 2/1?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  would they be playing this as precisely 1@d with some other bid to show a void?|pg||
nt|daman: oh wow|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: ? by Chan to Rodwell|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  good thing E has 7 cards in the minors :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Lee reaches for box|pg||
nt|daman: 4NT is a very perilous bid|pg||
nt|athene: double single-suited?|pg||

mb|2D!|nt|yorkbeach:  500 as cards lie|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: can't see what is written|pg||
nt|athene: normal to treat 6-4 as 1-suiter especially if the long suit is a major|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: strange, Zia made a limit raise with 3 card Major support via forcing 1NT earlier this session|pg||
nt|psyck: he did not like his 3 @h rags & 4333 hand here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but East could be less suitable|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: wave of the hand on this alert|pg||
mb|2H|nt|daman: most 2/1 auctions would be 1@H - 1NT - 2@H - 3@H|pg||
nt|athene: interesting that meckstroth passes there|pg||
nt|daman: Meck might have bid 5@C|pg||
nt|athene: rather than bidding 5@D|pg||
nt|athene: 5@C sorry|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: north is wondering if his partner is really serious|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  rather than passing?|pg||
nt|athene: in which case he might want to consider something like 2nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: another shake of the hand|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|benjent: Hamman-Zia could check for a @s fit, but there isn't one, so no matter|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: yes PDT|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: well i don't know their exact agreements|pg||
nt|daman: it doesn't matter what you like and don't like    you still need to bid your hand|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he feels that with equal length rodwell will redouble|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: okay lets see if I can get all the plays here|pg||
nt|athene: and if rodwell has 6@D-5@C he will bid 5@D and that will be preferable?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Meckstroth has left the room|pg||
nt|daman: so has Elvis|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  smoking break?|pg||

pc|dT|pc|s6|pc|s2|nt|othered1: would you really lead the ace on this auction?|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s9|nt|fabsayc: has to smoothly unguard spades or keep Ax in clubs|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h7|pg||
nt|barnets: no|pg||
nt|fabsayc: unblocking hearts as well|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the defense is still ok, still the unblock could not cost|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|fabsayc: he may lead club but does not work if defense alert|pg||
pc|h3|pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|s4|nt|barnets: 4 more imps for ivatury|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: last board of this section|pg||
nt|daman: Zia is an old rubber player    most rubber player would bid 2@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: asks how much time left in this segment|pg||
nt|andyv:  I like N's actions because it shows that they are playing their game and not being influenced by the opps.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: all laugh when says 42 minutes|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: this is the final board of this session|pg||
mb|1C|nt|davidstern: On the hand where 4@S failed with East on lead giving partner heart ruffs in the OR South was declarer so no heart lead for ruff and 13 imps|pg||
mb|1H|nt|psyck: Last deal.  Thanks Bill & George.  Good job Debbie.  Thanks to the kibs for joining us & for their inputs.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|yorkbeach:  and almost back to where we started with the score|pg||
nt|davidstern: Last hand of this segment hence the laughter|pg||
nt|benjent: Ivatury's @c9 was just checking to see if Meckstroth wanted to ruff and blow a trump trick. Meckstroth knew Ivatury had nothing but @h's left, so nothing to gain from ruffing|pg||
mb|3H!|an|bad|nt|daman: here is the vugraph sked for future sessions     http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|athene: south might have arrived at a spade lead by a process of elimination, i suppose|pg||
nt|athene: yes zia decided his 14 count really wanted to be a notrump|pg||
nt|benjent: This is the last board of the set and the day, and takes us to halfway in the match|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: 3NT = I have about 13 cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Hamman is writing notes to Lee  but I can't see what he is asking|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt might be a bit more scientific than just that|pg||
nt|athene: it might be actually showing a 4red bid but also offering a safe to partner if he is very pure|pg||
nt|athene: offering a save to partner|pg||
nt|davidstern: Official website http://www.usbf.org/|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Chan is opening and closing his hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|athene: whereas if zia had just bid 4@D or 4@H right away that might be simply trying to jam the auction and not suggesting a save|pg||
nt|daman: on Board 11    EW are in 5@D|pg||
nt|daman: in the OR|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Hamman has gotten up and left the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Zia asks what happen|pg||
nt|athene: hamman thinks he is dummy in 3nt?|pg||
nt|athene: seems unlikely :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Lee says to Zia he's tired of you|pg||
nt|psyck: 5@d should be ok, 1@s, 1@d losers|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: All are laughing |pg||
nt|athene: 7@S isn't such a bad contract is it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Security is very tight in this room|pg||
nt|psyck: that 5@d comment was about deal 11 other room of course|pg||
nt|daman: that's what I said   5@D in the OR|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: He'ss back|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Hamman says "he's sorry"|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: 10 minutes left|pg||
nt|athene: leading from four-card suits headed by the ace isn't all that appealing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: usually 74 should lay in the long suit. not keen on N bidding plan here|pg||
nt|andyv:  with no @d control this will stop at 4@h|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS may continue|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: The US U26 team for the U26 Championship in Coratia has been decided following an online tournament and will be Roger Lee - Dan Wolkowitz plus Jeremy Fournier - Mitch Towner plus ...|pg||
nt|davidstern: Kevin Dwyer - Owen Lien|pg||
nt|athene: lee might decide the double showed a club raise, in which case he will bid 5@C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: club raise? what clubs had been bid to raise?|pg||
nt|davidstern: Here are the entries http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_entries&event=20&task=list|pg||
nt|andyv:  the dbl of 4@c|pg||
nt|davidstern: 15 teams entered|pg||
nt|athene: a raise of north's putative club suit :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Lee points to club to Meckstroth and when ask the x shows the 4 spade bid|pg||
nt|benjent: The next 4 sets start in  14 hours|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: i am not a huge fan of this sort of bidding (3nt then 5@D)|pg||
nt|athene: just bid 5@D first time, take a bit of room away|pg||
nt|psyck: I would guess that they will stop in 6 here|pg||
nt|daman: he is trying tio create some action|pg||
nt|athene: against very innocent opponents you can sow some confusion, maybe even get yourself doubled in 4@D|pg||
nt|athene: but asking a bit much to find innocence in this event?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Lee keeps reaching for bidding box|pg||
nt|daman: he wishes he could ask for aces|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: grabbing the box now|pg||
nt|davidstern: Here the scores for all the round of 16 matches before this set http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2011/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof16|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  would rather lead a major than minor|pg||
nt|andyv:  i guess the support wasn't good enough|pg||
nt|davidstern: A trump lead will make this a little painful|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  this could go for 800|pg||
nt|athene: if 4nt over 4@H would have been offering minors then 5@C should be a strong statement i.e. 6 or 7 clubs|pg||
nt|athene: but i guess no-one really knows what 4nt over 4@H would mean|pg||
nt|davidstern: Most people play 2 places to play but here???|pg||
nt|andyv:  or xruff (cash A@s first)|pg||
nt|andyv:  6@c goes only for 500|pg||
nt|davidstern: Club ruff spade to the ace and another club ruff spade ruff and now a trump|pg||
nt|davidstern: Problem then is that the spade and diamond seven are both entries|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Lee is shaking his head|pg||
nt|andyv:  so I hate to admit but Marshall seems to be right to not liking N's actions|pg||
nt|davidstern: As noted Might be hard for W to imagine void when opps pulled from @C to @D...|pg||
nt|davidstern: But on the @SA lead suit pref from East may guide defence|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: Now Zia is thinking|pg||
nt|daman: a successful operation by EW|pg||
nt|psyck: N chooses a practical option with no sure means of investigating anything else|pg||
nt|daman: if Zia pushed them to the Grand Salami?????       fireworks will start|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Zia picks up his cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Rodwell asks if this is showing 4 spades of Ivatury|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzfe: CLAIM|pg||
nt|daman: we have to remember    NS is not an established partnership    we need to cut them some slack|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think it's easy and most natural lead|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|davidstern: What is?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Rodwell and Chan are talking to each other|pg||
pc|hA|nt|daman: see you for the next session|pg||
nt|psyck: they could have tried something different maybe, thet they were in unknown territories|pg||
nt|psyck: *but they...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: There is 22 minutes left in this round and there will be a 10 to 15 minute break|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: thanks by Chan|pg||
nt|davidstern: I think we will see the spade 2 from Meck|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|nt|marlowepi: there are downsides to 3C opener but it also has upsides. nothing clear there. but over 1H the X was opening a can of worms.  the whole N bidding plan reflected a thirst for play ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in spades. but esp when the hand is weak i am a firm adherent  of Reese's dictum "swans should play in the long suit"  (swan = 74 shape)|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cQ|nt|yorkbeach:  feel the same about four-card suits with ace but do not like Jxx either|pg||
pc|cK|nt|davidstern: That will likely be the same in their methods|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|pc|s7|pc|c4|pg||
pc|d3|nt|benjent: Thanks to my fellow commentators Mildred & Henri, and our excellent operator Debbie|pg||
nt|mildredb: Thanks Ben |pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Thanks BBO and USBF for having us experience this event see you tomorrow|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|davidstern: @DJ now and another trick for the defence|pg||
nt|davidstern: -1100|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|nt|davidstern: Sorry no more -800|pg||
nt|benjent: Nickell grab the lead back on the last|pg||
