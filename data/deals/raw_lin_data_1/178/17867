mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@H may be transfer showing @S     or  @H & @S|pg||
mb|3N|nt|robinswr: one reason why i don't like DONT is that you play 2@h  if partner is 3-3|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Drew -  how do you and Jim play 2@H over mini-NT ??|pg||
pc|h3|nt|robinswr: i wonder if Kit will lead his sides 5-card suit?|pg||
nt|robinswr: this lead will probably bid it since declarer has to duck this|pg||
nt|kareno: If Kit had the heart jack, ducking would be essential.|pg||
nt|robinswr: i don't see any other play for his 9th trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzfp: screen down - stewart asking L'Ecuyer about something and I can't see the handwriting|pg||

nt|robinswr: Kit doesn't attack from four card suits he leads thru strenght or tries to find partner's long suit  |pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h9|pg||
nt|robinswr: amazing ( what is he going to do for his 9th trick)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kareno: I don't understand the duck.|pg||

nt|kareno: Shows five. :)|pg||
nt|robinswr: I play 2@h is either spades or spade shortness depending on what i do next|pg||
nt|kareno: Honestly I do.|pg||
nt|robinswr: 2@h followed by 3nt shows a singleton spade|pg||
nt|kareno: That's sensible too.|pg||
nt|robinswr: 2@h followed by 3@c shows a stiff spade and clubs|pg||
