mb|3H|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|poohbear: Brogeland Ventin playing for session prize|pg||
nt|poohbear: Hi karen|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kareno: Heart, club, heart could produce a problem for declarer.|pg||
nt|kareno: No, I take it all back :)  n & south would be void in hearts by then :)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|pc|h6|pc|h4|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d2|nt|poohbear: coffee break hand. the defense to scare declarer would be . Win the @h cross to a @c and back a @h then a third @h but thats totally dbl dummy since West would try for @c ruff|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|kareno: No problem, he'll just take ten tricks.|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|h3|pc|s4|pc|sT|pg||

mb|1S|nt|poohbear: for those who abide by the law of total tricks , he should bid to 3 lvl|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|3C|nt|poohbear: I suspect Smith just raises to 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: i meant|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: and sure enuf|pg||
nt|kareno: I'd be bidding 3@h to show four spades and a raise to two spades.  But with the threadbare holdings, I can't argue with Smith's view of the hand.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pc|s6|pc|s2|pg||
nt|poohbear: and the vul|pg||
nt|poohbear: Dont want South saving over 4@h|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, that too, Barry.  |pg||
nt|poohbear: personally I would make a To dbl with east|pg||
nt|poohbear: over 2@s|pg||
nt|poohbear: no reason not to bring @ds into the picture|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pc|s4|pc|c3|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|kareno: East concerned about a partner with a weak hand and diamonds but that east hand is a fine dummy for diamonds as well - would you double, 2@s Barry?  I would.|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|poohbear: 5@ds would make on a non trump lead|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|d7|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cJ|pc|c5|pc|c9|pg||

nt|kareno: Any minor suit partial okay for e/w|pg||
nt|poohbear: so a decent result for NS who stay out of trouble as wel|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|poohbear: interesting choice by Brogeland|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|an| |nt|poohbear: I wonder what their NT range is|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|poohbear: in the US dbl shows 4 @ss not sure how these europeans treat it|pg||
nt|kareno: Have to assume it does not include 15|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hA|nt|poohbear: Smith has 4 aces to cash|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|pc|h3|pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|nt|kareno: This looks a little Kokish-y|pg||
nt|poohbear: at least thats how its treated in US|pg||
nt|poohbear: they may switch|pg||
mb|3S!|mb|p|nt|poohbear: 3@s minor suit stayman|pg||
nt|vugraphzfp: oops sorry Ron Smith doubled 2@S|pg||
nt|kareno: So he's treated this as balanced|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfp: Boye staring at the whole auction trying to think what is happening|pg||
nt|kareno: They may be on different wavelengths|pg||
nt|poohbear: This seems pretty normal to me. Question is does Boye's hand merit a slam try in @hs|pg||
nt|kareno: I thought he had shown a balanced hand with more hcp???|pg||
nt|poohbear: I would expect partne rto have long @hs |pg||
nt|vugraphzfp: Brogeland could be thinking why his partner didn't bid 3@H with long hearts|pg||
nt|poohbear: If he had good hand for minors he would just bypass 3NT |pg||
nt|poohbear: and bid a minor|pg||
nt|poohbear: If he doesnt he bids 3NT even with a 4 card minor|pg||
nt|poohbear: so this has to show @hs|pg||
nt|poohbear: in my humble opinion|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|poohbear: of course easier to work it out from here and not when 10's of thousands of dollars on the line|pg||
nt|kareno: Brogeland seems to have reached the same conclusion.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|poohbear: So Smith and Cohen had a chance for a great result but now have to figure out how to beat 4@h|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h6|pc|hT|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|hJ|pc|h8|pg||
pc|hK|pc|s2|nt|poohbear: they wont|pg||
pc|s9|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|poohbear: the play to 3NT is not without interest|pg||
nt|kareno: I think it will take a lot more artillary than they have available :)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d5|pc|d6|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|poohbear: on a @s lead declarer has a choice of 8 card suits to try and develop|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|s6|pc|d7|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|nt|poohbear: he should try AK in one and then finesse in the other|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
mc|10|nt|kareno: I think that play would consist of two rounds of clubs in case the queen comes and then a heart finesse ...|pg||
nt|poohbear: why not the other way?|pg||
nt|kareno: He has jack and ten of hearts?  |pg||
nt|vugraphzfp: Next round (second last round) we have: Levin-Weinstein vs Fleisher-Martel, Hurd-Wooldridge vs Fredin-Wrang, and Stewart-Woolsey vs L'Ecuyer-Krekorian|pg||
nt|poohbear: yup|pg||
nt|kareno: It's probably best for a computer to work it out, not me :)|pg||
nt|kareno: specs point out @h 9 could be singleton.|pg||
nt|poohbear: so?|pg||
nt|kareno: Where are convention cards - anyone know?|pg||
nt|kareno: In south.  But would you play for it?|pg||
nt|kareno: Without a mirror?|pg||
nt|poohbear: doesnt help|pg||
nt|poohbear: @h spots not good enuff|pg||
nt|poohbear: and you wouldnt play for it|pg||
nt|kareno: I don't know if convention cards are on the Cavendish web site AND I don't know which site that is... sorry.|pg||
