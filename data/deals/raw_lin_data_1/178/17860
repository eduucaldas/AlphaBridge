nt|jbennet: perhaps 1 NT was best.|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: Nobody reached the good slam on board 14|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|poohbear: He had 13 points|pg||
nt|jbennet: yes.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|pelu: and I exp that almost all tables will be in 3Nt down 100/150|pg||
nt|jbennet: but that hand did not have values for GF.|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbennet: 4333 1 controll.|pg||
nt|pelu: practical bridge is to be in 3NT|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jbennet: yes but if one need a swing.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|jbennet: then best bet is to onlyinvite.|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
nt|jbennet: hoping for minimum with p (declines the invite and then hoping that 3NT doesnt make).|pg||
