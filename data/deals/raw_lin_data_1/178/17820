nt|chorush: perhaps some danger that Helgemo will finesse the diamond when he finds west with 6 hearts and 4clubs|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|c9|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|pc|cJ|nt|davidstern: Yes as noted he may hook diamond when he knows leftie is 6-4|pg||
mc|5|nt|davidstern: Even that will fail if diamonds are 5-1|pg||
nt|chorush: apparently he finessed|pg||

nt|davidstern: 5@H seemed to be the limit|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|davidstern: I am told Thomas Bessis finessed the diamond but was in 3NTx and went -1100|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|davidstern: Cost sorry 200 or 50 was what I meant to say|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|chorush: I think maybe more than that David; some may let the opps play 6H if the bid comes from West|pg||
mb|5C|mb|5S|nt|davidstern: Yes as some noted the computer is on a roll|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|davidstern: 6@C/6@D makes but is scary in two suits|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h4|nt|davidstern: That same scariness means this contract will fail by one|pg||

pc|s5|pc|c2|pc|sK|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|chorush: I think you might hve meant 1 overtrick|pg||
nt|davidstern: No scores published during session latest scores www.cavendish.bridgewinners.com|pg||

mc|12|nt|davidstern: Yawn|pg||

nt|chorush: Yes, three taking tricks but you had to take them|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: I guess thats was they say cashing not cashed|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|davidstern: why|pg||
nt|chorush: Helness certainly could have been right|pg||
nt|davidstern: Luckily NS dont have enough points to get into too much trouble in spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: last bd of this round, we will be closing and reopening after each round. will be back shortly|pg||
mb|2S|mb|d|nt|chorush: but he could have been just as right to lead the diamond ace and see if he still felt like getting a ruff|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dT|nt|davidstern: On the hand where Helgemo went -500 in 6@S Bessisx2 went -100 in 4@S|pg||

pc|h6|pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|davidstern: Declarer has one more club to lose before the issue of the trump suit arises|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: next round we will have Cohen  Smith  vs   Lev  Pepsi|pg||
nt|davidstern: In the Bessis match they are playing 5@S undoubled on the same heart lead|pg||

mc|6|nt|vugraphzfa: we will be back shortly with the next rd, will leave the table open for a little, still some time in the clock|pg||
nt|chorush: Some people call this second day of the Cavendish "moving day". The computer certainly seems determined to see to it that large swings may occur|pg||
nt|chorush: Some very wild hands|pg||
nt|davidstern: Bessis playing 2@S undoubled on this hand at other table|pg||
nt|chorush: Cohler-Seamon had a very reasonable score after 3 sessions. They certainly improved their score here|pg||
nt|davidstern: I would estimate substantially|pg||
nt|davidstern: Not what one expects against world champions - for sure|pg||
nt|davidstern: Tournament website www.cavendish.bridgewinners.com|pg||
nt|chorush: Everyone has their off-days. H&H were slightly negative coming into the 4th stanza and may have felt they had to push a bit to get into contention|pg||
nt|davidstern: If you go to the website you will see photos from two of the three VG tables. |pg||
nt|davidstern: Click on the photo to enlarge|pg||
nt|davidstern: There are three more rounds this evening 12 boards and then the final 28 tomorrow morning 10:30 pacific time|pg||
