mb|2S!|an|karolar|nt|ahollan1: 1@S=0-3@S|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S t/o without spades and x would be 4+ (some play specifically 4-5) spades|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|tez: 6@c e 6@d dememekte garip o elde|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: secondly it gives responder more choice, especially with short club opener|pg||

pc|hT|nt|athene: i think you bid 3@H here|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pef: the -100 score on the previous board was obviously wrong|pg||
