mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h4|nt|vugraphzfp: I think it's the sort of thing you have to go against a 3rd seat favourable opening? Like a kill-or-be-killed|pg||
nt|vugraphzfp: go->do*|pg||
nt|poohbear: but will work out here. Declarer has no choice but to play for 2-2 @cs since he lacks the entries to play @cs twice and get back to dummy to cash them|pg||
nt|poohbear: the problem with the 1nt overcall is 2 fold. Your only 4 card suit is @hs so you have no long tricks and the heart holding is wrong to play from your side|pg||
pc|hK|nt|poohbear: I prefer TO dbl|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h2|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|poohbear: maybe partner bids NT|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|drewsky: I agree with Barry..unless partner can 'jump' over my double, game is unlikely.|pg||

mb|1D|nt|poohbear: not his style|pg||
mb|d|mb|2C|mb|2S|mb|d|nt|poohbear: Dbl penalties? or cards?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfp: Schermer thinks the double is just cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|drewsky: I doubt many players would respond 1@D with the east hand.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfp: Chambers thought it was penalties|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|drewsky: And for what its worth, I prefer a 1@S respond in my 5 bagger, not 1@H is my 3 bagger :)|pg||

nt|poohbear: For those interested the trials drraw is out http://usbf.org/|pg||
nt|vugraphzfp: If anyone is curious the screen is divided NE and SW, so when Chambers had doubled 2@S Levin held up the tray for a few seconds before pushing the tray through as to not make it ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfp: look like the speed of the bids were "out of tempo"|pg||
nt|poohbear: there is a tray that the bids are placed on and they slide it back and forth under the table|pg||
pc|hT|pc|d2|pc|h8|pc|h7|pg||
nt|poohbear: North and South control the tray|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|poohbear: since they are first to bid|pg||
pc|dA|nt|poohbear: so 3 @ds will make. I am sure there will be people in game|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s5|nt|poohbear: Declarer doesnt know who is the "safe " hand|pg||
nt|poohbear: has to avoid a @h shift from the hand that doesnt have the king|pg||
nt|poohbear: He knows that the length is in west|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s7|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d5|nt|poohbear: and he knows that West didnt overcall|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|s2|nt|poohbear: but EW are not known for light bids|pg||
nt|vugraphzfp: Levin asks if Chambers plays Smith Echo and the reply was "standard smith echo"|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|mb|d|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|drewsky: too many negatives..sorry...'Levin almost always plays them very well'|pg||
nt|poohbear: chambers will rebid 1NT which shows better than a 1NT overcall|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|poohbear: 2NT highly aggressive|pg||
mb|3N|nt|poohbear: even if he had bid 1NT partner would raise to 3|pg||
