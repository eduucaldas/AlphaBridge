nt|vugraphzfp: Yep|pg||
nt|vugraphzfp: So with these methods you're constrained to be in game or if you have a weak hand just pass 2NT and hope for the best|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i've seen  3@S to show 5@S/2@H  and 3N to show odd shape  [long minor]   but never this treatment|pg||
nt|vugraphzfp: Not bad of a method since you get a bit more clarity on slam-going auctions after 2NT-transfer-accept-4m|pg||
