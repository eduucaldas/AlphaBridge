mb|3D|nt|chorush: The top 7 places get paid in this event so both these pairs have a lot to shoot for|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbennet: looks like 3 D hit the target. |pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: Event website: http://cavendish.bridgewinners.com/   Also live table pictures updating every two minutes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Weak NT and EW missed the spade fit|pg||
nt|jbennet: yes. 3 sp|pg||
nt|drewsky: East opened 1@C with 15 HCP, so they must be playing weak NTs |pg||
pc|c3|nt|chorush: I expect Grue woul dhave acted over a stong NT but EW might still have found spades|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jbennet: if they did find the spade they wouldnt have bid game.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|pg||
nt|chorush: Still, EW will go plus 50 or 100 so no major swing|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|chorush: maybe i spoke too soon|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Stewart opened 1@D next door and then South was out of it. 2@S it is|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jbennet: no not ncessaryly|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jbennet: DD 3 d is unbeatable.|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|pc|cA|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|jbennet: only nedds to take right view in diamonds.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h5|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|pc|h6|pc|c7|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|h9|pc|s2|pg||
nt|jbennet: he probably know by now that spades were 54|pg||
nt|jbennet: and clubs 44|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Standings after 4 sessions at  http://cavendish.bridgewinners.com/results/pairs4r.htm|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|d7|pg||
pc|d5|mc|8|nt|drewsky: He had no chance to get this right because they ARE playing strong NTs|pg||
pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|2D|mb|2H|mb|2S|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|Walddk2: Only 3 losers but not necessarily 10 tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: trump is kiling for a start|pg||
nt|chorush: That 109 doubleton in hearts in East's hand may let this one come in. A trump lead will beat it, I think|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|dT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Still time to switch|pg||
nt|jbennet: so trump switch now necessary |pg||
nt|jbennet: looks fairly obvious.|pg||
nt|jbennet: even though we can see all four hands it cant be diffcult to see the necessity to reduce ruffs.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe not needed. @H8 could be a factor|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now it can hardly go wrong for the defense|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Standings after 4 sessions at  http://cavendish.bridgewinners.com/results/pairs4r.htm|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|jbennet: so perhaps it is worth +4 - 5 IMP:s to beat 4h.|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|drewsky: The Brad Moss style is that 1@S promises 5+ clubs|pg||
nt|chorush: Well, clubs are friendly but the rest of the hand is not|pg||
nt|jbennet: On that kind of auction often goos idea NOT to lead declares suit from criticaL holdnings.|pg||
nt|chorush: diamond lead looks best|pg||
nt|jbennet: so spade lead will get a well deserved punishment|pg||
nt|chorush: and seems reasonable on the bidding|pg||
nt|jbennet: west might lead a heart antivipating declarer being short there.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: Event website: http://cavendish.bridgewinners.com/   Also live table pictures updating every two minutes|pg||
nt|jbennet: not sure that D is so good over time.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://cavendish.bridgewinners.com/index.php?option=com_content&id=204  for overall standings|pg||
pc|h6|nt|drewsky: There is an inference here that south of 4-2-2-5 as he might well have patterned out with 3@D over 3@C|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|nt|jbennet: the odds in favour to play 7|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|jbennet: of H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2 spades, 1 heart, 1 diamond, 5 clubs|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jbennet: now east will fire back spade probably "when the impossible is eliminated whats left [however improbable] must be the truth)"|pg||
nt|jbennet: nasty hand.|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|sK|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: thisthis table is webcam 2 in the web page|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 1NT+1 in the other room|pg||
pc|c4|pc|d3|pc|cT|pc|c5|pg||
nt|jbennet: having failed to win the sp on hand he had to preserve un entry to dummy.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|c7|pc|s6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Meck was in 2 and made 3|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|curtis: will do|pg||

nt|jbennet: it call came down to the defence.|pg||

pc|d8|pc|d7|pc|dA|pc|dK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hand collapsing now|pg||
nt|jbennet: west choosed the best lead (to lead away from a shabby d or spad suit on that auction is loosing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3 down with a diamond|pg||
mc|6|pg||

nt|jbennet: this time theory and reality agreed with each other.|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|d|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|d|nt|Walddk2: This is down on a club ruff which I think Chambers will find .... eh, no|pg||
nt|jbennet: east should not stand it.|pg||
mb|5C|mb|d|nt|chorush: 4 spades will be a disaster. I think that 5 diamonds can make|pg||
nt|jbennet: he must be aware of that the hand will collapse if playing on 43|pg||
mb|5D|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chorush: this could be 950|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jbennet: well west do have a choice.|pg||
nt|jbennet: should he go for the contract (if that fails it will be 3-4 off. Or play safe for -1??|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Next round we have: Levin-Weinstein vs Hurd-Wooldridge, Johnson-Meckstroth vs Cohler-Seamon, and Jansma-Paulissen vs Multon-Zimmermann|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jbennet: -1 or -2|pg||

pc|d8|pc|cK|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
