mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: NS play that a 1@S rebid guarantees an unbalanced hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i guess that's wrong too     they have choice when holding 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: time for a coke :(|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: While Smirnov thinks , Weinstein looks over his CC|pg||
pc|h2|nt|henryb:  And they may raise to 2@h rather than bid 1@s with 4-3 and a small doubleton|pg||
