mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: one of Roland's 20-20 hands: but at matchpoints, there's always some interest|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bjacobs: In this case, it's how many the nameless South will go down|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He prefers to be anonymous|pg||
nt|Walddk2: as he is going at least 2 down|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, but -100 might be worth some matchpoints.  Maybe E/W can make 110 or 120|pg||

nt|Walddk2: First he misplayed 3NT, then he gave 1@H, so two yellow cards = sent off|pg||

pc|hA|pc|hT|pc|h3|pc|hK|pg||

nt|Walddk2: They threw 2 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The trump lead did not cause it|pg||
nt|bjacobs: ok, what did cause it?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @DA was a disaster|pg||
nt|suketbombi: kinda deccision again possible in MPS dont think in Imp they would have done this|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When is it right to rise ace?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Never when you know declarer has a long suit|pg||
nt|bjacobs: he didn't?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: you will score the ace regardless|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes the rats wont eat it as they say:)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: i'm lost|pg||
nt|bjacobs: that's not the play that I saw|pg||
nt|Walddk2: sorry no, the spade switch cost it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: declarer will not score a spade trick if left to his own devices|pg||
nt|bjacobs: yes, and it's easy to sympathize with North, who was looking at @Sxxx in dummy|pg||
nt|bjacobs: but to be honest, the trump lead was sensible on this auction, and I think N/S didn't do anything too wrong|pg||
nt|suketbombi: the @S return was the last nail in the coffin or else they were entitiled for 2@S 2@DS2@HS|pg||
nt|suketbombi: the @S return after the dead dummy was the culprit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't agree with you, Bill. Spade is not right. Whatever spade tricks you are entitled to you will get by endplaying declarer with a diamond|pg||
nt|bjacobs: well, a club didn't seem right ... how was North to know?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Read above|pg||
nt|bjacobs: so you want North to return a diamond into declarer's suit?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He can't throw spade losers out of the window|pg||
nt|bjacobs: or a club?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: i think this was a lot harder than you make out|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I'm not saying North was correct to play a spade, just that it was a difficult situation|pg||
nt|suketbombi: surely would have been easy for south to win the second trick and return the @C but North cud bide his time by returning the @D and get the @c count|pg||
nt|bjacobs: you might be finessing South's diamond holding by returning a diamond|pg||
nt|bjacobs: a diamond return feels totally unnatural|pg||
nt|suketbombi: btw was 2@C double not a penalty ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: South could have had  Jxx  right enough|pg||
nt|bjacobs: well, raju, perhaps the double points to the club return.  also feels wrong on Kx, but I suspect it's safe enough|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes pd wud not jump in to the auction to Double 2@C holding XXX|pg||
nt|bjacobs: that was a mighty interesting hand, bidding and play|pg||

pc|d5|nt|suketbombi: it is better to give the @D trick to talk him out of the @S finesse|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bjacobs: He makes the imps play ... the only way to beat the contract is that low diamond continuation|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dJ|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|mb|d|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Shah will likely take out into 2@D|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|suketbombi: nobody does these days 15-17 Nt is treated with lot of respect|pg||
nt|bjacobs: My theory is that even if the opponents play 15-17 1NT, you are best off with a simple penalty double|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|bjacobs: So don't play DONT|pg||
nt|bjacobs: but as you say, people treat 15-17 1NT with respect ... respect it doesn't deserve|pg||

nt|bjacobs: The other advantage of the simple penalty double is that when you do overcall, partner knows you're limited in HCP|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So play Multi-Landy or Astro or even Cappalletti is my recommendation|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes that is a good point|pg||
pc|c3|nt|suketbombi: and mess around with that double as conventional on a Passed hand|pg||
