nt|janm: Hmmm, this auction didn't work out well for EW |pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@h searching 4 cards in East is a spot, but also a risk|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, stressed by Ron Klinger from Australia, but he was aiming at IMPs|pg||

nt|janm: You're right, GIorgio. As this auction came up, W felt that she hadn't shown her values and had to do something over 1NT. If she'd bid 1NT the first round, she would have shown her ...|pg||
