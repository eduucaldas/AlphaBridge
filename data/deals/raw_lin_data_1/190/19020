mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: hi cliff what about that 1s opening|pg||
pc|h5|nt|capercliff: i would have opened 1@c, but that is probably not natural for them|pg||

nt|capercliff: a very aggressive lead from Gino, he gets a bad board for it|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|d|nt|rmb1: Some number of NT?|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|capercliff: 2@d looks like a limit @c raise|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|rmb1: 1C is natural 3+ better minor|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h3|nt|rmb1: transfer responses at one level (I have no more details)|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|nt|capercliff: this contract has no chance, but the defence needs to be accurate|pg||

nt|capercliff: it probably retains its meaning even after a double, limit raise in @c's|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|nt|rmb1: 2D may be balanced invitational [or clubs invitational]|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|pg||
pc|h8|pc|d5|pc|h7|pc|d2|pg||
nt|capercliff: a lot play 1@c-2@d and 1@d-3@c as limit raises|pg||
mc|9|nt|capercliff: so now inverted minors are more defined, if not game forcing|pg||
nt|capercliff: after winning the Q@c E had to shift to a @d|pg||
nt|capercliff: not easy|pg||
nt|capercliff: perhaps it would have been a better idea to rise up with the A@c to play the K@d from W|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1S|mb|d|mb|2C|nt|yuval10: NS are currently 19th , EW 21st|pg||
nt|rmb1: Expecting new EW|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but ew have the power|pg||
mb|3S|nt|yuval10: NEW EW are 41st|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: the VUL will persuade N/S to stay low|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|capercliff: 4@h is the spot|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1@C natural or balanced.  Now N and E are bidding the opponent's suits|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: thats a mighty big e hand but i suppose he said that already|pg||
nt|capercliff: the @d lead will hold this to 11|pg||
nt|capercliff: assuming declarer gets the trumps right|pg||
nt|rmb1: 3@S was a big bid for a big hand|pg||
pc|dK|nt|yuval10: it's all about finding the J@h here, 11 tricks will be above average for EW|pg||
nt|capercliff: now that North has the KQ@d at least, he is unlikely to have the A@h|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h7|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|pc|dJ|pc|d4|pg||
nt|capercliff: did he really play the K@h from his hand?|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h6|pc|d7|pc|dT|pg||
nt|jcomyn: knowing s has ha why did e play that way|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h3|nt|yuval10: because he thought he has AJ |pg||

mb|2H|an| |nt|capercliff: also was the possibilty for stiff A@h|pg||
nt|rmb1: 4@H looks too much here but 4@S is OK for NS|pg||
mb|4S|mb|5H|nt|capercliff: 5@h is some bid|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: especially at red|pg||
nt|yuval10: not many time a sacrifice in the 5 level Red vs White is successful, but this hand is one of those rare cases|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cQ|nt|rmb1: Now all South has to do is pick up @SK|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|capercliff: when E has the A@c maybe he has no choice?|pg||
nt|yuval10: if 2@h is weak, i think declarer can read the @s position|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|h9|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes now case is clear|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|s2|pg||
nt|yuval10: but our loyal Swedish kibitzers inform me that 2@h is 10-13|pg||
nt|capercliff: the defence might have done better on this one|pg||
nt|yuval10: so not so clear i guess|pg||
nt|capercliff: to conceal some of the HCP|pg||
nt|capercliff: A@c KQ to 6 and the K@s is too much for 2@h's|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think you missed my previous comment|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@h is 10-13|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes but presumably still pre-emtive?|pg||
nt|yuval10: E also put some smoke-screen by playing the K@h in the 2nd round of @h|pg||
nt|yuval10: if their system is 10-13, why would he not?|pg||
nt|capercliff: my question is whether or not they would open 1@h with such a hand|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1@h is stronger hand|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|sK|pg||
nt|yuval10: 14+ i guess|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c6|pc|cA|pc|s6|pg||
mc|10|nt|jcomyn: if that isnt a 1h opening i cant think what is|pg||
nt|capercliff: 1@h cannot be 14+|pg||
nt|yuval10: why not?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: agree that sounds daft|pg||
nt|capercliff: because what do you open with a 5-card suit?|pg||
nt|capercliff: i am told 1@h and rebid 2@h is 14+|pg||
nt|yuval10: :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: come on yuval whats the answer to that|pg||
nt|yuval10: like was obvious 2 minutes ago|pg||
nt|capercliff: 1@h open is 5+ and 11+ points|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: http://b.poznan2011.pl/op/osfa2.html  running scores|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|capercliff: can the defence score 2@c tricks before @d are set up?|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|yuval10: doesn't even need it |pg||
mc|8|nt|capercliff: that will be a very good score for N/S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: do we have a problem|pg||
nt|capercliff: on the last hand declarer could have legitimately endplayed E if he read the position |pg||
nt|capercliff: but that was perhaps double dummy|pg||
nt|jcomyn: any idea whats happen ing|pg||
nt|capercliff: waiting for the next round I presume|pg||
nt|yuval10: probably waiting for next round|pg||
nt|jcomyn: unusually long wait|pg||
nt|yuval10: many good pairs are currently "in the bubble" , between final A and final B|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It does not really matter how much they score as long as they are among the first 46. There is no carryover to the finals|pg||
nt|capercliff: Pachtmann and Ginossar have been one of Israel's top pairs for a good few years now|pg||
nt|capercliff: and they are still quite young|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed, Ron is the older and will celebrate 33 this July|pg||
nt|yuval10: Gino is 30|pg||
