pc|dT|pc|d5|pc|d6|nt|athene: now @D10, club ruff, @DA pitching the spade|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: And S goes for diamonds first, so he can discard his spade loser|pg||
nt|panja: does he?|pg||
nt|panja: what about @H finesse?|pg||
nt|panja: what if @D gets ruffed from 2 Hearts?|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|ianmcc: still debating the @h finesse|pg||
pc|h3|pc|cQ|nt|pbmarstr: A heart finesse will not necessarily help|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|c3|pg||
nt|athene: ok well he did finesse hearts but i don't think it was totally clearcut to do that then|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|h4|pc|c6|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|nt|athene: now west can ruff in on the diamonds and cash a top trump |pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Declarer should not touch the trumps. Now he will go down|pg||
pc|s2|nt|panja: at MP's, ideas get twisted becuase you have to try for that extra trick|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h6|pc|d8|pc|h5|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s8|pc|d9|nt|athene: if someone ruffed the @DA it was much more likely to be from long trumps|pg||
nt|athene: pulling two rounds of trumps too likely to let a defender draw a killing third round|pg||

nt|pbmarstr: Here E should be held to 10 tricks. 11 will give good score.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|dK|nt|panja: B2 10 tricks every which way?|pg||
nt|athene: not too much interest here; declarer knocks out the @DA but must lose both black kings|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|athene: the only way you might make 11 is if you lead a small club towards the queen and south ducks|pg||
nt|athene: then south can get strip squeezed in the black suits|pg||
nt|athene: but he shouldn't do that|pg||
nt|panja: S needs to go passive just now|pg||
nt|athene: because he can count the points :)|pg||
nt|athene: he knows his partner has nothing|pg||

nt|panja: right..it has to be that...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: all paths to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|panja: he should not discard a Club|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: On the first board several declarers made the contract in 4 @H|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|athene: yes drawing two rounds of trumps early in that 4@H was very costly - he could have made|pg||
nt|athene: if he just went for the ruff right away or even after @HQ-king-ace|pg||
nt|athene: because west can never draw a third trump so declarer gets another ruff AND another entry to winners in dummy|pg||
nt|panja: there were 4-5 4@H made, equal number going two down, but many more going just one down|pg||

nt|ianmcc: N can make 11 tricks in @s by giving up 2 heart|pg||
nt|athene: you can make 6@S here if east leads his ace |pg||

mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|athene: i suppose sometimes partner could have @HAxxxx and a minor suit ace|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|athene: north will be thinking of the hearts as a splendid source of tricks instead of his primary source of losers :)|pg||

nt|ianmcc: at all|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|athene: i mean -480 won't matchpoint well for EW :)|pg||
nt|athene: was east really worried that the hearts were all going away?|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: I guess 4 @S instead of 4 @H may have  contributed to this lead.|pg||
nt|athene: well, the only time this lead would be necessary is when south has a good club suit and declarer can throw his hearts away|pg||

mb|2C|an| |nt|ianmcc: should West raise @d?|pg||
nt|panja: EW will do well to play in @S from West hand on B4|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|an| |nt|pbmarstr: I was thinking along the same line. Should W raise. With 3343 I dont think he can be blaimed.|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D looked fine to me, you have an extra diamond|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|an| |nt|athene: 2@H showing a very bad hand here i guess|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: west wanted to have a go at 3@C :)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|panja: the strong 2@C bid and the artificial responses thereto have wrongsided this contract|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: The club ruff is an original trick|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cT|pc|d3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: yes, but then he can play a spade to the ace and another club for a trump promotion|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c6|nt|athene: so the @HJx becomes a trick|pg||
nt|panja: after @C ruff...S must get to North hand for another club and an uppercut|pg||
nt|athene: that is often the way|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c9|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|nt|athene: if you get just one ruff, it doesn't gain|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: but the second ruff is the killer|pg||
nt|athene: that can happen in lots of ways - for example if you have a trump holding like QJx|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: if you get one ruff it's no advantage, but two ruffs are|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Yes. Going one down|pg||
nt|ianmcc: nice defence|pg||
nt|athene: that's why you should often only go for ruffs when partner is likely to have lots of entries|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s5|nt|panja: of course, even if there were no ruffs..if Decl ducked @CQ, for example, this would have gone down...|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|d6|pc|d4|pg||

pc|hA|pc|hJ|pc|h5|pc|hK|pg||
nt|athene: south decided not to ruff|pg||
mc|9|nt|athene: he hoped declarer would not be able to reach hand so he would make his @HK|pg||
nt|panja: that was hoping against hope after the @D discard|pg||
nt|athene: but would north really lead a fourth club if he had nothing promotable in trumps?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: no|pg||
nt|athene: i think if you trust your partner you ruff that club with the king|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: surely|pg||

pc|hK|pc|hQ|nt|pbmarstr: Instead of ruffing the spade W should have played the Q of heart. Opponents then have to decide which hand to take the tap|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|hT|pg||
nt|ianmcc: should be zero|pg||
nt|athene: with that diamond holding declarer knows he has to draw trumps at some point|pg||
nt|athene: and dummy is getting forced in clubs|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: http://b.poznan2011.pl/op/opf.html|pg||
nt|athene: so maybe it is a bad idea to get his own hand forced as well|pg||
nt|athene: might have been better to try for a dummy reversal|pg||
nt|athene: crossruffs only work if you have side-suit winners you can cash without needing to draw trumps|pg||
nt|athene: any suit where you have length in both hands, like the 4-4 diamonds here, is just bad news for that|pg||
nt|athene: as it happens of course south could have continued with a top club at trick 2|pg||
nt|athene: but he saw that he might be wanting to play lots of clubs|pg||
nt|athene: and just in case declarer had the @C10 he decided to sort things out right away|pg||

nt|athene: it's not automatic to reach 3nt - some might just go for a heavy club overcall which might end the auction|pg||
nt|athene: but i guess in a good field you would expect most people to be in 3nt|pg||
