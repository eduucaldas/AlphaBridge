mb|p|mb|1N|an|GF|mb|p|mb|2C|an|5+!C|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|brgpro: would EW stop in 6NT?|pg||
nt|psyck: will be tuf to get there|pg||
nt|brgpro: after pd opened and W has these cards?|pg||
nt|psyck: more likely 6@d |pg||
nt|brgpro: not in pairs...|pg||
nt|mamos: but West presumably knows East may have that sort of hand|pg||
nt|brgpro: they will be in 6NT but i am afraid that after these jumping bids...they might overbid to 7|pg||
nt|vugraphpl3: information www.poznan2011.pl|pg||
nt|fokal: well 6 @d is much better : if @d are not behavious you can still rely on the @c finesse |pg||
nt|fokal: behaving|pg||
nt|vugraphpl3: running scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/op/osfa2.html|pg||
mb|3H|nt|brgpro: yes but this is pairs, worth the risk|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|brgpro: 7@d cant be made even if u guess the @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|fokal: I think they know the blackwood so they should find aout the @d Q is missing|pg||
mb|4N|nt|brgpro: no entry in dummy|pg||
nt|mamos: West will continue to push  and East backpedal |pg||
nt|fokal: then avoid 7|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5H|an| |mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|nt|mamos: this may be ask for @dQ|pg||
nt|fokal: is patchman sure that @d is trump ?|pg||
mb|6N|nt|fokal: it seems so|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brgpro: well...with the W cards, 6@D is not a pairs contract|pg||
nt|fokal: and now ginosar made the understandable conclusion|pg||
nt|psyck: after gf 3@d itself sets trumps maybe|pg||
nt|fokal: well done|pg||
pc|s7|nt|psyck: This will make it more comfortable for EW who are currently 19th|pg||
nt|fokal: yes 3@d followed by 4 @d should be pretty clear|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|fokal: will S bare his @c king ?|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s3|nt|brgpro: not likely...he is glad that he is in 6NT|pg||
pc|c8|nt|psyck: they are well placed b4 this set, so will not be looking for a swing|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|fokal: depend how many clubs left in the end I guess, or if N discards :)|pg||
nt|psyck: and as Jack says, should not when already in a good spot|pg||
nt|fokal: I agree|pg||
nt|mamos: 6Nt = will be enough|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s4|pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
pc|d4|nt|fokal: so S won't bare his @c king anyway right ?|pg||
pc|sT|pc|h6|pc|hT|pg||
nt|fokal: so why not making the finesse ?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|fokal: :)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c9|nt|psyck: :)|pg||
nt|mamos: will only make a differenc eif South bares @cK and he won't do that|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|sK|pc|c6|nt|fokal: yes so my oppinion is you can always finesse :)|pg||

pc|c7|pc|h8|pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|h7|pc|hK|pg||
nt|brgpro: there will be some 6@d or 7NT or 7@d|pg||
nt|fokal: yes making an overtrick when both king are whitin North|pg||
nt|brgpro: so 6NT is a great result|pg||
nt|fokal: sure it's the maximum of the board|pg||
nt|brgpro: will be around 70% only i think|pg||
nt|mamos: I believe there is no carry forward for the final so pairs in qualifying places will be trying to consolidate while others  may be shooting   this may affect scores becaus enot ...|pg||
nt|mamos: like a normal Pairs competition   glory or bust|pg||

nt|psyck: lucky choice anyway, this should be easier for S to pass|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck: normal play is to bang top @d's after drawing trumps to cater for @dHx or 33|pg||

nt|psyck: here, if E did not have come in, it would have also been bid i guess|pg||
nt|mamos: can 3Nt be mad on Diamond lead ?    West will have some discards to make|pg||
nt|brgpro: 180 will be below average|pg||
nt|psyck: but many may go down trying @s double fin that putting pressure on W|pg||
nt|psyck: *than|pg||
nt|brgpro: even after @d lead, just run 5 rounds of @c and u will feel W's pain|pg||
nt|brgpro: before u take double @s finesse, the opening 1@d will help u to make this judgement|pg||
nt|brgpro: so i would think 3NT will be bid and made more often around the room|pg||
nt|psyck: 1@d only says he has 13 cards at this vul :)|pg||
nt|psyck: but yes, many should make on @d lead too|pg||
nt|mamos: has gone down at two of the other BBo tables once still playing  and once 3dx  prob -2|pg||

pc|h4|nt|brgpro: actually, the only way for defence to get it right is to cash first 2@h and since S knows N must have at least 4@h, he shd  play @hJ on the 2nd @h, then N would probably get it ...|pg||
