nt|Walddk2: E-W from Finland|pg||
nt|mcphee: wow what a super hand E holds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Our operator is Joanna|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Commentators Bob and Bill|pg||
nt|mcphee: hi Joanna|pg||
nt|mcphee: hi Bill|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: and we have Poland E-W|pg||
nt|vugraphpl5: Hi all|pg||
nt|mcphee: perhaps 1@C is artificial|pg||
nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Polish Club most likely, 3-way|pg||
nt|Walddk2: One of which is 18+ any|pg||

nt|athene: i guess you play ace and a diamond against this bidding at MP|pg||
nt|mcphee: best  match point spot is right here |pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes, they have announced no D control|pg||

pc|d3|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|d9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Opps listen|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mcphee: nice the trumps are 3-2, declarer has a chance to finesse @S but it carries the risk of the @C ruff|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|d4|pc|d8|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: maybe a relay trying to find out if partner has five spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://b.poznan2011.pl/op/osfa2.html  running scores|pg||
nt|athene: if he did then 4@H could easily be better|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes, i suppose|pg||
nt|mcphee: 10@D lead deadly I think|pg||
nt|athene: deadly but hard to find|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|s3|nt|mcphee: J@S is a super card for declarer|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|athene: on a club lead, how about rising ace and playing the @D10?|pg||
nt|mcphee: lost chance now|pg||
nt|athene: ok, well now maybe heart switch and the @D10 :)|pg||
nt|athene: i really don't think they are finding this cute surrounding play in diamonds - west doesn't know his partner has the @DQ|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|athene: maybe if east had shifted to a bigger heart there|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|cK|pc|c7|pg||
nt|athene: that might have done the trick|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d5|nt|mcphee: if declarer has Q@C they have no shot so I think he should rise on first @C play|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h9|pg||
pc|c6|mc|10|nt|mcphee: a decent result for N/S|pg||
pg||

mb|2S!|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Vesa Fagerlund|pg||
nt|athene: i'm told fredin found that @D10 play after a different start (heart)|pg||
nt|muppe: 2@s is muiderberg|pg||
nt|muppe: hi|pg||
nt|mcphee: ahh the doodle bug 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: EW from Sweden|pg||
nt|mcphee: this should bounce them directly to 4|pg||
mb|3H|nt|athene: 3@H a constructive spade raise i suppose|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: N has super fit|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: south will turn down any invitation :)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mcphee: likely make only 3|pg||
nt|athene: north gives his partner a great deal of slack|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes but perhaps they play the hand can hold a 4 card minor for 2@S|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|sQ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|muppe: yes, it can be 5-4 and i think also pretty weak|pg||
nt|mcphee: in which case N is a bit less of a super fit|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h8|pc|s7|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|mcphee: now needs to guess @C|pg||
nt|athene: restricted choice in the clubs|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|d4|pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: well, i guess he has a choice - ace and another should be ok|pg||
pc|dK|pc|s6|pc|d5|pc|d7|pg||
nt|athene: but leading small to the 8 for intra finesse, playing east for @CJx/@C10x might not be so good|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c6|pc|c5|pc|cK|pg||

nt|athene: @S@S@C@D to lose|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|mcphee: i like N's pass at pairs|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: i am not sure i like the pass of 2nt very much but it might work out ok|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|pc|c5|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|athene: spade lead needed now just to take out the entry to dummy|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mcphee: my thought is that I do not think very many pairs will try 3N, |pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|pc|c7|pg||
pc|cT|pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|cA|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
nt|mcphee: seems better from up here that Fallenius maight have put in 10@H|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mcphee: not so easy from down there|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|dT|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s9|pg||
mc|8|nt|athene: giving declarer an extra heart winner doesn't really cost because dummy has a million winners as soon as declarer gets there|pg||
nt|athene: so it was just a question (east thought) of putting a diamond through and setting up some tricks|pg||
pg||
qx|o5|st||md|3SK98532HA3D872CT4,SQ64HQ542DT65CQJ7,SJT7HJ87DKQJ93C98,SAHKT96DA4CAK6532|sv|n|mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1S|mb|d|mb|2S|mb|3S|nt|mcphee: E wants to play this one, N is going to lead @D:(|pg||
nt|athene: 3@S might not be guaranteeing a heart fit but when east pulls 3nt to 4@H then it is obvious|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: that is 4@c from west?|pg||
nt|mcphee: S shows his 2 suiter?|pg||
nt|mcphee: nah:)|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|athene: 4@C looks a bit odd; why not 3nt?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcphee: I think 4@C is 100%|pg||
nt|athene: oh well; the end result would have been the same, i imagine|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mcphee: now has the time to make 12 tricks|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: heart to the queen looks natural and will lead to 12 tricks i suppose|pg||
nt|muppe: N showing his diamond values as lead directional would have worked here|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|h7|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|pc|h9|pc|hA|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes Vesa good point|pg||
nt|athene: maybe north should have bid 2@D rather than 2@S, for the lead|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: but if you play a multi then it is not obvious that 2@D is a spade raise as you might have quite good diamonds and not be able to open them|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|hK|pc|s2|pc|h4|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|c8|pg||

pc|c7|pc|dQ|pc|cA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|mcphee: wd here e/w|pg||
mc|12|nt|muppe: It's so important to make lead directional bids at mps i thinki. Many mps can be won|pg||
nt|mcphee: duplicated at many tables I am sure, but above average|pg||
pg||
qx|o6|st||md|4SAQJ652H9DAQ953C2,SKHA642DT8CQJT974,ST873H53DK42CK865,S94HKQJT87DJ76CA3|sv|e|nt|athene: if you play a weak 2@D opener there is more reason to have 2@D there as a spade raise|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: of course with such a good suit you might bid 2@D even if it wasn't guaranteeing a spade fit :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mcphee: this may well end in 4@S dbled|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|mcphee: i would have opened E hand 2@H|pg||
mb|3C|mb|4H|nt|athene: fit-showing jump 4@C from west might warn east that declarer has a big spade diamond two-suiter|pg||
nt|athene: hmmm |pg||
mb|4S|mb|5H|nt|athene: not sure quite what 3@C is supposed to mean|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he felt that not making a lead-directing raise was costly last hand so it's time to make one now :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|muppe: Yes i guess that too|pg||
nt|mcphee: oh my|pg||
nt|mcphee: i can not see passing out 5@H|pg||
nt|athene: if 3@C shows club values how can you not double 5@H|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|c8|pc|c3|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mcphee: good new, E does not have trump spots to reach table and extablish the @C:)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|h9|pg||
nt|athene: still, +100 might not actually be that much better for NS than +200|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: if people are playing in spades (doubled or not)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||
pc|cA|pc|d3|pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||
nt|athene: sorry i mean +200 might not be that much better than +100 :)|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sA|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|mcphee: i suspect some n/s pairs go minus|pg||
nt|muppe: now S is thinking what partner has for his 3@c bid|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1D|mb|d|mb|r|nt|Walddk2: double = hearts|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|3D|nt|athene: interesting that east doesn't try 2@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H 4-card support, minimum|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: surely west could have four spades here|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|d|nt|mcphee: just lost his last plus score|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: south might double this for one off if he really wants MP|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mcphee: i think W was a bit too aggressive this time|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: maybe it's a bit much though; no-one forced opps to go all the way to 4@D so if it goes one off that should be good anyway|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|mcphee: J@C next?:)|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|athene: well @C8 is upside down count so east must be worried about @C10x left with declarer?|pg||
nt|mcphee: but he will be endplay later any way|pg||
nt|athene: but if declarer does have that (and reads the cards) he can always strip squeeze east in the minor suits anyway|pg||
nt|mcphee: so go for the brass ring|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|c3|pc|cT|pc|s8|pg||
nt|mcphee: oh this is not wise|pg||
nt|athene: he can always exit with queen and a spade and then decide later what to do about the @C10|pg||
nt|athene: i.e. whether to unblock the @CJ|pg||
nt|mcphee: 10@C just got dumped|pg||
nt|mcphee: :)|pg||
nt|athene: hmmm west thinks this is helping his partner out but of course it isn't|pg||

pc|sT|pc|s7|pc|d2|pc|h9|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c2|pc|d6|nt|athene: maybe west thought the @C10 said "play a heart" but east would have done that if he could find another one, you can be sure :)|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|athene: now with only one heart left it's safe to play the club|pg||
nt|mcphee: y|pg||
nt|mcphee: 120 a nice score|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|nt|athene: west would have done better to keep more hearts then there might have been some slight risk to exiting the club|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d5|pg||
mc|7|nt|athene: although declarer should have gone for it anyway|pg||
nt|mcphee: a short delay while pairs are getting seated for the last round|pg||
