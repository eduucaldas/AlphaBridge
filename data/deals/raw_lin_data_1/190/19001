mb|p|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d5|nt|athene: this is quite interesting; declarer may give up on the spade finesse (which would only really gain if north had @SQxx, very unlikely)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|s3|pc|s8|pg||
nt|athene: leading towards the @SJ gives you two entries to lead hearts twice from dummy and score two tricks there |pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|s9|pc|s7|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|h8|nt|athene: heart now, and duck when north splits|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: if north cashes ther @DJ now there is almost a double squeeze around clubs for the tenth trick|pg||
nt|athene: but it doesn't quite work because the menaces are in the wrong hand|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d8|pc|d7|pc|d4|pg||
pc|c9|nt|athene: north has to keep all his clubs otherwise south will get squeezed in the minors|pg||
nt|athene: but declarer can't take the heart finesse and untangle everything|pg||
mc|9|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: 5@C pretty good for NS, so the aggressive 3@S has worked out well|pg||
pc|s5|pc|dT|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hK|nt|athene: if east had just bid 1@S then south could bid 3@C if that is a weak jump shift, or maybe 2@C if that is non-forcing|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|pc|h5|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|athene: did he really do that?|pg||
mc|11|nt|athene: perhaps he didn't imagine that east could have four hearts, but still, it looks a bit odd|pg||
nt|athene: if you think east "can't" have four hearts, then south's @H3 (upside down count) must be from four|pg||
nt|athene: so declarer has two hearts|pg||
nt|athene: so you lead the @HJ just in case he has @H10x|pg||
nt|athene: i mean if you want to return a heart at all :)|pg||
nt|athene: but i can't see why you do, really|pg||
nt|athene: maybe balicki was worried that neither minor was safe|pg||
nt|athene: but how can the @DQ hurt?|pg||
nt|athene: sorry a diamond, he had already played the queen|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he thought the lead could have been from @DJxx|pg||
nt|athene: so diamond was giving a ruff/discard|pg||
nt|athene: declarer could have something like this: @SAKQJxxx @H10x @Dxx @CA10x|pg||
nt|athene: then a lead in either minor is costly|pg||
nt|athene: and the @HJ is the only safe exit|pg||
nt|athene: but you could always just duck the @HK, as a spec points out|pg||
nt|athene: if the @H3 is upside down count then declarer must have another heart so this can't cost|pg||
nt|athene: sorry only 6 spades in the above hand|pg||
nt|athene: some specs are suggesting east wouldn't overcall 3@S with that|pg||
nt|athene: well i agree but i am just trying to find some reason for north to do what he did|pg||
pg||
qx|o5|st||md|3SATHJT72DQJ6CK954,S52HA95D543CAJ863,SQJ763HQ643DK2CT7,SK984HK8DAT987CQ2|sv|n|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|athene: after P 1@D P 1NT, north can double to get the majors into it i suppose|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: perhaps he is still feeling sad about that @HJ|pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: well, maybe he can, but he didn't :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|d|nt|athene: ok, 2@C obviously majors here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d3|nt|athene: this sort of double is much more common at MP scoring than imps |pg||
nt|athene: because 200 is such a good score|pg||
nt|athene: and -670 - well, it's only a board|pg||
nt|athene: still i don't think it's clear to leave it in with that east hand|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: you know opps are in an 8-card fit which is breaking OK [partner can't have four hearts]|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: declarer conceals his @DJ hoping the defence don't cash out in clubs, so he can get a club away on the @DJ, but no such luck|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: now the @H9 and @H8 mean one down|pg||
nt|athene: a spec suggests that declarer might have done better to rise @DK at trick 1|pg||
nt|athene: but that in itself would be a bit suspicious i think|pg||
nt|athene: west can't have @DQJx (he would lead the queen surely)|pg||
nt|athene: so east knows south hasn't just got @Dxxx or something in hand, so i think he would return a club anyway|pg||
nt|athene: west could have @DQxx yes but with @DJxx in hand declarer's natural play would be to play low on the lead|pg||
nt|athene: so the @DK is suspicious either way|pg||

nt|athene: assuming it goes 1@C 1@H double [some heart raise]|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|an| |nt|athene: might be tricky since 1@C never promises clubs these days|pg||
nt|athene: ok, pass doesn't promise clubs either|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|athene: aggressive trying to snatch a partscore in fourth|pg||
nt|athene: 9 hcp + 2 spades = pass it out in 4th chair for many people|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: it might look as though declarer will have a bit of trouble getting to dummy twice to lead hearts up, but the defence might well run out of things to play themselves|pg||
mb|p|pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s8|pc|s6|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: declarer doesn't need to risk the finesse against the @HJ first time, i wouldn't think|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cQ|pc|c8|pg||
nt|athene: he can rise @CA, heart to the king, then a spade and just let the defence get on with it|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: but i suppose he might feel that the double of 2@H at vul against not could be a singleton heart|pg||
nt|athene: in which case you might need to take the deep finesse|pg||
nt|athene: still that did not look an obvious play at all|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h6|pg||
nt|athene: now the defence can cash the @SK and @CJ and exit @HJ|pg||
nt|athene: to avoid having to help declarer out|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|c2|pc|h8|pg||
nt|athene: ok this will do just as well, they have club exits|pg||
nt|athene: the key to the hand is the defence not going anywhere near diamonds of course|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|dT|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c9|pc|cK|pc|c7|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s7|pc|c4|pc|hT|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pc|s9|pc|s4|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|mc|8|nt|athene: that's why it would have been better to cash the other spade first, i think|pg||
nt|athene: then declarer ends up having to lead diamonds from his hand both times|pg||
nt|athene: a spec points out east could just have kept his fourth club|pg||
nt|athene: that would work too :)|pg||
nt|athene: no point keeping little spades|pg||
nt|athene: you know you are never leading those, given dummy's spade winners|pg||
nt|athene: getting only 50 instead of 100 might be quite costly for EW since many NS pairs will be pushed to 3@H |pg||
nt|athene: most will open 1@C in third seat you would think|pg||
nt|athene: so the fact that NS "could" have just passed the board out might not be that relevant|pg||
pg||

pc|sQ|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s4|pc|s6|pc|sK|pg||
nt|athene: given how reluctant east was to pass 3@C out it's quite likely he has a singleton|pg||
nt|athene: well, it doesn't matter anyway, because even if he led @CQ-K-A-10, he can't get back to hand to finesse against the 9, so west can score it on a spade overruff|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|cJ|pc|cT|pg||
nt|athene: not trivial to lay down the @CA now because if the defence get to draw a third round of trumps you can only ruff one thing in hand|pg||
nt|athene: and south might think he needs to ruff two things (spade and diamond)|pg||
nt|athene: he doesn't know the @DA is going to appear|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|h9|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c7|nt|athene: of course, playing this way you sometimes look silly when trumps are 2-2 and you let both defenders get a ruff|pg||
mc|9|nt|athene: but i think it was best play to leave the @CA|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sK|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|pc|s4|pc|s8|pg||
nt|athene: but i can't see many south players leading the @DA|pg||

pc|dA|pc|dQ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: that was weird play|pg||
pc|d8|pc|c2|pc|d4|pc|dK|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: you can try @SK then @SA|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: when they break 2-2 it doesn't hurt to lead the @CJ does it? go for 12 tricks?|pg||

nt|athene: but when the cards have given you 12 tricks, you have to take them, at MP|pg||
nt|athene: EW will wander into 4@S after 1nt from north i imagine - normally after a 1nt opener you know where all the cards are but here north isn't guaranteed to have the @SQ for a 15-17 ...|pg||
nt|athene: notrump so declarer still has a trump guess|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|d|mb|3C|nt|athene: 2@D was spades + another?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 2@S a little conservative, but west can catch up now|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: ok i'm told 2@D was hearts or the black suits|pg||
mb|p|pc|s6|nt|athene: clearly that is news to west|pg||
nt|athene: at MP you tend to favour 5-4 spade fits over 5-3 club fits, if you know what is going on|pg||
nt|athene: on the bright side, playing in clubs has induced south to lead a spade and resolve the guess i was babbling about :)|pg||
