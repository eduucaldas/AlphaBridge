pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|danilo1: as cards are ... best lead for defense ... only one to put South in hand before 2@S discarded on @D |pg||
nt|yuval10: and it remains to be seen whether N will play another @h or switch to @s|pg||
nt|danilo1: just need to foellow now|pg||

pc|c9|pc|h5|pc|d5|pc|d8|pg||
nt|danilo1: he opened his pair the chance for very good score by the lead ... (thk 2@H will be popular contract) ... and than - rotated all 180 degrees ... casching @SA would be at least ...|pg||
nt|danilo1: probably normal (1 trick difference) ... small @S is vera bay (2 tricks away)|pg||
mc|9|nt|danilo1: shoud be good score for EW (or deserved bad for NS)|pg||

nt|danilo1: HI Shirl @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: @H |pg||

pc|hK|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||

nt|danilo1: after this Dble, noone will stop North|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|sybarra: S  may pull the brake handle |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: 4 @S not easy but should make |pg||
nt|danilo1: leading paitr has been Doubled in 2@D for -1100 ... so expecting change in the lead (EW will probably be first after this board)|pg||
nt|sybarra: so this will not be good, unless opps help |pg||

nt|sybarra: likely to see the score a few more times |pg||
nt|danilo1: or ... if I look better .. maybe not (for me not good) 4@C opening bid ... and 3NT ... |pg||
nt|danilo1: ..difficult defense is beating 3NT (@S lead and @H10 back) - so let us wait|pg||
nt|sybarra: can they get to 3 nt if W  opens 1 @C ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or 2 if it is precision like?|pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting hand,  would love to see other auctions |pg||
