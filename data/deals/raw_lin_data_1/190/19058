pc|d7|mc|6|nt|rv: interesting play in 3@s, South could be under some pressure after @c ruff, but no quick entry to East to run @s |pg||
nt|derric: depends on the rebid of W, many have 1NT show 18-20 (or less) |pg||
nt|rv: suspect 3@s will be go one off in practise|pg||
nt|rv: if played by East, played by West it is lot tougher to defend and could even make'|pg||
nt|derric: north has a difficult lead problem against 3@s|pg||
nt|jcomyn: precision will be played in 1h or 2c by N|pg||
nt|rv: I suspect West will compete till atleast 2@s level|pg||
nt|derric: how do you end in 2@c?|pg||
nt|rv: this will be excellent result for N-S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: after 1c - 1d - 1h maybe|pg||
nt|derric: by not overcalling on the first round?|pg||
nt|rv: N-S lying 19th and E-W lying 30th|pg||

nt|rv: Kandemir-Kolata followed by Gawrys-Kalita, Buras-Narkiewicz, Balicki-Pepsi|pg||
