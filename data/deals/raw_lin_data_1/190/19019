mb|1S|mb|d|mb|2C|an|!D|nt|psyck: 20, this & 1 more set of 10|pg||
mb|d|nt|blum1956: 4@h is the best spot, the score depending on the trump guess|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|blum1956: and on the first lead of course|pg||
nt|psyck: @d will be lead after N showed them|pg||
nt|blum1956: Pszczola's 2@c look  like a transfer|pg||
mb|3S|nt|psyck: E will probably bid 3@h when he comes out of the trance|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@H from East - or will he go for slam?|pg||
nt|psyck: oh well, i should stop guessing|pg||
mb|d|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|blum1956: So it is natural to predict 11 tricks in hearts. But EW still need to discover their @h fit|pg||
nt|pelu: E too strong for 3@h - min 4@h and now he has shown a hand to 4+@h|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5H|nt|pelu: bad bidding by E he never show his @H-fit - if he bid 4@H and not 4@C = a hand too strong for direct 4@h - 3Nt (vasted values in @S = no slam)|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: well, at least E finally shows his @h , better than ending in 5@c|pg||
nt|vugraphpl3: information www.poznan2011.pl|pg||
nt|pelu: poor West - can he guess partners bidding :)|pg||
nt|pelu: East had nice bidding to 3@S, but then he fall of the horse by bidding 4@c|pg||
nt|psyck: i'm not sure about E jumping to 4@h, as pd may not have 4 @h's, maybe best was to cue something & bid @h|pg||
nt|blum1956: Anyway partner did not use the !5d bidding card - so it is time to pass|pg||
nt|blum1956: 5@d i mean|pg||
nt|psyck: W is lost, he still does not know if @h is a fit|pg||
nt|psyck: but know 6 @c will be too high|pg||
nt|blum1956: He studies in his mind the dark picture of partner playing 5@h on 4-2 fit or like|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|6H|nt|psyck: i hope he is not wondering if pd is asking for 3rd round @h control for @c grand|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@C 1@S X sh promise a 4 card @H, so no problem for East to support @Hs - durecht or 3@S first (a good bid)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d7|nt|psyck: this was not difficult a lead to find on the bidding|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d9|pc|dA|pg||
nt|blum1956: One more excellent score for the NS - this time close to 100%|pg||
nt|pelu: only 1 good news - East has to play the contract himself|pg||
pc|h9|nt|blum1956: It depends in fact on whether East guesses the trumps right|pg||

mb|5H|nt|blum1956: 5@h doubled is only 200 for the NS while in 5@s they need to guess the @sK right|pg||
