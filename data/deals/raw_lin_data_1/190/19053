pc|c2|pg||
nt|psridhar: playing nat methods -ew may end in 3! after 2N opg|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c8|nt|psridhar: 3@s|pg||
pc|h8|nt|petergill: N led @CA on grounds that he has another ace for 2 ruffs, and South with Hx in @c might bid 3@C|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|petergill: @CJ suit pref for @S|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||

pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|d2|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h3|pc|hK|pg||
nt|geot: 140|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hJ|nt|petergill: On @DJ lead (my choice, by elimination - partner with 3 or 4 @H's might not want club ruffs, and on the bidding @CK is likely to be on my right), declarer can still make 9 tricks |pg||
pc|h4|pc|d4|pg||
mc|9|nt|petergill: perhaps not 9 tricks|pg||
nt|psridhar: better than 3@s whicch fares a trick less|pg||
nt|geot: so +140 should give a bit over average|pg||
nt|petergill: Best defence might be @D, @D, @SQ - rise ace and exit spade to endplay West|pg||
nt|petergill: Some Wests will open 2NT, get overboard (in 3@S), so that was a triumph for the 1@c opening|pg||
nt|geot: the more you talk, Peter, I feel the estimate for 140 should be higher than "a bit over average":). Maybe like 70 pct|pg||
nt|petergill: or 80%|pg||
nt|geot: we will see:)|pg||
nt|petergill: On Bd 1, making 4@H would be 85%|pg||
nt|petergill: Website is not updating, stuck on Bd 62|pg||
nt|petergill: This happens sometimes, we will advise you when it is working again|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 1 is interesting, because careful play should land 4@H, but perhaps after 2 weeks' bridge, not every expert is careful?|pg||
nt|psridhar: also , 'careful experts' are slow -and thats disallowed in pairs|pg||
nt|psridhar: quick thinkers are at an adv in MP|pg||

nt|geot: no|pg||
nt|psridhar: slam needs @d finesse + trumps to break|pg||
nt|geot: to tough, club K onside and trumps must be 3-2 as well|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@D - @H's|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|s6|pg||

pc|d4|nt|psridhar: less odds than a finesse i mean|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d6|pg||
pc|c5|mc|12|nt|petergill: With 4-4 fits, only 8 trumps, slams are often very dodgy, need 3-2 breaks|pg||
nt|geot: yeah. It is a game contract, and in fact a boring one:(|pg||
nt|vugraphplf: Michal Klukowski is not even a Junior yet. Playing with his father.|pg||
pg||
qx|o6|st||md|4SQ93HQ72DKQT2CT53,SAK8HJT653D854CA9,SJ652H84DJ973CK62,ST74HAK9DA6CQJ874|sv|e|mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|geot: but those who overbid will be rewarded this time. |pg||
mb|1D!|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|psridhar: one more 4@h ?|pg||
nt|petergill: The field in this Final is very even, lacking big-name superstar pairs.|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@D = @H|pg||
nt|psridhar: some big names are playing with non-regular partners|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|geot: Again 8 card @H fit, and weak diamonds. Sort of similar hand to the previous one|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: 3N may not make on @d lead- 4@h can|pg||
nt|geot: Both these two boards are better played in @Hs|pg||
pc|dK|nt|petergill: Philippe Cronier won the Mixed Pairs and Mixed Teams, and his wife Benedicte won the Mixed Teams and is leading the Women's Pairs fairly easily|pg||
nt|vugraphplf: Running scores at http://b.poznan2011.pl/op/opf.html|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D probably was GF checkback (Two Way Checkback) with 2@H = 3 @H's|pg||
nt|geot: I am sure some pairs will play 3NT on both these boards, so maybe just being in heart games gives a small plus|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
nt|petergill: then 4@h fast arrival, no slam interest|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|psridhar: there again , those who read the bulletin, may lead a @s -not @d :)|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|pc|c9|nt|psridhar: but a @d shift also works|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h8|pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||
nt|petergill: At matchpoints, playing 4@h instead of 3NT can be very attractive, as 620 beats 600 and 650 beats 630. At imps, where those differences are only 1 imp, 3NT can be more attractive|pg||
mc|10|nt|petergill: Philippe Cronier's expert technique of "setting up the side suit first" was instructive on Bd 6|pg||
nt|psridhar: entry to side suit was in trumps.. sound technique in general indeed|pg||
nt|geot: Played by West (without the transfer) it could have been interesting if N does not hit the diamond lead|pg||
nt|petergill: Rewording what I wrote: Many experts play 4@H or 4@S with 8 card fits at matchpoints, but look for 3NT at imps, as the extra trick in 4@H or 4@S is worth many matchpoitns but few ...|pg||
nt|petergill: imps|pg||
nt|geot: I am sure some will make 11 tricks on this board, where the contract is played by West|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, no @D lead = 11 tricks  |pg||
nt|psridhar: NS currently 9th|pg||
nt|petergill: Scores still not updating at http://b.poznan2011.pl/op/opf.html|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|psridhar: NS hv climbed to 5th now|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@S = transfer, i.e. no 4 card major|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2:  running scores updated - Rasmussen - Malinowski now 1st|pg||
nt|psridhar: 10 tricks i can see in @c -can they make 5@c ?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|geot: Yes, Rasmussen (Norway)- Malinowski (England/Poland/Norway:)) in the lead. I hope they stay there....|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: I think 2@d would be to play over 2@C, and as NS cannot have a @H fit, 2@H is relay, invit or better, I think|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|petergill: 3NT needs @CQ to drop and @d finesse or misdefence, not good odds at matchpoints|pg||
nt|psridhar: NT wont play well for NS-they shd play a @C partial, tough holding 24 hcp and all the aces|pg||
nt|psridhar: even 5@c d1 is not bad as 3N rates to go down more|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 4: 140 for EW was 92%, 110 for EW would be 80%|pg||
nt|geot: Game in @C is not bad when you see N/S cards, more or less cold if clubs are friendly|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: They bid the slow way to 3@C. We don't know exactly what all the bids mean|pg||
nt|psridhar: passing 3@c is a winning decision as cards lie, but i suspect they may be unique in the field|pg||
pc|hK|nt|psridhar: a near top |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|hT|pg||
nt|geot: Yes, you were right Peter.....that 2@H (no 4) +140 was huge|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|c4|pc|s9|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h4|nt|petergill: but South might bid on with e.g. 3@D or 4@C in that auction, liking his singleton in unbid suit, and the good but unlucky 5@C would be reached |pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
nt|psridhar: where a rebid of 1@S by opener shows an unbal hand, N will try 3@C , else 2N more likely from him|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h8|pc|c9|pc|sK|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C - 1@D - 1@S - 2NT - now South might bid 3@D.  |pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|pc|c8|pc|h7|pg||
nt|geot: 5@C has an additional chance, @DK doubleton onside|pg||

nt|petergill: Yes, West's imaginative response worked well|pg||
nt|psridhar: compare 1@s with 3@c ( weak NT contract) - we will get an idea of MP ( 50% will be in 1N doing worse)|pg||

nt|psridhar: going d1 now -losing 5 more red suit tricks|pg||
nt|petergill: 130 on Bd 7 is worth 88% so far, but Bd 8 (good for EW) will cancel that out|pg||
pc|h8|nt|yuval10: -1 is currently worth 60% for NS|pg||
nt|geot: Easy for us....who can see the club finesse works and not the diamond finesse. We can see he could have ruffed two diamonds, finessed clubs and scored 110 easily|pg||
nt|psridhar: but why not spurn both finesses and make your contract ?|pg||

pc|hA|pc|hT|pg||
pc|cK|pc|sT|pc|d2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|psridhar: tough guess of course |pg||
pc|dA|mc|6|nt|yuval10: they can't be so sure about it. 2@c seem to be makeable|pg||
nt|petergill: Great opening lead by Ginossar put declarer under pressure and declarer misguessed the play badly|pg||
nt|yuval10: and 2@c is better than 1@s of course|pg||
nt|geot: It was a good lead|pg||
nt|psridhar: at IMPs it is easy -take youor 7 tricks and run....|pg||
nt|petergill: so a good round for the Israelis, I was wrong about Bd 8, will be close to average|pg||
nt|geot: Note that N/S may win a partscore in diamonds on board 8|pg||
nt|petergill: NS 3rd now after 8 boards scored|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@d is making, how to get there is a different story|pg||
nt|yuval10: Helness and Moleberg actually made 3@h in the NS cards|pg||
nt|petergill: Gula - Taczewski, aided by their lucky slam 980 on Bd 5, in the lead now|pg||

nt|petergill: If S pauses (this S didn't) over 1NT, or Dbls 1NT, there's no problem picking @HK|pg||
nt|geot: South had shown AK fo clubs and A of spades, so I must admit declarer was perfectly trapped into this|pg||
nt|petergill: a good alternative when @HQ won was to cross to @DA, ruff club with @HJ then @h to ten |pg||
nt|petergill: which is effectively a "dummy reversal", would be good play|pg||
nt|geot: 460 on no 9 gave 62 %|pg||
nt|petergill: could be wrong if N has 3 clubs and @HK to play the line I suggest, but|pg||
nt|petergill: the non-cover of @HQ by N mildly suggests no king in N|pg||
nt|psridhar: makiing 4@h was worth 75%|pg||
nt|petergill: and at this level, holding off with Kxx in trumps over ace is fairly normal, even for pair in 49th place|pg||
nt|geot: The new leaders Gula -Taschewski got 100 pct for 490 on board no 9|pg||

pc|s4|pg||
nt|psridhar: 800 is possible|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hT|pc|c3|nt|geot: yes 2NT is an option if it shows "tow places to play", but to be fair: I will admit I would have bid 3@H myself (not that that help them...)|pg||

mb|2N|nt|geot: I like 2NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar: Dbl will look for unbal hand from E|pg||

pc|h3|nt|psridhar: 2N is no cakewalk|pg||
nt|psridhar: may go down|pg||
nt|geot: I guess 2@S still would have been natural from West. |pg||
pc|h2|nt|psridhar: likely go down i think|pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer has 4 sure tricks, not a great start in 2NT|pg||
nt|geot: The 2NT bid makes it so much easier if East has values. However East was a passed hand.|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|pg||
nt|psridhar: poor @s spots = declarer cant attack any suit for devloping tricks|pg||
nt|geot: low spade?|pg||
nt|psridhar: play @h back -the 8 spot is falling |pg||
nt|geot: twice a low spade from West will work best, but...|pg||
nt|psridhar: or concede 3 and develop 2 in @s|pg||
nt|petergill: the low spade idea is to try to fell a doubleton or singleton honour by playing low @s twice|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|pc|hT|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|geot: would have worked best this time|pg||
nt|psridhar: if S is tempted to attack @s now, declarer can do well |pg||
nt|psridhar: may be 7 tricks then|pg||
nt|petergill: Polish leads - bottom of doubleton- so S marked by @h3 opening lead with AQxxx in @H so N must have short spade honour so low spade at trick 2, as recommended by Geo, was 100% best ...|pg||
nt|petergill: play |pg||

pc|s8|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|psridhar: now N is ripe for endplay in minors|pg||
nt|psridhar: a low @d now will do it -for 7 tricks|pg||

pc|d5|pc|dQ|nt|psridhar: S hand at this stage is dead-declarer knoows about his 5-4 in Majors|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|geot: Where S does not open 2@H as at this table, at many tables the bidding will go 1NT-p-p...and South will for sure balance....|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|nt|geot: Will S move to 4@S?|pg||
nt|psridhar: 3N over 2@s =choice of game|pg||
nt|psridhar: S has an alternate source of tricks in @c|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar: + bits in reds..so well judged |pg||
pc|h4|nt|psridhar: correct @c guess = 630 even |pg||
nt|geot: yes, agree. But then the doubleton of hearts could have been an extra trick in spades. Still, passing is a reasonable decision|pg||
nt|petergill: ! would bid 2NT over 2@S to show 18,  5332. 3NT to me is more like 6322 19. But hardly any expert except me  ever seems to play in 2NT, even at matchpoints|pg||
