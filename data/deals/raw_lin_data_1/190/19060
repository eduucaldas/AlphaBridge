nt|athene: -200 is just too much of a worry|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, was tough, N did all he could too|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think S, with 4 trumps and a stiff spade should have bid 3@d over 2@s|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|s5|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: north's 3@C was a bit weird but obviously he didn't want to double and hear hearts from his partner|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|nt|psyck: Yes, S could bid more at some time, I don;t think N could do anything different as it went|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|athene: specs suggest that north might double 3@S, but you are not so aggressive doubling partscores for one down if opps are not vul|pg||
nt|athene: because turning 50 into 100 often is not that big a deal anyway|pg||
nt|athene: it's not like turning 100 into 200 which is worth a big risk|pg||

pc|d2|pc|c4|pc|d8|pg||
nt|athene: if north did double then south might bid 4@D - if you can make a partscore your way it's always just bad news to let opps get away with losing a 50 or two|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|athene: even with a decent six-card suit|pg||
nt|henryb:  Only 6 pairs on board 2 played in @d, and many sold out to low level spade contracts|pg||
nt|psyck: You could probably count the people bidding 2@d at this vul in the fingers of 1 hand|pg||
nt|athene: i sympathise with 3@C - west could have had some clubs on the bidding and 2@DX is pretty much sure to be bad|pg||
nt|athene: of course, most of the time 3@C will be bad too, but sometimes you might escape|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|s2|nt|henryb:  question is whether you should try your 6 card suit. Since partner did not make a takeout double he probably has a flaw, and the flaw id more likely clubs than spades|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|psyck: I don't have anything much for or against 3@c, it could work if you have a semblence of a fit or if opps bid on, while you may be in another misfit at a higer level on the other ...|pg||
