pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so to get 120 instead of 140 here could be a poor score for EW|pg||

mb|p|nt|MolvaM: well I dont agree with wests bidding here|pg||
nt|MolvaM: that 1nt 2nt sequence is over-conservative|pg||
nt|MolvaM: he has 12 hcp AND a 5 card major|pg||
nt|MolvaM: that qualifies for a 2@h response in my book|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and to add insult to injury 2nt goes down with good def|pg||
nt|MolvaM: even good def is not needed. just play clubs after getting the @dA|pg||

pc|s9|pc|d5|pc|sK|pc|s7|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|hK|nt|MolvaM: but EW would probably go up to 5@s which would fail|pg||

nt|MolvaM: each session consists of 10 boards|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|dT|nt|MolvaM: this is possible thanks to pre duplicating of boards so that everybody plays the same boards at the same time|pg||
nt|MolvaM: this is called a "Barometer" event|pg||
nt|MolvaM: for a long time we had been used to the style that the boards are played at one table and then circulated across the room for about 12 rounds|pg||
