mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: Not the greatest time for one of Ish Delmonte's slightly offbeat 1NT overcalls|pg||
mb|p|pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: Artur already played for Norway, in the Nordic Championships recently|pg||

pc|c4|nt|petergill: Ish Delmonte preferred bidding 1Nt to bidding the very weak @h suit, which might be passed out in a 5-1 fit. I prefer @H myself, but I can see all 52 cards. |pg||

pc|sT|pc|sQ|nt|petergill: Over 1@C openers that are less than 4 cards about 20 to 30% of the time, the need for a club stopper is regarded by some (not me) as a quaint and archaic concept.   |pg||
mc|7|nt|Walddk2: Last board of the session coming up shortly. Many thanks again to Monika, great concentration!|pg||

mb|p|nt|petergill: And conservative old? me? I think that 1@c has 4+ cards more than half the time, so a stopper would be very nice|pg||
nt|vugraphpl7: see you at 14.30|pg||
mb|2D|nt|petergill: Ish's excellent rapid discarding on the long clubs fooled NS - typical Ish Delmonte, getting 90 out of the mire with fine deceptive card play|pg||
mb|d|mb|2S|nt|petergill: Ish came 2nd in the Vanderbilt in the Grue team this year|pg||
mb|3D|nt|Walddk2: 2@D = both majors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: with longer spades|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D = shows about what East has: I think they play it as 5+ spades and 4 @H |pg||
mb|3S|nt|petergill: 3@s due to the extra spade|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2: Ish is not thrilled, but he finds a nice dummy|pg||

nt|petergill: This looks like 9 tricks. West would have doubled 3@D for 200, if given the chance|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|cT|pc|c5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks all for watching. We hope you enjoyed the show as much as we did and will be back for more half past the hour|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: 30 minutes later than scheduled|pg||
nt|petergill: Ish is (I think) Australia's top ranked player - his WBF record is at http://www.wbfmasterpoints.com/playerdetail.asp?Code=5707|pg||
