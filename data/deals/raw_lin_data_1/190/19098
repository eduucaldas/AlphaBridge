nt|don_kapu: this bidding like a song from Beatles : YELLOW SUBMARINE|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|janm: Of course, with no defense and lots of extra offense it was clear to S to pull - he really couldn't expect to beat 3@c|pg||
nt|telkom2011: but continue in...long and winding road..."|pg||
nt|vugraphzhz: @h After this session, an hour breaktime, and we'll start the Final Round 6 @h|pg||
nt|rodal f: Why do S deniey the @S after the neg X from pard?|pg||
nt|janm: Well, NS seem to have gotten to the right strain - I'm not sure what the right level is|pg||
nt|don_kapu: and now come The Rolling Stones bidding : I Can Get Know|pg||
nt|janm: N did well to bid 3@s, concluding that his partner didn't have many clubs or hearts, so probably had spades - surely if he'd had more diamonds he would have opened 3@d|pg||
nt|janm: There are only 3 losers in 4@s, but I don't see 10 winners|pg||
nt|janm: I think opposite a passed hand, S would be optimistic to bid a game, even with all that shape|pg||
nt|rodal f: The level use to be at ure home for a nice dinner and vine:)|pg||
nt|don_kapu: "I can't get no satisfaction"|pg||
nt|janm: Let's see - lead a trump, win and play a diamond, win and play a second trump, diamond honor, ruff a diamond - maybe he can come to 10 tricks|pg||
mb|4S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cT|nt|janm: What if the defense starts with clubs to tap declarer? ruff, diamond, another club ruffed, now I think he can't get the diamonds going because of lack of entries and can't come to ...|pg||
nt|janm: 10 by cross-ruffing|pg||
nt|janm: So this looks to me as if it's the best start to the defense|pg||
nt|don_kapu: must play @D first to make a cross ruff type|pg||
nt|janm: not enough tricks on a cross ruff though - only 1 diamond and 8 trumps|pg||
pc|h3|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|don_kapu: my line of play is to develop side suit|pg||
nt|telkom2011: yes Jan, one down will come|pg||
nt|janm: Might try pitching hearts on clubs here, but that will just delay the inevitable tap|pg||
nt|janm: the problem with trying to develop the diamonds after you've been tapped is that there won't be an entry to take them after trumps are gone|pg||
nt|don_kapu: Good play of Nicolas, change the loser trick|pg||
nt|don_kapu: maybe Nicolas will develop @D suit|pg||
nt|don_kapu: and dont want short trump in dummy|pg||
nt|don_kapu: made difficult for W now|pg||
nt|janm: Another club here, S can pitch another heart if he wants to, but then E can shift to a low heart and when W wins the @d A, she can lead a second heart, so declarer will be tapped ...|pg||
nt|janm: twice and won't be able to take the diamonds.|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|dJ|pc|h4|pc|d3|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|nt|janm: I'm not sure she's getting to 8 here - needs to ruff diamonds in order to ruff hearts or clubs in hand and that little 7 of spades might start looking pretty big|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|sJ|nt|don_kapu: ok, - 1 if ruff with 8@S|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|janm: can ruff with the 8 here, and then ruff a round suit with a high trump and ruff a diamond with an honor, and another round suit ruff, but then dummy's last 2 cards are a losing ...|pg||
