pc|s9|nt|kareno: Declarer will have one dummy entry and will use it, I'm sure, for a heart play.  Eventually the defense will have to give a second black suit trick for eight|pg||

mc|8|nt|toral5: ofcourse 2nd @C ll be ducked|pg||
nt|kareno: Has only one chance for heart finesse.  They will be playing on clubs.  So get all the information you can before making the heart play.|pg||
nt|toral5: so whats wrong with @D immediately?|pg||
nt|toral5: if @H guess right,always 8 without touching @S|pg||
nt|kareno: It hurts nothing to play the spade.  And it can gain information or cause the defense to shift - sometimes to a heart which helps declarer a lot.|pg||
nt|toral5: give north @H king and see the hurting effect:)|pg||
