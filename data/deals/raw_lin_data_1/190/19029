nt|panja: 4@H will not make, nor will 4@S for EW here...|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|panja: of course..because of the @S suit distribution in EW hand..and because W is on lead....S might end up making 9 tricks..|pg||

nt|geot: Hi all|pg||
nt|panja: hi|pg||
nt|geot: I watched this hand at another table just before joining here. E/W found the spad fit, but N/S dived in 3@C and got doubled. Got away with minus 100|pg||
pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|3H|mb|4H|mb|d|nt|geot: 30 HCPs N/S, 4-4 in spades and a nice sidesuit. Still just a game I guess, but 6@S is makeable|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|geot: Not a bad slam when you see only N/Ss cards. The spade suit could have been without a loser, and if there is a spade loser as here, 12 tricks depends on the diamonds|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|geot: Lots of specs are right in that there are twelve tricks in both spades and NT. It depends on a diamond guess which certainly is possible to find....when West has pre-empted |pg||

nt|geot: 5Hx whould have been costly, 1400, but less than slam. Still 1400 would have given N/S a very good score. 680 will be the result at many tables|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|geot: 3NT is a reasonable contract, because E/W holds the 9 and 10 of hearts. But then again, the diamonds are not friendly|pg||
nt|panja: this will make...|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: running scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/op/opf.html|pg||
nt|panja: cards are favourable..|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphpl2: www.poznan2011.pl|pg||
nt|geot: Not really? Diamonds are not, but clubs are. |pg||
nt|panja: most important, @H are..|pg||
pc|h8|nt|panja: after winning first @H..Declarer will play @D in  safe way..|pg||
nt|geot: If he playes a low diamond to the king and low towards the A-9 he should be close to making|pg||
nt|panja: for the double....best way is to play @DK and then play a small to @D9.....|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|geot: yes|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d3|nt|geot: but there are entry problems. So the best diamond play gives declarer just three diamond tricks|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|d5|nt|panja: but then, even a more careless play by West...will still lead to 9 tricks..|pg||
pc|c4|nt|geot: the club honors are both onside, that helps of course|pg||

nt|vugraphpl2: information www.poznan2011.pl|pg||
nt|panja: silly play to pass @D...|pg||
nt|geot: The defence has now 2 hearts and 1one diamond trick already, so declarer can not establish diamonds anymore|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s6|pc|c5|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|cT|pg||
pc|c6|mc|7|nt|geot: You are right, to pass the diamond to S ended the hopes for declarer|pg||
nt|panja: and it didn't seem like being purposeful in any way|pg||
nt|geot: Right. not when N showed out, he should have gone for plan B then....|pg||
nt|geot: so if he wins the diamond K and play a club he can win 3+2+2+2|pg||

mb|1H|mb|d|nt|panja: and in MP....S should make 12 tricks..|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: running scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/op/opf.html|pg||
nt|panja: take @C finesse to discard a losing @S...|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: Ns 14th place|pg||
nt|geot: Nice @H fit N/S, and game should be reached|pg||
mb|3D|nt|panja: then take trump finesse...and then @D finesse..|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: EW 30th|pg||
mb|3S|nt|geot: The club finesse is a favourite, but on a spade lead taking a club finesse can go wrong of course|pg||
nt|panja: true, but the dbl clears the air...|pg||
nt|geot: Even though West made the t/o double|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|geot: yes, in MP a club finesse is a good play|pg||
nt|panja: well..in IMP's...such a finesse risks the contract...so is contra indicated...|pg||
nt|panja: in MP..it is almost mandatory|pg||
pc|s3|nt|panja: and Kwiecien will go for it I guess|pg||
nt|geot: Let see if Kwiecien agrees:) He is certainly a strong MP player, I think he has won the World Pairs once|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||

nt|panja: great men think alike....is that what some great man said?|pg||
nt|geot: he he. Even greater those who does the right thing when they dont see all 13 cards|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|dT|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|panja: did you see the irony...I typed 'not a moment of thought'....and then I claimed it was thinking alike...|pg||
nt|geot: but this is a hand where the declaring would have been a coplete other thing in teams|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|h3|pg||

nt|geot: but 16 hcps....no choice as far as |pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: running scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/op/opf.html|pg||

nt|vugraphpl2: information www.poznan2011.pl|pg||
nt|geot: as far as I am concerned no choice, have to open 1NT if you play 15-17NTs|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: 11 boards to go in this session|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: yes, it's true|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|panja: I would have considered 1@C if 1Nt were 15-17|pg||
nt|geot: but the lack of aces proves it all, on a spade lead 3NT will go down|pg||
mb|3N|nt|panja: 3@D..seems to be artificial...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|geot: I think you will be lonely in the 1@C group|pg||
nt|panja: quite likely|pg||
nt|geot: West has to find the spade lead, or else 3NT is fine|pg||
nt|panja: of course, I didn't say I would have opened 1@C...I would have considered it....|pg||
pc|h6|nt|geot: yes|pg||

nt|panja: in MP....the approach has be bolder...|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: running scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/op/opf.html|pg||
nt|panja: on that count, I thought E was a bit timid here..|pg||
nt|geot: Now 9 top tricks, the defence can do nothing but not mess it up and give declarer overtrick|pg||
nt|panja: I don't know what 2@H was...|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|pc|cK|pc|d3|pg||

nt|panja: y|pg||
nt|panja: what was 3@D?|pg||
nt|panja: Maria, do you have any idea?|pg||
nt|panja: oh ok, Costel Lung tells me it is Rubensohl...substitute for 3@H control asking bid|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: ask for stopper of @H|pg||
nt|panja: thx|pg||
nt|panja: I was wondering whether there was a case for @S lead|pg||
nt|panja: clearly, since E did not support @H..@H lead was not a great idea|pg||
nt|panja: and with 4@S, North would have tried to look for a @S fit..|pg||
nt|panja: so..@S could be an option....|pg||
pg||

mb|2S|mb|d|nt|panja: we now have pair rank 2 in NS position|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|an|lebensohl|nt|panja: so this contest will be much  more interesting|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|geot: Ish and Ash here N/S, by teammate N:) Both Kiwis originally, but Delmonte has lived in Australia a long time|pg||
nt|panja: ah...Leb has got EW into a poor spot|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|geot: my teammate that was, not by....something wrong with my (by) key board?|pg||
nt|panja: W doesn't accept the 3@D spot...because it is MP I guess..|pg||
nt|panja: but E is likely to think W has extras|pg||
nt|geot: I saw Bach Delmonte started the final |pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: West has not neccesarily shown a huge hand here, as he would have bid 3@H directly over 2NT in that case|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
nt|panja: on @H..N should play small...in tempo|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|geot: East got the point, West is not VERY strong....because he did not bid 3@H directly over 2NT which asked for 3@C|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|hK|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|nt|geot: And passed 3@H even though he had values|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s7|pg||
nt|panja: y..certainly not very strong..|pg||

pc|c7|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|pc|hT|nt|panja: in which case E might have a raise....|pg||

nt|panja: Maria, did W make 9 or 10 tricks last deal?|pg||
nt|geot: On the previous hand declarer had to take the club finesse when he was in dummy for the last time to make ten tricks|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|vugraphpl2: 10 tricks|pg||
nt|panja: thx|pg||
mb|2C|an| |mb|p|mb|2D|an| |mb|p|mb|2H|an| |mb|p|mb|2S|an| |nt|panja: this is 9 tricks in Nt for EW..but at MP, things could take twists and turns|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: i missclicked claim :(|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: sorry @h|pg||
nt|panja: np|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: yes, he played carefully and had the @H10 as an entry, and the clubfinesse worked|pg||
mb|2N|an| |mb|p|mb|3D|an| |mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|geot: but 170 on that one will most likely be a small minus for E/W. Some in game, and almost everyone will make ten tricks|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s6|pc|h5|nt|panja: he will run a @H now...|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|geot: East has a huge responders hand here, but no fit, so reasonably he got no slam thougths|pg||

nt|geot: ok, because it looked like only 9 tricks which would have been far below average for E/W|pg||
nt|panja: the kibitzers should check the score on board 9|pg||

nt|panja: http://b.poznan2011.pl/op/opf.html|pg||

mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|geot: if 2NT is 20-21 west has 12 good points, and will most likely go to slam|pg||

mb|p|pc|cK|nt|panja: 12 tricks..every which way...|pg||
nt|geot: 11 top tricks, and the diamond finesse gives the 12th|pg||
nt|panja: not chance to make 13|pg||
nt|mareczek: currently bach Delmonte are 6-th and Kwiecien - Jag 13th|pg||

nt|mareczek: sorry, names chaqnged 3 times|pg||
nt|panja: 33@D..and finesse|pg||
nt|panja: so a duck is unlikely|pg||
nt|geot: only way to go down here is to play for a squeeze end play against S|pg||
nt|panja: yes|pg||
nt|panja: but..the major suit play will tell you not to try that option|pg||
nt|geot: if you give S the @D Q that would have been the right line|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|geot: I know a few who would have opened 1NT as West, in MP.....|pg||
