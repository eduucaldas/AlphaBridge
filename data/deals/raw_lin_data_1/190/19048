mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|3D|nt|chick: a few kibs are pointing out that EW can sacrifice in 7@D quite effectively|pg||
mb|4D|nt|kareno: It's easy for us to see the club position - may not be easy to bid this one with interference, however.|pg||
mb|5D|nt|chick: one suggested opening 3@D, but I prefer E's patience to see what happens before he decides|pg||
nt|chick: 2N is undoubtedly some form of Jacoby 2n or similar forcing raise|pg||
nt|kareno: It's good to have agreements with your partner about how to handle interference over Jacoby 2nt.  Does pass mean singleton?  Double mean singleton?  Here south used a whole round ...|pg||
nt|kareno: of bidding for his message.|pg||
mb|5H|mb|7D|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chick: 3N by East over the 2N bid would have described his hand better and allowed for either minor|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kareno: So east believes in the slam :)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||
nt|kareno: However, his diamonds are one card longer and two honors stronger than the clubs.  Don't want to encourage a club lead against any contract by south.|pg||
nt|chick: West had a choice of doubling 4@D or bidding 5@D suggesting he had nothing else|pg||

nt|lebridgeur: hi all :):)|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: many controversial prediction from spec|pg||
nt|chick: many are telling me that if he played on hearts, could save one trick, which is true as the cards lie, but not at all clear to declarer|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Bessis   could pay the 4th losing trick   dearly though|pg||
nt|kareno: I think not every pair n/s will reach slam but I imagine 800 will be a good result for e/w|pg||
nt|chick: I cannot imagine any NS pair not reaching slam on this one|pg||
nt|chick: The only question is how many EW pairs will find the sacrifice|pg||

nt|kareno: I'm told currently -800 is 12 % for e/w|pg||

nt|lebridgeur: two russian players  but as opponents !|pg||

nt|lebridgeur: on previous board playing in Nt was worth 89 %|pg||
nt|chick: West had to discard something, would you prefer a club or a spade from his point of view? :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Spade is clear.  I'm not sure what 2@d meant.  If two-suited, then spades are a likely candidate.|pg||

nt|lebridgeur: 2 down a bad but popular result for EW|pg||
nt|kareno: There were ways to avoid down 2 but he would have had to work out the club position.|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 2 key cards   off side so the flat 24 hcp   does not allow to make game in the 8 cards fit|pg||

nt|lebridgeur: plus 1 is a real good score for EW  or bad for NS|pg||
nt|kareno: I think on the second heart, north must play the lowest, showing a club card, and then south can shift to clubs.|pg||
