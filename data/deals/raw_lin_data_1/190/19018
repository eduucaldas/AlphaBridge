nt|runnerup: here some tricks in nt contracts looks normal |pg||

nt|paulg:  Good afternoon everyone|pg||
pc|h5|nt|vugraphpl2: the next round should begin at 7PM schedule in your zone http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3nt is too high at least 1 down |pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||

nt|khaled_m: lovely|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|nt|runnerup: and they are good -look it came|pg||
nt|paulg:  it is a shift that is easy to find when set as a problem, and it is easy to justify, it's just that not everyone would do it at the table|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||

mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|paulg:  for some it will be spades and another suit, perhaps also some for whom it is just (very) weak|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|khaled_m: only @D lead|pg||
nt|runnerup: if ns can find 4 @s it can be made.but also  2 down possible |pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||
nt|paulg:  top heart looks the lead that everyone would make|pg||
nt|paulg:  of course some Norths might double, but not attractive opposite passed partner|pg||

pc|h9|pc|h4|pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||

nt|vugraphpl2: running scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/op/osfa2.html|pg||
nt|runnerup: my guess 25% ns -no running scores yet|pg||
nt|khaled_m: And how many would overcall 2@C paul|pg||
nt|khaled_m: yes led 3 other suits|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think slightly higher than 25%, perhaps 40%, as most will miss spades|pg||

nt|vugraphpl2: schedule www.poznan2011.pl/schedule|pg||
mb|d|nt|paulg:  everyone will overcall 2@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: double doent look average bid so some action here also|pg||
nt|paulg:  West might rebid 2@d|pg||
mb|2S|nt|paulg:  you hate to pass with six hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|khaled_m: difficult bid for West|pg||
mb|3C|nt|paulg:  I prefer 2@d to 2@s .. much more flexible and unlikely to get into trouble|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|khaled_m: How much does 2NT show|pg||
nt|paulg:  and I think South should double rather than 3@c, not that it would make a difference here|pg||
pc|sT|nt|vugraphpl2: running scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/op/osfa2.html|pg||
nt|paulg:  over East's double I think 2NT is close, perhaps like one more card, either spade or club |pg||
nt|runnerup: i think this is down and so is 2 @s also so big different perhaps|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|pc|cJ|pc|c4|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|pc|c7|nt|paulg:  if West rebids 2@d, then East can bid 2@h and try to play there, which is a lot better than 2@s|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sJ|pc|s9|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|nt|paulg:  the more I look, the more action i see the field taking on this hand|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s4|pg||
nt|paulg:  some 3@h-X for example|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||

pc|dT|pc|dK|pg||
nt|khaled_m: @DQ?|pg||
nt|khaled_m: must be a mistake|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think they were playing fast at that point|pg||
nt|khaled_m: by the operator|pg||
mc|7|nt|vugraphpl2: yes, it's my mistake, they played very fast and i missclicked....|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: the card... sorry @h|pg||
nt|paulg:  I think all the players would be very happy, and doing extremely well, if they made as few errors as our BBO operators|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: now we must wait for new pair...|pg||
nt|runnerup: this ns pair staryed this section as 7.|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: because all "tables" are playing...|pg||
nt|runnerup: my bet is that they gone down some stairs|pg||
nt|paulg:  this is the fourth day of continuous pairs, they should know where they are going|pg||
nt|paulg:  in fact I expect some of the players have become fixed to the tables, much like the screens|pg||
nt|paulg:  and tstill hey have two days to go|pg||

mb|2S|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|khaled_m: should be a problem in 4@H|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|khaled_m: now played by W North has an easy @D lead|pg||
nt|paulg:  now it is getting dangerous when the hand with @dKQJ is on lead|pg||
nt|runnerup: now ew overbids |pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: running scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/op/osfa2.html|pg||
nt|paulg:  it is still okay with the @hJ where it is|pg||
nt|paulg:  but they better not bid above five hearts|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|5H|nt|paulg:  so we don't know what system EW are playing, but it seems strange for West to take a long time to respond to 4NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|runnerup: and i am sure west doent like to be in 5|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: polish club :)|pg||

pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||

nt|vugraphpl2: running scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/op/osfa2.html|pg||
nt|paulg:  some competition here|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: 5 boards to go in this round :)|pg||
nt|runnerup: this can be in no mans land (5 level)|pg||
nt|khaled_m: And North showing up @DKQ and not bidding, south is likely to hold 6 spades or more hence short in Hearts.|pg||
mb|2D|an| |nt|paulg:  i guess East will open 1@h ... South might bid Michaels or 4@s|pg||
mb|3S|nt|paulg:  this must be a very strong multi 2@d|pg||
nt|khaled_m: Not a Michael's hand. Many play less than opening or 16+|pg||
nt|runnerup: and strong jumps by S also|pg||
mb|4C|an| |mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  the vulnerability and East's limited opening keeps West silent at the end|pg||
nt|khaled_m: 5@H good save vul against non-vul|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|paulg:  when South sees @cA and @hK from East, he may drop the singleton @sK|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|h9|pg||
nt|runnerup: now if so south sees K @s west -so just trop it|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
nt|paulg:  well done|pg||
nt|khaled_m: play safe and overtrick|pg||
nt|runnerup: wd|pg||
mc|11|nt|vugraphpl2: so we ended as first table again|pg||
nt|khaled_m: It was obvious too E could not possibly have had @SK for his Multi |pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: so again we must wait...|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: 4 boards to go :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  few will open a weak two, or multi, as East, so +450 will be an excellent score for NS|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: information www.poznan2011.pl|pg||
nt|runnerup: just bad we cant see scores other table|pg||
nt|paulg:  the live scores are working again|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|an| |mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|khaled_m: Will he pass now|pg||
nt|paulg:  light opening from West|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|runnerup: sorry 1. was 38 |pg||
nt|khaled_m: opend light so should pass 1@S|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@s is forcing in most systems|pg||
nt|khaled_m: passed hand|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: EW 89th|pg||
nt|paulg:  East was not a passed hand|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: NS 10th :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  I guess 2@d is non-forcing and West is considering whether spades will be better at matchpoints|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|paulg:  it's not clear that bidding spades with four small ones and six good diamonds is really a good idea|pg||
nt|runnerup: looks strange not to bid 1 @d first round |pg||
nt|paulg:  this competition will push EW into 2@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|paulg:  East may also call the director if he believes that South was slow on the previous round (even though it was his partner!)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hK|pg||
nt|runnerup: more bad news for ns -this makes +1|pg||
nt|paulg:  wow, pass by South is very aggressive|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|pc|h7|nt|Walddk6: http://b.poznan2011.pl/op/osfa2.html  running scores|pg||
nt|paulg:  North's double clearly takeout with four hearts|pg||
nt|khaled_m: 380 |pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: information www.poznan2011.pl|pg||
nt|paulg:  all of South's points are sitting over East, but still a huge call |pg||

nt|khaled_m: I wonder how he made 2@S|pg||
