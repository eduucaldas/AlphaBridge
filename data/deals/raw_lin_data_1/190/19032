nt|rv: at IMPs, Jas might have not doubled again and would have got plus, once he doubled again East's 4@s can't be faulted|pg||
nt|rv: maybe G Mihai could have doubled since it was MPs, maybe North could have bid 4@d on the way to 4@h|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|h2|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|nt|rv: South wasn't sure of North's strength since jump to 4@h could be variety of hands, if North had shown max for passed hand @d stiff (4@d) it would be more consultative auction|pg||

nt|rv: declarer now has 10 tricks which will be 60+% score, if Multon finds @s switch E-W should score 60+%|pg||

nt|mareczek: opening by South, sorry|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|cQ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|mareczek: or 3@c on NS|pg||
nt|mrxxx: if they lead 135 a duck is nog obvious, if they lead 2nd 4th a duck is much more difficult|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|nt|mareczek: if doubled 2 down|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h8|pg||

nt|mrxxx: think he should have ducked @d as north could have taken en play @c|pg||

mb|r|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: another MPs strategy|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|rv: North's pass of redouble should be willing to play, Ish decided to trust his opponents since he had doubled on four cards|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: now Bach wll redouble for SOS|pg||
nt|rv: he should redouble instead of bidding 2@S since he knows Ish is likely to be very short in one major|pg||
mb|r|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|rv: even 2@h double won't be a thing of beauty for N-S|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h2|nt|rv: if West starts with @h, declarer will struggle to make 5 tricks|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||

pc|s4|pc|sT|pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|rv: Ish should score 5 tricks here, 6th trick could be elusive|pg||

nt|mareczek: some EW play 3NT|pg||
nt|mrdct: so far 3NT has made 2 times and 4@h has failed 4 times|pg||
