nt|Walddk2: E-W from Poland|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|cJ|nt|brolucius: North uses check-back, but this 2@S may well be non-forcing (it will depend on the range of 1NT). Yes, it must be 12-14 and South has indeed passed.|pg||

mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Name with hidden modesty|pg||
nt|psyck: Formidables, Texan Aces, & Railways are the 3 top indian teams|pg||
mb|3H|nt|psyck: EW have a good sac here agains 5m|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@H is a game-try. West would not mention the hearts if he was sure of the level.|pg||

nt|psyck: yes 4N by N will work fine if he can find it|pg||
mb|4N|nt|brolucius: Well done!|pg||
nt|psyck: now the ball in EW court|pg||
mb|5S|nt|brolucius: Because of West's well-judged 3@H bid, East does have some chance of reading the position, but not easy. Wow! This is bidding of a high standard.|pg||

nt|psyck: yes|pg||
nt|brolucius: Thanks!|pg||
nt|vugraphplf: Running scores at http://b.poznan2011.pl/op/opf.html|pg||
nt|brolucius: +300 is excellent for N/S.|pg||
nt|psyck: only about 42% as of now 4 NS|pg||
nt|brolucius: That is 42 match-points - a very good score.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 84%|pg||
nt|psyck: aah, yes|pg||
nt|psyck: 2nd top score|pg||
nt|psyck: with only a couple allowed in 5m|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is such a great web-site. The scores click up from every table, as you watch!|pg||
nt|psyck: board 1 a bottom for NS though|pg||
nt|vugraphplf: The scores displayed seem to be accumulated in Tournament Points. To calculate the % score for each pair, divide the points score by the number of boards played, then multiply by ...|pg||
nt|vugraphplf: 2.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes 25 points and a 5-3 spade fit. Don't know what went wrong with their bidding.|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|psyck: yes, it has been extremely well organized with the gr8 web site & operators practically flawless so far|pg||
nt|brolucius: N/S buy it in a 6-3 fit with fewer than half the points. It was difficult for E/W to get into the bidding, even after a natural 1@C opening.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hi dear Anita @H|pg||
nt|brolucius: Ah, East heard me.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: David is relieved to see that I did not give *him* a @H|pg||
nt|brolucius: I could survive it.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d7|nt|brolucius: West decides to pass the take-out double.|pg||
nt|psyck: looks like no constant NS pairs like in qualification rounds, so more work for the operator in updating names|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Typical matchpoint view. He would never have passed at IMPs|pg||
nt|psyck: only 2@c, 1@d, 1@h if he gets it right|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@H went down at the one table that has played that contract, so maybe West has taken the right decision.|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|c5|pg||
nt|brolucius: But defensive prospects do not look good against 3@C.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: N-S from Israel, E-W from Sweden|pg||
nt|psyck: they cannot play a 2nd trump profitable, so 2 @h ruffs...|pg||
nt|psyck: *profitably|pg||
nt|brolucius: Roland is always happy to see pairs from Sweden doing well.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A profitable correction if Mr Burn had been here|pg||
nt|psyck: Yes, he would have pointed it out before I could correct it :)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Then I got a Danish passport, which the authorities may regret now|pg||

nt|psyck: dec wants 3@s, 3@h, 2@d, 1@c tricks, but he will not be able to get them unless defense helps|pg||

mb|3D|mb|4S|nt|brolucius: David Bakhshi has had several excellent results in the last year or so, some of them in the USA. |pg||

mb|5S|mb|d|nt|Walddk2: 4@S would make if Tom Townsend had been a rabbi|pg||

nt|brolucius: Yes, but she is not English.|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|p|mb|2N!|nt|Walddk2: 2NT good fit for clubs one would assume|pg||
nt|brolucius: Always difficult to judge minor-suit hands at match-points. Should you investigate a club slam and go past 3NT? Here West is very strong, though.|pg||
nt|psyck: should be easy to bid 6@c now, just better not bid grand|pg||
nt|brolucius: Townsend-Baknshi wait patiently to hear their fate. All will depend on opponents' bidding, which is outside their control.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|brolucius: 6NT too.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|psyck: once W rkc's, W should be able to easily place it in NT instead|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|psyck: what is the response for trump Q + 3 K's? :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|psyck: usually 4N would show trump Q + 2 K's for many |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think 4@H is a cuebid|pg||
mb|6N|nt|Walddk2: and that 4NT is RKC|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@C  1 or 4|pg||
nt|psyck: aah, ok, I though 4@c was minorwood|pg||
nt|brolucius: Excellent bidding to the best contract. Although N/S will hope that most of the field will do the same.|pg||
nt|psyck: but clearly 4N was rkc looking at 5@c|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|psyck: don't see why E did not bid 5N or something on 5@c|pg||

pc|sA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There is no 13thy trick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Revoke is the only chance|pg||
nt|psyck: no reason to rule out grand, and W's hand is unlimited, so E should just confirm all key cards & leave it to W to placve final contract I think|pg||
nt|brolucius: If South holds 5 spades (as he does), there is a double squeeze when North holds the @DQ-J. Hearts is the pivot suit.|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, needed @hQJT or @dQJ with N if 5@s with S I guess|pg||

pc|hA|pc|s5|nt|brolucius: Declarer knows about South's minor-suit holdings, from the opening lead and the fall of the @CA.|pg||
nt|psyck: but you never know what they will try at pairs|pg||
nt|brolucius: He could play AK of spades and end-play South with a diamond.|pg||
nt|psyck: true David, Declarer may think S would discard @s from Qxx when needing to guard the minors though|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, he had to discard a spade, but that does not affect the end-play. If the @SQ falls too, so much the better.|pg||

mb|1H|nt|brolucius: Worth around 80% to E/W.|pg||
nt|brolucius: And so to the last board....|pg||

pc|s4|nt|psyck: 1 Table played this in 1@hWx, an interesting choice.|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@s, 2@h, 1@d, 3@c...where 8, there nine?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Must have been 1@H - Dble - Pass - Pass. Maybe they were playing a transfer system over a double and redouble would have been artificial. |pg||

nt|brolucius: Declarer does not have much to work with. 1@S doubled has gone 800 down at one table, so 98% was available from that quarter.|pg||
