mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4C|nt|pelu: 6@D a fair slam - on a non @c-lead u can take @D from top and fines in @C if @Dq dont drop|pg||

nt|runnerup: 3nt +1 seems to be average if you just look at cards -but in shields ..dont know yet|pg||
nt|fokal: since KQ of @d are onside 3NT is the top spot here, but hard to find|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: they had great score in Board 15 : + 800 as Ew and +50 in 16|pg||
mb|p|nt|fokal: does someone know if 3@c by w would have been forcing ?|pg||
nt|pelu: and there they are :)|pg||
nt|pelu: EW play polish @c/ precision style, so I exp that 3@C = NF|pg||
nt|fokal: I've been told that no. So balicky didn't have much of a choice for his second bid|pg||
nt|fokal: he could have bid 4 @c instead|pg||
nt|fokal: but it would have been a bit too late to play 3NT :)|pg||
nt|pelu: S cant find the @H-lead|pg||
pc|d2|nt|pelu: that better than @DK - give decl a loosing option|pg||
nt|fokal: declarer may play a small to play it safe|pg||
pc|dA|nt|runnerup: he may take ace -because @h can..|pg||
pc|d5|nt|pelu: small is not safe: @H from N and 5 tricks for defense|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||
nt|fokal: Ace was safer indeed|pg||
nt|fokal: don't want a @h switch|pg||
nt|pelu: but EW has some help in their "high-jump" they came from Team-final and they %-score count 2x|pg||
