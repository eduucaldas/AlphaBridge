nt|rmb1: Looks like EW went on to 4@D over 3@S.  The auction shown now is just to move on with the play|pg||

nt|jfaria:  maybe a winner|pg||
nt|jfaria:  but doubt it was the only call t table :)|pg||
nt|rmb1: The "Law" does not suggest playing in your 8 card fit at the 4 level |pg||

mb|1C|nt|rmb1: The auction was something like 1D-1S-X-2D-3D-3S-4D...|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|jfaria:  i would x with S cards|pg||

mb|1H|nt|dburn: unclear what sort of result that will be - North-South may go plus in clubs, or East-West in spades|pg||
mb|2H|nt|dburn: but this is dangerous|pg||
mb|d|nt|jfaria:  think they will play in nt :)|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2@H is michael S+m  weak or strong|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|d|nt|rmb1: Has North anywhere to go now?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: well, if his partner had diamonds he would have somewhere to go|pg||
nt|dburn: but as it is...|pg||
nt|jfaria:  looking at S cards they dont look weak neither strong|pg||
mb|p|nt|jfaria:  i would rather bid 1@s with S hand|pg||
pc|h6|nt|rmb1: I'm just quoting a convention card for NS from a swedish competition (don't know how up to date)|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|c4|nt|dburn: this may get out for down two, but I don't think East-West have a game|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cJ|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|jfaria:  ocf c, question is if NS are faithfull to their card or if S considers his hand as strong|pg||
nt|jfaria:  basically <11 or â¥15 r standard tresholds|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|dT|pc|d8|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d9|pc|dQ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|dburn: well, getting out for down one may salvage some points if other pairs also find trouble|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c3|pc|h2|pc|c8|pg||
nt|dburn: and if he ruffs a club with the nine of spades, he may be able to manage that|pg||
nt|rmb1: Thanks to specs: the NS convention card is from this years Nordic Teams|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d5|pc|h4|pc|s8|pg||
nt|dburn: but not if he doesn't|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|d4|pc|h8|pg||
pc|h3|pc|sT|pc|sQ|pc|hT|pg||
nt|jfaria:  looks like 500|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|dK|pc|s6|pg||
nt|dburn: well, it looked like 200 for a brief moment, but I'm afraid you're right|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|s3|pc|s9|pc|sA|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s7|pc|sJ|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s5|pc|dJ|pc|h9|pc|sK|pg||
nt|jfaria:  not your fault David :)|pg||
nt|rmb1: But we have to support the Englishman :)|pg||
nt|rmb1: Running scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/op/osfa2.html|pg||
nt|rmb1: Would you prefer "English" man: BBO shows an English flag|pg||
nt|jfaria:  ok with me whatever u choose :)|pg||
nt|rmb1: ... waiting for new pair(s)|pg||

mb|1C|mb|2S|nt|jfaria:  some drama here|pg||
mb|d|mb|3S|nt|jfaria:  nt is excluded|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|jfaria:  and cant see any game with 28 hcp|pg||
nt|dburn: this won't make many tricks, if North passes|pg||
nt|jfaria:  3@s x maybe a good "cosolation" for NS|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|jfaria:  problem is n takes S X as showing nothing in@s..|pg||
nt|dburn: but that's not so good - at other tables this will start with 2NT by South, leading to 3NT down one|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sA|nt|dburn: or not down at all, if West decides a spade lead is too risky at matchpoints|pg||
pc|s5|nt|dburn: but this is down two without the option|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pc|d3|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|jfaria:  a plus for EW (>50) cant be a good result for NS|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d6|pc|c7|pc|h4|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|h2|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|pc|cJ|pc|dT|pg||
pc|c2|nt|dburn: but I must admit, I 've never seen a Frenchman make an overcall like 2@s before on this kind of hand|pg||
mc|9|pg||
qx|o28|st||md|2SQJT86H64DAKQ5CA5,S4HA7DJT8643CKJT3,SAK93HKQJ32D7C862,S752HT985D92CQ974|sv|n|nt|rmb1: There is a first for everything |pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: all sorts here - 6@s unluckily down on club lead|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|1N|mb|2S|nt|dburn: but that last board was almost certainly down two - hope the Bridgemate has the right results|pg||
nt|dburn: actually, 6@s OK even on club lead|pg||
mb|5C|nt|rmb1: From what I have heard from earlier in the event, the bridgemates could say anything :(|pg||
nt|jfaria:  Volckerplayed a lot with Pual Chemla, didnt he?|pg||
nt|fokal: no|pg||
nt|dburn: not afraid to mix it up, Levy and Volcker|pg||
nt|jfaria:  my fault then|pg||
nt|fokal: they are going to play a lot starting now|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|fokal: but volcker played a bit with Christian Mari|pg||
nt|jfaria:  in that case just antecipated|pg||
nt|jfaria:  :)|pg||
nt|fokal: with mixed results|pg||
nt|fokal: they succefully qualified in the the french , but the team wasn't able the make it to the bermuda bowl|pg||
nt|dburn: still, these efforts might help North, who will think partner is short in clubs|pg||
nt|rmb1: Is 5@D a general try (last train) given that 5@h would be choice of contract|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: and when partner makes a slam try and you have the ace and king of trumps, you should usually bid a slam|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|dburn: well, pass in this kind of auction is forcing, so no need for "last train"|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|cA|pg||
nt|rmb1: ah yes|pg||
nt|fokal: not really|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s6|nt|fokal: S could have 6pts 4333 after all|pg||
pc|c3|pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pc|s8|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dK|nt|fokal: well maybe because it's red against white and because W is a passed hand|pg||
pc|d4|pc|c6|pc|d9|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|pc|c8|pc|c4|pg||
nt|fokal: but this should be specifiquely discussed with the partner|pg||
mc|12|nt|dburn: true - but it is generally sensible to assume that when both opponents pass on the first round, then contract for eleven tricks on the second round, they are sacrificing|pg||
nt|fokal: *6pts 4243 sorry :) |pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|3D|mb|3H|nt|rmb1: and lots of diamonds|pg||
nt|jfaria:  N has a problem, shpae without strenght|pg||
nt|jfaria:  solved it|pg||
mb|3S|nt|jfaria:  maybe a x would cover strong situations|pg||
mb|4H|nt|rmb1: North only needs shape OR strength to keep bidding :)|pg||
mb|4N|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|jfaria:  of c but send a message to S telling his story|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d2|nt|jfaria:  reasonable contract|pg||
nt|rmb1: certainly has play|pg||
nt|dburn: East-West have done pretty well not to double this|pg||
nt|dburn: but as things are, they should not double six|pg||

nt|dburn: I bet he didn't - but no great matter|pg||
nt|jfaria:  no logicall safety play to avoid 12 tricks :)|pg||
nt|rmb1: The "semi-balanced" 7222 shape means all the suits are behaving well|pg||
