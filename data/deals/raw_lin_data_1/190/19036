mb|p|mb|2N|nt|pelu: sorry what I wrote was for Nowosadski :(:( he is the "junior"|pg||
nt|mrdct: but mirrored shape in majors probably rules out the grand|pg||
nt|pelu: the runnign score has stopped after a few results in boards 23 - but prov soon up again|pg||
nt|henryb:  One of those hands where you wonder whether there is a compound squeeze|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|mrdct: i don't see any workable squeeze for 13 tricks here|pg||
nt|pelu: EW are No 2|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4C|nt|pelu: and NS No 14|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|mrdct: i think this will settle in 6NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|mrdct: might get a double squeeze happening if south pitches a @h early|pg||
mb|5D|nt|mrdct: but communications look awkward|pg||

mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: cant W count 12 tricks?|pg||
nt|pelu: in NT?|pg||
nt|mrdct: hmm - 6@c look likely to score poorly regardless of home many tricks he takes|pg||
nt|henryb:  Since I have no idea what West knows, I do not know what he can count|pg||
nt|pelu: he know the red Kings - so 6@C and 6NT sh be the game|pg||

pc|s2|pc|sT|pc|c9|mc|12|nt|mrdct: trying for a simple red suit sq|pg||
nt|pelu: and I exp that Apteker was not so interested knowing that 6Nt = 12-13 trick|pg||
nt|mrdct: 1370 would score well in the club duplicate - but i doubt if it will do well in this field|pg||
nt|pelu: I have the contract from 7 BBO-tables: 4x 6NT, 2x &@c, and 1 x 7NT|pg||
nt|mrdct: 7@c has made at one table|pg||
nt|mrdct: quite a few making 13 tricks in 6NT|pg||
nt|mrdct: which seems to be soft defence|pg||
nt|pelu: Prooijen made 7NT 2220 - double-squeeze with !A on hand |pg||
nt|mrdct: so how did the double sq position emerge?|pg||
nt|pelu: @hA|pg||
nt|mrdct: low @h to the Q and A perhaps|pg||
nt|mrdct: which isolates the @h menace in north|pg||
nt|mrdct: the hand sort of plays itself if it starts that way|pg||

nt|henryb:  Personally I think Bakhshi should have started trumps at trick 1|pg||
mc|10|nt|mrdct: yep - and townsend at trick 5|pg||
nt|mrdct: i guess prooijen just didn't sense that @s were 4-4|pg||
nt|mrdct: but all worked out OK for him in the end|pg||
nt|pelu: only 3x E olayed in @D - and 3x 130 - I am not impressed :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: it is, of course, a lot easier to defend these hands looking at 4 hands sitting on the couch at home|pg||
nt|henryb:  Going back to 26 for a moment, the double squeeze has to have hearts as the middle suit|pg||
nt|mrdct: so how does a @h lead help?|pg||
nt|henryb:  There is no diamond communication|pg||
nt|henryb:  A heart lead does create a guard position against South|pg||
nt|henryb:  But basically, what has to happen to make 7 is that South unguards @d, and then N is squeezed in the reds, South in the majors|pg||
