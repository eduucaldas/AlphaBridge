nt|kdr_fm: hi all exciting match this scot 97 / eng 97 so this will certainly play a large part in the probable winner|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  i'd have bid Michaels on the East hand, but perhaps EW play weak or strong|pg||
mb|p|pc|sA|nt|cuttysark: The NI West overcalled 2@H on that scrappy suit. but East has not solved the problem by doubling|pg||

nt|kdr_fm: 6S on here lets see how N/S do|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|yorkbeach:  some do not like to splinter with a singleton ace|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|yorkbeach:  the fifth spade is going to come in hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  i like the 2@s raise but it will not be to everyone's taste|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  handy|pg||
mb|3N|nt|cuttysark: Agreed - much the best bid with a minimum and a worthless doubleton|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kdr_fm: 4H also takes up sooo much room - but its a reasonable bid on this hand.  May be better slower routes available|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: 3@C presumably intermediate strength - even so, this hand looks a bit good|pg||
nt|vugraphzzj: Explained as "invitational" both sides of screen|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|yorkbeach:  5@d asking for the @sQ|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: Q ask so looks like theu'll get there - good bidding|pg||
pc|d2|nt|cuttysark: Morgan does seem to be overegging the pussing here - surely partner does not have the right cards for slam|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Pudding!|pg||
pc|d7|nt|yorkbeach:  6@c yes plus the @cK|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|d5|nt|dkkello:  still , I like the 4 @D bid , lots of controls |pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|nt|dkkello:  but enough is enough ..|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: S happy now the CK + SQ + 1ace is perfect|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: nicely bid|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  choice between a trump and a @d lead|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West's hxK is a clue for a trump lead|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: trump for 2 reasons - you want to try and cut down ruffs (maybe your @HK may turn into a trick) ... @d may be into AQ ...|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @hK|pg||
nt|vugraphzzj: He's still agonising here|pg||
nt|vugraphzzj: Now he's scribbling a question for Morgan|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|cuttysark: In the other room East West trsnspose 1@S and 1NT, so East was decalrer. Diamonds were not mentioned and South led @DQ, which helped|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|cuttysark: The nine is probably zero or 2 higher|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|yorkbeach:  declarer's concern is a possible 5-2 @h break, when East may be overruffing dummy|pg||
nt|pitiful:  nicely done here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  so may be safer to take ruffs in hand and ruff 1@h only|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|mc|8|nt|cuttysark: Looks a fai 6S to protect against the diamond lead, but there there might be a club ruff....|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Game-forcing surely - and natural, I think|pg||
mb|p!|nt|cuttysark: I hope West does not take him too seriously - oh dear|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: 2S was in case partner was 4-4 in the Majors, but perhaps 3@D was just talking to himself|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Well, 2 hearts, 2 diamosd, 2 clubs with the ruffing finesse, and 3 trump tricks - was there a problem?|pg||

nt|paulg:  but this is always clearer to the player making the call|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Actually this pair are well established - have been playing together since they were about 12 - but they do not get together very often, and they are prone to the occasional ...|pg||
nt|cuttysark: misunderstanding|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Well, one is always in doubt, but that does not make trump leads right!|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|cuttysark: Jake Corry plays his bridge in Edinburgh these days - can't imagine what they have been teaching him|pg||
nt|paulg:  Corry can only be wondering whether to bid 5@d or 6@d?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  giant defense misunderstanding at other table..  |pg||
nt|cuttysark: I much prefer the direct approach of Alex Wilkinson - calling his 8-card suit trump|pg||

mb|p|nt|cuttysark: As long as they avoid 4@S|pg||

nt|paulg:  unless she has played in a number of late-night games on BBO|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not sure I ahve either :)  West will know what to do to 7@H|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Though I think  would rather be in 4@H|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Maybe he can afford to cash @SA while he is in dummy|pg||

nt|cuttysark: 4@S has very few losers, but a bit short of winners|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: East may well be forced to bid 4@S due to the length of time he's taking|pg||
nt|vugraphzzj: Corry still in the box here|pg||
nt|cuttysark: if he doubles would East pass? Without the hesitation?|pg||

mb|2H|nt|diumraid: Viewgraph Operator - Bridgemate scoring has Board 2 as X -3 not -2 ?|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Declarer taking no risks in his game contract|pg||
mb|1D|nt|kdr_fm: is that a slam you'd want to be in ?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Ugly weak 2 with an ace empty suit and two aces, but...|pg||
nt|cuttysark: (And no, I would not want to be in slam on the last board :))|pg||
nt|cuttysark: In the other Room West overcalled 2NT over a Multi, but 3NT was doomed on a heart lead|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 3nt doesnt make as in the other room - 4@s has chances ..|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|cuttysark: Tough hand to bid - but 3@H looks a bit weird, should be either Michaels or a stopper ask|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: An Irish slam? Fails on a diamond lead, but who leads from Jx (unless North bids the suit, of course|pg||
mb|2C|nt|vugraphzzj: I can just about read "Stopper ask" on the notepad|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: This looks like a Kokish sequence to show a big balanced hand - not sure of their ranges, but most would have bid 2NT by now|pg||
mb|3N|nt|cuttysark: I think 2@H is Kokish, when he rebids 2N he will show 22-23 balanced, I hope|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Sorry, my contact has developed a slow-to-nonexistent motion|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Assuming that North has shown hearts with this double, South is unsure how many hearts to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  looks like Multi from South and 4@c = please transfer into your suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|kdr_fm: well lets see how the defence goes|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Well, they got to 4@S but does 3@S show spades? For me it shows a weak hand with no stopper|pg||
pc|s5|nt|cuttysark: East should be worried about his red suit holdings for slam purposes|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I do not believe the auction from the other room, where apparently South opend 4@s|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|cuttysark: 2@S is a relay, and now 2@H is a transfer|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: needs a club switch at trick 2 or this is home|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|dA|nt|cuttysark: And 4@H a retransfer|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|d5|nt|cuttysark: Ireland gain 3 more imps from their advnturous 3D -1 on board 19: england tried 2@H, two down|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dJ|pc|s3|pg||
pc|d4|nt|yorkbeach:  we have confirmation that the auction was indeed longer|pg||
pc|h3|pc|dK|nt|cuttysark: Not an easy switch to find, that club.|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: big swing 13 imps i'm informed|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes, provided he keeps his eye on the ball NI win 13 imps here|pg||
nt|cuttysark: and they get another 4 on Board 30 where England played in 4@S-1 and Corry doubled 4@H, also -1|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Scotland now leading NI by 6 imps|pg||

pc|d6|nt|cuttysark: ireland attemtping to make 1NT in both directions on this board - North succeeded, can West?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: ot the time for an imaginative lead - the trusy 4th highest does the job|pg||
nt|dkkello:  13  |pg||

pc|hA|nt|paulg:  a lot to be said for bidding 3NT .. either hearts or diamonds may be source of tricks even if minimum|pg||
