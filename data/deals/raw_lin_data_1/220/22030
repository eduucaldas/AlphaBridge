nt|fabsayc: hi Gary, i would be tempted to blast to slam with versace hand, but perhaps 2@S first does no harm|pg||

nt|vugraphzvc: the early @c discard made it easy to set up @c|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: but if Frank ducked the @cA it would be more difficult|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs upside-down count & attitude   EW odd/even discard|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the Open Room starts with Board 27  so we won't see comparisons -- but they will|pg||
nt|mcphee: might make via and end play|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am asked which way, well given lauria is declarer i will say right way for declarer|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the idea is no trump lead, but zia exposed the flaw of leading a trump versus 7 in his book|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: both pairs  upside-down count & attitude   EW odd/even discard|pg||
nt|psyck: i think there will be 3 round robin games followed by semi & finals|pg||

pc|hK|nt|twcho: now possibly 12 tricks|pg||
nt|gsper:  Hi, all|pg||
nt|mcphee: i always hate these postions, you know the @D hook is losing:(|pg||
nt|mcphee: even though E has tried to mislead declarer discarding 7@D|pg||

mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: NS system = Ultimate Canape [big club, canape openings]    EW  Dutch Doubleton|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: Zaleski had an unfortunate start losing 25-1 to Israel|pg||
mb|2C|nt|penseur9:  probably another 3nt NS here|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15 HCP, 0+@D   if 2-suit LONGER @C/@S but not @H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if you dont lead a trump, is because you dont half the queen|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: possible 6@h for NS|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good slam, should be found|pg||
mb|3C|nt|gsper:  NS can make a lot in @C but the vul will hold them back|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=7+ hcp, 4+@H, maybe longer @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=game force relay|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|twcho: but not a good slam|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2N = 12-14, some 4333|pg||
nt|mcphee: 3N = same result they had last time,,,,,,,,,,,,,maybe 2 down tho:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it is not much of a clue, but enough perhaps to change the odds|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  part score seems indicated here... possibly in @H by NS|pg||
mb|3S|nt|vugraphzvc: 1@h might be only 3 sometimes, that's probably the reason that Ton did not bid 2@h|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if east were not a passed hand, i would respond 1nt to slow the auction|pg||
nt|fabsayc: even 2 is an overbid|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: more likely 6N|pg||
nt|penseur9:  this is not a forgone conclusion... lot's of work to do|pg||
mb|4D|nt|penseur9:  seems that N is tempted to go for slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4N is regressive  [doesn't like either of responder's suits]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N range  20-21(22)|pg||
nt|penseur9:  hi Al, welcome back|pg||
nt|fabsayc: because you have the queen (i typed it wrong)|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  some work to do here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H lead brutal   it gives declarer hope|pg||
nt|mcphee: N please no @S lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: are there options other than playing Ton for @DH10?|pg||
nt|psyck: looks like both pais play a fairly natural system, so hopefully we will be able to follow most of their biddin|pg||
mb|4H|nt|penseur9:  good lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: and he showed 4@h already|pg||
nt|ahollan1: most of the Onstein2 lead came in 2nd set where they more than overcame the White House 20 imp carryover [from Round Robin match]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i vote for 5@C instead of 5@H    just in case NS bid 5@S, i'd like @C lead|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: e/w have play for 4 spades      but this looks 500-800 |pg||

mb|4N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i wonder if same bad breaks in the other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but they start with board 31  so we won't know until the end of the set|pg||
nt|penseur9:  it seems that both rooms started on board 17, so comparisons may be available soon|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: Was a minor mistake, they are playing 31 now|pg||
nt|gsper:  With the @S finesse marked, this should make, so the 5@C sac...|pg||
nt|gsper:  would have paid, or possibly even made|pg||
nt|gsper:  The voice commentators are discussing various lines. They have lost me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: terrible hand to lead from |pg||

nt|ahollan1: hi David|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|aramesh_:  Hello Hasan - Welcome|pg||
nt|famus: Tommy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: initial thinking   how do i combine chances in the majors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but that assumes 5@C tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: don't know why bertens played the @d10 here, Q looks better|pg||
nt|bobholl: in practice surely :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: if you play for Kx low is best of course, but against 98 the Q is the same as 10, but it gains with J9|pg||
pc|sK|nt|penseur9:  I'm not sure I would have played @D here... most likely|pg||
nt|penseur9:  trump most likely*|pg||
nt|penseur9:  always difficult to second guess declarer on these part score contracts|pg||
nt|gsper:  Yes, I also thought it was that simple|pg||
pc|s2|nt|dkkello:  they used to play chess, but that whent to fast for them |pg||

nt|gsper:  Welcome, Martin|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in fact he can claim now, and should :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but westra perhaps has to keep up his reputation for slow play|pg||
nt|gsper:  S may be considering a low @D return|pg||
nt|fabsayc: for what purpose|pg||
nt|gsper:  In case W has Qxx|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: similar problem in 6N - except that declarer probably won't suffer @S ruff|pg||
nt|penseur9:  looking like -1 here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's one wrong guess|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi al, spectators|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think i would have won first spade in hand to play clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: perhaps Verhees went wrong at trick 1?  yes, he picked up trump, but being in dummy left too few options |pg||

nt|ahollan1: White House started the match with 20 imp carryover from the Round Robin|pg||
nt|ady: in fact O got vulnerability right    was 800|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Onstein 2 had big 2nd set to take this 20-something lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they are not handicapped by having to type|pg||
nt|ahollan1: progressive lenses don't improve matters |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Verhees does NOT have bid to describe weak 2@H opener   even if he wants one here|pg||

nt|ady: North will be sorry if trying a raise|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@S=10-15 HCP, 4+@S  if 2 suits then 2nd is LONGER|pg||

nt|andyv:  ok|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: 15-17|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@D=ART INV  a) 3/4@S  b) NT  c) 3@H/@S & 6@C/@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=5+@H   note: 5@S 5@H opens 1@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: eventually it will come up so a pre-alert   NS opening 2@C/@D/@H are all multi-purpose  either weak in next higher suit  [think transfer preempt]  or various strong hands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but 3@D avoids all alerts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is west worth another bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which slam try now from Verhees?|pg||
nt|mcphee: intersting hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  W probably can't make 3@h|pg||
nt|fabsayc: undo|pg||
nt|andyv:  we can see that 7N or 7@h makes...reasonable to get to 6 but finding out about the 4th @c is difficult|pg||
nt|psyck: hi Richard|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think this is polish club|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: reach 4@S (3nt down on @C lead)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW system is called Ultimate Canape|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: i'm surprised by action from EACH player|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ok 3@H could be a form of micheals, spades and a minor|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok, EW are out of the picture|pg||

nt|fabsayc: now maybe 5@D by west to check on club control|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: "must" was an overbid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on the downside, king and jack of diamonds may be worthless|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looking for justification - maybe Verhees worried about @H losers when vP holds less then 4@H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Jokes all around about the quality of Ton's preempts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they always seem to have 13 cards|pg||
nt|andyv:  UNDO PLEASE!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no andy i think this is correct|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok...so W bid 3@h|pg||
nt|fabsayc: versace taking advantage of vulnerability|pg||
nt|andyv:  sorry everyone....my senior moment!|pg||
nt|riccho:  dangerous field here entered by E... NS may reach slam |pg||
nt|psyck: maybe E could have entered the auction with a @c bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: EW is now sitting at 3rd position before this round starts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 7 small is similar to Kxxxxx so often bid the same way|pg||
nt|gsper:  Me too, but some people would not dream of it|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Site: http://www.bridge.nl/uitslagen |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=3-fit Drury  [2@D=4-fit]|pg||
pc|h6|nt|famus: a big B UT!!!:)|pg||
nt|twcho: NS lying 8th|pg||
nt|twcho: so EW still has chance to clinch the title|pg||
nt|penseur9:  good lad should still make easely|pg||
nt|gsper:  Especially Law devotees|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS system is Dutch Doubleton|pg||
nt|mcphee: so 2@D was some game try or just annouced opening values?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=RELAY  but i don't follow-ups|pg||
nt|mcphee: just see if I ask you any more questions :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you'll have to yell them   i'm having trouble staying awake :(|pg||
nt|mcphee: OK|pg||
nt|fabsayc: could pass 2@D but 2@S is fine|pg||
pc|hA|nt|twcho: seems quite a no. of options available for declarer here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: West could try 3N at these colors|pg||
nt|fabsayc: pass is 0-3 we think|pg||
nt|andyv:  this can go down 6 |pg||
pc|h2|nt|penseur9:  *lead|pg||
nt|penseur9:  nothing much the defense can do to defeat this contract here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs  upside-down count & attitude|pg||
nt|penseur9:  good bidding from EW here|pg||
nt|dkkello:  yes |pg||
nt|ahollan1: vP might have raised|pg||
nt|mcphee: E hand getting worse|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not sure if 5nt is queen ask, looks that way|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in any case we are into a sequence i have never ever seen before|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2nt was some form of super accept of transfer, probably max with three trumps|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|ady: 4-1 trump split    but should arrive at 10 tricks  losing 2 hearts and a club|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  1  Bakkeren brothers get to 5@S|pg||
pc|s9|nt|twcho: but @d is the most promising|pg||
nt|twcho: @c can wait and @s suit is not robust enough|pg||
nt|famus: he exercised one of em--next ought to be a small @s to Q to wind up |pg||
nt|penseur9:  this COULD make but difficult to figure out double dummy|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ahollan1: @HJ from QJxx(x) or JT(x)     @HQ from QJ(x)|pg||
nt|penseur9:  probably will go down now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this could be a form of Slawinsky honor leads,   which i never remember|pg||
nt|penseur9:  remember though that they are much better then I am :)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  should make in 12-15 min or so .. |pg||
nt|penseur9:  on board  1, OR in 4@S -1 for 5 IMPs Onstein1|pg||
nt|bobholl: would play @CK now|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1:  15  3N in South|pg||
nt|psyck: opening 2@h would also have got them to the same spot|pg||
nt|psyck: other room gets there via a multi opening|pg||
nt|psyck: multi enabled it to be played by E, not that it matters here|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: ah perhaps now some realistic bidding|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|mcphee: west doesn't care|pg||
nt|djneill:  East could have had @hK, @dA, @cK, opposite singleton @s, that would have been nice|pg||
nt|mcphee: very nice|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard to sac in 7 spades now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: kudos to pachtman for negotiating this auction|pg||
mc|13|nt|fabsayc: jansma looking for a line to make this hand, needs a miracle for that|pg||

nt|Vugraphzvc: Loek talking about asking for a director|pg||

nt|ahollan1: DBL can be strong NT   [1N overcalls are artificial]|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i think that skews advancer's ability to bid|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: marginal slam here|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 18+ bal|pg||

nt|Vugraphzvc: Hola Shirley|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15 hcp, 0+@D  often weak NT   maybe 4@D and LONGER @S/@C [canape] but not longer @H|pg||
nt|djneill:  there is one bid that shifts the blame back to doubler, I think North will find it|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=a) 6+@C 1-suit    b) 4+@C and LONGER @S|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i don't think they can find @S now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S usually less than game force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D = 5+@H  invitational or stronger|pg||
nt|riccho:  @s dominates this hand (as it is so often the case)|pg||
nt|andyv:  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008MindSortGamesBeijing/Open/France/multon-zimmerman.pdf|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzvc: 1@D was 3+@D|pg||
nt|penseur9:  rare 1@D contract, S could hardly bid 1@H with that hand|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: incredibly Lauria-Versace goad the opps into another 13 imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: so we can conclude that both pairs are playing precision, probably the most popular system in China|pg||
nt|penseur9:  hi AL welcome back|pg||
nt|sybarra: easy 4 @H's probably +1  |pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Van Prooijen always has a short suit, Verhees explained|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very practical rebid from Verhees|pg||
nt|djneill:  that's a nice bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: is it best for Wortel to bid now with the lousy 6@S or later?  and show both majors or ...|pg||
nt|penseur9:  does not look like any contract can ake either side|pg||
nt|penseur9:  *can make...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S looks good |pg||
nt|penseur9:  yes @S contract looks best here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no entry to West hand for @H ruff|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: 2@D does not promise any points   because may prefer @S over @C|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3@H from bertens now i guess|pg||
nt|dkkello:  well she didnt went owerboard  |pg||
nt|kemperg: 1@S a nice 3rd hand opening|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N shows any 8+ hcp|pg||
nt|psyck: a fav vul 3@h opening...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: two way finesse|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|twcho: 3@h should say solid suit|pg||
nt|twcho: and invite cuebid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: NS playing 2@H in open room|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: good save|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well  Kit Woolsey defines a good save as one that makes, but this is better than letting NS play 4@S|pg||
nt|gsper:  I wonder if W liked that opening or if he was forced by system|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we lost the clubs in the 60's, diamonds in the 70's, balanced nt bids in the 10's|pg||
nt|fabsayc: trump lead?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  15  [3NE+2]   Bertens in 5@D after Paulissen got to make lead directing DBL of @C |pg||
nt|fabsayc: israel can do no wrong|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|twcho: 4@c probably deny @s control|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the running total includes 10 IMPs for Het Witte Huis  [White House] for winning the round robin|pg||
nt|penseur9:  didn't somebody say that the five level belongs to the oponents|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL would have shown cards rather than typical negative double|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so will be part score swing here|pg||
pc|sK|nt|penseur9:  *opponents|pg||
nt|kemperg: no retransfer from Jan|pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is because he wants to stop the auction in 4 @H |pg||
nt|kemperg: retransfer has not to mean slam interest|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not a great hand for the system|pg||
nt|ady: 2 diamonds and 2 trump tricks to be lost for sure    might scrape home|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL = takeout|pg||
nt|psyck: other room did not go for o/t as only in 4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont consider 50% as a good slam and this is no better than that|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vugraphzvc: meanwhile onstein 2 won 5 imps on bd 17, letting them play 4@h undoubled|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: dbl by Drijver was GF|pg||
nt|gsper:  Not many losers, but a bit short on winners|pg||
nt|gsper:  He can ruff a @D high, but he does not know that|pg||
nt|gsper:  Could try something mundane like the @D finesse|pg||
nt|kemperg: I think 3@D had been the retransfer|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4@D splinter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ruffing finesse in @D works -- but will it be taken?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: immediate 2-level suit bids would be natural 0-7|pg||
nt|psyck: mildly aggresive 3n, some would rebid 2n, but vul...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Gary Hanna|pg||
nt|psyck: lead will give 9th after @c fin|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Krishna, Roland and everyone|pg||
nt|psyck: Hi Gary|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: A pleasure to see my fravourite partnership in action|pg||
nt|psyck: so we may continue to see 1 imp scores every deal|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: Ed Manfield in a BOLS Bridge Tip back in the 1980s|pg||
nt|andyv:  true...very evident the first set|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|famus: actually observing the Bermuda Bowl etc recently--the most favoured system appeared to be a combination of 2/1 with precision @c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW flip-flop PASS/DBL     i think Eric Rodwell gets credit for that inversion|pg||
nt|bobholl: difficult to stop in 4@C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: depends if they take their trump winners|pg||
nt|ady: very likely to go down|pg||
nt|kemperg: @H 41 is rather unlucky|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|penseur9:  already 4 IMPs for EW on board  1... only down one in OR|pg||
nt|mcphee: they only use that over 1@S dble or other suits also?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|twcho: the winner - Netherlands having three pairs playing 3 different systems IIRC|pg||
pc|h4|nt|famus: run of the mill board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: honestly   i don't know why a 1@D bidder opposite a hand that was willing to play a partscore would be in a forcing situation|pg||
nt|bobholl: berry wondering were the @S are on the bidding off course with huub|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi gm ga all|pg||
nt|bobholl: hi jaap :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi bob:)|pg||
nt|gsper:  Finis|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2nd @S from hand rather than @H to dummy then @S  since very possible for North to duck with @SA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then could lose @SA AND defense gets to play 2 round of trump and another potential @S loser|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jaapfr: even DD i see no way of making this|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2 @H ruffs and @D 33 looks as best (and only) chance|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: Carl -- DBL isn't always traditional takeout shape since 1N overcalls are artificial|pg||
nt|djneill:  good stop, 25 HCP, no game|pg||
nt|psyck: sooner or later E will give dec the 9th trick|pg||
pc|h7|nt|fabsayc: lauria can develop two spade tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  the Italians had two poor results opening 11 hcp hands with A, AK in first set|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: wow   18  the doomed slams    Paulissen-Jansma stop in 3N!!|pg||
nt|jaapfr: exchange @D 6 with 8 and it can be mad|pg||

nt|ahollan1: of course seeing all 4 hands -- we know better :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|kemperg: kib thinks he wanted opener on lead, wich is right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: opener will hold 4@H only if   a) weak NT  b) 4@H(441)  c) 4405    so i'm a bit surprised at choice of 3@D|pg||
nt|mcphee: i would want to be in 4@H though|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: or S will just take them|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but that is still down one|pg||
nt|fabsayc: best slam is 6NT avoiding a club ruff|pg||

nt|penseur9:  1@D transfer to @H|pg||
nt|penseur9:  good question :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=INV a) @C/@D  b) 5@H/@S  c) NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that pretty much covers it all, doesn't it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: to me this method of 4+ spades is unplayable without support doubles, and i think north could double 3@D on this auction to show 3 spades|pg||
nt|fabsayc: north should probably double for takeout|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2N=bal max|pg||
nt|bobholl: would play @D myself now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: specs say 5@D a better save but i doubt that with this awful distribution|pg||
nt|bobholl: in spite of @S 3 :)|pg||
nt|psyck: (when rho bids at the 2 level, 2N is often used a good bad, with direct 3 level bids stronger & via 2n weaker)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hard to belive this is Lauria - Versace, seems like Overbid and Guggenheim :(|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6@H would be good contract if souths diamond 8 were the 9|pg||
nt|andyv:  their aggressiveness has backfired on several boards|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: polite word aggressiveness :(|pg||
nt|andyv:  another good slam for NS|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes we can all make 6 but i dont think will make if bid|pg||
nt|riccho:  tricky @h lead to convince decl not to finesse in @h ...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@H accepting, fewer than 4 hearts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and an overbid of 4@H by south|pg||
pc|s4|nt|penseur9:  2nt makes but 3 ????|pg||
nt|ady: may play 3NT   down on spade lead|pg||
nt|psyck: some reverse it & play bad-good 2NT|pg||
nt|pelu:  and CC for EW: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Italy/lauria-versace.pdf|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: now vP needs to find @S lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C was a relay  did not promise a 4 card major|pg||
nt|psyck: thanks Peter|pg||
pc|sT|nt|vugraphzvc: EW CC: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Netherlands/vanprooijen-verhees.pdf|pg||
nt|penseur9:  that helps|pg||
nt|ady: low spade best|pg||
nt|ady: should survive  |pg||
nt|djneill:  a ruff, a palpable ruff, not that it gained much|pg||
nt|psyck: risky to enter such auctions vul...as happened in other room, more placid this room|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|gsper:  N may have wanted a little extra strength for that|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this seems to have marked the lead, lets see|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems @S is only logical choice   |pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlikely that @CA @C would get partner ruff|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Peter :)|pg||
nt|psyck: Peter and Andy on voice commentary this room|pg||
nt|psyck: kibs can listen using the browser version|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: :)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|penseur9:  4@D is pick a major|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if Gerbrand doesn't tell us -- the opponents don't know either|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D says  not 3@H/@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzxn: sorry|pg||
nt|andyv:  you were right, Martin...probably too hard to bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  np:)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|penseur9:  :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@C  0/3 keycards   5@H a bit of a mystery to me   maybe thinking 5@C showed 1 keycard??|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: 5@C showed 1 KC|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Frank just told me he made a mistake|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Frank seemed to be stressed out|pg||
nt|fabsayc: blame it all on Kantar|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: That explains it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks Bas  that explains 5@H :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: He says he made three wrong calls :)|pg||
nt|ady: need the club finesse|pg||
nt|fabsayc: operator, what was 2@C please?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: so   2236 or 2227|pg||
nt|ahollan1: invite opposite max -- seems forcing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe vP can change his mind|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yep  otherwise i'd sleep|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS leads vs NT = 4th|pg||
nt|riccho:  more than a single imp now...|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|bobholl: good news for drijver knows his save is good now|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: westra might get a long trump if drijver misguesses in @c|pg||
nt|jaapfr: he is thinking about not becoming trump short|pg||
nt|mcphee: ruffed with a natural as it happens|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|nt|twcho: both this bd and the last one looks like another 2 flat bds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wrong side but can the defense take their @H AND kill dummy?|pg||
nt|penseur9:  probable @C lead here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: really?   auction seems to highlight @H weakness|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Kantar would have been able to ask for keycards at lower level|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i agree 4@H would make after 1nt opening|pg||
pc|s2|nt|gsper:  Voice comentators suggest that they may not support D this high|pg||
nt|ady: there are losing options|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm a @D leader too -- which is why systems in college geared to having me on lead|pg||
nt|ady: if declarer guages this a 4 card suit  then best to cross and take heart finesse|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in this case 3 wrongs = a right|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|penseur9:  you have a point Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and @SKxxx might look for tap|pg||
nt|ahollan1: see   just as i told you   my leads are terrible|pg||
nt|gsper:  A kib confirms that|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi all:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good-o  so now he agrees that he did have 2@C opener :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: anyway  nice recovery|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Verhees asking why vP didn't lead @S|pg||
nt|djneill:  may see a supernatural resurrection|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H @H promotes a trump trick, doesn't it?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3nt might have made|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|jaapfr: oeff luckily @CA and @DA not in other hands|pg||
nt|gsper:  Wlc, Marshall|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a few pairs can jump to 3@H/@S to show 4441 hands, but most use to show (31)(54)|pg||
nt|mcphee: could try 9@C|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: now down a lot|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: south has 2 @H entries AND @C length to give ruffs|pg||
nt|bobholl: 380 difference indeed|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry 800|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: 5@c -1 on bd 20 a push with 110 in 2@h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: must cash @DA first|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: nice finesse|pg||
pc|h8|nt|vugraphzvc: Schollaardt ai, when he sees @Hq|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: West takes a toilet break|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: 3@D was 15-17 with 4@H, like a old school 3@H bid|pg||
nt|penseur9:  13 IMPs on  18 for HWH OR in 3nt only|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Gerbrand -- can you explain this tournament   is it a seasonal/year long event??  does it impact selection of international team??|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: it's basicly the premier league|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: it was a 12 team double round robin|pg||
nt|bobholl: so 3@H from bertens not as good as i said :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: well, that depends, without 3@h brink-drijver might have stopped below 5@c|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ady: in 5@D  if south leads a heart   must duck first round and later discard a heart on club|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|psyck: didnt expect trump to break i guess|pg||
nt|psyck: may have escaped for -1 if a 3rd round of trumps were drawn as cards are|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|c8|nt|bobholl: good guesses always help :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: when this loses   has the option of diamond break   or club finesse|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|pc|s6|nt|twcho: maybe a imp to EW|pg||
nt|famus: this needs handling|pg||
nt|vugraphzxn: 2c = h+?|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dK|nt|kemperg: he heard you:)|pg||
pc|dA|mc|8|nt|psyck: back to -1|pg||
pg||

nt|viren169: re|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: lots of messages saying that 3N is better on the last hand |pg||
mb|p|pc|s5|nt|viren169: probably pass now|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|pc|s9|pg||
nt|viren169: West may have dbled 2@D to bring in the spades|pg||
nt|xenya: yes it is|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|c8|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|viren169: Q of spades can only be wrong when South has a singleton K - highly unlikly here|pg||
pc|cA|pc|d9|pc|s3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|xenya: Multon/Zimmermann also failed to bid slam on 31|pg||

pg||
qx|c34|st||md|4S93HAJT6DAKQ652C7,SKJ752HDT83CK9862,S86H8743D4CAQJT53,SAQT4HKQ952DJ97C4|sv|n|nt|twcho: overtricks seems likely. don't know why claim 10 tricks only|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: West not agreeing with how East bid the hand, not sure what he should have done there to show his 6-6|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: so you play 2 16 board matches against each team|pg||
nt|ahollan1: running total includes White House 10 imps for winning round robin|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sure|pg||
nt|penseur9:  yes shure does :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Frank very relieved|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good question -- but i wouldn't ask it at the table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 18+ bal|pg||
nt|ady: np|pg||
nt|ady: good afternoon all|pg||
nt|mcphee: hi david|pg||
nt|djneill:  hi david|pg||
mb|1H|nt|twcho: sorry,|pg||
nt|twcho: trump is 31|pg||
nt|penseur9:  likely 4@H NS here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: More of a statement really: "Isn't a 1@S lead best?"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: won't be surprised if  5 is pushed |pg||
mb|2D|nt|riccho:  W may think his partner has more defensive values than he actually has. penX may be the result|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: 1@S=4+  NEVER the longest in a 2-suiter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3rd 2@C opener this set -- rare|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: they are also surprised :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2@C for @H now ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: they don't play that|pg||
nt|kemperg: weak 2 in @D or strong|pg||
nt|kemperg: 2NT strong relay|pg||
nt|kemperg: how good is your weak?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S=5@S 5@H 1@D  8-11 or 15+ hcp|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how's THAT for a specific bid??|pg||
nt|fabsayc: vunderbar|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H = 4-fit, 3-8 HCP|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: unusual light opening from Lauria|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a total misfitting hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  another 11hcp wonder|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I would not call it a good slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: but is a good convention :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|twcho: so declarer has to guess the @c for an overtrick|pg||
nt|famus: again dicey 3NT on @d lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@S 5@H opens 1@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: and top 4 qualifies for semi-finals which are played now|pg||
nt|penseur9:  3@H transfer to @S|pg||
nt|dkkello:  good presure bidding from E-V |pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: i think 2@h is NF by the Bakkerens|pg||
nt|kemperg: 10pts, but still not very good:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: Jansma really wants to bid |pg||
nt|sybarra: not often you have an 8 card suit |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@C sets @H|pg||
nt|ady: games both sides fail here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=4+ but can be balanced|pg||
nt|mcphee: what is e/w nt range?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 15-17 for both|pg||
mb|3D|nt|andyv:  the 11 hcp is not so bothersome as the quality of the hand itself|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: 3@S maximum in context of non 1@C opener|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@H  minimum|pg||
nt|fabsayc: super duper dutch reverse flannery |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@CX on  1  was down 3  so only 2 imp swing|pg||
nt|ady: part score in clubs for n/s|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: omg who would open E|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not clear to double with west hand, but will likely gain|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  slam may be here EW again but hard to get there... again|pg||
nt|psyck: 3N could be tricky to defend|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  3nt going down on a @D lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at this point  5+@S  4+@C|pg||
nt|kemperg: the dealing machine in Utrecht has no problems with 8  or 9 suits:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=4+|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this seems to be the set of 4-1 trump splits|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now RKC|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will stop in 6@S knowing @SQ missing|pg||
nt|psyck: defense should switch to @h at some time & not continue @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: good news   @DK protected     bad news -- they get 5(+) before you get 9|pg||
nt|psyck: at least has some intermediate spots in the 11hcp & not a 4333 this time :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6@D about 25%, or 100% after the fact|pg||
pc|dA|nt|penseur9:  very tough decision for W here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H lead beats more than @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N could be lebensohl or scramble here   both make sense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlike Precision 2@C   here 2@D says nothing about points|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: NS just discussed, not sure what they agreed after all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry 6@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S is RKC in @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@D=2 keycards no Q|pg||
nt|psyck: other room had a misunderstanding on deal 4 for the 1st suing|pg||
nt|psyck: *big swing|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes 14 imps|pg||
nt|psyck: it could be a 'sohl misunderstanding...make sure you & pd are on same page.  Personally i prefer Rumpelsohl: http://gerbenbridge.blogspot.in/2005/12/your-sohl-or-mine.html|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2 unsupprted K's and a J to bolster the A in the "long" suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  they may get there|pg||
pc|d3|nt|famus: E needs to retain @d suit control by not rising up with @dA--i think thats the crux of this hand|pg||
nt|dkkello:  for new bridgeplayers , notice how much the bid on very few points |pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh my     2 [5@HW=]   4@HX|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jcwla:  Welcome to my world.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in my world they are 4-1 FITS|pg||
nt|ady: should not be a problem    has 2 clubs tricks 1 diamond and 1 heart     can surely manage 4 trump tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other table seems to be entering 2nd 10 minutes of board  2|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 10 tricks|pg||
nt|riccho:  3@d may imply the @s-fit (otherwise doubling)|pg||
nt|psyck: i suppose so, more normal to just raise to 3@s|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|famus: @dQ and small|pg||
nt|twcho: good defense|pg||
nt|twcho: else, declarer may make|pg||
nt|ady: can ruff diamonds high  and Q98 of spades come in to play|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bobholl: drijver will have a difficult card when in with k@D|pg||
nt|penseur9:  only two @S and a @C loosers|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: Frank confirms 2@h was NF|pg||
nt|dkkello:  protected by "the law" even vulnerable |pg||
nt|bobholl: tya htg |pg||
nt|dkkello:  se you Bob |pg||
nt|penseur9:  tks Bob|pg||
nt|ady: good lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  2 just finished  4@S=|pg||
nt|ady: just 4 side suit tricks   so need 6 trump tricks|pg||
nt|psyck: with 55 & all the values in the 2 suits, it is a routine opening,...|pg||
nt|psyck: but as you say, with the misfit here, not many tricks...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: after 4 cue bids|pg||
nt|andyv:  17 and this board will be a chance for them to make up some of the imps|pg||
nt|riccho:  well played by W|pg||
pc|d8|nt|penseur9:  now it's E with tough decision :)|pg||
nt|penseur9:  I expect 5@C-p-p-p|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that won't make Verhees any happier|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other forms of scoring  Schollaard very close to converting DBL to penalty|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i missed the question Andy -- ask again|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  2  2@S made so 5 imps back to the leaders|pg||
pc|h4|nt|gsper:  1@C strong or weak bal, I hear|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Paulissen didn't preempt with north hand on  3  [where 3370]|pg||
nt|psyck: opening light had to payoff sometime, they just kept trying :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  and 17 turned out to be 1 imp for Israel|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@H was overbid, but after 3@H north would raise, so normal spot|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|andyv:  it's their style and hard to argue with their track record|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I've always seen them to play sound openings at the 1 level|pg||
nt|psyck: well, tricky as i said...:)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: correct spelling  of south   Schollaardt    but bbo field can't fit in last letter|pg||
nt|jaapfr: presumably he will return @S|pg||
nt|bobholl: only @S is rigth|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: can cash 1@c first|pg||
nt|jaapfr: still only 8 tricks: 2@S4@H1@Dand 1@C\|pg||
nt|jaapfr: with @DATx in W|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry 3 @D and 2@C to loose|pg||
nt|bobholl: but ew have to wait with cashing their 2 @C :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i think E can not deduct all permutations here at this moment so each card now has a risk to play|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: can cash 1@c, then @s switch sets up @ss before @ds|pg||
nt|bobholl: if they cash 1@C it migth make anyway :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: yyy but how he must know that or tell him:)?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: cashing a @c looks a normal option. Drijver doesn't know Bertens has 5|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but the @S switch now or thereafter is vital|pg||
nt|bobholl: 60% bet on making |pg||
nt|fabsayc: ok at least 5 cue bids|pg||
nt|riccho:  lot of things which could go wrong for the defense now |pg||
pc|dT|nt|bobholl: not necessary|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E about to be squeezed if W exits with heart jack i think after clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: and a bid unfortunate here |pg||
nt|ahollan1: more from  17   Paulissen DBL 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that won't help the trailing team|pg||
nt|ady: may get home as it is going     just lose 3 club tricks|pg||
pc|h8|nt|vugraphzvc: west telling east that he thinks East has a minimum for 3@C|pg||
nt|ady: still will be ok|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so White House closes gap to 11|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they don't usually open with weak values|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: east known to have [at least] 9 black cards    how likely is @H finesse to work??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6 imps on  2 after 4@HX made with 1 non-vul overtrick|pg||
nt|ady: club leads I suppose look obvious   but it seems to have given the contract|pg||
nt|ady: trumps now 2-2    so Q@C can be ruffed out|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if zimmerman believes the discards he will run this|pg||
nt|fabsayc: NS seem to be allergic to trump leads|pg||
pc|s2|nt|twcho: As suggested by kibitzer, 4@h is cold for NS|pg||
pc|h3|nt|gsper:  or unbal, @Cs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: busy defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now ruffing @S finesse for overtrick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does Jansma open 1N or 1@D  [their system derived from Polish Club]|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: best news -- 4@S not making either|pg||
nt|psyck: other room got to 6@d|pg||
pc|s5|nt|twcho: but I wonder who can arrive at such great spot|pg||
nt|bobholl: no @C now and down|pg||
nt|jaapfr: now W to find the @S|pg||
nt|jaapfr: even tougher for W|pg||
pc|s6|nt|penseur9:  often when trum queen doubleton, it makes a trick :)|pg||
nt|penseur9:  *trump|pg||
nt|bobholl: @H equally weel|pg||
nt|gsper:  Contradictory info from kibs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the good news is he is still in control|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ady: thats has set up all available side suit winners|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and removed entry to East's @D winner|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure why declarer burned the diamond 8 in dummy|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bobholl: now it is made so my 60% comes out|pg||
nt|jaapfr: your bet was right Bob|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jaapfr: just give a @D and claim (provided W no @C left)|pg||
nt|penseur9:  well done|pg||
pc|cK|nt|penseur9:  you're full of good news Al :)|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|c5|nt|fabsayc: tricky return|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|pc|c2|pg||
nt|ady: better play the next diamond from south|pg||

mc|7|nt|psyck: the bidding went 1@d-6@d or something like that|pg||
nt|andyv:  with the bidding by NS, this slam should be more in the 45-50% range|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so down 2 now cant score the spade seven|pg||

nt|xenya: what makes you think it was not natural, Gad?|pg||
nt|viren169: It was the 2@D that made 1@H nat (thks Roland)|pg||

nt|Vugraphzvc: Sorry, misclick, 6@D was just made ofcourse :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: whew|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Ton played the @HQ upside down and then picked up his cards, shuffled and put them in the board|pg||
nt|ady: an easy 11 tricks for e/w in hearts|pg||
nt|andyv:  I was wondering if he needed to bid 6@d, once pd made a second cue bid in @c suit.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: another slam, my wish for lively boards has come true|pg||
nt|andyv:  in any case, 11 more imps to Israel which is running away with this|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: too right   first check for @C 3-3  and if that doesn't work  THEN @S play|pg||
nt|psyck: Zaleskis hope fading now as the needed two good wins to make up|pg||
mb|1D|nt|penseur9:  will N simply raise to 3nt here?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that hand plays a lot better for NS on defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N = 4@H/@S and 5+@C  [Raptor]|pg||
nt|ady: n/s likely to play 3NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  another slam hand|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the nightmare continues|pg||
nt|Walddk4: What was played on 21?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We know about 20  7NTX -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: according to rule of 15, east shd pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D tends to deny 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: vP gets a reprieve but still enters the auction|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S makeable but getting there maybe not obvious:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E may venture testosterone 2N|pg||
nt|fabsayc: do you mean 4@H?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: guess not:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: I was typing I had mis-seen the deal and should make  then..... |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D denies 4@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tends to deny 4@H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: why?|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  3 where Verhees opened 3@H   Westra did start with multi 2@D   Paulissen playing 3@S East|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@H+1N roland|pg||
mb|1N|nt|marlowepi: yes 4H sorry for typo|pg||
nt|mcphee: do we see a support dble?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: dont balance|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if opponents want to play 1 of a minor, i let them unless i have a real hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|gsper:  Could he misguess @S in 4@H?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i should have alerted that i type transfers:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Haha|pg||
nt|ady: got there quickly      the play should be quick as well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+   1@H=7+ hcp  [1@D=0-6]|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a good hand for a weak 2 suiter opening, 2@H @H and another then pard can pass|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@H shows spades, 4@D splinter|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: xfer to @S, splinter and the real fit goes begging|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 7@C is not good, but better than 7@S|pg||
nt|andyv:  N can't be interested in slam|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think south will drive to six|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in clubs you just need clubs 2-2|pg||
nt|andyv:  if 4@h is a cue, should N do that now?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you can discard two spades on the hearts|pg||
nt|psyck: if the @hA were @dA, that would have been the defense required|pg||
nt|fabsayc: usually opener has a balanced 18-19 hand and belongs in no trump|pg||
nt|fabsayc: multon's pass is amazing|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i think i'd vote for 2@S    lots of losers, no quick tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: Schollaardt is sorry for his dummy :)|pg||
nt|ady: will be happy to see Q@D appear|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i would not, but |pg||
nt|andyv:  in @s, you are almost forced to make 7 if you are in 7 because of the opps @s spots|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they may play automatic cues below game|pg||
nt|andyv:  or 4@h merely xfers back to @s|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: true andy|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you could bid 2@H and then 3@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzvc: West happy East didn't get doubled in 2@S|pg||
nt|djneill:  bold 1@s vulnerable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15, 0+@D  1@S usually less than game force|pg||
nt|mcphee: kinda forced if 1@D can be 0 cards|pg||
nt|andyv:  if it's a cue, then it should not be alerted|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you guys may be right, but in that case 4@S would be a subsitute cue bid of hearts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in true alice in wonderland style|pg||
nt|andyv:  anyway, S is thinking and judging from how long it took N to bid, I have to think 4@h was a cue|pg||
pc|dA|nt|dkkello:  game force , but wich one ? |pg||
nt|gsper:  We will never know|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i would be terrified to double with west hand|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: i made comment about Verhees NOT holding 4@H because they play Raptor NT overcalls, so  (1@S)-1N would show 4@H & 5+@C/@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW play Raptor NT overcalls   so 1N here would show 4@H and 5+@C/@D|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ahollan1: this could be a  Slawinski spot card lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i need a cheat sheet to even try to explain|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, but there is sonme slight consolation in that you are not doubling them into game|pg||
nt|gsper:  You are not alone|pg||
nt|marlowepi: still there could be overtricks, or a XX with nowhere to go.|pg||
nt|mcphee: this will be a cold bath I afraid|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ok makes sense|pg||
nt|fabsayc: down 4 with best defense|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: i've had some good results playing raptor -- but always felt uncomfortable having to use DBL to include a normal strong NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems strange to win @CA and THEN think -- when i've done that it usually means i shouldn't have won the trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  3  4@H made for a push|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well 1@D is opened with  4@D & 5+@S   so weak hand with preference for @S bids  but if you reverse @S & @H maybe not|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  18  [3@CS=]   Paulissen playing 3@S East|pg||
nt|riccho:  @dA and a @c anyone? |pg||
pc|hT|nt|vugraphzvc: it's on their CC http://www.bridge.nl/groepen/Wedstrijdzaken/1112/Lombard_Schollaardt&Wortel.pdf|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 180 on the way?|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  4  Ton Bakkeren stops in 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 of the pairs on the winning Bermuda Bowl team play that  and a couple of pairs from Germany|pg||
nt|mcphee: whihc may make|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ah   hi=odd without honor  or   even with honor|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3@D was likely to be down 1|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sybarra: wonder if Jansma had a 2-suited bid to make |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i suppose this 2N was game force so ok to include 4-fit|pg||
nt|ady: this should be quick|pg||
pc|c4|nt|dkkello:  no problems for declarer now  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: so just a question of how many imps closer White House will be|pg||
nt|ahollan1: middle of hand  both pairs lead 2nd/4th|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it was highlighted so couldn't find it on my own :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: where Verhees 6@H-1|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so 1@c-1@H-6@S in effect|pg||
nt|andyv:  so a sane slam which was not reached in OR|pg||
nt|riccho:  strange @d10|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kiwibridge: big 3-suiters are hard to handle, as are weak ones, but another big plus here |pg||
pc|s3|nt|penseur9:  now the question is only how many overtricks|pg||
nt|jaapfr: will be a struggle to make this 2@H|pg||
nt|dkkello:  and 3 @H makes 8 or 9 now |pg||
nt|ady: now there will be a claim|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|dkkello:  :)  |pg||
nt|dkkello:  Maybe Drijver even guess the @D J |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jaapfr: hoi kjeld welcome|pg||
nt|bobholl: not quite sure of 9 tricks :) (after @H now) has to go for it|pg||
nt|bobholl: if @H now he has to go for @C 33|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: @c2 lead, so he knows @c break|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: assuming they lead 3rd/5th|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3@D could be made if double finesse|pg||
nt|bobholl: assumed that too but migth be 5 :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: in @D|pg||
nt|dkkello:  but it is not a speedball tournament today ... |pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: bertens doubled on 2@c for t/o of @h|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Hi Dennis , is there any timeproblems at this table?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|nt|vugraphzvc: West annoyed about the @DK|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|h6|nt|gsper:  Shortening his trumps frantically|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why did he ruff with the 6?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: to confuse us|pg||
nt|gsper:  But E can overruff in the process|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with one natural trick|pg||
nt|gsper:  But E gets shortened too to avoid the endplay|pg||
nt|fabsayc: indeed in general you should overruff if possible to avoid any trump endplays|pg||
nt|gsper:  In the other rooms it seems W even doubled a 3@C opening|pg||
nt|gsper:  *room|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the difference between the actual 200 and the theoretically available 500 will probably be substantial here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: doubling 3C is different. although it does double opps into game, that opening also tells you that your partner probably has more HCP than anyone else at the table|pg||
nt|gsper:  Why not opener's partner with a misfit the strong one?|pg||
nt|kemperg: stuck?|pg||
nt|gsper:  OK, not in this case where S has passed|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it is 2:36 am here, if they dont speed up soon i will fall asleep|pg||
pc|c8|nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: Morning Geoffrey|pg||
nt|penseur9:  welcome to Geoffrey godd morning|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi gerbrand|pg||

pc|hK|nt|dkkello:  :)|pg||
nt|penseur9:  necessity makes the law :)|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|fabsayc: verhees was checking if anything could go wrong in this line|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh sorry  they're in 3|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dQ|nt|psyck: I play muiderberg 2@h, but that hand looked closer to 1@h than 2@h to me :)|pg||

nt|mcphee: they might|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|h7|nt|fabsayc: unreal|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: similar, I can stand 1@H but not 2@S|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: on 19  Bertens did use DBL to show 4-major and 5+minor|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|c6|pg||
nt|penseur9:  well done|pg||
nt|fabsayc: strange sequence of plays here|pg||
pc|sT|nt|bobholl: with huubke (bertens) at the table you never have time problems :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: bertens would never defend this way with spade queen|pg||

nt|Vugraphzvc: 51 minutes remaining on the clock|pg||

nt|fabsayc: i really think 1nt is the wrong opening, but is a matter of style|pg||
mb|1N|nt|penseur9:  big swing on board 5... slaam bid and made in OR|pg||
nt|penseur9:  for 11 IMPs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: most common hand type is weak NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: for EW CC http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Netherlands/vanprooijen-verhees.pdf|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can have 4+@D and longer @S or @C, but never longer @H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well defended|pg||
nt|andyv:  bidding:  7 minutes.... play of hand:   7 seconds....|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  are we looking at another 3NT by EW again?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: are you 1% serious?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C = majors   if he chooses to bid|pg||
nt|ady: e/w may get to 4@S     bad split may make it awkward|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=@H & @S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: easy game = Pacht - tastic|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: Many ask what is rule of 15|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4N  long @D and tolerance for @C???  |pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: West said this 1 is undiscussed, but it looks liks long @D with 2(3)@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sounds right -- ace ask makes no sense    real @C length would bid 5@C|pg||
nt|ady: should come to 9 tricks   heart lead likely|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: Wortel preventing EW from having misunderstanding    4@H and 1@D makes bid look right, equal vul and @CQ  not so much|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course still a chance for EW to go wrong   [bid rather than DBL]|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: is this really Versace opening 1@C on that or is this a bad dream?|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: it is a guideline for the 4th seat player whether to open the hand|pg||
nt|twcho: HCP + no. of @s cards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D usually says  equal length\|pg||
nt|sybarra: smolen |pg||
nt|ahollan1: totally serious that it would make it interesting    0% serious that it was a bid that would be considered|pg||
nt|ahollan1: try 2@D?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the results link does not work, we will have to wait till official results posted, i believe|pg||
mb|4H|nt|penseur9:  3nt made in OR on  19 for Lombard team|pg||
nt|jaapfr: simple 9 tricks despite bad @HKJT|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: 9 lead denies 10 and shows a honor|pg||
nt|ahollan1: pull because of vulnerability|pg||
nt|psyck: lol, 4333, i don't mind a pass even with AAK|pg||
nt|andyv:  after several exciting hands, we finally get a mundane 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: you can see explanation |pg||
nt|sybarra: Bertens never gets a decent trump break?? |pg||
nt|sybarra: jansma coming in now? |pg||
nt|kemperg: yes 4@S, 5+@H, gamef or stronger|pg||
nt|sybarra: at least only 4/1 this time  |pg||
nt|sybarra: does he have the entries for that Cornelia?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I do not think so |pg||
nt|kemperg: 4@H is minimum, so W wont try slam|pg||
nt|sybarra: Cornelia suggesting that if Bertens plays the Ace of @H, he could finess the 10 |pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if 2N just forcing or specifically showing ????|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's my guess and i'm sticking to it|pg||
nt|psyck: i also prefer the style where 1@s rebid shows 4+ @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: because @s is so vital in partial contract competition|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: with 3-2 we bid 2@D in Netherlands too|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now --  is east hand really a prototypical 3@C bid??    only the shadow knows|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hmm, 2nt as a forcing bid is interesting|pg||
nt|fabsayc: will win in hand and lead club king|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: if this sums up to >= 15, one can open|pg||
nt|twcho: if not, better pass|pg||
nt|penseur9:  that is 12 IMPs for...|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: to find 5-2 fit instead of 4-3 :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bos ducked 2 rounds of @H and flew @CA  |pg||
nt|dkkello:  gtg , be back a little later , very good bridge we see today , |pg||
nt|penseur9:  thanks see you later|pg||
nt|ady: e/w  after a penalty|pg||

nt|ady: trump lead best |pg||
pc|s4|nt|roswolf: hmm got there despite the systen!?:)|pg||
nt|penseur9:  if we remember that EW had a 10 IMp carry over, de Lombard team doing good here|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  19 [3@C-2]  Jansma playing 2@H West|pg||
nt|ady: east will be wary of a bad trump split on the bidding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but what can he do about it?|pg||
nt|mcphee: seems you can pick up trumps |pg||
nt|ady: impossible on the bidding for south to start with ace and another diamond|pg||
nt|mcphee: not sure that is worth it|pg||
nt|djneill:  what are the easy cases for East to imagine, if any|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might try @C9 to dummy then trump|pg||
nt|ady: I would back declarer to make this|pg||
nt|mcphee: i think so also David|pg||
nt|ahollan1: preemptor not leading @C/@D often suggests no singleton there -- so short trump|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but with solid suit   lead from sequence overrides that inference|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: declarer is asking what the signal of Norths hearts means, normally Lavinthal according to Van Prooijen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we have unfair advantage -- don't have to devise line of play assuming @C 4-2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: silly question -- what if it is singleton|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not impossible on the auction|pg||
nt|fabsayc: more overbidding but this time the contract at least has a play|pg||
pc|s8|nt|penseur9:  seems that 2@S should go down here|pg||
nt|gsper:  N will agree with me that S did not have his double|pg||
nt|kemperg: he does with 15 to 15/14|pg||
nt|sybarra: too high now on a @D lead |pg||
nt|ady: 2NT   looks like being down    2 hearts better spot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if vanProoijen had rebid 2@H that would have been 5@H invite!|pg||
nt|ady: might make 2NT  if the clubs get entangles|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder why that wasn't his choice|pg||
nt|fabsayc: north should duck|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Vugraphzvc: Jansma already apologised|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Frank may be thinking about correcting to 3N|pg||
nt|ady: at least down 3 |pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|twcho: this will make thanks to 33 @d|pg||
nt|twcho: east has to determine whether her partner leads a singleton or from 765|pg||
nt|penseur9:  oops|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought that was a Kokish-ism   after opener shows 6-card major, 2N forcing|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: the reference to Lavinthal is   with singleton in dummy, 3rd hand card shows suit preference|pg||
pc|dK|nt|vugraphzvc: Muller - de Wijs missed 4@s on bd 5, so now 14 imps difference|pg||
nt|gsper:  That lead makes it easier, of course|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe not but i dont think north had any extras after his 2@D bid|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ady: I think maybe just 4 trump tricks|pg||
nt|psyck: wrong time to play the beer card|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: from 109 combinations they lead the 10 and with 9xxx 2nd highest, so 9 promises a honor|pg||
nt|jaapfr: my simple statement was too soon (is more to the hand than i thought initially)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Frank didn't realise 2NT was artificial he said|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: similar problems with score last week at the NEC Cup, they need to get Australia involved their scoring package is 2nd to none|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1:  20  Jansma did open 1N on the 4252 hand  Bertens playing 2@HX North|pg||
nt|mcphee: a frisky dble of 2@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in balancing hand  DBL from NT opener = max with doubleton in their suit   looks like perfect fit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after 5 comparisons  session score  2-0|pg||
nt|ady: if he ruffs 3rd heart now with 9@S   north does best to discard|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with south out of trump  might just play @C|pg||
nt|ady: from here much easier|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  for some reason i thought 2 rounds of trump played   actually it was @H ruff in dummy|pg||
nt|mcphee: E mostly concerned about 4/2@C I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@HX made   11 imps to the leaders|pg||
nt|psyck: i pass lots of bad quacky 4333 12 counts too|pg||
pc|h6|nt|psyck: missed the usual 1 imp score due to that|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: well if 2 hearts would have been an invite    why not   instead of 2NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: his actual sequence was still invite but showing one or both 4-card major|pg||
nt|ady: ducking the club  stopped any defensive problems with the suit|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good cash|pg||
nt|ahollan1: easy avoidance play to guarantee the contract|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: avoidance play -- finesse into East to protect the @CJ|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|nt|sybarra: seems everything wrong sided here |pg||
nt|sybarra: but no way to know |pg||
nt|fabsayc: now he cant afford to duck|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmm  i think he needed to insert @H10|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now what   @S or high @C?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the line in vegas       vanProoijen was bidding 5@D|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: duck and take 10 or fly ace to take 10   tough choice|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kemperg: only doubledummy will work:(|pg||
pc|hK|nt|fabsayc: still if clubs were 2-2 was not hopeless|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ady: now down 3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no 3rd round of trump ????|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ahollan1:  19  Paulissen in 5@D  as expected another swing for the leaders|pg||
pc|s6|nt|gsper:  !!|pg||
nt|ady: could have mae  playing a spade when in the east hand with 10@D|pg||
nt|ady: saves 300 for n/s|pg||
nt|psyck: got the 1 rather|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: i wish i was awake enough to analyze @CJ/9 shift|pg||
nt|bebechira: Van Persie scored in the 2nd minute at the Emirates....as we are in the Netherlands may be some people interested lol|pg||
nt|ady: dont believe that|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|penseur9:  he can claim now|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: EW both took a toilet break|pg||
nt|penseur9:  short break here at half way point|pg||
nt|dkkello:  well done Bertens |pg||
nt|jaapfr: E must bring no 9|pg||
nt|dkkello:  yes|pg||
nt|bobholl: i am a great fan off huubke he decides quick and mostly rigth :)|pg||
nt|ady: still will survive  though    |pg||
nt|fabsayc: he has misplayed this hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: should have won second heart in hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now he cant even use the spade pitch|pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugraphzvc: EW discard odd=enc|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: South checked that when West played @Cq|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: @C4*|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in odd/even discards    odd says  "i like this suit"     even says "i don't like this suit, and shows suit preference by size of spot played"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on board 19 open room stopped sanely in 5@D|pg||
pc|dA|nt|twcho: since there is only one entry to dummy, declarer has to hope for even break in both red suits to bring in her contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  21  Bertens in 1@D North  |pg||
nt|fabsayc: well it is going down, so no big deal guys|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sybarra: will that@D  play persuade dec to play for @h 4-1 ?|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in case it wasn't mentioned    20  where Wortel made overtrick in 5@SX    Bos was down 1 in 5@CX   so 2 12-imp pickups in a row for de Lombard|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: :)  ruff sluff  tough to find in NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hehe  Andy wants to play 2@H|pg||
nt|ady: favourable position of Q@H  mad life easier |pg||
nt|fabsayc: great minds occasionally comment alike :)|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: i'm dizzy enough not have slept yet      did he really trade -3 for -4?|pg||
nt|ady: surely settle for 500   s smallish loss against making 3NT for e/w|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we know it was always down, but no reason to go down 2|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|nt|sybarra: appently it did |pg||
pc|c9|nt|mcphee: well played hand|pg||

nt|twcho: EW are ladies while NS are gentlemen|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: EW came back, discussing about the 5@C board board  6 that is|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so Verhees X only cost 2 imps   unless it helped Wortel make 5@S|pg||
nt|gsper:  I think E will apologise too|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Bertens apologising now :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes....thats why they are playing and we are mere commentators |pg||
nt|sybarra: Bertens "on fire"  as one spec said |pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Both apologised :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  5  Jansma has described his short @S opposite 1N opener  so they find 5@D|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Ton looking for coffee|pg||
nt|ahollan1: make mine a coke|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS system has 2@S as only weak 2 -- but it requires 6 card suit    but down a bunch, will vP slip @C into @S???|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if that was the actual play he made one|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe not|pg||
nt|psyck: and Zaleski continue to score in binary|pg||
nt|riccho:  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|gsper:  My predictions are unusually accurate today:)|pg||
nt|kemperg: teammate of me agrees too:(|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  only 11 tricks here in @S due to king off side|pg||
nt|fabsayc: too early in the morning perhaps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S [in my opinion a lucky stop]  big pickup|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 1@D - X?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@D should be invite after redouble and 2s, to force would need to bid 3@H|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: oh  i said overtrick -- sorry  10@S on time|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this might be dangerous for e/w|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was going to ask if east opens 1@S or 2@S   [the only weak 2 in the system]|pg||
nt|dkkello:  all 4 dammend good bridgeplayers , we danes envi you big time!|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: westra a big fan of responding light to partner's 1M-opening, especially at this vul|pg||
nt|gsper:  If kibs want response to chats, it is polite to have your full name in your profile|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N="almost forcing"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS need decent 12 to open 1@D with balanced hand|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|dkkello:  1 NT  ..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no transfers after DBL either -- that's a surprise to me|pg||
nt|ady: difficult re-bid   3@H   looks too high|pg||
nt|mcphee: oh|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: that is a hefty 1@H overcall :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: it looks as if the table with bauke(muller) will finish before the one with hubbke(bertens) incredible :)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  keep the flies away sometimes|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thats the 3rd sub-standrd opening now, quite frankly I am shocked|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe N will balance with an x if passed to him|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: e/w sensibly keeping their heads down|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s mustnt get carried away|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: NS might reach 4@S, guess West will dbl that|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup with relish|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is 4@C a cue bid andy and jordan for you|pg||
pc|h7|nt|bobholl: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unfavorable,  ambivalent suit,  7222 [i.e. outside losers]    3@S still doesn't occur to me|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: 3NT looks lik an reasonable contract in EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tough choice vul at imps|pg||
nt|ady: even higher|pg||
nt|mcphee: i think 3@H a bad bid|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: no support doubles|pg||
nt|ady: 3 hearts should make  as south has only 1 entry to play diamonds threw the king|pg||
nt|riccho:  the most volatile choice here...|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, could get interesting|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bobholl: good flying from brink drijver :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: but i think it's becoming common practice to respond light here|pg||
nt|dkkello:  not against theese guys however , the can smell a vul game |pg||
nt|dkkello:  or more!|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@D anyone ?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: jansma might have doubled 2@C if negative|pg||
nt|psyck: Deal 6 East hand: 14.75KnR, 30 Zar.  Deal 8 W hand: 11.7KnR, 24 Zar.  (26+ zar recommended to open)|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@S strikes me as bold and has tempted north to go on|pg||
nt|sybarra: suggested by another spec:  If he knows that trumps never break for him it is easy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D10 prevents defense from taking 3 tricks in the suit without declarer's help|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@D did make    22-0 set for White House|pg||
nt|ady: has the look of 1 down|pg||
nt|psyck: S takes a safer option with poor @h's|pg||
nt|jcwla:  yes|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jaapfr: y DD:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: given today's hand agree |pg||
nt|kemperg: 1N = @S and 1@S was max. 3 @Ss|pg||
nt|ady: well this has pushed to game  ?|pg||
nt|psyck: This one is 10.3KnR, 23 Zar.  they hear my comment about quacky 12 counts & wanted to prove me wrong|pg||
pc|c9|nt|twcho: not everyone will open North hand|pg||
nt|twcho: 2@c is probably 2-way checkback|pg||
nt|roswolf: west asleep!?|pg||
nt|penseur9:  we're seing very agressive bidding here|pg||
nt|penseur9:  good stop here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you mean to pass 2@S?|pg||
nt|ady: 5@D a good contract to reach    a nice fight back|pg||
nt|ady: might make on a cross ruff    will need to ruff 3rd club with 8@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  6 [4@SN=]   Paulissen in 4@HX   that should be another pickup for trailing team|pg||
pc|cA|nt|twcho: forcing his partner to bid 2@d|pg||
nt|twcho: and then 2@h is an invitaional bid showing at least 54 M|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: NS are still juniors, what do you expect :)|pg||
nt|ady: spade lead best to try and remove entry to 4th club   but 8@H is an entry|pg||
nt|psyck: *4333|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: wonder why Zar never caught on lol, too complicated, KnR?|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed with age comes caution because only juniors and madmen know no fear:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: helps to play some form of Bart or Gazilli|pg||
nt|psyck: is is very easy to calculate zar at the table|pg||
nt|psyck: but is is just another tool, has its pros & cons|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@h -1 at best...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the multi hand gained another 9 imps|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: nice @D10 in East hand    for 4@H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: for most of us 2@D would promise a rebid|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'm told 2@D=both majors, X would be only one (rather strange)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: 3 swings this set   all double digit|pg||
nt|penseur9:  we have big swingers :0|pg||
nt|ahollan1: expect @H10 to show @D preference?|pg||
nt|penseur9:  :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: if you see ew only and know N opened you want to be in 6@D|pg||
nt|mcphee: i think this is even worse than 3@H:)|pg||
nt|riccho:  not 1 imp but an exciting 2 imp score here? |pg||
pc|c4|nt|twcho: of course, north decline his partner's hearty invitation. :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think the tone of the set proves that @D won't run|pg||
nt|gsper:  Instructions for voice commentary: http://webutil.bridgebase.com/v2/news_fetch.php?id=743|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6 requires a revoke|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|penseur9:  with the 4@H preempt, declairer knows that trumps are mostly in East|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H2?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H @H makes for interesting hand too|pg||
nt|kemperg: both majors spec tells|pg||
nt|ady: might try for trumps 3-2  which is 8 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and helps show why van Prooijen didn't open a non-systemic 'state of match' 2@S |pg||
nt|ahollan1: isn't @C ruff with @S8   8 tricks?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|nt|penseur9:  :)|pg||
nt|penseur9:  untill N finds the @s king he may think they missed slam|pg||
nt|ady: well we can see J9 spades with east|pg||
nt|psyck: or 5|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ady: what is right    2@H  a little conservative|pg||
nt|psyck: if it makes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: making 4 is a lot|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right  north just guessing|pg||
nt|mcphee: however exact methods are not known to us|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ahollan1: 1@D also down 3  so Verhees bidding 1@S with junk  equates to push|pg||
nt|mcphee: 3@H for me shows a trick taking suit, one where you do not have to give up the elad 3 times:)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|twcho: this is not a nice dummy for declarer|pg||
nt|penseur9:  very hard to guess how declarer will handle this hand here|pg||
nt|roswolf: well he is going off -probably a few|pg||
nt|penseur9:  @D ruff ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes K and anor seems best|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer is fortunate that the @HJ falls|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|penseur9:  now wat a relief it is :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: and she knows, as Jans girlfriend:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  wife - just married!|pg||
nt|psyck: for kibs who ask, Zar Count=Number of high card points + length of two longest suits + number of controls (A=2, K=1) + (length of longest suit minus length of shortest suit)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: there are good 11 counts and there are flat poop with 2XAces and 1 King, it doesnt need Zar to work out if one is worth opening|pg||
nt|psyck: some use just the 1st 2 factors as a rule of 20|pg||
nt|psyck: Zar requires 26+ to open|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I just use common sense|pg||
nt|psyck: there are also some corrections like adding 1 zar for 4+ @s suit|pg||
nt|psyck: you can download a 4 in 1 opening bid evaluator here: http://tedmuller.us/Bridge/Software.htm|pg||
nt|psyck: the help section in that software will explain the reasonings behing each of the evaluatiors|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: or you can use your eyes :)|pg||
nt|psyck: but you always have to fall back on your experience & judgement, e.g. zar may not factor in values in short suits instead of long ones...|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: how close is 4@H for NS?|pg||
nt|sybarra: congrats to them@H@H |pg||
nt|ady: heaty seems best|pg||
pc|s4|nt|penseur9:  @C now ???|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 22  final contract 4@HX|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: now ruff and trump|pg||
nt|ady: dont think it is right to re-bid 3NT to show 6 hearts and 3 spades  with that strength|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @HA  then @HK shows @D|pg||
nt|ady: nice position though if south has 1 big diamond  queen or jack to give a guess what the play is from?|pg||
nt|mcphee: rather than be pushy with a poor suit if you make the 2@H rebid you are well placed if partner bids again|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|penseur9:  4@Sx makes for headaches for declarer and commentators alike :)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|psyck: normal to go down here, only the previledged in the gallary like us can read the cards :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mcphee: if they pass 2@H most days you will be a happy camper|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|penseur9:  should have played low|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|nt|psyck: @c spots good enough to make|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: those of us that return partners suit probably hold this to 2|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jaapfr: is 6@D unbeatable?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|roswolf: looks booked for -2|pg||
nt|penseur9:  yes|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: on 23  Jansma opened 2@D [multi] where Schollaard opened 1@S  [and Wortel down in 4@H]     Bos playing 3N East|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|sybarra: those little baby @H spots in dummy |pg||
pc|d6|nt|twcho: south is restraining enough to bid only 2@h but the dummy is really disappointing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: told you @D10 in dummy was nice :)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bobholl: if you guess @D yes|pg||

mb|p|nt|viren169: wd|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|viren169: lol...more luck than judgement, i guess|pg||
nt|xenya: not that it will do them much good |pg||
pc|s3|nt|viren169: Now only 200/500|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|viren169: better than 1N dbled...|pg||
nt|xenya: seems so, yes|pg||
nt|viren169: Gawrys has stopped shaking now...|pg||
nt|viren169: Normal 1N overcall...be interesting how the auction develops in the CR|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|pc|c3|pc|cK|pg||
nt|xenya: we'll see it soon|pg||
nt|viren169: Cards are sitting well for declarer - they will think themselves lucky here!|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|viren169: Especially East, who will have contributed with the 4-card spade suit here!|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|pc|d5|nt|xenya: yes, E's hand is known as Yarborough -- no card higher than 9|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|viren169: West did well to redble. Was East's pass forcing?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h6|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|nt|viren169: Looks like E/W are playing somesort of wriggle over 1NT dbled|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|viren169: so finding 2@S was not quite so lucky as we thought!|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Anderson-Pelham,_2nd_Earl_of_Yarborough|pg||
nt|xenya: that's right|pg||
nt|viren169: so if East had some scattered values it would pass 1NT redbled|pg||
nt|viren169: so here 2@C was part of an escape seq|pg||
nt|xenya: known as scrambling in some circles|pg||
nt|viren169: Lots of variations of the Wriggle available|pg||
nt|psridhar: well you gave an assignment; i hv done it :)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: can we replay that with a 2@S opener??|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3x yes so must been unbeatable:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: jaap you were rigth about DD i forgot the @D T|pg||
nt|penseur9:  10 IMPs diff with 9 boards to score|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Sorry play sped up there I may have missed something/ got something wrong|pg||
nt|gsper:  You can not have missed anything very interesting|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=10-15 HCP, 4+@S  if 2-suit then 2nd suit is LONGER|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S rebid without those toys is wide range|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final board of the set|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think is more a matter of weak two bids are weaker in Europe than NA, so south can be quite light for 1 and 2 spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's nice score for NS|pg||
nt|mcphee: that will lose a few imps I think|pg||
nt|psyck: yeah, they should stop making those questionable openings :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: should be able to get to 6 clubs  with wests great hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS play Ghestem|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  looking at wrong card|pg||

nt|ahollan1: does south reopen with DBL?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sunday afternnon so we are all so peacefull:)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  sunday morning IMHO|pg||
nt|bobholl: no alert for 4@S ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S = 1-suited, 6+suit|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@C=3-fit Drury  [2@D=4-fit]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 18+ bal|pg||
nt|mcphee: I didn't think he was light at all|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: well   vP also had to decide to treat the hand as opener rather than preempt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh right   east gets to bid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the first place team in each group plays 2nd in other group|pg||
mb|2C|nt|penseur9:  5@D seems to make EW but can it be bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't know about 4@H :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: possible  slam try in @C???|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would be kool if 4@H is RKC|pg||
nt|ady: 6 diamonds a good save  800 if 6 clubs is bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does anyone know if screens in use?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 03:10 where i'm trying to stay awake|pg||
nt|ahollan1: short suit game try???|pg||
nt|fabsayc: winners take home 12000 dollars|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzvc: West before he sees dummy: down 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzvc: Yup screens|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i assume so    seems operator is waiting to display bids until after both screenmates bid|pg||
nt|kemperg: dbl might give the save|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@D not a RKC response    looks like cue showing 1st/2nd round control|pg||
nt|ady: as pointed out 6NT can make by east    so n/s would need to go to the 7 level for 1100  for a save|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: the nebulous 1@d deprive NS from competing|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well this could be manna to n/s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it might be hard to believe, but 1st 3 boards of the set actually were contracts that MADE|pg||
nt|penseur9:  quite unusual wasn't it? :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might be blasphemy,    is west hand automatic 2@S bid opposite passed hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: they do not always alert all bids that need to be alerted|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no problem for me, i am on Marshall Islands time|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Verhees did NOT have weak 2@H bid available|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but he could have responded 2@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for EW  2@S is the only weak 2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C/@D/@H are all intermediate hands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S = 8-11  3-places to play   so 5431/4441, some 5440|pg||
nt|fabsayc: which should just about cover the vodka and hotel :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: if 5431 then yes   but here with wasted round jacks, i'm not so sure|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @CA lead destrys all hope of N here|pg||
nt|dkkello:  it is on the lead  and some more |pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|twcho: 5@d is a cheap sacrifice|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S rebid is invitational|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i know i'd bid at the table, but not sure it is right|pg||
nt|ady: would you believe that     why save|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tough to show those solid 8-baggers :(|pg||
nt|kemperg: no save needed:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Verhees obviously expected better trump with 3@S|pg||
nt|ady: well surely even if the spades are solid   6 clubs will be a certainty|pg||
nt|ady: east could have had AQJXXX   and stil there can be a 5-1 split    cant be better than playing a solid  8 card suit?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i've checked   after 2@S Michaels  they use both cue bids to show @S raises|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so DBL starts all good hands with 4th suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but  agree with voices from above   why not just Ask Aces|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since there are 2 ways to set @S then I think immediate 4N should be Standard Blackwood [not Keycard]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i shouldn't use term "2 cues"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they use 2N and 3@H to show different strength 4+@S raises|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so now i'm confused about why not 3@C -- still looking to see if i've made note about it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Verhees bids RELAYS|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C = 1@C|pg||
nt|ady: solid 4@S for n/s|pg||
nt|fabsayc: an excellent save here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: keep in mind monaco needs only to avoid a blitz to qualify for playoffs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava12/slava12r.htm for standings after 2 rounds|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D preempts  would also get votes|pg||
nt|bobholl: it is agressive anyway but mostly on the 3@D bid :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Verhees apologising, saying 6NT may be the top spot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: also checking the draft of book  "the art of bidding solid 8 card suits"|pg||
nt|ady: amazing  clubs never mentioned once  with AKQJXXXX|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or semi-solid 9-baggers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so in Ultimate Canape  you either open 3@H or PASS with what others open 2@H or multi 2@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=3@H|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jaapfr: y N feels he has a beauty|pg||
nt|fabsayc: al, what is a 2h opening in VV system|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe puppet to 2N to then show long suit try in @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: regardless of meaning   they got there|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and layout very declarer friendly|pg||
nt|ady: nice red suit splits    |pg||
pc|h7|nt|kiwibridge: even after 4 @S tricks they can't help but make :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|twcho: but they don't have any chance to find it|pg||
nt|roswolf: east's lack of defence will be a deterrenr for future adventures!?|pg||
nt|kemperg: undo|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D completes exact shape|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Martin  the responses change a bit for passed hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i have no life :(|pg||
nt|psyck: Versace decision to open 1NT fetches about 7 imps of so|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: auction says nothing about vP's @H length|pg||
nt|penseur9:  might make 4 here|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: West hoped East could bid 3N over 3@S :)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  the 10 of @D an importent card once again |pg||
pc|h4|nt|roswolf: declarer should get the guesses right|pg||
nt|roswolf: or at least 1 of them|pg||
nt|penseur9:  pretty difficult decision to finesse here|pg||
nt|roswolf: not much else for west's double than Qxx(X) IN @h +@c|pg||
nt|penseur9:  right, no entry to is hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might think Verhees short in @C rather than @D   but can't make in that case|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: South asked about possible shapes in East, not sure what the questions were, answers were 1@D and 1@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: that makes more sense |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 10-15 hcp  5+@H 4+@C     2@D = @H & @D|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ady: leaders pulling away again|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: NONE of the Bermuda Bowl partnerships is known for timidity :)|pg||
nt|gsper:  With the @C9 falling this makes, rather surprisingly|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at the practical level, 2D by S might have fetched a making 3N by N. E might well lead spade honor against that auction|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or a heart|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S forced 3N|pg||
nt|riccho:  If W has a systemic 2c opening, E had to do sth more than pass|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: 28-0 so far this set for Het Witte and boards 8 and 9 dont look bad for them|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bobholl: small @D ducked and it can be made|pg||
pc|d2|nt|penseur9:  will go down now|pg||
nt|roswolf: now declarer is in danger|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room playing  10 in 4@SX|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: @SK @D away, @H still works?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now 4@S mild slam try in @S|pg||
nt|ady: 20 bids to get to 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: amateurs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: van Prooijen showed 5341 with bad spades|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: and 9-11|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i kibitzed Burgess-Marston  they ran BOTH opponents out of PASS cards before reaching 3N|pg||
nt|ady: 1 for the 5th spade|pg||
pc|sK|nt|penseur9:  I could be wrong :)|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|nt|ahollan1: how loud were the gasps when dummy came down?|pg||
nt|ady: a bigger lead for Onstein after this|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that is result of using 1-level canape openings|pg||
nt|fabsayc: notice these strange meanings are forced to allow consistency in canape structure|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|roswolf: declarer may however muddle it|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  8  [the very bizarre 2@SX-2]  Paulissen 3N East|pg||
nt|ady: another 3 or 4|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: but look at the score|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|nt|fabsayc: i am told 3@D game unspecified singleton, but in that case i dont understand versace double of 5@H|pg||

nt|penseur9:  de Lombard made another 11 IMPs on  23... only 3 IMPs diff now|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: players discussing how many 5@h or 5@c would have been off|pg||
nt|gsper:  That was nonsense by me, but it still made|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Verhees saying he thinks 6 poor @S is not good enough to rebid 3@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Westra will open Verhees' hand with 2@D  = weak @H or various strong hands|pg||
nt|ady: that seems wrong|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no overtrick???|pg||
nt|mcphee: back 2 mins|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: @DQ was a BIG clue|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  8   v Lankveld  5@D west|pg||
nt|psyck: yes E could bid eventhough W is limited hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  5@S for sure NS |pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3nt or 4@H?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 18+ bal|pg||
nt|ady: maybe west just condeeded a club|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 22 was another 8 for leaders   [that was 4@S hand that took so long   the other table was 4@HX]|pg||
nt|ady: 5@C   6 if taking a peep at the diamond position|pg||
nt|psyck: South lead @h other room in that 3N, Ginossar did well not to here|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: what else?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: ns 2@H/@S openers are natural weak 2's    go figure|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ady: good lay for game in hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL = 5-7 hcp|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: wrong Al    westra 2@D is weak EITHER major or ...|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe took a conservative view as NV|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: make sure your partnership knows whether 4N or 5@C is asking for partner's minor|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: with strong leaping michaels they just bid 4m|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: they know :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: options include using 5m as saying  I have my own suit   or   using 4N/5@C to differentiate strength|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @C like the precision 2 @C  can have a 4 card major |pg||
nt|ady: trumps 2-2  and diamond finesse helps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and 100 honors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this interference probably helping EW   both in auction and in play|pg||
nt|andyv:  almost a classic dbl|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@d xfer to @h...probably a better raise than 2@h directly|pg||
nt|riccho:  Ew play some sort of polish club?!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: each match has two segments of 12 boards with about a 15 minute break|pg||
mb|d|nt|penseur9:  I beleive to take with the ace and play trump is best line here|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|bobholl: 4@H i guess|pg||
nt|penseur9:  still may go down one though|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H = natural, forcing   not sure why it gets alert|pg||
nt|ahollan1: voices discussing 3@S bid on last hand|pg||
nt|ady: not sure where n/s were going    but now we know|pg||
nt|ady: surely south will not remove|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one twist is   1@S only promised 4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure, but it is possible that other bids/pass  show  canape/5332 shapes|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  9 [3@HW+1]    Jansma playing 2@S South|pg||
nt|ady: an easy 300 to 500|pg||
nt|ady: 3@H    some action|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzxn: the second segment will start in 10-20 minutes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@D is a sound heart raise|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we must forgive them for not paying attention, as there is nothing at stake in this match, zimmerman has qualified, vainkonis already eliminated|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: must be puppet stayman,   3@S=4@H, not 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if Wortel gave any thought to leading trump|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how close is North to making a stronger bid over 3@S?   other than 4@H  [which endplays partner] what else can he try without playing adjective bridge?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Westra hand got a lot better on this auction   but only because East bid 3@S|pg||
nt|ady: K@C   or Q@H lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @HQ for me|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|xenya: he had almost an opener opposite W's 2@C bid|pg||
nt|riccho:  kibs explains to me that 2@c was limited to 14 HCP. |pg||
nt|fabsayc: last night first hand had lots of dull flat boards, the second half lots of slams, i wish for that again|pg||
nt|fabsayc: direct 2@S over 2@D would be better hand for me|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@D multi so direct 2@S also could be conventional|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am just guessing :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: nevertheless, a very poor showing|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: who knows   @C lead could kill entry to partner's hand|pg||
nt|ady: east badly of whichever  lead king of clubs or queen of hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: remember when most common distributions were  5431 and 4432 ??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from what i've seen  all of the Bermuda Bowl winners make bids like this|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: 4@C slam try in @H|pg||
nt|dkkello:  coffe hand ?  ( i am told no hand is a coffehand! )|pg||
nt|jaapfr: this one is with @S 4-3 and @H 3-2 and @DK ok:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H does NOT show @S length  it is 'normal'  1-suiter|pg||
nt|riccho:  Than it was W who did the mistake. The hand is certainly worth more than 14 HCP (Bd 34)|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  The coffeshops in Netherland is also better than ours ;)  |pg||
nt|gsper:  Voice commentator suggests that N had not shown 4@H|pg||
nt|gsper:  *5@H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: safest line win spade ace, lead heart queen|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if he has not shown five hearts i dont like this method, more likely jansma took a view|pg||
nt|sybarra: so even this hand Bertens gets a 3/1 break |pg||
nt|sybarra: better than 4/0 |pg||
nt|sybarra: but I bet he is thinking about that option |pg||
nt|ahollan1: good defense, but declarer will prevail|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  21  [3@CW=]  Westra 2@H after opening 1N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in 4th seat|pg||
mb|4S|nt|twcho: 4@h can be defeated it seems|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just guessing|pg||
nt|bobholl: boils down to the @C decision i guess|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  10  Frank Bakkeren  thinking over the Michaels bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  15-15 VPs|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: what is the best strategy for N to bid his hand against strong @c?|pg||
nt|twcho: it is an interesting problem indeed|pg||
nt|ady: nice 1 suiter?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice in context of  favorable vul opposite passed partner :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: EW has missed their par contract of 3NT but N came to their rescue|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y before 5 losers so a dutch coffeeshop hand:)|pg||
nt|gsper:  They have a number of canape positions|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Jansma explained 3@D as showing 5-5 btw|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thanks operator, smooth job @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  seems a resonnable stop here|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: North puts dummy down; to bad trumps|pg||
nt|bobholl: not necessary in 4@H :) |pg||
nt|kemperg: duck! @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: should Frank play for Ton to have underled @CA?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: honest   i typed that before he returned @C9|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well he needs a second club trick to have a chance, so pretty normal|pg||
pc|cA|nt|penseur9:  should make now|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|nt|twcho: I think east shd bid 3NT with regard to her sheer strength|pg||
nt|jaapfr: now @D creates a lot of pressure |pg||
nt|dkkello:  do you agree on the 2 @D bid?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4333333333333 for me ok to deny|pg||
nt|dkkello:  i agree it looks like a NT hand to me!  |pg||
nt|bobholl: don't even understand because 4@H stay 4@H without an hounour :)|pg||
nt|gsper:  Ty|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vP might have bid 3@S thinking that 3@H was a psych    so - rather than losing a chance to defend 4@H  worried about what he would do over 4@C-P-P|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: South really took @C10 with the A|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ok 2 different views (half specs agree and other disagree as we do)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for those who started with duplicate    in the old days   holding 4 of top 5 trump got a bonus of 100 points, 5 of 5 got 150 for honors  [and all 4 aces in NT was 150]|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bobholl: but huubke needs swings :)|pg||
nt|ady: duck a spade  and if trumps 3-1   hope 3rd trump has the length in spades|pg||
pc|c8|nt|twcho: her 12 points + her partner's 16+ make 3NT a hot favorite to make|pg||
nt|riccho:  Aces are structurally undervalued in point-coint|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jaapfr: too much frustrated in the past with a 4333 and missing NT|pg||
nt|dkkello:  need right wiew in clubs and teammates will never notice what happend, my money goes on declarer here |pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|djneill:  North may pitch a @d, assuming needs South to have @dQ to set it, right?|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  23  11 to the trailing team|pg||
nt|psyck: yes Ekaterina was flawless|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2NT shows both majors i believe, french agreement|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: Frank Bakkeren jumps to 4N over Michaels|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: :) indeed|pg||
nt|riccho:  count |pg||
pc|cT|nt|twcho: while the opponent's bidding shows a likely chance of bad break|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jaapfr: especially this one:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course he doesn't have to worry about canape -- but i don't think that should have factored in here either|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if 2@D was multi 2nt followed by 3@H is invite|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ady: now no problem|pg||
pc|s7|nt|vugraphzvc: West surprised now|pg||
nt|ady: tht that was only money bridge Al ?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: final board is 28|pg||
nt|ady: on 23  with the 6 hearts and 3 spades  west chose to re-bid 2 hearts rather than 3NT   and gained 11 imps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 24  Paulissen opened 3rd seat with his balanced 6-count :)|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s9|pc|s4|pc|d4|pg||
nt|kemperg: OK 1 down is enough|pg||
mc|10|nt|ahollan1: too tired    wondering if Ton should duck 2nd @C    i know doesn't matter on actual layout but ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Frank went to the bathroom|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  22  [3NN+1]  Paulissen North playing 3@C REDOUBLED|pg||

nt|twcho: and EW can make 4@h if NS didn't find their ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks to everyone who has pointed out   north is  SHE|pg||
nt|penseur9:  well done|pg||
nt|ady: lucky    got out for down 2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: 15 minutes remaining on the clock|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually  early world championships playing Total Points included honors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: time for another big club auction!|pg||
nt|psyck: Thanks Gary & the kibs for joining us here & for their inputs.|pg||
nt|andyv:  final board|pg||
nt|xenya: now comes the big blow|pg||
nt|psyck: Zaleski seem to be on track to get back to making it to a qualification spot...lot more work to do still of course|pg||
nt|fabsayc: last board now, thanks to our operator for a good job|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@S never has shorter 2nd suit  could be 4@S with 5+other|pg||
nt|gsper:  I have to leave now. Thank you Bas for a great job (goes without saying)|pg||
nt|gsper:  And Martin, Marshall and informative kibs|pg||
nt|ady: ok|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they were excellent Krishna and thanks also to you :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Martin and Gary|pg||
nt|vugraphzxn: Next match will start at 5.30 Moscow time.|pg||
nt|psyck: 2nd half of this match in about 30 minutes|pg||
nt|riccho:  the 5@h bid from other table looks crazy in my mind|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava12/slava12r.htm  for results|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|ahollan1: 5@S 5@H opens 1@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might well be some fight between the majors of e/w|pg||
nt|penseur9:  9 IMPs on 10 for O1 for a 2IMP now... it's anybodies game now|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: finally an example of canape hand  i.e.  2nd suit is LONGER|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with 3@H/@S  they use 1@S-2@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is this a 1@H opening or upgrade to 2@D = bal 18-19|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i really did type that before the bid was made|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Thanks Göran :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: which may effectively end this match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but mostly rubber bridge|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 18+ bal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL = @H & @S|pg||
nt|djneill:  vulnerable, but 1-level, 5-5, strong club - lots going for the X|pg||
nt|ady: n/s   will cetainly be ing game     3NT?|pg||
nt|djneill:  yep|pg||
nt|mcphee: pretty sure they will rule out @S game david|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and to everybody involved, including our spectators for some "interesting" observations|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|penseur9:  O1 = Onstein1 :0|pg||
nt|penseur9:  :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thanks G|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and to our operator, the organizers, bbo and lots of suggestions from spectators|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Ekaterina for a wonderful job as our operator|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@C alert maybe 2 card suit|pg||
mb|2S|nt|twcho: many kibitzers pointed out that 4@h should be cold even NS find their ruffs|pg||
nt|twcho: sorry for my wrong analysis|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we saw that at the beginning of the set -- or maybe that was last set|pg||
nt|bobholl: didn't see huub do anything wrong (no 2@D bid in the start may be)|pg||
nt|ady: nice 4@S for n/s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think 1@H ignores DBL  so   FG  a) BAL [no singleton/void], 8+ HCP  b) 3 places-to-play, 12-14 HCP|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: sorry, I was delivering some drinks for the guys, N and E did not think|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: 2@D=@H|pg||
nt|psyck: we can be sure that the contract will not be the same here this room now|pg||
nt|riccho:  W blocked N from any @h-ambitions easily ... .)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: good fitting black suits     should make 11 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D  10-15 HCP, 5+@H 4+@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and again  DBL=5-7 hcp|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S a good save for e/w|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not counting @SJ|pg||
nt|mcphee: we forgive you this one time|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no real life kibitzers in the room??|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: nope, not allowed|pg||
nt|mcphee: anyone a 3@H bidder as E?|pg||
nt|ady: reasonable|pg||
nt|mcphee: i suppose dble need not be 5/5  major tho|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: was that a transfer to NY :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: NT:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: S ostensibly very strong for this sequence but presumably wishing to prevent EW finding viable save|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would be more worried about missinbg a slam than about that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm uncertain of auctions after the interference :(|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thanks Andy and martin, great operator and amazing specs @H|pg||
nt|andyv:  and ty specs for joining us and making this so much fun.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|twcho: need to drop the offside K, highly unlikely|pg||
nt|kemperg: on board 22 2 down in 3NT, big win for Onstein|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not this opening is very preemptive on partner, this is excellent 4@H game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Verhees could raise with something exceptional|pg||
nt|ady: will have to play on spades|pg||
nt|ady: I suppose could run 10@S   first round|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes NY here we come :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: last hand, thanks everybody|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 2@D= ANY INVIE!?|pg||
nt|roswolf: invite|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry   2@D=ART INV  a) 3/4@S  b) NT  c) 3@H/@S & 6@C/@D|pg||
nt|penseur9:  good stop here|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@H jump probably does NOT set up forcing pass situation|pg||
nt|sybarra: that was that crazy hand "wrong sided" at both table |pg||
nt|ahollan1: voices from above make great point   why ONLY 2@H from east|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: ty al|pg||
nt|sybarra: has to find the 9th trick here |pg||
nt|sybarra: but hts are 3/3  so should not be difficult |pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to try a @H early,  that gets the club ace out of N hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry I mean a @C early |pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  will declarer guess the trump the right way?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: total performance of all 4 here very high imo|pg||
nt|dkkello:  agree |pg||
nt|fabsayc: this 3@D raise covers a lot of hand types, it seems|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Bergen style|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: last set almost half of the boards were double digit swings   here, the biggest exchange is 3 imps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S good bid -- took away Verhees Michaels call -- so vP limited info|pg||
nt|ady: dbl showes majors?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: at 04:36  i should copy/paste rather than try to remember :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh my     Ton bid over 6@C  so he really did think 4N was keycard|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final is 7@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: west's dbl  yes  @H & @S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a decent slam if no club lead|pg||
pc|h2|nt|penseur9:  :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but 5@H isn't exceptional|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H  not guaranteed    need correct diamond guess|pg||
nt|ady: certainly must defend 4@S|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|penseur9:  looks like +2 here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think will go down 1|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: on  25  vLankveld overcalled 4@H immediately|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  9  [vP's 3@S opener]    Bos opened 1@S and Lankveld declaring 3N West|pg||
nt|penseur9:  we seam frozen here|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: no North thinking|pg||
nt|ady: unusual to be doubled in a solid 10 card fit   but should get 300|pg||
nt|mcphee: not always 5/5 though correct Al?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: sometimes even the world's best look just like us humans :) see you sson for the next set @H|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: run 10@S   soade to ace and diamond|pg||
nt|ady: spade|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no lengths given on CC  but vul|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ady: switch to stiff A@C    and low diamond best|pg||
nt|ahollan1: alert of PASS implies they play PASS/DBL Inversion here   where PASS says willing to defend  and DBL says "i'd like to bid more"|pg||
nt|ady: can get 500|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  9 [2@SN=]  Bertens opened 2@S [2-suiter] and was raised  that should mean yet another pickup for White House|pg||
pc|h3|nt|twcho: Is 6@s an odd on bid?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: about this hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: yes, she is.. |pg||
nt|penseur9:  ok tks :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my guess would be 55 highly probable|pg||
nt|fabsayc: time for spade lead|pg||
pc|h8|nt|penseur9:  again a reminder that EW had a 10 IMP carry over so very thight play here |pg||
nt|riccho:  15 Imps or so if 4@s goes down; even 10 Imps if they let 4@s thru|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: as you see   responder does NOT promise 3+fit|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: soon|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  25  Jansma playing 6@C|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mcphee: so E should have perhaps considered 3@H|pg||
nt|ady: thats why I am not a great believer in these defences to strong club   if you dont play the hand the auction reveals too mcuh|pg||
nt|mcphee: i am a major believer you get in their face|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on the flip side   you really don't like giving Relay pair a free run in the auction|pg||
nt|mcphee: conventions like Suction or crash dak are good against strong @C|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 3@D  limited splinter, 3@H asksm 4@D =@Hx not @C cue thx unox for that|pg||
nt|vugraphzxn: Next segment will start in 15 minutes|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  11.00 Moscow, 8.00 Paris, 7 am UK|pg||
pc|c5|nt|roswolf: in the other room on 9 west axed 4@S to gain 5 imps|pg||
nt|bobholl: berry zal (een beetje) verrast zijn als @H 4 1 zitten|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kemperg: wow|pg||
nt|sybarra: now will explore the red suits |pg||
nt|jbennet: west still have sort of guess.|pg||
nt|jbennet: play for klub king south??|pg||
nt|jbennet: or play for at least 1 red suit 3-3?|pg||
nt|kemperg: lots of options now|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: a) he thought 4N keycard   b) he thought 6@C asking 3rd round control|pg||
nt|ady: will not be good if 4 spades reached in OR    but better than 2 spades passed out|pg||
nt|ahollan1: suction is called something different in other parts of the world    i think much of europe calls it Kelsey [or maybe Yeslek]   can't recall name in New Zealand/Australia :(|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sybarra: :( |pg||
pc|sA|nt|kemperg: even discarding a @H wont matter|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry berry will be surprised (a bit) with @H 41|pg||
nt|dkkello:  he will come to 8 tricks now one way or another  |pg||
nt|sybarra: now all ok |pg||
nt|kemperg: claim|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@D was doubled  but Frank didn't give his brother a chance to bid 6N|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that explains a lot including the lead|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzvc: brink smashing his @hJ on the table|pg||
nt|dkkello:  pitch spade  |pg||
nt|bobholl: didn't come to mind at first but it is a good idea|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i miss why he does not play @S7 in a split second?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kiwibridge: thanks again all, I am staggered by the score :(|pg||
nt|andyv:  quite a shock|pg||
nt|andyv:  good night all|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: for sure i can avoid +1 with heart return now|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|pc|dJ|nt|bobholl: A of @S @D 8 tricks|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|jaapfr: now goes the @S:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 7|pg||
mc|9|nt|ady: lost a trick|pg||
nt|fabsayc: off to romania, bye all|pg||
