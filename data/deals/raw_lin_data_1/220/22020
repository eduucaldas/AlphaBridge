nt|rv: what a hand to start off proceedings?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|rv: I presume top 2 from each group qualify for SFs|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed...|pg||
nt|xenya: that's right|pg||
nt|rv: thanks|pg||
nt|rv: GS on right @s guess or @h ruffing finesse|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  5NT?|pg||
nt|xenya: one of the freakiest hands i've seen in a long time|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Roland, gm|pg||
mb|3C|nt|Walddk2:  Ruffing finesse does not work on a trump lead against 7@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2:  You can't get to the @DA|pg||
mb|3N|nt|xenya: http://www.slavacup.com/tournament.htm|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: I presume Herbst didn't bid 5n since he felt there were GS prospects even if East didn't have both @SK and @SQ|pg||
mb|4C|nt|xenya: sadly the results link is still inactive |pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|7C|mb|p|nt|rv: West could set @cs, but can't find a very scientific route to GS other than Roland's 5n option|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2:  The recommended trump lead will likely defeat it|pg||
nt|rv: one option was for Herbst to bid 4@c on 2@s to set @cs (solid or semi-solid suit) as trumps|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|rv: on the actual auction, I presume Zack's 4n said no @c fit and no slam interest|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzvc: welcome back all|pg||

nt|fabsayc: hi all|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: interesting 1st hand 2nd set, hi Martin|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi Gary, i would be tempted to blast to slam with versace hand, but perhaps 2@S first does no harm|pg||
mb|3H|nt|kemperg: No, 5@H is -3 on a @D ruff|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont believe this bid|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: seems odd unless a transfer :)|pg||

nt|fabsayc: apparently 3@H is some kind of artificial bid, 2@H showing spades|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: now GSF maybe it was|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|nt|ahollan1: Open Room starts with board 13 so we won't see their results but they'll have ours for comparison|pg||

mb|7C|nt|twcho: And this is the last round of this event|pg||

nt|fabsayc: 7@C has some extra chances, including counting the hand|pg||

pc|hA|nt|penseur9:  yes, what won't I do for bridge :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi everyone|pg||

nt|bobholl: wd huub :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: the early @c discard made it easy to set up @c|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: but if Frank ducked the @cA it would be more difficult|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs upside-down count & attitude   EW odd/even discard|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the Open Room starts with Board 27  so we won't see comparisons -- but they will|pg||
nt|mcphee: might make via and end play|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am asked which way, well given lauria is declarer i will say right way for declarer|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the idea is no trump lead, but zia exposed the flaw of leading a trump versus 7 in his book|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: both pairs  upside-down count & attitude   EW odd/even discard|pg||
pc|s6|nt|penseur9:  declarer will probably decide to make it and run|pg||
pc|sK|nt|twcho: now possibly 12 tricks|pg||
nt|gsper:  Hi, all|pg||
nt|mcphee: i always hate these postions, you know the @D hook is losing:(|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|mb|d|nt|Walddk2:  Never lead a trump, he says|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|rv: West is possibly too strong for simple 1@s O/C though a few modern experts might just O/C|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2S|mb|d|mb|p|nt|rv: N-S make up to 3@d|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Jordan doing Voice Commentary|pg||
nt|ady: good afternoon all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: today is 2nd half of the final match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3 sets of 14 boards|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i wish i had 1% of lauria's instincts in these situations|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: NS system = Ultimate Canape [big club, canape openings]    EW  Dutch Doubleton|pg||
mb|1C|mb|d|nt|penseur9:  probably another 3nt NS here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15 HCP, 0+@D   if 2-suit LONGER @C/@S but not @H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if you dont lead a trump, is because you dont half the queen|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|twcho: possible 6@h for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|gsper:  NS can make a lot in @C but the vul will hold them back|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=7+ hcp, 4+@H, maybe longer @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=game force relay|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2S|nt|twcho: but not a good slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15 HCP, 0+@D  maybe longer @C/@D but not @H|pg||
nt|ady: no doublt west will emerge with a penalty double|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C-1@D=0-6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N = 12-14, some 4333|pg||
nt|mcphee: 3N = same result they had last time,,,,,,,,,,,,,maybe 2 down tho:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it is not much of a clue, but enough perhaps to change the odds|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|penseur9:  part score seems indicated here... possibly in @H by NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzvc: 1@h might be only 3 sometimes, that's probably the reason that Ton did not bid 2@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: more likely 6N|pg||
nt|penseur9:  this is not a forgone conclusion... lot's of work to do|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  seems that N is tempted to go for slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4N is regressive  [doesn't like either of responder's suits]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N range  20-21(22)|pg||
nt|penseur9:  hi Al, welcome back|pg||
nt|fabsayc: because you have the queen (i typed it wrong)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|penseur9:  some work to do here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H lead brutal   it gives declarer hope|pg||
nt|mcphee: N please no @S lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: are there options other than playing Ton for @DH10?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|penseur9:  good lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: and he showed 4@h already|pg||
nt|ahollan1: most of the Onstein2 lead came in 2nd set where they more than overcame the White House 20 imp carryover [from Round Robin match]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i vote for 5@C instead of 5@H    just in case NS bid 5@S, i'd like @C lead|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: i wonder if same bad breaks in the other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but they start with board 31  so we won't know until the end of the set|pg||
nt|penseur9:  it seems that both rooms started on board 17, so comparisons may be available soon|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: Was a minor mistake, they are playing 31 now|pg||
nt|gsper:  With the @S finesse marked, this should make, so the 5@C sac...|pg||
nt|gsper:  would have paid, or possibly even made|pg||
nt|gsper:  The voice commentators are discussing various lines. They have lost me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: terrible hand to lead from |pg||

nt|aramesh_:  Hello Hasan - Welcome|pg||
nt|famus: Tommy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: initial thinking   how do i combine chances in the majors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but that assumes 5@C tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: don't know why bertens played the @d10 here, Q looks better|pg||
nt|bobholl: in practice surely :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: if you play for Kx low is best of course, but against 98 the Q is the same as 10, but it gains with J9|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|penseur9:  I'm not sure I would have played @D here... most likely|pg||
nt|penseur9:  trump most likely*|pg||
nt|penseur9:  always difficult to second guess declarer on these part score contracts|pg||
nt|gsper:  Yes, I also thought it was that simple|pg||
pc|s7|nt|dkkello:  they used to play chess, but that whent to fast for them |pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: Sjoert saying 'Thank you' when he was allowed to win the trick|pg||

nt|gsper:  Welcome, Martin|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in fact he can claim now, and should :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but westra perhaps has to keep up his reputation for slow play|pg||
nt|gsper:  S may be considering a low @D return|pg||
nt|fabsayc: for what purpose|pg||
nt|gsper:  In case W has Qxx|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: similar problem in 6N - except that declarer probably won't suffer @S ruff|pg||
nt|penseur9:  looking like -1 here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's one wrong guess|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi al, spectators|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think i would have won first spade in hand to play clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: perhaps Verhees went wrong at trick 1?  yes, he picked up trump, but being in dummy left too few options |pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)  sorry marshall  i was typing   didn't see you got there first|pg||
nt|ahollan1: MARTIN|pg||

nt|Vugraphzvc: lol|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bobholl: only good plays (as usual) from huubke (bertens)|pg||
nt|bobholl: i guess that a misguess in @H makes no difference :)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: oops|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|nt|ady: ruff a spade     same|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room started with board 13, so we won't be seeing comparisons this set|pg||

nt|ahollan1: White House started the match with 20 imp carryover from the Round Robin|pg||
nt|ady: in fact O got vulnerability right    was 800|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Onstein 2 had big 2nd set to take this 20-something lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they are not handicapped by having to type|pg||
nt|ahollan1: progressive lenses don't improve matters |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Verhees does NOT have bid to describe weak 2@H opener   even if he wants one here|pg||

nt|ahollan1: westra might open multi 2@D|pg||
nt|ady: Verhees attempting  to get swings|pg||
nt|ady: North will be sorry if trying a raise|pg||
nt|ady: could be right if south was short in spades and had a 7 card suit|pg||
nt|mcphee: hi Dan|pg||
nt|andyv:  N certainly interested in investigating for slam|pg||

mb|2N!|nt|ahollan1: 1@S=10-15 HCP, 4+@S  if 2 suits then 2nd is LONGER|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@D=ART INV  a) 3/4@S  b) NT  c) 3@H/@S & 6@C/@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=5+@H   note: 5@S 5@H opens 1@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: eventually it will come up so a pre-alert   NS opening 2@C/@D/@H are all multi-purpose  either weak in next higher suit  [think transfer preempt]  or various strong hands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but 3@D avoids all alerts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is west worth another bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which slam try now from Verhees?|pg||
nt|mcphee: intersting hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  W probably can't make 3@h|pg||
nt|fabsayc: undo|pg||
nt|andyv:  we can see that 7N or 7@h makes...reasonable to get to 6 but finding out about the 4th @c is difficult|pg||
mb|4N|nt|bobholl: reach 4@S (3nt down on @C lead)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW system is called Ultimate Canape|pg||
mb|5S|nt|ahollan1: i'm surprised by action from EACH player|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ok 3@H could be a form of micheals, spades and a minor|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok, EW are out of the picture|pg||
mb|p!|nt|twcho: yes, running score available at http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/RoundResult.aspx?section=c9efb17f-ccb2-4cff-b5bf-3463f7676fc6&round=11&tourid=704|pg||
nt|twcho: but in Chinese characters|pg||
nt|ahollan1: must be worth at least one try   @D under control, stiff @C  @SA|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: "must" was an overbid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on the downside, king and jack of diamonds may be worthless|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looking for justification - maybe Verhees worried about @H losers when vP holds less then 4@H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Jokes all around about the quality of Ton's preempts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they always seem to have 13 cards|pg||
nt|andyv:  UNDO PLEASE!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no andy i think this is correct|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok...so W bid 3@h|pg||
nt|fabsayc: versace taking advantage of vulnerability|pg||
nt|andyv:  sorry everyone....my senior moment!|pg||
mb|5N!|nt|twcho: EW is now sitting at 3rd position before this round starts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 7 small is similar to Kxxxxx so often bid the same way|pg||
nt|gsper:  Me too, but some people would not dream of it|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Site: http://www.bridge.nl/uitslagen |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=3-fit Drury  [2@D=4-fit]|pg||
mb|p|nt|famus: a big B UT!!!:)|pg||
nt|twcho: NS lying 8th|pg||
nt|twcho: so EW still has chance to clinch the title|pg||
nt|penseur9:  good lad should still make easely|pg||
nt|gsper:  Especially Law devotees|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS system is Dutch Doubleton|pg||
nt|mcphee: so 2@D was some game try or just annouced opening values?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=RELAY  but i don't follow-ups|pg||
nt|mcphee: just see if I ask you any more questions :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you'll have to yell them   i'm having trouble staying awake :(|pg||
nt|mcphee: OK|pg||
mb|6C|nt|twcho: seems quite a no. of options available for declarer here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: West could try 3N at these colors|pg||
nt|fabsayc: pass is 0-3 we think|pg||
nt|andyv:  this can go down 6 |pg||
mb|6S|nt|penseur9:  *lead|pg||
nt|penseur9:  nothing much the defense can do to defeat this contract here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs  upside-down count & attitude|pg||
nt|penseur9:  good bidding from EW here|pg||
nt|dkkello:  yes |pg||
nt|ahollan1: vP might have raised|pg||
nt|mcphee: E hand getting worse|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not sure if 5nt is queen ask, looks that way|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in any case we are into a sequence i have never ever seen before|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2nt was some form of super accept of transfer, probably max with three trumps|pg||
mb|7N|nt|ady: 4-1 trump split    but should arrive at 10 tricks  losing 2 hearts and a club|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  1  Bakkeren brothers get to 5@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: but @d is the most promising|pg||
nt|twcho: @c can wait and @s suit is not robust enough|pg||
nt|famus: he exercised one of em--next ought to be a small @s to Q to wind up |pg||
nt|penseur9:  this COULD make but difficult to figure out double dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: @HJ from QJxx(x) or JT(x)     @HQ from QJ(x)|pg||
nt|penseur9:  probably will go down now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this could be a form of Slawinsky honor leads,   which i never remember|pg||
nt|penseur9:  remember though that they are much better then I am :)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  should make in 12-15 min or so .. |pg||
nt|penseur9:  on board  1, OR in 4@S -1 for 5 IMPs Onstein1|pg||
nt|bobholl: would play @CK now|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1:  15  3N in South|pg||
nt|psyck: opening 2@h would also have got them to the same spot|pg||
nt|psyck: other room gets there via a multi opening|pg||
nt|psyck: multi enabled it to be played by E, not that it matters here|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: ah perhaps now some realistic bidding|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mcphee: west doesn't care|pg||
nt|djneill:  East could have had @hK, @dA, @cK, opposite singleton @s, that would have been nice|pg||
nt|mcphee: very nice|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard to sac in 7 spades now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: kudos to pachtman for negotiating this auction|pg||
mc|13|nt|fabsayc: jansma looking for a line to make this hand, needs a miracle for that|pg||

nt|Vugraphzvc: Loek talking about asking for a director|pg||

nt|ahollan1: DBL can be strong NT   [1N overcalls are artificial]|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: for the slow 3@h|pg||
nt|andyv:  for all those who want 8@s, it would only go down 2000|pg||
mb|1C|nt|twcho: slam time|pg||
nt|penseur9:  NS may have missed a @H trick in previous hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15 hcp, 0+@D often weak NT    maybe @D and LONGER @C/@S [canape] but not longer @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think that skews advancer's ability to bid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is 1000 an undertrick if you bid at 8 level|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 18+ bal|pg||
nt|penseur9:  we should see some scoring soon since the OR started on boards 14 to 16|pg||
nt|bobholl: authorities (especially school people) didn't like the way it went :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi Shirley|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Hola Shirley|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=10-15 HCP, 4+@H  could be 5@H 5@S or 2nd suit LONGER|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N @H raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15 hcp, 0+@D  often weak NT   maybe 4@D and LONGER @S/@C [canape] but not longer @H|pg||
nt|djneill:  there is one bid that shifts the blame back to doubler, I think North will find it|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=a) 6+@C 1-suit    b) 4+@C and LONGER @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: and hello to Bas! |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@C shortness   still don't know if 1-suit @H or  longer @S/@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't think they can find @S now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S usually less than game force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D = 5+@H  invitational or stronger|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzvc: 1@D was 3+@D|pg||
nt|penseur9:  rare 1@D contract, S could hardly bid 1@H with that hand|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: incredibly Lauria-Versace goad the opps into another 13 imps|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|twcho: so we can conclude that both pairs are playing precision, probably the most popular system in China|pg||
nt|penseur9:  hi AL welcome back|pg||
nt|sybarra: easy 4 @H's probably +1  |pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Van Prooijen always has a short suit, Verhees explained|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very practical rebid from Verhees|pg||
nt|djneill:  that's a nice bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: is it best for Wortel to bid now with the lousy 6@S or later?  and show both majors or ...|pg||
nt|penseur9:  does not look like any contract can ake either side|pg||
nt|penseur9:  *can make...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S looks good |pg||
nt|penseur9:  yes @S contract looks best here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no entry to West hand for @H ruff|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ahollan1: 2@D does not promise any points   because may prefer @S over @C|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3@H from bertens now i guess|pg||
nt|dkkello:  well she didnt went owerboard  |pg||
nt|kemperg: 1@S a nice 3rd hand opening|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N shows any 8+ hcp|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: 3@h should say solid suit|pg||
nt|twcho: and invite cuebid|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: good save|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well  Kit Woolsey defines a good save as one that makes, but this is better than letting NS play 4@S|pg||
nt|gsper:  I wonder if W liked that opening or if he was forced by system|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we lost the clubs in the 60's, diamonds in the 70's, balanced nt bids in the 10's|pg||
nt|fabsayc: trump lead?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  15  [3NE+2]   Bertens in 5@D after Paulissen got to make lead directing DBL of @C |pg||
nt|fabsayc: israel can do no wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: 4@c probably deny @s control|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the running total includes 10 IMPs for Het Witte Huis  [White House] for winning the round robin|pg||
nt|penseur9:  didn't somebody say that the five level belongs to the oponents|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL would have shown cards rather than typical negative double|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  *opponents|pg||
nt|kemperg: no retransfer from Jan|pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is because he wants to stop the auction in 4 @H |pg||
nt|kemperg: retransfer has not to mean slam interest|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not a great hand for the system|pg||
nt|ady: 2 diamonds and 2 trump tricks to be lost for sure    might scrape home|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL = takeout|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzvc: meanwhile onstein 2 won 5 imps on bd 17, letting them play 4@h undoubled|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: dbl by Drijver was GF|pg||
nt|gsper:  Not many losers, but a bit short on winners|pg||
nt|gsper:  He can ruff a @D high, but he does not know that|pg||
nt|gsper:  Could try something mundane like the @D finesse|pg||
nt|kemperg: I think 3@D had been the retransfer|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4@D splinter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ruffing finesse in @D works -- but will it be taken?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: immediate 2-level suit bids would be natural 0-7|pg||
nt|psyck: mildly aggresive 3n, some would rebid 2n, but vul...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Gary Hanna|pg||
nt|psyck: lead will give 9th after @c fin|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Krishna, Roland and everyone|pg||
nt|psyck: Hi Gary|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: A pleasure to see my fravourite partnership in action|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: Ed Manfield in a BOLS Bridge Tip back in the 1980s|pg||
nt|andyv:  true...very evident the first set|pg||
pc|d5|nt|famus: actually observing the Bermuda Bowl etc recently--the most favoured system appeared to be a combination of 2/1 with precision @c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW flip-flop PASS/DBL     i think Eric Rodwell gets credit for that inversion|pg||
nt|bobholl: difficult to stop in 4@C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: depends if they take their trump winners|pg||
nt|ady: very likely to go down|pg||
nt|kemperg: @H 41 is rather unlucky|pg||
pc|dT|nt|penseur9:  already 4 IMPs for EW on board  1... only down one in OR|pg||
nt|mcphee: they only use that over 1@S dble or other suits also?|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d6|nt|twcho: the winner - Netherlands having three pairs playing 3 different systems IIRC|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|famus: run of the mill board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: honestly   i don't know why a 1@D bidder opposite a hand that was willing to play a partscore would be in a forcing situation|pg||
nt|bobholl: berry wondering were the @S are on the bidding off course with huub|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi gm ga all|pg||
nt|bobholl: hi jaap :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi bob:)|pg||
nt|gsper:  Finis|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2nd @S from hand rather than @H to dummy then @S  since very possible for North to duck with @SA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then could lose @SA AND defense gets to play 2 round of trump and another potential @S loser|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jaapfr: even DD i see no way of making this|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2 @H ruffs and @D 33 looks as best (and only) chance|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: Carl -- DBL isn't always traditional takeout shape since 1N overcalls are artificial|pg||
nt|djneill:  good stop, 25 HCP, no game|pg||
nt|psyck: sooner or later E will give dec the 9th trick|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: lauria can develop two spade tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  the Italians had two poor results opening 11 hcp hands with A, AK in first set|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: wow   18  the doomed slams    Paulissen-Jansma stop in 3N!!|pg||
nt|jaapfr: exchange @D 6 with 8 and it can be mad|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ady: settling for down 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course seeing all 4 hands -- we know better :)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|kemperg: kib thinks he wanted opener on lead, wich is right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: opener will hold 4@H only if   a) weak NT  b) 4@H(441)  c) 4405    so i'm a bit surprised at choice of 3@D|pg||
nt|mcphee: i would want to be in 4@H though|pg||

nt|ahollan1: that pretty much covers it all, doesn't it|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|rv: 3@s is splinter, I am not sure of splinter range played by E-W, it is good to play splinter in narrow range since it takes away too much bidding space|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: 1@S=4+  NEVER the longest in a 2-suiter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3rd 2@C opener this set -- rare|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: they are also surprised :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2@C for @H now ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: they don't play that|pg||
nt|kemperg: weak 2 in @D or strong|pg||

nt|kemperg: how good is your weak?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S=5@S 5@H 1@D  8-11 or 15+ hcp|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how's THAT for a specific bid??|pg||
nt|fabsayc: vunderbar|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H = 4-fit, 3-8 HCP|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: unusual light opening from Lauria|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a total misfitting hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  another 11hcp wonder|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I would not call it a good slam|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bobholl: but is a good convention :)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|twcho: so declarer has to guess the @c for an overtrick|pg||
nt|famus: again dicey 3NT on @d lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@S 5@H opens 1@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: and top 4 qualifies for semi-finals which are played now|pg||
nt|penseur9:  3@H transfer to @S|pg||
nt|dkkello:  good presure bidding from E-V |pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: i think 2@h is NF by the Bakkerens|pg||
nt|kemperg: 10pts, but still not very good:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: Jansma really wants to bid |pg||
nt|sybarra: not often you have an 8 card suit |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@C sets @H|pg||
nt|ady: games both sides fail here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=4+ but can be balanced|pg||
nt|mcphee: what is e/w nt range?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 15-17 for both|pg||
mb|3S|nt|andyv:  the 11 hcp is not so bothersome as the quality of the hand itself|pg||
mb|d!|nt|ahollan1: 3@S maximum in context of non 1@C opener|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@H  minimum|pg||
nt|fabsayc: super duper dutch reverse flannery |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@CX on  1  was down 3  so only 2 imp swing|pg||

mb|p|nt|penseur9:  slam may be here EW again but hard to get there... again|pg||
mb|3N|nt|penseur9:  3nt going down on a @D lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at this point  5+@S  4+@C|pg||
nt|kemperg: the dealing machine in Utrecht has no problems with 8  or 9 suits:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=4+|pg||

nt|ahollan1: now RKC|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will stop in 6@S knowing @SQ missing|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: good news   @DK protected     bad news -- they get 5(+) before you get 9|pg||
nt|psyck: at least has some intermediate spots in the 11hcp & not a 4333 this time :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6@D about 25%, or 100% after the fact|pg||
mb|4C|nt|penseur9:  very tough decision for W here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H lead beats more than @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N could be lebensohl or scramble here   both make sense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlike Precision 2@C   here 2@D says nothing about points|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: NS just discussed, not sure what they agreed after all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry 6@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S is RKC in @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@D=2 keycards no Q|pg||
nt|psyck: other room had a misunderstanding on deal 4 for the 1st suing|pg||
nt|psyck: *big swing|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes 14 imps|pg||
nt|psyck: it could be a 'sohl misunderstanding...make sure you & pd are on same page.  Personally i prefer Rumpelsohl: http://gerbenbridge.blogspot.in/2005/12/your-sohl-or-mine.html|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2 unsupprted K's and a J to bolster the A in the "long" suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  they may get there|pg||
mb|p|nt|famus: E needs to retain @d suit control by not rising up with @dA--i think thats the crux of this hand|pg||
nt|dkkello:  for new bridgeplayers , notice how much the bid on very few points |pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh my     2 [5@HW=]   4@HX|pg||
mb|4D|nt|jcwla:  Welcome to my world.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in my world they are 4-1 FITS|pg||
nt|ady: should not be a problem    has 2 clubs tricks 1 diamond and 1 heart     can surely manage 4 trump tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other table seems to be entering 2nd 10 minutes of board  2|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 10 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|famus: @dQ and small|pg||
nt|twcho: good defense|pg||
nt|twcho: else, declarer may make|pg||
nt|ady: can ruff diamonds high  and Q98 of spades come in to play|pg||
mb|4H|nt|bobholl: drijver will have a difficult card when in with k@D|pg||
nt|penseur9:  only two @S and a @C loosers|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: Frank confirms 2@h was NF|pg||
nt|dkkello:  protected by "the law" even vulnerable |pg||
nt|bobholl: tya htg |pg||
nt|dkkello:  se you Bob |pg||
nt|penseur9:  tks Bob|pg||
nt|ady: good lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  2 just finished  4@S=|pg||
nt|ady: just 4 side suit tricks   so need 6 trump tricks|pg||
nt|psyck: with 55 & all the values in the 2 suits, it is a routine opening,...|pg||
nt|psyck: but as you say, with the misfit here, not many tricks...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: after 4 cue bids|pg||
nt|andyv:  17 and this board will be a chance for them to make up some of the imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  now it's E with tough decision :)|pg||
nt|penseur9:  I expect 5@C-p-p-p|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that won't make Verhees any happier|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other forms of scoring  Schollaard very close to converting DBL to penalty|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i missed the question Andy -- ask again|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  2  2@S made so 5 imps back to the leaders|pg||
mb|4S|nt|gsper:  1@C strong or weak bal, I hear|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Paulissen didn't preempt with north hand on  3  [where 3370]|pg||
nt|psyck: opening light had to payoff sometime, they just kept trying :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  and 17 turned out to be 1 imp for Israel|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  it's their style and hard to argue with their track record|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I've always seen them to play sound openings at the 1 level|pg||
mb|5C|nt|ahollan1: correct spelling  of south   Schollaardt    but bbo field can't fit in last letter|pg||
nt|jaapfr: presumably he will return @S|pg||
nt|bobholl: only @S is rigth|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: can cash 1@c first|pg||
nt|jaapfr: still only 8 tricks: 2@S4@H1@Dand 1@C\|pg||
nt|jaapfr: with @DATx in W|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry 3 @D and 2@C to loose|pg||
nt|bobholl: but ew have to wait with cashing their 2 @C :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i think E can not deduct all permutations here at this moment so each card now has a risk to play|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: can cash 1@c, then @s switch sets up @ss before @ds|pg||
nt|bobholl: if they cash 1@C it migth make anyway :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: yyy but how he must know that or tell him:)?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: cashing a @c looks a normal option. Drijver doesn't know Bertens has 5|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but the @S switch now or thereafter is vital|pg||
nt|bobholl: 60% bet on making |pg||
nt|fabsayc: ok at least 5 cue bids|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: not necessary|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E about to be squeezed if W exits with heart jack i think after clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: and a bid unfortunate here |pg||
nt|ahollan1: more from  17   Paulissen DBL 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that won't help the trailing team|pg||
nt|ady: may get home as it is going     just lose 3 club tricks|pg||
mb|5D|nt|vugraphzvc: west telling east that he thinks East has a minimum for 3@C|pg||
nt|ady: still will be ok|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so White House closes gap to 11|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: they don't usually open with weak values|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: east known to have [at least] 9 black cards    how likely is @H finesse to work??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6 imps on  2 after 4@HX made with 1 non-vul overtrick|pg||
nt|ady: club leads I suppose look obvious   but it seems to have given the contract|pg||
nt|ady: trumps now 2-2    so Q@C can be ruffed out|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: As suggested by kibitzer, 4@h is cold for NS|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|gsper:  or unbal, @Cs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: busy defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now ruffing @S finesse for overtrick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does Jansma open 1N or 1@D  [their system derived from Polish Club]|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: best news -- 4@S not making either|pg||
nt|psyck: other room got to 6@d|pg||

nt|fabsayc: they may play automatic cues below game|pg||
nt|andyv:  or 4@h merely xfers back to @s|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: true andy|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzvc: West happy East didn't get doubled in 2@S|pg||
nt|djneill:  bold 1@s vulnerable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15, 0+@D  1@S usually less than game force|pg||
nt|mcphee: kinda forced if 1@D can be 0 cards|pg||
nt|andyv:  if it's a cue, then it should not be alerted|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you guys may be right, but in that case 4@S would be a subsitute cue bid of hearts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in true alice in wonderland style|pg||
nt|andyv:  anyway, S is thinking and judging from how long it took N to bid, I have to think 4@h was a cue|pg||
mb|4N|nt|dkkello:  game force , but wich one ? |pg||
nt|gsper:  We will never know|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i would be terrified to double with west hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i made comment about Verhees NOT holding 4@H because they play Raptor NT overcalls, so  (1@S)-1N would show 4@H & 5+@C/@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW play Raptor NT overcalls   so 1N here would show 4@H and 5+@C/@D|pg||
mb|5D|nt|ahollan1: this could be a  Slawinski spot card lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i need a cheat sheet to even try to explain|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, but there is sonme slight consolation in that you are not doubling them into game|pg||
nt|gsper:  You are not alone|pg||
nt|marlowepi: still there could be overtricks, or a XX with nowhere to go.|pg||
nt|mcphee: this will be a cold bath I afraid|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: ok makes sense|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i've had some good results playing raptor -- but always felt uncomfortable having to use DBL to include a normal strong NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems strange to win @CA and THEN think -- when i've done that it usually means i shouldn't have won the trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  3  4@H made for a push|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well 1@D is opened with  4@D & 5+@S   so weak hand with preference for @S bids  but if you reverse @S & @H maybe not|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  18  [3@CS=]   Paulissen playing 3@S East|pg||
mb|5S|nt|vugraphzvc: it's on their CC http://www.bridge.nl/groepen/Wedstrijdzaken/1112/Lombard_Schollaardt&Wortel.pdf|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 180 on the way?|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  4  Ton Bakkeren stops in 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 of the pairs on the winning Bermuda Bowl team play that  and a couple of pairs from Germany|pg||
nt|mcphee: whihc may make|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: ah   hi=odd without honor  or   even with honor|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3@D was likely to be down 1|pg||
mb|6S|nt|sybarra: wonder if Jansma had a 2-suited bid to make |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i suppose this 2N was game force so ok to include 4-fit|pg||
nt|ady: this should be quick|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  no problems for declarer now  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: so just a question of how many imps closer White House will be|pg||
nt|ahollan1: middle of hand  both pairs lead 2nd/4th|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: it was highlighted so couldn't find it on my own :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: where Verhees 6@H-1|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so 1@c-1@H-6@S in effect|pg||
nt|andyv:  so a sane slam which was not reached in OR|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kiwibridge: big 3-suiters are hard to handle, as are weak ones, but another big plus here |pg||
mc|13|nt|penseur9:  now the question is only how many overtricks|pg||
nt|jaapfr: will be a struggle to make this 2@H|pg||
nt|dkkello:  and 3 @H makes 8 or 9 now |pg||
nt|ady: now there will be a claim|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||

nt|xenya: yes, 7@C might be a bit too hard to bid with any degree of confidence, but 6@S/@C is excellent and should be reached   |pg||

nt|vugraphzvc: they have 54 min left fot 9 boards now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: 51 minutes remaining on the clock|pg||
nt|kemperg: so 3 level for this combination, not advised with these bad suits|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C opening would make things interesting|pg||
nt|mcphee: i guess e/w have 9 tricks in 3N thqt hand|pg||
nt|mcphee: maybe not, close tho|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: NS have played well last set and this|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: and she did pass. :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@H looks the likely contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=0+@D  but never fewer|pg||
nt|sybarra: Paulissen would have prefered a @S ruff no doubt  that might break up he end play |pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  big swing on board 5... slaam bid and made in OR|pg||
nt|penseur9:  for 11 IMPs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: most common hand type is weak NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: for EW CC http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Netherlands/vanprooijen-verhees.pdf|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can have 4+@D and longer @S or @C, but never longer @H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well defended|pg||
nt|andyv:  bidding:  7 minutes.... play of hand:   7 seconds....|pg||
mb|1N|nt|penseur9:  are we looking at another 3NT by EW again?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: are you 1% serious?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C = majors   if he chooses to bid|pg||
nt|ady: e/w may get to 4@S     bad split may make it awkward|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=@H & @S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: easy game = Pacht - tastic|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: Many ask what is rule of 15|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4N  long @D and tolerance for @C???  |pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: West said this 1 is undiscussed, but it looks liks long @D with 2(3)@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sounds right -- ace ask makes no sense    real @C length would bid 5@C|pg||
nt|ady: should come to 9 tricks   heart lead likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Wortel preventing EW from having misunderstanding    4@H and 1@D makes bid look right, equal vul and @CQ  not so much|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course still a chance for EW to go wrong   [bid rather than DBL]|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: is this really Versace opening 1@C on that or is this a bad dream?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|twcho: it is a guideline for the 4th seat player whether to open the hand|pg||
nt|twcho: HCP + no. of @s cards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D usually says  equal length\|pg||
nt|sybarra: smolen |pg||
nt|ahollan1: totally serious that it would make it interesting    0% serious that it was a bid that would be considered|pg||
nt|ahollan1: try 2@D?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the results link does not work, we will have to wait till official results posted, i believe|pg||
pc|s6|nt|penseur9:  3nt made in OR on  19 for Lombard team|pg||
nt|jaapfr: simple 9 tricks despite bad @HKJT|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: 9 lead denies 10 and shows a honor|pg||
nt|ahollan1: pull because of vulnerability|pg||
nt|psyck: lol, 4333, i don't mind a pass even with AAK|pg||
nt|andyv:  after several exciting hands, we finally get a mundane 1NT|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sybarra: you can see explanation |pg||
nt|sybarra: Bertens never gets a decent trump break?? |pg||
nt|sybarra: jansma coming in now? |pg||
nt|kemperg: yes 4@S, 5+@H, gamef or stronger|pg||
nt|sybarra: at least only 4/1 this time  |pg||
nt|sybarra: does he have the entries for that Cornelia?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I do not think so |pg||
nt|kemperg: 4@H is minimum, so W wont try slam|pg||
nt|sybarra: Cornelia suggesting that if Bertens plays the Ace of @H, he could finess the 10 |pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if 2N just forcing or specifically showing ????|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's my guess and i'm sticking to it|pg||
nt|psyck: i also prefer the style where 1@s rebid shows 4+ @c|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|twcho: because @s is so vital in partial contract competition|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: with 3-2 we bid 2@D in Netherlands too|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now --  is east hand really a prototypical 3@C bid??    only the shadow knows|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hmm, 2nt as a forcing bid is interesting|pg||
nt|fabsayc: will win in hand and lead club king|pg||
pc|cK|nt|twcho: if this sums up to >= 15, one can open|pg||
nt|twcho: if not, better pass|pg||
nt|penseur9:  that is 12 IMPs for...|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: to find 5-2 fit instead of 4-3 :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bos ducked 2 rounds of @H and flew @CA  |pg||
nt|dkkello:  gtg , be back a little later , very good bridge we see today , |pg||
nt|penseur9:  thanks see you later|pg||
nt|ady: e/w  after a penalty|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can't blame them|pg||
nt|ady: trump lead best |pg||
pc|c9|nt|roswolf: hmm got there despite the systen!?:)|pg||
nt|penseur9:  if we remember that EW had a 10 IMp carry over, de Lombard team doing good here|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  19 [3@C-2]  Jansma playing 2@H West|pg||
nt|ady: east will be wary of a bad trump split on the bidding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but what can he do about it?|pg||
nt|mcphee: seems you can pick up trumps |pg||
nt|ady: impossible on the bidding for south to start with ace and another diamond|pg||
nt|mcphee: not sure that is worth it|pg||
nt|djneill:  what are the easy cases for East to imagine, if any|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might try @C9 to dummy then trump|pg||
nt|ady: I would back declarer to make this|pg||
nt|mcphee: i think so also David|pg||
nt|ahollan1: preemptor not leading @C/@D often suggests no singleton there -- so short trump|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but with solid suit   lead from sequence overrides that inference|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: declarer is asking what the signal of Norths hearts means, normally Lavinthal according to Van Prooijen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we have unfair advantage -- don't have to devise line of play assuming @C 4-2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: silly question -- what if it is singleton|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not impossible on the auction|pg||
pc|c2|nt|penseur9:  seems that 2@S should go down here|pg||
nt|gsper:  N will agree with me that S did not have his double|pg||
nt|kemperg: he does with 15 to 15/14|pg||
nt|sybarra: too high now on a @D lead |pg||
nt|ady: 2NT   looks like being down    2 hearts better spot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if vanProoijen had rebid 2@H that would have been 5@H invite!|pg||
nt|ady: might make 2NT  if the clubs get entangles|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder why that wasn't his choice|pg||
nt|fabsayc: north should duck|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Jansma already apologised|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Frank may be thinking about correcting to 3N|pg||
nt|ady: at least down 3 |pg||
pc|s2|nt|twcho: this will make thanks to 33 @d|pg||
nt|twcho: east has to determine whether her partner leads a singleton or from 765|pg||
nt|penseur9:  oops|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought that was a Kokish-ism   after opener shows 6-card major, 2N forcing|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: the reference to Lavinthal is   with singleton in dummy, 3rd hand card shows suit preference|pg||
pc|s8|nt|vugraphzvc: Muller - de Wijs missed 4@s on bd 5, so now 14 imps difference|pg||
nt|gsper:  That lead makes it easier, of course|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe not but i dont think north had any extras after his 2@D bid|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|ady: I think maybe just 4 trump tricks|pg||
pc|c4|nt|vugraphzvc: from 109 combinations they lead the 10 and with 9xxx 2nd highest, so 9 promises a honor|pg||
nt|jaapfr: my simple statement was too soon (is more to the hand than i thought initially)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Frank didn't realise 2NT was artificial he said|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: similar problems with score last week at the NEC Cup, they need to get Australia involved their scoring package is 2nd to none|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1:  20  Jansma did open 1N on the 4252 hand  Bertens playing 2@HX North|pg||
nt|mcphee: a frisky dble of 2@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in balancing hand  DBL from NT opener = max with doubleton in their suit   looks like perfect fit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after 5 comparisons  session score  2-0|pg||
nt|ady: if he ruffs 3rd heart now with 9@S   north does best to discard|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with south out of trump  might just play @C|pg||
nt|ady: from here much easier|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  for some reason i thought 2 rounds of trump played   actually it was @H ruff in dummy|pg||
nt|mcphee: E mostly concerned about 4/2@C I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@HX made   11 imps to the leaders|pg||
nt|psyck: i pass lots of bad quacky 4333 12 counts too|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
nt|ady: well if 2 hearts would have been an invite    why not   instead of 2NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: his actual sequence was still invite but showing one or both 4-card major|pg||
nt|ady: ducking the club  stopped any defensive problems with the suit|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: good cash|pg||
nt|ahollan1: easy avoidance play to guarantee the contract|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: avoidance play -- finesse into East to protect the @CJ|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s9|pg||
nt|sybarra: seems everything wrong sided here |pg||
nt|sybarra: but no way to know |pg||
nt|fabsayc: now he cant afford to duck|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmm  i think he needed to insert @H10|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: now what   @S or high @C?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the line in vegas       vanProoijen was bidding 5@D|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: duck and take 10 or fly ace to take 10   tough choice|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kemperg: only doubledummy will work:(|pg||
mc|6|nt|fabsayc: still if clubs were 2-2 was not hopeless|pg||

nt|roswolf: west asleep!?|pg||
nt|penseur9:  we're seing very agressive bidding here|pg||
nt|penseur9:  good stop here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you mean to pass 2@S?|pg||
nt|ady: 5@D a good contract to reach    a nice fight back|pg||
nt|ady: might make on a cross ruff    will need to ruff 3rd club with 8@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  6 [4@SN=]   Paulissen in 4@HX   that should be another pickup for trailing team|pg||
pc|d5|nt|twcho: forcing his partner to bid 2@d|pg||
nt|twcho: and then 2@h is an invitaional bid showing at least 54 M|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: NS are still juniors, what do you expect :)|pg||
nt|ady: spade lead best to try and remove entry to 4th club   but 8@H is an entry|pg||
nt|psyck: *4333|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: wonder why Zar never caught on lol, too complicated, KnR?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|roswolf: indeed with age comes caution because only juniors and madmen know no fear:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: helps to play some form of Bart or Gazilli|pg||
nt|psyck: is is very easy to calculate zar at the table|pg||
nt|psyck: but is is just another tool, has its pros & cons|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice @D10 in East hand    for 4@H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: for most of us 2@D would promise a rebid|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'm told 2@D=both majors, X would be only one (rather strange)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: 3 swings this set   all double digit|pg||
nt|penseur9:  we have big swingers :0|pg||
nt|ahollan1: expect @H10 to show @D preference?|pg||
nt|penseur9:  :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: if you see ew only and know N opened you want to be in 6@D|pg||
nt|mcphee: i think this is even worse than 3@H:)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|twcho: of course, north decline his partner's hearty invitation. :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think the tone of the set proves that @D won't run|pg||
nt|gsper:  Instructions for voice commentary: http://webutil.bridgebase.com/v2/news_fetch.php?id=743|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|penseur9:  with the 4@H preempt, declairer knows that trumps are mostly in East|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H2?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H @H makes for interesting hand too|pg||
nt|kemperg: both majors spec tells|pg||
nt|ady: might try for trumps 3-2  which is 8 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and helps show why van Prooijen didn't open a non-systemic 'state of match' 2@S |pg||
nt|ahollan1: isn't @C ruff with @S8   8 tricks?|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|s2|nt|penseur9:  :)|pg||
nt|penseur9:  untill N finds the @s king he may think they missed slam|pg||
nt|ady: well we can see J9 spades with east|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ady: what is right    2@H  a little conservative|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: right  north just guessing|pg||
nt|mcphee: however exact methods are not known to us|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D also down 3  so Verhees bidding 1@S with junk  equates to push|pg||
nt|mcphee: 3@H for me shows a trick taking suit, one where you do not have to give up the elad 3 times:)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|twcho: this is not a nice dummy for declarer|pg||
nt|penseur9:  very hard to guess how declarer will handle this hand here|pg||
nt|roswolf: well he is going off -probably a few|pg||
nt|penseur9:  @D ruff ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes K and anor seems best|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer is fortunate that the @HJ falls|pg||
pc|s6|nt|penseur9:  now wat a relief it is :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: and she knows, as Jans girlfriend:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  wife - just married!|pg||
nt|psyck: for kibs who ask, Zar Count=Number of high card points + length of two longest suits + number of controls (A=2, K=1) + (length of longest suit minus length of shortest suit)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: there are good 11 counts and there are flat poop with 2XAces and 1 King, it doesnt need Zar to work out if one is worth opening|pg||
nt|psyck: some use just the 1st 2 factors as a rule of 20|pg||
nt|psyck: Zar requires 26+ to open|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I just use common sense|pg||
nt|psyck: there are also some corrections like adding 1 zar for 4+ @s suit|pg||
nt|psyck: you can download a 4 in 1 opening bid evaluator here: http://tedmuller.us/Bridge/Software.htm|pg||
nt|psyck: the help section in that software will explain the reasonings behing each of the evaluatiors|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: or you can use your eyes :)|pg||
nt|psyck: but you always have to fall back on your experience & judgement, e.g. zar may not factor in values in short suits instead of long ones...|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how close is 4@H for NS?|pg||
nt|sybarra: congrats to them@H@H |pg||
nt|ady: heaty seems best|pg||
pc|s7|nt|penseur9:  @C now ???|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 22  final contract 4@HX|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ady: now ruff and trump|pg||
nt|ady: dont think it is right to re-bid 3NT to show 6 hearts and 3 spades  with that strength|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: @HA  then @HK shows @D|pg||
nt|ady: nice position though if south has 1 big diamond  queen or jack to give a guess what the play is from?|pg||
nt|mcphee: rather than be pushy with a poor suit if you make the 2@H rebid you are well placed if partner bids again|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|penseur9:  4@Sx makes for headaches for declarer and commentators alike :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|psyck: normal to go down here, only the previledged in the gallary like us can read the cards :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mcphee: if they pass 2@H most days you will be a happy camper|pg||

nt|penseur9:  yes|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: on 23  Jansma opened 2@D [multi] where Schollaard opened 1@S  [and Wortel down in 4@H]     Bos playing 3N East|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: those little baby @H spots in dummy |pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|twcho: south is restraining enough to bid only 2@h but the dummy is really disappointing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: told you @D10 in dummy was nice :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bobholl: if you guess @D yes|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|kiwibridge: yes, normal to go down in a poor contract, one that should never be reached|pg||

nt|gsper:  You can not have missed anything very interesting|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=10-15 HCP, 4+@S  if 2-suit then 2nd suit is LONGER|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S rebid without those toys is wide range|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final board of the set|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think is more a matter of weak two bids are weaker in Europe than NA, so south can be quite light for 1 and 2 spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's nice score for NS|pg||
nt|mcphee: that will lose a few imps I think|pg||

nt|ahollan1: does south reopen with DBL?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sunday afternnon so we are all so peacefull:)|pg||

mb|5H|nt|ahollan1: well   vP also had to decide to treat the hand as opener rather than preempt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh right   east gets to bid|pg||
mb|d|nt|penseur9:  5@D seems to make EW but can it be bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't know about 4@H :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: possible  slam try in @C???|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would be kool if 4@H is RKC|pg||
nt|ady: 6 diamonds a good save  800 if 6 clubs is bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does anyone know if screens in use?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 03:10 where i'm trying to stay awake|pg||
nt|ahollan1: short suit game try???|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzvc: West before he sees dummy: down 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzvc: Yup screens|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i assume so    seems operator is waiting to display bids until after both screenmates bid|pg||
nt|kemperg: dbl might give the save|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@D not a RKC response    looks like cue showing 1st/2nd round control|pg||
nt|ady: as pointed out 6NT can make by east    so n/s would need to go to the 7 level for 1100  for a save|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: the nebulous 1@d deprive NS from competing|pg||
pc|sK|nt|roswolf: well this could be manna to n/s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it might be hard to believe, but 1st 3 boards of the set actually were contracts that MADE|pg||
nt|penseur9:  quite unusual wasn't it? :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might be blasphemy,    is west hand automatic 2@S bid opposite passed hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: they do not always alert all bids that need to be alerted|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no problem for me, i am on Marshall Islands time|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Verhees did NOT have weak 2@H bid available|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but he could have responded 2@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for EW  2@S is the only weak 2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C/@D/@H are all intermediate hands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S = 8-11  3-places to play   so 5431/4441, some 5440|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: if 5431 then yes   but here with wasted round jacks, i'm not so sure|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @CA lead destrys all hope of N here|pg||
nt|dkkello:  it is on the lead  and some more |pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|pg||
nt|twcho: 5@d is a cheap sacrifice|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S rebid is invitational|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i know i'd bid at the table, but not sure it is right|pg||
nt|ady: would you believe that     why save|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tough to show those solid 8-baggers :(|pg||
nt|kemperg: no save needed:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Verhees obviously expected better trump with 3@S|pg||
nt|ady: well surely even if the spades are solid   6 clubs will be a certainty|pg||
nt|ady: east could have had AQJXXX   and stil there can be a 5-1 split    cant be better than playing a solid  8 card suit?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i've checked   after 2@S Michaels  they use both cue bids to show @S raises|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so DBL starts all good hands with 4th suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but  agree with voices from above   why not just Ask Aces|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since there are 2 ways to set @S then I think immediate 4N should be Standard Blackwood [not Keycard]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i shouldn't use term "2 cues"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they use 2N and 3@H to show different strength 4+@S raises|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so now i'm confused about why not 3@C -- still looking to see if i've made note about it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Verhees bids RELAYS|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C = 1@C|pg||
nt|ady: solid 4@S for n/s|pg||
nt|fabsayc: an excellent save here|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: @D preempts  would also get votes|pg||
nt|bobholl: it is agressive anyway but mostly on the 3@D bid :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Verhees apologising, saying 6NT may be the top spot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: also checking the draft of book  "the art of bidding solid 8 card suits"|pg||
nt|ady: amazing  clubs never mentioned once  with AKQJXXXX|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or semi-solid 9-baggers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so in Ultimate Canape  you either open 3@H or PASS with what others open 2@H or multi 2@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=3@H|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jaapfr: y N feels he has a beauty|pg||
nt|fabsayc: al, what is a 2h opening in VV system|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe puppet to 2N to then show long suit try in @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: regardless of meaning   they got there|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and layout very declarer friendly|pg||
nt|ady: nice red suit splits    |pg||
pc|hK|nt|kiwibridge: even after 4 @S tricks they can't help but make :)|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|twcho: but they don't have any chance to find it|pg||
nt|roswolf: east's lack of defence will be a deterrenr for future adventures!?|pg||
nt|kemperg: undo|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D completes exact shape|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Martin  the responses change a bit for passed hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i have no life :(|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: auction says nothing about vP's @H length|pg||
nt|penseur9:  might make 4 here|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: West hoped East could bid 3N over 3@S :)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  the 10 of @D an importent card once again |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|roswolf: declarer should get the guesses right|pg||
nt|roswolf: or at least 1 of them|pg||
nt|penseur9:  pretty difficult decision to finesse here|pg||
nt|roswolf: not much else for west's double than Qxx(X) IN @h +@c|pg||
nt|penseur9:  right, no entry to is hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might think Verhees short in @C rather than @D   but can't make in that case|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: South asked about possible shapes in East, not sure what the questions were, answers were 1@D and 1@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: that makes more sense |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 10-15 hcp  5+@H 4+@C     2@D = @H & @D|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ady: leaders pulling away again|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NONE of the Bermuda Bowl partnerships is known for timidity :)|pg||
nt|gsper:  With the @C9 falling this makes, rather surprisingly|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at the practical level, 2D by S might have fetched a making 3N by N. E might well lead spade honor against that auction|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or a heart|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: 3@S forced 3N|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ady: 28-0 so far this set for Het Witte and boards 8 and 9 dont look bad for them|pg||

nt|penseur9:  will go down now|pg||
nt|roswolf: now declarer is in danger|pg||

pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: now 4@S mild slam try in @S|pg||
nt|ady: 20 bids to get to 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: amateurs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: van Prooijen showed 5341 with bad spades|pg||

nt|vugraphzvc: players discussing how many 5@h or 5@c would have been off|pg||
nt|gsper:  That was nonsense by me, but it still made|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Verhees saying he thinks 6 poor @S is not good enough to rebid 3@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Westra will open Verhees' hand with 2@D  = weak @H or various strong hands|pg||
nt|ady: that seems wrong|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no overtrick???|pg||
nt|mcphee: back 2 mins|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: @DQ was a BIG clue|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  8   v Lankveld  5@D west|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  5@S for sure NS |pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3nt or 4@H?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 18+ bal|pg||
nt|ady: maybe west just condeeded a club|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 22 was another 8 for leaders   [that was 4@S hand that took so long   the other table was 4@HX]|pg||
nt|ady: 5@C   6 if taking a peep at the diamond position|pg||
nt|psyck: South lead @h other room in that 3N, Ginossar did well not to here|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: what else?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: ns 2@H/@S openers are natural weak 2's    go figure|pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: good lay for game in hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL = 5-7 hcp|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|ahollan1: wrong Al    westra 2@D is weak EITHER major or ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: make sure your partnership knows whether 4N or 5@C is asking for partner's minor|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: with strong leaping michaels they just bid 4m|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: they know :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: options include using 5m as saying  I have my own suit   or   using 4N/5@C to differentiate strength|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @C like the precision 2 @C  can have a 4 card major |pg||
nt|ady: trumps 2-2  and diamond finesse helps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and 100 honors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this interference probably helping EW   both in auction and in play|pg||
nt|andyv:  almost a classic dbl|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@d xfer to @h...probably a better raise than 2@h directly|pg||
mb|2H|nt|penseur9:  I beleive to take with the ace and play trump is best line here|pg||
mb|d|nt|bobholl: 4@H i guess|pg||
nt|penseur9:  still may go down one though|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H = natural, forcing   not sure why it gets alert|pg||
nt|ahollan1: voices discussing 3@S bid on last hand|pg||
nt|ady: not sure where n/s were going    but now we know|pg||
nt|ady: surely south will not remove|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one twist is   1@S only promised 4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure, but it is possible that other bids/pass  show  canape/5332 shapes|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  9 [3@HW+1]    Jansma playing 2@S South|pg||
nt|ady: an easy 300 to 500|pg||
nt|ady: 3@H    some action|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzxn: the second segment will start in 10-20 minutes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@D is a sound heart raise|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: must be puppet stayman,   3@S=4@H, not 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if Wortel gave any thought to leading trump|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how close is North to making a stronger bid over 3@S?   other than 4@H  [which endplays partner] what else can he try without playing adjective bridge?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Westra hand got a lot better on this auction   but only because East bid 3@S|pg||
nt|ady: K@C   or Q@H lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @HQ for me|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: who knows   @C lead could kill entry to partner's hand|pg||
nt|ady: east badly of whichever  lead king of clubs or queen of hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: remember when most common distributions were  5431 and 4432 ??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from what i've seen  all of the Bermuda Bowl winners make bids like this|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 4@C slam try in @H|pg||
nt|dkkello:  coffe hand ?  ( i am told no hand is a coffehand! )|pg||
nt|jaapfr: this one is with @S 4-3 and @H 3-2 and @DK ok:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H does NOT show @S length  it is 'normal'  1-suiter|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  The coffeshops in Netherland is also better than ours ;)  |pg||
nt|gsper:  Voice commentator suggests that N had not shown 4@H|pg||
nt|gsper:  *5@H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: safest line win spade ace, lead heart queen|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if he has not shown five hearts i dont like this method, more likely jansma took a view|pg||
nt|sybarra: so even this hand Bertens gets a 3/1 break |pg||
nt|sybarra: better than 4/0 |pg||
nt|sybarra: but I bet he is thinking about that option |pg||
nt|ahollan1: good defense, but declarer will prevail|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  21  [3@CW=]  Westra 2@H after opening 1N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in 4th seat|pg||
pc|dT|nt|twcho: 4@h can be defeated it seems|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just guessing|pg||
nt|bobholl: boils down to the @C decision i guess|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  10  Frank Bakkeren  thinking over the Michaels bid|pg||
pc|dA|nt|twcho: what is the best strategy for N to bid his hand against strong @c?|pg||
nt|twcho: it is an interesting problem indeed|pg||
nt|ady: nice 1 suiter?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice in context of  favorable vul opposite passed partner :)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|twcho: EW has missed their par contract of 3NT but N came to their rescue|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y before 5 losers so a dutch coffeeshop hand:)|pg||
nt|gsper:  They have a number of canape positions|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Jansma explained 3@D as showing 5-5 btw|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thanks operator, smooth job @H|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|penseur9:  seems a resonnable stop here|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: North puts dummy down; to bad trumps|pg||
nt|bobholl: not necessary in 4@H :) |pg||
nt|kemperg: duck! @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: should Frank play for Ton to have underled @CA?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: honest   i typed that before he returned @C9|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well he needs a second club trick to have a chance, so pretty normal|pg||
pc|cK|nt|penseur9:  should make now|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|nt|twcho: I think east shd bid 3NT with regard to her sheer strength|pg||
nt|jaapfr: now @D creates a lot of pressure |pg||
nt|dkkello:  do you agree on the 2 @D bid?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4333333333333 for me ok to deny|pg||
nt|dkkello:  i agree it looks like a NT hand to me!  |pg||
nt|bobholl: don't even understand because 4@H stay 4@H without an hounour :)|pg||
nt|gsper:  Ty|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vP might have bid 3@S thinking that 3@H was a psych    so - rather than losing a chance to defend 4@H  worried about what he would do over 4@C-P-P|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: South really took @C10 with the A|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ok 2 different views (half specs agree and other disagree as we do)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for those who started with duplicate    in the old days   holding 4 of top 5 trump got a bonus of 100 points, 5 of 5 got 150 for honors  [and all 4 aces in NT was 150]|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bobholl: but huubke needs swings :)|pg||
nt|ady: duck a spade  and if trumps 3-1   hope 3rd trump has the length in spades|pg||
pc|d5|nt|twcho: her 12 points + her partner's 16+ make 3NT a hot favorite to make|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jaapfr: too much frustrated in the past with a 4333 and missing NT|pg||
nt|dkkello:  need right wiew in clubs and teammates will never notice what happend, my money goes on declarer here |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|djneill:  North may pitch a @d, assuming needs South to have @dQ to set it, right?|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  23  11 to the trailing team|pg||
nt|psyck: yes Ekaterina was flawless|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: Frank Bakkeren jumps to 4N over Michaels|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: :) indeed|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|twcho: while the opponent's bidding shows a likely chance of bad break|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jaapfr: especially this one:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course he doesn't have to worry about canape -- but i don't think that should have factored in here either|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: now no problem|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vugraphzvc: West surprised now|pg||
nt|ady: tht that was only money bridge Al ?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: final board is 28|pg||
nt|ady: on 23  with the 6 hearts and 3 spades  west chose to re-bid 2 hearts rather than 3NT   and gained 11 imps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 24  Paulissen opened 3rd seat with his balanced 6-count :)|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
nt|kemperg: OK 1 down is enough|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: too tired    wondering if Ton should duck 2nd @C    i know doesn't matter on actual layout but ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Frank went to the bathroom|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  22  [3NN+1]  Paulissen North playing 3@C REDOUBLED|pg||
pc|c8|nt|vugraphzvc: South says sorry for taking @CA, and North sorry for showing wrong count|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: Ton responded 5@S -- i'm confused    now thinking over 6@C|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||

nt|ahollan1: thanks to everyone who has pointed out   north is  SHE|pg||
nt|penseur9:  well done|pg||
nt|ady: lucky    got out for down 2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: 15 minutes remaining on the clock|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually  early world championships playing Total Points included honors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: time for another big club auction!|pg||
nt|psyck: Thanks Gary & the kibs for joining us here & for their inputs.|pg||
nt|andyv:  final board|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: 1@S never has shorter 2nd suit  could be 4@S with 5+other|pg||
nt|gsper:  I have to leave now. Thank you Bas for a great job (goes without saying)|pg||
nt|gsper:  And Martin, Marshall and informative kibs|pg||
nt|ady: ok|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they were excellent Krishna and thanks also to you :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Martin and Gary|pg||
nt|vugraphzxn: Next match will start at 5.30 Moscow time.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 5@S 5@H opens 1@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might well be some fight between the majors of e/w|pg||
nt|penseur9:  9 IMPs on 10 for O1 for a 2IMP now... it's anybodies game now|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: finally an example of canape hand  i.e.  2nd suit is LONGER|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with 3@H/@S  they use 1@S-2@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is this a 1@H opening or upgrade to 2@D = bal 18-19|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i really did type that before the bid was made|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Thanks Göran :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: which may effectively end this match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but mostly rubber bridge|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 18+ bal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL = @H & @S|pg||
nt|djneill:  vulnerable, but 1-level, 5-5, strong club - lots going for the X|pg||
nt|ady: n/s   will cetainly be ing game     3NT?|pg||
nt|djneill:  yep|pg||
nt|mcphee: pretty sure they will rule out @S game david|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  O1 = Onstein1 :0|pg||
nt|penseur9:  :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thanks G|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and to our operator, the organizers, bbo and lots of suggestions from spectators|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Ekaterina for a wonderful job as our operator|pg||
mb|3H|nt|twcho: many kibitzers pointed out that 4@h should be cold even NS find their ruffs|pg||
nt|twcho: sorry for my wrong analysis|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we saw that at the beginning of the set -- or maybe that was last set|pg||
nt|bobholl: didn't see huub do anything wrong (no 2@D bid in the start may be)|pg||
nt|ady: nice 4@S for n/s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think 1@H ignores DBL  so   FG  a) BAL [no singleton/void], 8+ HCP  b) 3 places-to-play, 12-14 HCP|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: sorry, I was delivering some drinks for the guys, N and E did not think|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D=@H|pg||
mb|4D|nt|ady: good fitting black suits     should make 11 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D  10-15 HCP, 5+@H 4+@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and again  DBL=5-7 hcp|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S a good save for e/w|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not counting @SJ|pg||
nt|mcphee: we forgive you this one time|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no real life kibitzers in the room??|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: nope, not allowed|pg||
nt|mcphee: anyone a 3@H bidder as E?|pg||
nt|ady: reasonable|pg||
nt|mcphee: i suppose dble need not be 5/5  major tho|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: was that a transfer to NY :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: NT:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: S ostensibly very strong for this sequence but presumably wishing to prevent EW finding viable save|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would be more worried about missinbg a slam than about that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm uncertain of auctions after the interference :(|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thanks Andy and martin, great operator and amazing specs @H|pg||
nt|andyv:  and ty specs for joining us and making this so much fun.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|twcho: need to drop the offside K, highly unlikely|pg||
nt|kemperg: on board 22 2 down in 3NT, big win for Onstein|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not this opening is very preemptive on partner, this is excellent 4@H game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Verhees could raise with something exceptional|pg||
nt|ady: will have to play on spades|pg||
nt|ady: I suppose could run 10@S   first round|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes NY here we come :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 2@D= ANY INVIE!?|pg||
nt|roswolf: invite|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry   2@D=ART INV  a) 3/4@S  b) NT  c) 3@H/@S & 6@C/@D|pg||
nt|penseur9:  good stop here|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@H jump probably does NOT set up forcing pass situation|pg||
nt|sybarra: that was that crazy hand "wrong sided" at both table |pg||
nt|ahollan1: voices from above make great point   why ONLY 2@H from east|pg||
mb|4S|nt|roswolf: ty al|pg||
nt|sybarra: has to find the 9th trick here |pg||
nt|sybarra: but hts are 3/3  so should not be difficult |pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to try a @H early,  that gets the club ace out of N hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry I mean a @C early |pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  will declarer guess the trump the right way?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: total performance of all 4 here very high imo|pg||
nt|dkkello:  agree |pg||
nt|fabsayc: this 3@D raise covers a lot of hand types, it seems|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Bergen style|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: last set almost half of the boards were double digit swings   here, the biggest exchange is 3 imps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S good bid -- took away Verhees Michaels call -- so vP limited info|pg||
nt|ady: dbl showes majors?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: at 04:36  i should copy/paste rather than try to remember :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh my     Ton bid over 6@C  so he really did think 4N was keycard|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final is 7@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: west's dbl  yes  @H & @S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a decent slam if no club lead|pg||
pc|cT|nt|penseur9:  :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but 5@H isn't exceptional|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H  not guaranteed    need correct diamond guess|pg||
nt|ady: certainly must defend 4@S|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|penseur9:  looks like +2 here|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: on  25  vLankveld overcalled 4@H immediately|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  9  [vP's 3@S opener]    Bos opened 1@S and Lankveld declaring 3N West|pg||
nt|penseur9:  we seam frozen here|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: no North thinking|pg||
nt|ady: unusual to be doubled in a solid 10 card fit   but should get 300|pg||
nt|mcphee: not always 5/5 though correct Al?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: sometimes even the world's best look just like us humans :) see you sson for the next set @H|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|ady: run 10@S   soade to ace and diamond|pg||
nt|ady: spade|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no lengths given on CC  but vul|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: switch to stiff A@C    and low diamond best|pg||
nt|ahollan1: alert of PASS implies they play PASS/DBL Inversion here   where PASS says willing to defend  and DBL says "i'd like to bid more"|pg||
nt|ady: can get 500|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1:  9 [2@SN=]  Bertens opened 2@S [2-suiter] and was raised  that should mean yet another pickup for White House|pg||
pc|d2|nt|twcho: Is 6@s an odd on bid?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: about this hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: yes, she is.. |pg||
nt|penseur9:  ok tks :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my guess would be 55 highly probable|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|penseur9:  again a reminder that EW had a 10 IMP carry over so very thight play here |pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: as you see   responder does NOT promise 3+fit|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: soon|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1:  25  Jansma playing 6@C|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mcphee: so E should have perhaps considered 3@H|pg||
nt|ady: thats why I am not a great believer in these defences to strong club   if you dont play the hand the auction reveals too mcuh|pg||
nt|mcphee: i am a major believer you get in their face|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on the flip side   you really don't like giving Relay pair a free run in the auction|pg||
nt|mcphee: conventions like Suction or crash dak are good against strong @C|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 3@D  limited splinter, 3@H asksm 4@D =@Hx not @C cue thx unox for that|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the other room on 9 west axed 4@S to gain 5 imps|pg||
nt|bobholl: berry zal (een beetje) verrast zijn als @H 4 1 zitten|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kemperg: wow|pg||
nt|sybarra: now will explore the red suits |pg||
nt|jbennet: west still have sort of guess.|pg||
nt|jbennet: play for klub king south??|pg||
nt|jbennet: or play for at least 1 red suit 3-3?|pg||
nt|kemperg: lots of options now|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: a) he thought 4N keycard   b) he thought 6@C asking 3rd round control|pg||
nt|ady: will not be good if 4 spades reached in OR    but better than 2 spades passed out|pg||
nt|ahollan1: suction is called something different in other parts of the world    i think much of europe calls it Kelsey [or maybe Yeslek]   can't recall name in New Zealand/Australia :(|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|sybarra: :( |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kemperg: even discarding a @H wont matter|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bobholl: sry berry will be surprised (a bit) with @H 41|pg||
nt|dkkello:  he will come to 8 tricks now one way or another  |pg||
nt|sybarra: now all ok |pg||
nt|kemperg: claim|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@D was doubled  but Frank didn't give his brother a chance to bid 6N|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that explains a lot including the lead|pg||
pc|s8|nt|vugraphzvc: brink smashing his @hJ on the table|pg||
nt|dkkello:  pitch spade  |pg||
nt|bobholl: didn't come to mind at first but it is a good idea|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i miss why he does not play @S7 in a split second?|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thanks again all, I am staggered by the score :(|pg||
