nt|rv: not everyone's choice of weak 2/multi with so much outside|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|rv: right time to open though with opponents' making slam|pg||
nt|petergill: If East has 7 spades and one heart, a 4@H psyche by East over 2@D Multi, anticipating defending 4@SX, has upsides and downsides. |pg||
nt|rv: is Helgemo's 4n RKC or is it just slam try?|pg||
mb|5C!|mb|p|mb|5H|nt|petergill: 4@S save makes Geir Helgemo think the chances of a singleton or void spade in East hand are higher|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: I think 4NT followed by 5@H was a slam try in @H, whereas a direct 5@H over 4@S is merely competitive|pg||

mb|p|nt|penseur9:  part score seems indicated here... possibly in @H by NS|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphzvc: 1@h might be only 3 sometimes, that's probably the reason that Ton did not bid 2@h|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if east were not a passed hand, i would respond 1nt to slow the auction|pg||
nt|fabsayc: even 2 is an overbid|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: more likely 6N|pg||
nt|penseur9:  this is not a forgone conclusion... lot's of work to do|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  seems that N is tempted to go for slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4N is regressive  [doesn't like either of responder's suits]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N range  20-21(22)|pg||
nt|penseur9:  hi Al, welcome back|pg||
nt|fabsayc: because you have the queen (i typed it wrong)|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  some work to do here|pg||

nt|mcphee: N please no @S lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: are there options other than playing Ton for @DH10?|pg||
nt|psyck: looks like both pais play a fairly natural system, so hopefully we will be able to follow most of their biddin|pg||
nt|aap00: and how strong is 4@h vs 10-13 - ???|pg||
pc|d5|nt|penseur9:  good lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: and he showed 4@h already|pg||
nt|ahollan1: most of the Onstein2 lead came in 2nd set where they more than overcame the White House 20 imp carryover [from Round Robin match]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i vote for 5@C instead of 5@H    just in case NS bid 5@S, i'd like @C lead|pg||

nt|vugraphzvc: don't know why bertens played the @d10 here, Q looks better|pg||
nt|bobholl: in practice surely :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: if you play for Kx low is best of course, but against 98 the Q is the same as 10, but it gains with J9|pg||

nt|penseur9:  I'm not sure I would have played @D here... most likely|pg||

nt|gsper:  *have bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: White House started the match with 20 imp carryover from the Round Robin|pg||
nt|ady: in fact O got vulnerability right    was 800|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Onstein 2 had big 2nd set to take this 20-something lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they are not handicapped by having to type|pg||
nt|ahollan1: progressive lenses don't improve matters |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Verhees does NOT have bid to describe weak 2@H opener   even if he wants one here|pg||
nt|djneill:  hi all|pg||
nt|fabsayc: another good slam, at least after south opens a preempt|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|famus: Wonder whether we have the latest leader board results??|pg||
nt|penseur9:  3nt looks like best contract for NS|pg||
nt|bobholl: nice hand for bas :)|pg||
nt|gsper:  Opinions differ about weak 2 on 7-carder|pg||
nt|ahollan1: westra might open multi 2@D|pg||
nt|ady: Verhees attempting  to get swings|pg||
nt|ady: North will be sorry if trying a raise|pg||
nt|ady: could be right if south was short in spades and had a 7 card suit|pg||
nt|mcphee: hi Dan|pg||
nt|andyv:  N certainly interested in investigating for slam|pg||
nt|fabsayc: transfer then 5NT is my guess|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Richard Bley|pg||
nt|riccho:  hi everybody!|pg||
nt|psyck: results: http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava12/slava12r.htm|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it was suggested that east bid 4@D and correct 4@H to 4@S to invite slam|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Another delicate 3NT ...|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|penseur9:  hi Bob, welcome|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Thats a Michaels  |pg||
nt|dkkello:  hi Bob |pg||
nt|kemperg: better speed than in first round:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  GSF?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@S=10-15 HCP, 4+@S  if 2 suits then 2nd is LONGER|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no just a force to slam (pick a slam)|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: 15-17|pg||
nt|gsper:  Or Multi|pg||
nt|kemperg: canape, shorter suit first|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=ART INV  a) 3/4@S  b) NT  c) 3@H/@S & 6@C/@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=5+@H   note: 5@S 5@H opens 1@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: eventually it will come up so a pre-alert   NS opening 2@C/@D/@H are all multi-purpose  either weak in next higher suit  [think transfer preempt]  or various strong hands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but 3@D avoids all alerts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is west worth another bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which slam try now from Verhees?|pg||
nt|mcphee: intersting hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  W probably can't make 3@h|pg||
nt|fabsayc: undo|pg||
nt|andyv:  we can see that 7N or 7@h makes...reasonable to get to 6 but finding out about the 4th @c is difficult|pg||
nt|psyck: hi Richard|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think this is polish club|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: reach 4@S (3nt down on @C lead)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW system is called Ultimate Canape|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: i'm surprised by action from EACH player|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ok 3@H could be a form of micheals, spades and a minor|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok, EW are out of the picture|pg||
nt|psyck: Zaleski needs two good wins, but the Russians & Bulgarians are tough opponents.|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: yes, running score available at http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/RoundResult.aspx?section=c9efb17f-ccb2-4cff-b5bf-3463f7676fc6&round=11&tourid=704|pg||
nt|twcho: but in Chinese characters|pg||
nt|ahollan1: must be worth at least one try   @D under control, stiff @C  @SA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now maybe 5@D by west to check on club control|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: "must" was an overbid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on the downside, king and jack of diamonds may be worthless|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looking for justification - maybe Verhees worried about @H losers when vP holds less then 4@H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Jokes all around about the quality of Ton's preempts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they always seem to have 13 cards|pg||
nt|andyv:  UNDO PLEASE!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no andy i think this is correct|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok...so W bid 3@h|pg||
nt|fabsayc: versace taking advantage of vulnerability|pg||
nt|andyv:  sorry everyone....my senior moment!|pg||
nt|riccho:  dangerous field here entered by E... NS may reach slam |pg||
nt|psyck: maybe E could have entered the auction with a @c bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: EW is now sitting at 3rd position before this round starts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 7 small is similar to Kxxxxx so often bid the same way|pg||
nt|gsper:  Me too, but some people would not dream of it|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Site: http://www.bridge.nl/uitslagen |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=3-fit Drury  [2@D=4-fit]|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Might "make" at trick 1 ... low diamond lead|pg||
pc|d3|nt|famus: a big B UT!!!:)|pg||
nt|twcho: NS lying 8th|pg||
nt|twcho: so EW still has chance to clinch the title|pg||
nt|penseur9:  good lad should still make easely|pg||
nt|gsper:  Especially Law devotees|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS system is Dutch Doubleton|pg||
nt|mcphee: so 2@D was some game try or just annouced opening values?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=RELAY  but i don't follow-ups|pg||
nt|mcphee: just see if I ask you any more questions :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you'll have to yell them   i'm having trouble staying awake :(|pg||
nt|mcphee: OK|pg||
nt|fabsayc: could pass 2@D but 2@S is fine|pg||
nt|aap00: 4@s-@h-2@d-@c|pg||
nt|aap00: oops, 3@d...|pg||
nt|psyck: @c would indeed have made it more interesting|pg||
pc|d2|nt|twcho: seems quite a no. of options available for declarer here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: West could try 3N at these colors|pg||
nt|fabsayc: pass is 0-3 we think|pg||
nt|andyv:  this can go down 6 |pg||
pc|d6|nt|penseur9:  *lead|pg||
nt|penseur9:  nothing much the defense can do to defeat this contract here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs  upside-down count & attitude|pg||
nt|penseur9:  good bidding from EW here|pg||
nt|dkkello:  yes |pg||
nt|ahollan1: vP might have raised|pg||
nt|mcphee: E hand getting worse|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not sure if 5nt is queen ask, looks that way|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in any case we are into a sequence i have never ever seen before|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2nt was some form of super accept of transfer, probably max with three trumps|pg||
nt|chick:  This match started a little earlier than scheduled, so hopefully we'll have some commentators shortly :)|pg||
nt|hedyg:  EW CC: http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Israel/pachtmann-ginossar.pdf|pg||
nt|psyck: 1N = 12-14 (11+ NV), all 5422's included except both M's, 6m ok, all 4441's included (!)|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|ady: 4-1 trump split    but should arrive at 10 tricks  losing 2 hearts and a club|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  1  Bakkeren brothers get to 5@S|pg||
nt|xenya: it appears their system hasn't worked too well on this one|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  On this deal, a club lead would only have been interesting for a little while, because dummy's club spots will yield a second club trick|pg||
nt|xenya: maybe, CK -- but the suspense wouldn't have lasted long i think -- it still makes|pg||
nt|aap00: agree|pg||
nt|nkgupt: killer might be a passive @s and repeats cutting off the dummy|pg||
nt|aap00: the only problematic lead was @d Q: say, @dA, 4rounds of @s, @h to A, @d...|pg||
nt|aap00: and looks like no 9th tricks available...|pg||
nt|xenya: that's true|pg||
pc|h2|nt|twcho: but @d is the most promising|pg||
nt|twcho: @c can wait and @s suit is not robust enough|pg||
nt|famus: he exercised one of em--next ought to be a small @s to Q to wind up |pg||
nt|penseur9:  this COULD make but difficult to figure out double dummy|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: @HJ from QJxx(x) or JT(x)     @HQ from QJ(x)|pg||
nt|penseur9:  probably will go down now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this could be a form of Slawinsky honor leads,   which i never remember|pg||
nt|penseur9:  remember though that they are much better then I am :)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  should make in 12-15 min or so .. |pg||
nt|penseur9:  on board  1, OR in 4@S -1 for 5 IMPs Onstein1|pg||
nt|bobholl: would play @CK now|pg||
nt|xenya: the funny thing that this 3N also seems to have a play|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ahollan1:  15  3N in South|pg||
nt|psyck: opening 2@h would also have got them to the same spot|pg||
nt|psyck: other room gets there via a multi opening|pg||
nt|psyck: multi enabled it to be played by E, not that it matters here|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: ah perhaps now some realistic bidding|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|mcphee: west doesn't care|pg||
nt|djneill:  East could have had @hK, @dA, @cK, opposite singleton @s, that would have been nice|pg||
nt|mcphee: very nice|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard to sac in 7 spades now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: kudos to pachtman for negotiating this auction|pg||
nt|xenya: same auction and lead in the other room|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Nice play that ... declarer's main chance is @HA onside, but he has some extra chances if hearts are 3-3 with the ace offside|pg||
nt|aap00: small @h in hope that something good happens |pg||
pc|d8|nt|fabsayc: jansma looking for a line to make this hand, needs a miracle for that|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so an unhappy push|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: Ton  not balancing with all of that shape seems very deep|pg||
nt|psyck: if the 2 doubletons were say 31 instead, it would be a 2@s opening for them|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bobholl: direct ak of @S best now ?|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|mcphee: not exactly a claimer, but he should manage|pg||
nt|ahollan1: defense decides   @D ruff or @C trick|pg||
nt|mcphee: only a @S lead had a shot to beat it I think|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|penseur9:  well done|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT speculative      poor trick taking potential|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|nt|kemperg: @D onside, so its made|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jansma in South passing throughout on  2   4@S East|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ady: could be a problem  with spades 4-1|pg||
nt|mcphee: this will also beat it if defenders are on the ball|pg||
nt|mcphee: low @S see S hop ace|pg||
nt|djneill:  for the locations of the @sA, @hK, and @cK, this is the only arrangement that provides danger for West, can he do something about it|pg||
nt|mcphee: and now a @C will get them the setting trick as W can not reach the dummy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but then doesn't @C go on @S?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh  i get it|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|kemperg: both sides bidding up to par:)|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: curious line|pg||
nt|psyck: only 2 in each suit maybe|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|bobholl: always 5 made now|pg||
nt|bobholl: at least|pg||
nt|ady: needs to ruff a diamond and a club with 5 and 3 of spades    has not got the entries|pg||
pc|s5|nt|famus: after surrendering @d and @h back--puts dec on his back foot to cash out|pg||
pc|sT|nt|dkkello:  since Laura Dekker  spent 500 days on the sea(congratulation) ..|pg||
nt|bobholl: but this is better|pg||
nt|gsper:  He hoped to discard the @C3 on a @H and lose no trump tricks|pg||
nt|gsper:  Rather forlorn in view of the 3NT bid, but you can try|pg||
nt|fabsayc: defense could always force him to ruff a club if necessary|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but van Prooijen needed to duck, didn't he?|pg||
nt|mcphee: y|pg||
nt|psyck: well, only 1 @c for now|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@d , 1@c & 2 each in majors may be the limit|pg||
pc|sK|nt|gsper:  Yes, it was a bit of an insult to opps|pg||
nt|kemperg: has he entrys left for @D play?|pg||
nt|kemperg: yes @C anD @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: are all 3N overcalls of 3-level preempts speculative?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now @H entry to @S|pg||

nt|Vugraphzvc: Loek talking about asking for a director|pg||
nt|djneill:  what should North do over the takeout double|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL can be strong NT   [1N overcalls are artificial]|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: for the slow 3@h|pg||
nt|andyv:  for all those who want 8@s, it would only go down 2000|pg||
mb|1C|nt|twcho: slam time|pg||
nt|penseur9:  NS may have missed a @H trick in previous hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15 hcp, 0+@D often weak NT    maybe @D and LONGER @C/@S [canape] but not longer @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think that skews advancer's ability to bid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is 1000 an undertrick if you bid at 8 level|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: marginal slam here|pg||

nt|kemperg: Hi Shirley|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Hola Shirley|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=10-15 HCP, 4+@H  could be 5@H 5@S or 2nd suit LONGER|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N @H raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15 hcp, 0+@D  often weak NT   maybe 4@D and LONGER @S/@C [canape] but not longer @H|pg||
nt|djneill:  there is one bid that shifts the blame back to doubler, I think North will find it|pg||
nt|psyck: Ducking 1st @h, running @s to T, then ducking a @d all around...would have been a double dummy way to make 3NT on deal 3.|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: yes, that's about what i had in mind|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=a) 6+@C 1-suit    b) 4+@C and LONGER @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: and hello to Bas! |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@C shortness   still don't know if 1-suit @H or  longer @S/@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't think they can find @S now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S usually less than game force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D = 5+@H  invitational or stronger|pg||
nt|riccho:  @s dominates this hand (as it is so often the case)|pg||
nt|andyv:  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008MindSortGamesBeijing/Open/France/multon-zimmerman.pdf|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzvc: 1@D was 3+@D|pg||
nt|penseur9:  rare 1@D contract, S could hardly bid 1@H with that hand|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: incredibly Lauria-Versace goad the opps into another 13 imps|pg||
mb|4S|nt|twcho: so we can conclude that both pairs are playing precision, probably the most popular system in China|pg||
nt|penseur9:  hi AL welcome back|pg||
nt|sybarra: easy 4 @H's probably +1  |pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Van Prooijen always has a short suit, Verhees explained|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very practical rebid from Verhees|pg||
nt|djneill:  that's a nice bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: is it best for Wortel to bid now with the lousy 6@S or later?  and show both majors or ...|pg||
nt|penseur9:  does not look like any contract can ake either side|pg||
nt|penseur9:  *can make...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S looks good |pg||
nt|penseur9:  yes @S contract looks best here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no entry to West hand for @H ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D does not promise any points   because may prefer @S over @C|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3@H from bertens now i guess|pg||
nt|dkkello:  well she didnt went owerboard  |pg||
nt|kemperg: 1@S a nice 3rd hand opening|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N shows any 8+ hcp|pg||
nt|psyck: a fav vul 3@h opening...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: two way finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: 3@h should say solid suit|pg||
nt|twcho: and invite cuebid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: NS playing 2@H in open room|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  @CJ lead simplified things in the other room - that won't happen here|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: good save|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well  Kit Woolsey defines a good save as one that makes, but this is better than letting NS play 4@S|pg||
nt|gsper:  I wonder if W liked that opening or if he was forced by system|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we lost the clubs in the 60's, diamonds in the 70's, balanced nt bids in the 10's|pg||
nt|fabsayc: trump lead?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  15  [3NE+2]   Bertens in 5@D after Paulissen got to make lead directing DBL of @C |pg||
nt|fabsayc: israel can do no wrong|pg||
pc|d6|nt|twcho: 4@c probably deny @s control|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the running total includes 10 IMPs for Het Witte Huis  [White House] for winning the round robin|pg||
nt|penseur9:  didn't somebody say that the five level belongs to the oponents|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL would have shown cards rather than typical negative double|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so will be part score swing here|pg||
pc|dA|nt|penseur9:  *opponents|pg||
nt|kemperg: no retransfer from Jan|pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is because he wants to stop the auction in 4 @H |pg||
nt|kemperg: retransfer has not to mean slam interest|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not a great hand for the system|pg||
nt|ady: 2 diamonds and 2 trump tricks to be lost for sure    might scrape home|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL = takeout|pg||
nt|psyck: other room did not go for o/t as only in 4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont consider 50% as a good slam and this is no better than that|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: meanwhile onstein 2 won 5 imps on bd 17, letting them play 4@h undoubled|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: dbl by Drijver was GF|pg||
nt|gsper:  Not many losers, but a bit short on winners|pg||
nt|gsper:  He can ruff a @D high, but he does not know that|pg||
nt|gsper:  Could try something mundane like the @D finesse|pg||
nt|kemperg: I think 3@D had been the retransfer|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4@D splinter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ruffing finesse in @D works -- but will it be taken?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: immediate 2-level suit bids would be natural 0-7|pg||
nt|psyck: mildly aggresive 3n, some would rebid 2n, but vul...|pg||

pc|dK|nt|famus: actually observing the Bermuda Bowl etc recently--the most favoured system appeared to be a combination of 2/1 with precision @c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW flip-flop PASS/DBL     i think Eric Rodwell gets credit for that inversion|pg||
nt|bobholl: difficult to stop in 4@C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: depends if they take their trump winners|pg||
nt|ady: very likely to go down|pg||
nt|kemperg: @H 41 is rather unlucky|pg||
pc|d5|nt|penseur9:  already 4 IMPs for EW on board  1... only down one in OR|pg||
nt|mcphee: they only use that over 1@S dble or other suits also?|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bjacobs:  So it looks like declarer may need a squeeze of some sort|pg||
pc|s6|nt|psyck: N could be endplayed maybe|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|twcho: the winner - Netherlands having three pairs playing 3 different systems IIRC|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|famus: run of the mill board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: honestly   i don't know why a 1@D bidder opposite a hand that was willing to play a partscore would be in a forcing situation|pg||
nt|bobholl: berry wondering were the @S are on the bidding off course with huub|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi gm ga all|pg||
nt|bobholl: hi jaap :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi bob:)|pg||
nt|gsper:  Finis|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2nd @S from hand rather than @H to dummy then @S  since very possible for North to duck with @SA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then could lose @SA AND defense gets to play 2 round of trump and another potential @S loser|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Also, he might play @SA as well|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  hoping for 0 spade losers|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  But what I think he might do first is play a club to the queen to see if the king is onside|pg||
nt|aap00: can't see any endplay|pg||
nt|xenya: pretty tricky, this|pg||
nt|psyck: will S cover if low @c played?|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  It is ... at a simplistic level, if the @CK is on-side, he can play the spades safely for 1 loser - if it's offside, he needs to play the spades for no loser|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  as we can see, nothing will work, hence us fumbling around to find some sort of squeeze or endplay|pg||
nt|aap00: with @s 8 dropped playing @sQ covers both cases|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  yes, there are two ways to play the spades for no loser: @SKx in North or @S10x in South|pg||
pc|hT|nt|jaapfr: even DD i see no way of making this|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2 @H ruffs and @D 33 looks as best (and only) chance|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: Carl -- DBL isn't always traditional takeout shape since 1N overcalls are artificial|pg||
nt|djneill:  good stop, 25 HCP, no game|pg||
nt|psyck: sooner or later E will give dec the 9th trick|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|fabsayc: lauria can develop two spade tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  the Italians had two poor results opening 11 hcp hands with A, AK in first set|pg||
nt|psyck: i think i will not bother with looking for a double dummy way to make this :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: wow   18  the doomed slams    Paulissen-Jansma stop in 3N!!|pg||
nt|jaapfr: exchange @D 6 with 8 and it can be mad|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@S cue, 4NT blackwood, 5@D queen ask, 6@C side king|pg||
nt|jcwla:  http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=KT4+AKQ6+A53+K54  19.25|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ady: settling for down 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course seeing all 4 hands -- we know better :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kemperg: kib thinks he wanted opener on lead, wich is right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: opener will hold 4@H only if   a) weak NT  b) 4@H(441)  c) 4405    so i'm a bit surprised at choice of 3@D|pg||
nt|mcphee: i would want to be in 4@H though|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: or S will just take them|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but that is still down one|pg||
nt|fabsayc: best slam is 6NT avoiding a club ruff|pg||
nt|fabsayc: kibitzers think 7NT is a marginal slam :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  and as you say, playing the @SQ from dummy plays to one of these whilst also avoiding 2 spade losers|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: multiple tables are visible without login via http://bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  that also gives access to voice commentary|pg||
nt|jaapfr: e|pg||
nt|psyck: dec does not have comm , but E will have to provide|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamond jack lead seems safe enough|pg||
nt|xenya: seems the tables are not linked -- hopefully that will change|pg||
pc|sA|pc|d9|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  1  5@D went down so 11 to White House|pg||
nt|djneill:  yeah vulnerable game would be a prize|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kemperg: 6@S also 1 down on @C start?|pg||
nt|xenya: still no score -- let's be patient|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|s7|nt|sybarra: I think the kibber has it right,  get the "big" hand on lead |pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: West: good lead|pg||
nt|penseur9:  great defence here|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: NS discussing the defence over this 2@C opener a bit now|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  So adding it all, taking the square root, and taking away the number you first thought of: the @CJ lead gave away the contract at the other table|pg||
nt|psyck: Deep Finesse found some double dummy squeeze lines to make it|pg||
nt|aap00: all goes to 3-card 12@c ending|pg||
nt|aap00: with decl on lead, and he'll have a chance|pg||
nt|xenya: @D now would squeeze S in a strange way|pg||
nt|aap00: y, but @h - doesn't|pg||
nt|aap00: @h or @s defeats it for sure|pg||
nt|xenya: exciting, complex hand|pg||
nt|aap00: and if N plays @d declarer ruffs, discarding @h, cashes last @s discarding @h (S has to keep all 3@c)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ady: south has enough entries in hand to force out K@H   and then draw other trump|pg||
pc|hK|nt|psyck: wonder if they have to restart to connect the rooms|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kemperg: OK 6 @D is OK tks specs|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h8|nt|mcphee: 4@H down a little bit of bad luck I think|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Classic Fantoni pause ... working out how to avoid squeezing partner|pg||
pc|h6|nt|penseur9:  contract just making|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|aap00: then @h and @c, ducking 10|pg||
nt|aap00: very well done|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|jaapfr: he did try everything he could to make this imo|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: Zack's 1n here shows 18-19|pg||
nt|petergill: 1NT on this auction = 18-19|pg||
mb|2H|nt|rv: he would pass with @s length and less hcp|pg||

mb|p|pc|dA|nt|rv: at IMPs, he is happy to take his plus if any|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
nt|rv: can Helgemo play this for 1 down, it looks like 2 down especially w/o double|pg||
nt|rv: that is another reason not to double close contracts at IMPs, good declarers will invariably take right inference and save a trick or 2|pg||
nt|petergill: low club by N is probably best now|pg||
nt|petergill: but N is concerned that declarer might ruff clubs in dummy|pg||
nt|petergill: Dbl perhaps more attractive if EW are vul ..... as long as Dbl is penalty, not take-out :)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|sA|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|h7|pg||
nt|petergill: If South had @SA, N expected West to misguess by rising with king then|pg||
nt|rv: with double, Helgemo might not touch trumps and try to score 2@s, 2@c, 1@d, 1@h and a @s ruff for 7 tricks|pg||
pc|d8|nt|petergill: -2, 100 looks almost certain now|pg||

nt|jaapfr: but even then is communication well enough?|pg||
nt|penseur9:  could have made one more on a @H finesse|pg||

nt|kemperg: we all agree:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: That's what Verhees just said|pg||
nt|fabsayc: could have made overtrick but played 100% safe line|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no matchpoints  but good imp result|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 15 & 16 both pushed  [no surprise]|pg||
nt|djneill:  North might pop in fav vul for a little jaunt|pg||

nt|pelu:  the CC for NS: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Israel/pachtmann-ginossar.pdf|pg||
nt|andyv:  and 5 more imps to Israel as they played 1@s in OR|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4 coffees for this table|pg||
nt|psyck: the other room may also have to restart...|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|fabsayc: the percentage play in heart is low to ace in isolation so 4@H probably down|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  1@C = 14+ with clubs or 15+ balanced|pg||
mb|2S|nt|twcho: we have 3 consecutive tie bds|pg||
nt|famus: possibility of going over board|pg||
nt|penseur9:  slam here for NS|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another 2@C opener  this time  @C    go figure|pg||
nt|ady: e/w need to find their way to 5@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL=4@H/@S & 5+@C/@D    if he wants in|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: but expect other room 6@H or @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=multi  a) 5+@D, 3-10 HCP  b) 1-suit, FG  c) BAL, 20-21/26-27   wonder why Frank didn't try that 1st seat favorable|pg||
nt|riccho:  some reason here for S to let 1NT play|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  any chance for slam here?|pg||
nt|penseur9:  EW|pg||
nt|penseur9:  actually a gran slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=4+ but could be balanced|pg||
nt|djneill:  verhees thinking "typical"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so treating it as 1-suit|pg||
nt|mcphee: and 3@C = @C if he wants in:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  W passed initially|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@c presumably for majors|pg||
nt|fabsayc: double showing hearts|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  and we've arrived ...|pg||
mb|2N|nt|twcho: not sure what is 3@c here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: a bit surprising that NS not playing transfers over 1@C|pg||
nt|penseur9:  is 4@H making NS here?|pg||
nt|bobholl: not imo whwn vulbarable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs strong NT|pg||
nt|kemperg: 6@D down on @H ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  1  where our North opened 2N to show minors, East opened 4@H   North balanced with 4N and Westra in 5@CX South|pg||
nt|psyck: good bad 2n likely|pg||
nt|psyck: *2NT|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|twcho: but shd be GF hand with @s support|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will NS ever bid???|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@S easy make so 5@HX-2 excellent save|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Verhees saying 'short but nice' when he puts down the @cK|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: obviously 3@D some form of @H raise -- but what are the specifics?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: curious   hand upgrades for cuebid  but not good enough for 2@C opener  |pg||
nt|mcphee: 6 losers|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good falsecard from K10x or Q10x|pg||
nt|psyck: operator may have missed the bidding & entered the final contract|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  2NT is paying rather a lot of attention to the vulnerability|pg||
mb|3D|nt|famus: modified bergen:)?|pg||
nt|twcho: possibly|pg||
nt|penseur9:  1@D transfer to @H|pg||
nt|penseur9:  good question :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=INV a) @C/@D  b) 5@H/@S  c) NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that pretty much covers it all, doesn't it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: to me this method of 4+ spades is unplayable without support doubles, and i think north could double 3@D on this auction to show 3 spades|pg||
nt|fabsayc: north should probably double for takeout|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2N=bal max|pg||
nt|bobholl: would play @D myself now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: specs say 5@D a better save but i doubt that with this awful distribution|pg||
nt|bobholl: in spite of @S 3 :)|pg||
nt|psyck: (when rho bids at the 2 level, 2N is often used a good bad, with direct 3 level bids stronger & via 2n weaker)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hard to belive this is Lauria - Versace, seems like Overbid and Guggenheim :(|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6@H would be good contract if souths diamond 8 were the 9|pg||
nt|andyv:  their aggressiveness has backfired on several boards|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: polite word aggressiveness :(|pg||
nt|andyv:  another good slam for NS|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes we can all make 6 but i dont think will make if bid|pg||
nt|riccho:  tricky @h lead to convince decl not to finesse in @h ...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@H accepting, fewer than 4 hearts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and an overbid of 4@H by south|pg||
nt|aap00: NS are on the way to 3n|pg||
mb|3N|nt|penseur9:  2nt makes but 3 ????|pg||
nt|ady: may play 3NT   down on spade lead|pg||
nt|psyck: some reverse it & play bad-good 2NT|pg||
nt|pelu:  and CC for EW: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Italy/lauria-versace.pdf|pg||
nt|vugraphzxn: 3c final contract|pg||
nt|psyck: nice stop :)|pg||
nt|psyck: for once, dec will be happy when trumps do not break :)|pg||
nt|xenya: so Monaco have extended their lead up to 37 imps...|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: now vP needs to find @S lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C was a relay  did not promise a 4 card major|pg||
nt|psyck: thanks Peter|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzvc: EW CC: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Netherlands/vanprooijen-verhees.pdf|pg||
nt|penseur9:  that helps|pg||
nt|ady: low spade best|pg||
nt|ady: should survive  |pg||
nt|djneill:  a ruff, a palpable ruff, not that it gained much|pg||
nt|psyck: risky to enter such auctions vul...as happened in other room, more placid this room|pg||
mb|p|nt|gsper:  N may have wanted a little extra strength for that|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this seems to have marked the lead, lets see|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems @S is only logical choice   |pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlikely that @CA @C would get partner ruff|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Peter :)|pg||
nt|psyck: Peter and Andy on voice commentary this room|pg||
nt|psyck: kibs can listen using the browser version|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: :)|pg||
nt|aap00: 3@d-3@h-@s-@c|pg||
nt|aap00: looks like a trick short...|pg||
nt|psyck: this will reduce the gap|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  This will take some making.  I would normally say "it's down for sure" but not with this player|pg||
nt|aap00: but defense has to be careful|pg||
pc|h6|nt|penseur9:  4@D is pick a major|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if Gerbrand doesn't tell us -- the opponents don't know either|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D says  not 3@H/@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzxn: sorry|pg||
nt|andyv:  you were right, Martin...probably too hard to bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  np:)|pg||
nt|xenya: but  still 12 boards to go, so anything is possible|pg||
nt|aap00: best start for defense|pg||
pc|h7|nt|penseur9:  :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@C  0/3 keycards   5@H a bit of a mystery to me   maybe thinking 5@C showed 1 keycard??|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: 5@C showed 1 KC|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Frank just told me he made a mistake|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Frank seemed to be stressed out|pg||
nt|fabsayc: blame it all on Kantar|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: That explains it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks Bas  that explains 5@H :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: He says he made three wrong calls :)|pg||
nt|ady: need the club finesse|pg||
nt|fabsayc: operator, what was 2@C please?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: so   2236 or 2227|pg||
nt|ahollan1: invite opposite max -- seems forcing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe vP can change his mind|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yep  otherwise i'd sleep|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS leads vs NT = 4th|pg||
nt|riccho:  more than a single imp now...|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|bobholl: good news for drijver knows his save is good now|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: westra might get a long trump if drijver misguesses in @c|pg||
nt|jaapfr: he is thinking about not becoming trump short|pg||
nt|mcphee: ruffed with a natural as it happens|pg||
nt|aap00: now can't see how it can be made|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  The power of the weak jump overcall ... pushed N/S overboard|pg||
nt|psyck: the 2@s instead of the 1@s other room pushed them too high|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  And this is a truly killing lead, because it's going to rip the entry to the long club|pg||
nt|aap00: GiB agrees with -1|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|nt|twcho: both this bd and the last one looks like another 2 flat bds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wrong side but can the defense take their @H AND kill dummy?|pg||
nt|penseur9:  probable @C lead here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: really?   auction seems to highlight @H weakness|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Kantar would have been able to ask for keycards at lower level|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i agree 4@H would make after 1nt opening|pg||
pc|d8|nt|gsper:  Voice comentators suggest that they may not support D this high|pg||
nt|ady: there are losing options|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm a @D leader too -- which is why systems in college geared to having me on lead|pg||
nt|ady: if declarer guages this a 4 card suit  then best to cross and take heart finesse|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in this case 3 wrongs = a right|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|penseur9:  you have a point Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and @SKxxx might look for tap|pg||
nt|ahollan1: see   just as i told you   my leads are terrible|pg||
nt|gsper:  A kib confirms that|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi all:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good-o  so now he agrees that he did have 2@C opener :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: anyway  nice recovery|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Verhees asking why vP didn't lead @S|pg||
nt|djneill:  may see a supernatural resurrection|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H @H promotes a trump trick, doesn't it?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3nt might have made|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|nt|jaapfr: oeff luckily @CA and @DA not in other hands|pg||
nt|gsper:  Wlc, Marshall|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a few pairs can jump to 3@H/@S to show 4441 hands, but most use to show (31)(54)|pg||
nt|mcphee: could try 9@C|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: now down a lot|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: south has 2 @H entries AND @C length to give ruffs|pg||
nt|bobholl: 380 difference indeed|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry 800|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: 5@c -1 on bd 20 a push with 110 in 2@h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: must cash @DA first|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: nice finesse|pg||
pc|dT|nt|vugraphzvc: Schollaardt ai, when he sees @Hq|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: West takes a toilet break|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: 3@D was 15-17 with 4@H, like a old school 3@H bid|pg||
nt|penseur9:  13 IMPs on  18 for HWH OR in 3nt only|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Gerbrand -- can you explain this tournament   is it a seasonal/year long event??  does it impact selection of international team??|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: it's basicly the premier league|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: it was a 12 team double round robin|pg||
nt|bobholl: so 3@H from bertens not as good as i said :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: well, that depends, without 3@h brink-drijver might have stopped below 5@c|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ady: in 5@D  if south leads a heart   must duck first round and later discard a heart on club|pg||
pc|dA|nt|psyck: didnt expect trump to break i guess|pg||
nt|psyck: may have escaped for -1 if a 3rd round of trumps were drawn as cards are|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bobholl: good guesses always help :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: when this loses   has the option of diamond break   or club finesse|pg||
pc|d2|nt|psyck: many wondering about the lead, i'm as clueless|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  West can throw a heart on the 4th diamond, and he will ultimately have a safe club exit|pg||

nt|aap00: y, no real way not to concede 2@c and 2@s|pg||

mb|p|nt|twcho: sorry,|pg||
nt|twcho: trump is 31|pg||
nt|penseur9:  likely 4@H NS here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: More of a statement really: "Isn't a 1@S lead best?"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: won't be surprised if  5 is pushed |pg||
mb|1N!|nt|riccho:  W may think his partner has more defensive values than he actually has. penX may be the result|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  the bottom line of that hand is that Pachtman made a great lead ... and even the great Fulvio couldn't overcome it|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|ahollan1: 1@S=4+  NEVER the longest in a 2-suiter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3rd 2@C opener this set -- rare|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: they are also surprised :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2@C for @H now ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: they don't play that|pg||
nt|kemperg: weak 2 in @D or strong|pg||
nt|kemperg: 2NT strong relay|pg||
nt|kemperg: how good is your weak?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S=5@S 5@H 1@D  8-11 or 15+ hcp|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how's THAT for a specific bid??|pg||
nt|fabsayc: vunderbar|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H = 4-fit, 3-8 HCP|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: unusual light opening from Lauria|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a total misfitting hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  another 11hcp wonder|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I would not call it a good slam|pg||
nt|aap00: 4@s can be defeated with @h ruff, 4@h are making...|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: but is a good convention :)|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|twcho: so declarer has to guess the @c for an overtrick|pg||
nt|famus: again dicey 3NT on @d lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@S 5@H opens 1@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: and top 4 qualifies for semi-finals which are played now|pg||
nt|penseur9:  3@H transfer to @S|pg||
nt|dkkello:  good presure bidding from E-V |pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: i think 2@h is NF by the Bakkerens|pg||
nt|kemperg: 10pts, but still not very good:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: Jansma really wants to bid |pg||
nt|sybarra: not often you have an 8 card suit |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@C sets @H|pg||
nt|ady: games both sides fail here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=4+ but can be balanced|pg||
nt|mcphee: what is e/w nt range?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 15-17 for both|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  the 11 hcp is not so bothersome as the quality of the hand itself|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|ahollan1: 3@S maximum in context of non 1@C opener|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@H  minimum|pg||
nt|fabsayc: super duper dutch reverse flannery |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@CX on  1  was down 3  so only 2 imp swing|pg||
nt|ady: part score in clubs for n/s|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: omg who would open E|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not clear to double with west hand, but will likely gain|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Yes, with two 9-card major suit fits, you want to play in the suit that has a 2-2 break in the OTHER suit (no ruff)|pg||
nt|xenya: this hand may decide a lot|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  slam may be here EW again but hard to get there... again|pg||
nt|psyck: 3N could be tricky to defend|pg||
nt|xenya: we are still in the dark as to overall score|pg||
mb|4S|nt|penseur9:  3nt going down on a @D lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at this point  5+@S  4+@C|pg||
nt|kemperg: the dealing machine in Utrecht has no problems with 8  or 9 suits:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=4+|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this seems to be the set of 4-1 trump splits|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now RKC|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will stop in 6@S knowing @SQ missing|pg||
nt|psyck: defense should switch to @h at some time & not continue @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: good news   @DK protected     bad news -- they get 5(+) before you get 9|pg||
nt|psyck: at least has some intermediate spots in the 11hcp & not a 4333 this time :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6@D about 25%, or 100% after the fact|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  very tough decision for W here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H lead beats more than @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N could be lebensohl or scramble here   both make sense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlike Precision 2@C   here 2@D says nothing about points|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: NS just discussed, not sure what they agreed after all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry 6@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S is RKC in @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@D=2 keycards no Q|pg||
nt|psyck: other room had a misunderstanding on deal 4 for the 1st suing|pg||
nt|psyck: *big swing|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes 14 imps|pg||
nt|psyck: it could be a 'sohl misunderstanding...make sure you & pd are on same page.  Personally i prefer Rumpelsohl: http://gerbenbridge.blogspot.in/2005/12/your-sohl-or-mine.html|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2 unsupprted K's and a J to bolster the A in the "long" suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  they may get there|pg||
mb|p|nt|famus: E needs to retain @d suit control by not rising up with @dA--i think thats the crux of this hand|pg||
nt|dkkello:  for new bridgeplayers , notice how much the bid on very few points |pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh my     2 [5@HW=]   4@HX|pg||
nt|aap00: 2@d probably shown only 1 major|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Wrong suit ... and I reckon the defence will find the ruff|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@D looks like multi, not the majors, so a @H contract was not in the picnture|pg||
nt|psyck: not easy with S on lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Even on a mnor suit lead ... North can take his two aces and play a heart|pg||
nt|aap00: not my choice... playing multy-landy I prefer to overcall 2@c and then repeat @s|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Only @SA gives away this contract|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jcwla:  Welcome to my world.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in my world they are 4-1 FITS|pg||
nt|ady: should not be a problem    has 2 clubs tricks 1 diamond and 1 heart     can surely manage 4 trump tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other table seems to be entering 2nd 10 minutes of board  2|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 10 tricks|pg||
nt|riccho:  3@d may imply the @s-fit (otherwise doubling)|pg||
nt|psyck: i suppose so, more normal to just raise to 3@s|pg||
nt|aap00: oops|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Bingo (for E/W)|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Another trump lead goes down the gurgler|pg||
pc|s2|nt|famus: @dQ and small|pg||
nt|twcho: good defense|pg||
nt|twcho: else, declarer may make|pg||
nt|ady: can ruff diamonds high  and Q98 of spades come in to play|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bobholl: drijver will have a difficult card when in with k@D|pg||
nt|penseur9:  only two @S and a @C loosers|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: Frank confirms 2@h was NF|pg||
nt|dkkello:  protected by "the law" even vulnerable |pg||
nt|bobholl: tya htg |pg||
nt|dkkello:  se you Bob |pg||
nt|penseur9:  tks Bob|pg||
nt|ady: good lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  2 just finished  4@S=|pg||
nt|ady: just 4 side suit tricks   so need 6 trump tricks|pg||
nt|psyck: with 55 & all the values in the 2 suits, it is a routine opening,...|pg||
nt|psyck: but as you say, with the misfit here, not many tricks...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: after 4 cue bids|pg||
nt|andyv:  17 and this board will be a chance for them to make up some of the imps|pg||
nt|riccho:  well played by W|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|penseur9:  now it's E with tough decision :)|pg||
nt|penseur9:  I expect 5@C-p-p-p|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that won't make Verhees any happier|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other forms of scoring  Schollaard very close to converting DBL to penalty|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i missed the question Andy -- ask again|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  2  2@S made so 5 imps back to the leaders|pg||
nt|psyck: they are entering the results now|pg||
nt|psyck: the tbls connected now|pg||
pc|s7|nt|gsper:  1@C strong or weak bal, I hear|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Paulissen didn't preempt with north hand on  3  [where 3370]|pg||
nt|psyck: opening light had to payoff sometime, they just kept trying :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  and 17 turned out to be 1 imp for Israel|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@H was overbid, but after 3@H north would raise, so normal spot|pg||
pc|s9|nt|andyv:  it's their style and hard to argue with their track record|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I've always seen them to play sound openings at the 1 level|pg||
nt|psyck: well, tricky as i said...:)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ahollan1: correct spelling  of south   Schollaardt    but bbo field can't fit in last letter|pg||
nt|jaapfr: presumably he will return @S|pg||
nt|bobholl: only @S is rigth|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: can cash 1@c first|pg||
nt|jaapfr: still only 8 tricks: 2@S4@H1@Dand 1@C\|pg||
nt|jaapfr: with @DATx in W|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry 3 @D and 2@C to loose|pg||
nt|bobholl: but ew have to wait with cashing their 2 @C :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i think E can not deduct all permutations here at this moment so each card now has a risk to play|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: can cash 1@c, then @s switch sets up @ss before @ds|pg||
nt|bobholl: if they cash 1@C it migth make anyway :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: yyy but how he must know that or tell him:)?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: cashing a @c looks a normal option. Drijver doesn't know Bertens has 5|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but the @S switch now or thereafter is vital|pg||
nt|bobholl: 60% bet on making |pg||
nt|fabsayc: ok at least 5 cue bids|pg||
nt|riccho:  lot of things which could go wrong for the defense now |pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|bobholl: not necessary|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E about to be squeezed if W exits with heart jack i think after clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: and a bid unfortunate here |pg||
nt|ahollan1: more from  17   Paulissen DBL 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that won't help the trailing team|pg||
nt|ady: may get home as it is going     just lose 3 club tricks|pg||
pc|hT|nt|vugraphzvc: west telling east that he thinks East has a minimum for 3@C|pg||
nt|ady: still will be ok|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so White House closes gap to 11|pg||
nt|xenya: still the "silly" lead looks quite reasonable from S's perspective|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kiwibridge: they don't usually open with weak values|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: east known to have [at least] 9 black cards    how likely is @H finesse to work??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6 imps on  2 after 4@HX made with 1 non-vul overtrick|pg||
nt|ady: club leads I suppose look obvious   but it seems to have given the contract|pg||
nt|ady: trumps now 2-2    so Q@C can be ruffed out|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if zimmerman believes the discards he will run this|pg||
nt|fabsayc: NS seem to be allergic to trump leads|pg||
nt|xenya: http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava12/slava12r.htm  for running scores|pg||
nt|xenya: 22 imps to Monaco over the first two, 17 to Israel on the next three -- a roller coaster |pg||
pc|h7|pg||

nt|psyck: y, no obvious lead|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: best news -- 4@S not making either|pg||

nt|henryb:  Even with a minor suit lead it may not be obvious for Fantoni to play partner for the @sA rather than declarer for 2 clubs and partner for the @sK|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: too right   first check for @C 3-3  and if that doesn't work  THEN @S play|pg||
nt|psyck: Zaleskis hope fading now as the needed two good wins to make up|pg||
nt|psyck: All the strains were doubled, but NS sensibly did not double the final contract also in tempo|pg||
mb|2H|nt|penseur9:  will N simply raise to 3nt here?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that hand plays a lot better for NS on defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N = 4@H/@S and 5+@C  [Raptor]|pg||
nt|ady: n/s likely to play 3NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  another slam hand|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the nightmare continues|pg||
nt|Walddk4: What was played on 21?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We know about 20  7NTX -1|pg||
nt|aap00: 4@s making easily here|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  2@C = 10-13 with 5+ clubs|pg||
mb|2S|nt|twcho: according to rule of 15, east shd pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D tends to deny 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: vP gets a reprieve but still enters the auction|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S makeable but getting there maybe not obvious:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E may venture testosterone 2N|pg||
nt|fabsayc: do you mean 4@H?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: guess not:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: I was typing I had mis-seen the deal and should make  then..... |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D denies 4@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tends to deny 4@H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: why?|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  3 where Verhees opened 3@H   Westra did start with multi 2@D   Paulissen playing 3@S East|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@H+1N roland|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed -- a record of sorts|pg||
mb|3S|nt|marlowepi: yes 4H sorry for typo|pg||
nt|mcphee: do we see a support dble?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: dont balance|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if opponents want to play 1 of a minor, i let them unless i have a real hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|gsper:  Could he misguess @S in 4@H?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i should have alerted that i type transfers:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Haha|pg||
nt|ady: got there quickly      the play should be quick as well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+   1@H=7+ hcp  [1@D=0-6]|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a good hand for a weak 2 suiter opening, 2@H @H and another then pard can pass|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@H shows spades, 4@D splinter|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: xfer to @S, splinter and the real fit goes begging|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 7@C is not good, but better than 7@S|pg||
nt|andyv:  N can't be interested in slam|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think south will drive to six|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in clubs you just need clubs 2-2|pg||
nt|andyv:  if 4@h is a cue, should N do that now?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you can discard two spades on the hearts|pg||
nt|psyck: if the @hA were @dA, that would have been the defense required|pg||
nt|fabsayc: usually opener has a balanced 18-19 hand and belongs in no trump|pg||
nt|fabsayc: multon's pass is amazing|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: i think i'd vote for 2@S    lots of losers, no quick tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: Schollaardt is sorry for his dummy :)|pg||
nt|ady: will be happy to see Q@D appear|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i would not, but |pg||
nt|andyv:  in @s, you are almost forced to make 7 if you are in 7 because of the opps @s spots|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they may play automatic cues below game|pg||
nt|andyv:  or 4@h merely xfers back to @s|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: true andy|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you could bid 2@H and then 3@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzvc: West happy East didn't get doubled in 2@S|pg||
nt|djneill:  bold 1@s vulnerable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15, 0+@D  1@S usually less than game force|pg||
nt|mcphee: kinda forced if 1@D can be 0 cards|pg||
nt|andyv:  if it's a cue, then it should not be alerted|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you guys may be right, but in that case 4@S would be a subsitute cue bid of hearts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in true alice in wonderland style|pg||
nt|andyv:  anyway, S is thinking and judging from how long it took N to bid, I have to think 4@h was a cue|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  game force , but wich one ? |pg||
nt|gsper:  We will never know|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i would be terrified to double with west hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i made comment about Verhees NOT holding 4@H because they play Raptor NT overcalls, so  (1@S)-1N would show 4@H & 5+@C/@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW play Raptor NT overcalls   so 1N here would show 4@H and 5+@C/@D|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: this could be a  Slawinski spot card lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i need a cheat sheet to even try to explain|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, but there is sonme slight consolation in that you are not doubling them into game|pg||
nt|gsper:  You are not alone|pg||
nt|marlowepi: still there could be overtricks, or a XX with nowhere to go.|pg||
nt|mcphee: this will be a cold bath I afraid|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  This one shouldn't take quite so long to play ... maybe only 10 minutes rather than 15|pg||
pc|h3|nt|fabsayc: ok makes sense|pg||
nt|fabsayc: down 4 with best defense|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i've had some good results playing raptor -- but always felt uncomfortable having to use DBL to include a normal strong NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems strange to win @CA and THEN think -- when i've done that it usually means i shouldn't have won the trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  3  4@H made for a push|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well 1@D is opened with  4@D & 5+@S   so weak hand with preference for @S bids  but if you reverse @S & @H maybe not|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  18  [3@CS=]   Paulissen playing 3@S East|pg||
nt|riccho:  @dA and a @c anyone? |pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphzvc: it's on their CC http://www.bridge.nl/groepen/Wedstrijdzaken/1112/Lombard_Schollaardt&Wortel.pdf|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 180 on the way?|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  4  Ton Bakkeren stops in 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 of the pairs on the winning Bermuda Bowl team play that  and a couple of pairs from Germany|pg||
nt|mcphee: whihc may make|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: ah   hi=odd without honor  or   even with honor|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3@D was likely to be down 1|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sybarra: wonder if Jansma had a 2-suited bid to make |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i suppose this 2N was game force so ok to include 4-fit|pg||
nt|ady: this should be quick|pg||
nt|aap00: :)|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|dkkello:  no problems for declarer now  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: so just a question of how many imps closer White House will be|pg||
nt|ahollan1: middle of hand  both pairs lead 2nd/4th|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|nt|ahollan1: it was highlighted so couldn't find it on my own :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: where Verhees 6@H-1|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so 1@c-1@H-6@S in effect|pg||
nt|andyv:  so a sane slam which was not reached in OR|pg||
nt|riccho:  strange @d10|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kiwibridge: big 3-suiters are hard to handle, as are weak ones, but another big plus here |pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|penseur9:  now the question is only how many overtricks|pg||
nt|jaapfr: will be a struggle to make this 2@H|pg||
nt|dkkello:  and 3 @H makes 8 or 9 now |pg||
nt|ady: now there will be a claim|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|psyck: trump promotion happened other room, ot here likely|pg||
pc|d4|nt|dkkello:  :)  |pg||
nt|dkkello:  Maybe Drijver even guess the @D J |pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|nt|jaapfr: hoi kjeld welcome|pg||
nt|bobholl: not quite sure of 9 tricks :) (after @H now) has to go for it|pg||
nt|bobholl: if @H now he has to go for @C 33|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: @c2 lead, so he knows @c break|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: assuming they lead 3rd/5th|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3@D could be made if double finesse|pg||
nt|bobholl: assumed that too but migth be 5 :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: in @D|pg||
nt|dkkello:  but it is not a speedball tournament today ... |pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: bertens doubled on 2@c for t/o of @h|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Hi Dennis , is there any timeproblems at this table?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|xenya: sharp contrast here -- bidding about as short as it could be and the other side declaring|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphzvc: West annoyed about the @DK|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c6|nt|gsper:  Shortening his trumps frantically|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why did he ruff with the 6?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: to confuse us|pg||
nt|gsper:  But E can overruff in the process|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with one natural trick|pg||
nt|gsper:  But E gets shortened too to avoid the endplay|pg||
nt|fabsayc: indeed in general you should overruff if possible to avoid any trump endplays|pg||
nt|gsper:  In the other rooms it seems W even doubled a 3@C opening|pg||
nt|gsper:  *room|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the difference between the actual 200 and the theoretically available 500 will probably be substantial here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: doubling 3C is different. although it does double opps into game, that opening also tells you that your partner probably has more HCP than anyone else at the table|pg||
nt|gsper:  Why not opener's partner with a misfit the strong one?|pg||
nt|kemperg: stuck?|pg||
nt|gsper:  OK, not in this case where S has passed|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it is 2:36 am here, if they dont speed up soon i will fall asleep|pg||
pc|c2|pg||

nt|vugraphzvc: Morning Geoffrey|pg||
nt|penseur9:  welcome to Geoffrey godd morning|pg||

nt|penseur9:  necessity makes the law :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  ok, 10 minutes is up ... play please|pg||

nt|ahollan1: oh sorry  they're in 3|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|psyck: I play muiderberg 2@h, but that hand looked closer to 1@h than 2@h to me :)|pg||

nt|mcphee: they might|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|sA|nt|fabsayc: unreal|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: similar, I can stand 1@H but not 2@S|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 19  Bertens did use DBL to show 4-major and 5+minor|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|nt|penseur9:  well done|pg||
nt|fabsayc: strange sequence of plays here|pg||
pc|hT|nt|bobholl: with huubke (bertens) at the table you never have time problems :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: bertens would never defend this way with spade queen|pg||
nt|kemperg: perhaps 2@D for majors and 2NT for @H/@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: j of clubs and pitch a spade |pg||
pc|d6|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|nt|rv: yes well played|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rv: N-S could make 12 tricks in @s|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|rv: they need to bid slam in the context of the match|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@H splinter|pg||
mb|4C!|mb|p|mb|4D!|mb|p|nt|petergill: Indeed, 980 here is a must for NS if they are to win|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@C cue (I think) 4@d cue bid|pg||
mb|4H!|mb|p|nt|rv: on 1@c-1@s, some play 3@d as variety of strong @s raise, 3@h likely to be splinter possibly lower range |pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|petergill: 4@H cue|pg||
nt|petergill: I expect South to bid onwards - not sure how|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: yes, South will surely bid on, possibly 5@d or just blast to 6@s since GS is very unlikely and tough to bid scientifically|pg||
nt|petergill: Direct approach gives EW less info on defence|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rv: South didn't bid 4n since he has void and it is normally not right to employ RKC with void|pg||
nt|petergill: Some work to do in the play|pg||
nt|petergill: Win @DA, @H to ace, @H ruff, then what? @D could be 6-1 after @D2 lead. |pg||
nt|rv: play does have interesting possibilities, tough to work out percentages for all options, any civilized line should work here though|pg||
nt|petergill: or play for @D 4-3 by cashing @d's (then cross ruff becomes easy and safe) - goes down only if @D 5-2 or 1-6|pg||
nt|rv: so far declarer doesn't take ruffing finesse in @hs, he should be fine as cards are|pg||
nt|petergill: Even if there's a @d ruff, might still survive|pg||
nt|petergill: To specs' suggestion: @H to jack is ridiculously double dummy - S cannot see 52 cards - what if @HK and @SK both offside?|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|rv: an interesting line, cash 3@ds, @HA and cross-ruff the hand|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|rv: now @s back best, declarer may need to commit in @hs|pg||
nt|petergill: EW lead 3rd and 5th|pg||
nt|petergill: I think @s play was to find out if @SK was onside = smooth duck of @SK by Tor Helness would not gain - I think|pg||
nt|rv: I don't think Zack took best line, I much prefer winning @DA and playing @HA and ruff a @h, keeps communications fluid|pg||
nt|petergill: Herbst is playing it|pg||
nt|rv: sry Herbst|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: NS have played well last set and this|pg||

nt|hedyg:  for results and standings: http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava12/slava12r.htm|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=@H & @S|pg||

mb|p|nt|twcho: Many ask what is rule of 15|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4N  long @D and tolerance for @C???  |pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: West said this 1 is undiscussed, but it looks liks long @D with 2(3)@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sounds right -- ace ask makes no sense    real @C length would bid 5@C|pg||
nt|ady: should come to 9 tricks   heart lead likely|pg||
nt|xenya: curiously, N opened in OR, yet EW bought contract -- here it was E who opened but N wound up declaring  |pg||
nt|xenya: last hand|pg||
nt|psyck: 10-13 value, 5D-4M/4+m unbalanced, or 6+D|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  3@D = 10-14, 5-5 in the majors|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Bad news - I reckon North is going to be declarer|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: Wortel preventing EW from having misunderstanding    4@H and 1@D makes bid look right, equal vul and @CQ  not so much|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course still a chance for EW to go wrong   [bid rather than DBL]|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: is this really Versace opening 1@C on that or is this a bad dream?|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: it is a guideline for the 4th seat player whether to open the hand|pg||
nt|twcho: HCP + no. of @s cards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D usually says  equal length\|pg||
nt|sybarra: smolen |pg||
nt|ahollan1: totally serious that it would make it interesting    0% serious that it was a bid that would be considered|pg||
nt|ahollan1: try 2@D?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the results link does not work, we will have to wait till official results posted, i believe|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|penseur9:  3nt made in OR on  19 for Lombard team|pg||
nt|jaapfr: simple 9 tricks despite bad @HKJT|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: 9 lead denies 10 and shows a honor|pg||
nt|ahollan1: pull because of vulnerability|pg||
nt|psyck: lol, 4333, i don't mind a pass even with AAK|pg||
nt|andyv:  after several exciting hands, we finally get a mundane 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: you can see explanation |pg||
nt|sybarra: Bertens never gets a decent trump break?? |pg||
nt|sybarra: jansma coming in now? |pg||
nt|kemperg: yes 4@S, 5+@H, gamef or stronger|pg||
nt|sybarra: at least only 4/1 this time  |pg||
nt|sybarra: does he have the entries for that Cornelia?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I do not think so |pg||
nt|kemperg: 4@H is minimum, so W wont try slam|pg||
nt|sybarra: Cornelia suggesting that if Bertens plays the Ace of @H, he could finess the 10 |pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if 2N just forcing or specifically showing ????|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's my guess and i'm sticking to it|pg||
nt|psyck: i also prefer the style where 1@s rebid shows 4+ @c|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|twcho: because @s is so vital in partial contract competition|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: with 3-2 we bid 2@D in Netherlands too|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now --  is east hand really a prototypical 3@C bid??    only the shadow knows|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hmm, 2nt as a forcing bid is interesting|pg||
nt|fabsayc: will win in hand and lead club king|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: if this sums up to >= 15, one can open|pg||
nt|twcho: if not, better pass|pg||
nt|penseur9:  that is 12 IMPs for...|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: to find 5-2 fit instead of 4-3 :)|pg||

nt|ady: e/w  after a penalty|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can't blame them|pg||
nt|ady: trump lead best |pg||
nt|psyck: 4@h meant as looking for @c cue with @s fit i guess|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|roswolf: hmm got there despite the systen!?:)|pg||
nt|penseur9:  if we remember that EW had a 10 IMp carry over, de Lombard team doing good here|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  19 [3@C-2]  Jansma playing 2@H West|pg||
nt|ady: east will be wary of a bad trump split on the bidding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but what can he do about it?|pg||
nt|mcphee: seems you can pick up trumps |pg||
nt|ady: impossible on the bidding for south to start with ace and another diamond|pg||
nt|mcphee: not sure that is worth it|pg||
nt|djneill:  what are the easy cases for East to imagine, if any|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might try @C9 to dummy then trump|pg||
nt|ady: I would back declarer to make this|pg||
nt|mcphee: i think so also David|pg||
nt|ahollan1: preemptor not leading @C/@D often suggests no singleton there -- so short trump|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but with solid suit   lead from sequence overrides that inference|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: declarer is asking what the signal of Norths hearts means, normally Lavinthal according to Van Prooijen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we have unfair advantage -- don't have to devise line of play assuming @C 4-2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: silly question -- what if it is singleton|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not impossible on the auction|pg||
nt|fabsayc: more overbidding but this time the contract at least has a play|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  seems that 2@S should go down here|pg||
nt|gsper:  N will agree with me that S did not have his double|pg||
nt|kemperg: he does with 15 to 15/14|pg||
nt|sybarra: too high now on a @D lead |pg||
nt|ady: 2NT   looks like being down    2 hearts better spot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if vanProoijen had rebid 2@H that would have been 5@H invite!|pg||
nt|ady: might make 2NT  if the clubs get entangles|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder why that wasn't his choice|pg||
nt|fabsayc: north should duck|pg||
mb|4N|nt|Vugraphzvc: Jansma already apologised|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Frank may be thinking about correcting to 3N|pg||
nt|ady: at least down 3 |pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: this will make thanks to 33 @d|pg||
nt|twcho: east has to determine whether her partner leads a singleton or from 765|pg||
nt|penseur9:  oops|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought that was a Kokish-ism   after opener shows 6-card major, 2N forcing|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  4@C is a cue, and shows maximum range (3NT would be "non-serious")|pg||
mb|5C!|nt|ahollan1: the reference to Lavinthal is   with singleton in dummy, 3rd hand card shows suit preference|pg||
nt|psyck: ruffing @h instead of ruffing fin like other room needed|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  4NT is (I think) even key-cards - TURBO|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  From here on,  I'm guessing|pg||
nt|aap00: Here NS also on the way to 6@s|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  The machinations of TURBO ... need someone more au fait with them|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzvc: Muller - de Wijs missed 4@s on bd 5, so now 14 imps difference|pg||
nt|gsper:  That lead makes it easier, of course|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe not but i dont think north had any extras after his 2@D bid|pg||
nt|psyck: unfortunately S tried to be scientific, many would have gone on after that aggresive overcall|pg||
nt|xenya: on this defence S will lose 2 trumps, 2 spades and a @D|pg||
nt|aap00: but will they make it?|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  This is a pretty complex setup for the bidding, because they are missing two key-cards, but one is opposite a void|pg||
nt|aap00: Declarer in OR played for @hK in W - it's with odds after @s are 31|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  One shudders to think how long this play will go for|pg||
nt|aap00: guess same will happen here|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  But, I guess, there is $US 12 grand at stake|pg||
mb|6S|nt|ady: I think maybe just 4 trump tricks|pg||
nt|psyck: wrong time to play the beer card|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzvc: from 109 combinations they lead the 10 and with 9xxx 2nd highest, so 9 promises a honor|pg||
nt|jaapfr: my simple statement was too soon (is more to the hand than i thought initially)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Frank didn't realise 2NT was artificial he said|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: similar problems with score last week at the NEC Cup, they need to get Australia involved their scoring package is 2nd to none|pg||
nt|xenya: providing W wins and plays another trump|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1:  20  Jansma did open 1N on the 4252 hand  Bertens playing 2@HX North|pg||
nt|mcphee: a frisky dble of 2@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in balancing hand  DBL from NT opener = max with doubleton in their suit   looks like perfect fit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after 5 comparisons  session score  2-0|pg||
nt|ady: if he ruffs 3rd heart now with 9@S   north does best to discard|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with south out of trump  might just play @C|pg||
nt|ady: from here much easier|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  for some reason i thought 2 rounds of trump played   actually it was @H ruff in dummy|pg||
nt|mcphee: E mostly concerned about 4/2@C I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@HX made   11 imps to the leaders|pg||
nt|psyck: i pass lots of bad quacky 4333 12 counts too|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: missed the usual 1 imp score due to that|pg||
nt|aap00: not 12, only 4 :)  |pg||
nt|aap00: 2nd prise is 8 |pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Oh yes, good point,  So only $4K ... they should hurry up then|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: well if 2 hearts would have been an invite    why not   instead of 2NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: his actual sequence was still invite but showing one or both 4-card major|pg||
nt|ady: ducking the club  stopped any defensive problems with the suit|pg||
nt|psyck: @s loser gone now, with Q dropping|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: good cash|pg||
nt|ahollan1: easy avoidance play to guarantee the contract|pg||
nt|psyck: oops|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: avoidance play -- finesse into East to protect the @CJ|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  East has no idea whether North had clubs, or was balanced|pg||
nt|aap00: this trick looks rather useless, is it?|pg||
nt|aap00: i mean trick, presented with @c A lead|pg||
nt|psyck: ruffing all the @c's is another way to make with the @ds cashing, but normal to go after @h i guess|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  So this might play quite well on a cross ruff|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sybarra: seems everything wrong sided here |pg||
nt|sybarra: but no way to know |pg||
nt|fabsayc: now he cant afford to duck|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmm  i think he needed to insert @H10|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: now what   @S or high @C?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the line in vegas       vanProoijen was bidding 5@D|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: duck and take 10 or fly ace to take 10   tough choice|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|kemperg: only doubledummy will work:(|pg||
pc|h7|nt|fabsayc: still if clubs were 2-2 was not hopeless|pg||
nt|psyck: putting to test early|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  To be honest, I was (pleasantly) surprised at the speed with which he took the trump finesse|pg||
nt|psyck: ineed :)|pg||
nt|psyck: indeed|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  But he makes up for it now|pg||
nt|henryb:  I don't understand taking the trump finesse at all|pg||
nt|aap00: @s finess gives about 75%, why not?|pg||
nt|henryb:  Basically, declarer here starts with 4 or 5 side tricks: @cK, @hA and at least two diamonds|pg||
nt|aap00: can't see better plan than try @s and @h|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  If the director needs a time monitor to determine who was slow ... we have 1407 people who can inform him|pg||
nt|henryb:  why not ruff, @hA, @h ruff, @dK @h ruff.|pg||
nt|aap00: playin X-ruff: even with @d 43 declarer is in dander being overruffed in @c with @s 8|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: now down 3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no 3rd round of trump ????|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1:  19  Paulissen in 5@D  as expected another swing for the leaders|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|gsper:  !!|pg||
nt|ady: could have mae  playing a spade when in the east hand with 10@D|pg||
nt|ady: saves 300 for n/s|pg||
nt|psyck: got the 1 rather|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: i wish i was awake enough to analyze @CJ/9 shift|pg||
nt|bebechira: Van Persie scored in the 2nd minute at the Emirates....as we are in the Netherlands may be some people interested lol|pg||
nt|ady: dont believe that|pg||
pc|d2|nt|penseur9:  he can claim now|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: EW both took a toilet break|pg||
nt|penseur9:  short break here at half way point|pg||
nt|dkkello:  well done Bertens |pg||
nt|jaapfr: E must bring no 9|pg||
nt|dkkello:  yes|pg||
nt|bobholl: i am a great fan off huubke he decides quick and mostly rigth :)|pg||
nt|ady: still will survive  though    |pg||
nt|fabsayc: he has misplayed this hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: should have won second heart in hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now he cant even use the spade pitch|pg||
nt|henryb:  The second @h ruff is with the @s10, so no overruff danger|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphzvc: EW discard odd=enc|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: South checked that when West played @Cq|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: @C4*|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in odd/even discards    odd says  "i like this suit"     even says "i don't like this suit, and shows suit preference by size of spot played"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on board 19 open room stopped sanely in 5@D|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|twcho: since there is only one entry to dummy, declarer has to hope for even break in both red suits to bring in her contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  21  Bertens in 1@D North  |pg||
nt|fabsayc: well it is going down, so no big deal guys|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sybarra: will that@D  play persuade dec to play for @h 4-1 ?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: in case it wasn't mentioned    20  where Wortel made overtrick in 5@SX    Bos was down 1 in 5@CX   so 2 12-imp pickups in a row for de Lombard|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: :)  ruff sluff  tough to find in NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hehe  Andy wants to play 2@H|pg||
nt|ady: favourable position of Q@H  mad life easier |pg||
nt|fabsayc: great minds occasionally comment alike :)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: i'm dizzy enough not have slept yet      did he really trade -3 for -4?|pg||
nt|ady: surely settle for 500   s smallish loss against making 3NT for e/w|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we know it was always down, but no reason to go down 2|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s7|pc|c4|pg||
nt|sybarra: appently it did |pg||
nt|bjacobs:  specs complaining that at this pace, their PC keeps dropping into screen saver mode!|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mcphee: well played hand|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s3|nt|ady: yes|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|aap00: @h return was a mistake, now playing for @d 43 is with odds|pg||
nt|aap00: Fantony also tested W for covering with @hK|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  All the little spades have survived ... this contract is gonna make|pg||
nt|aap00: now he will cash 2@d and play for X-ruff|pg||
nt|henryb:  When the @hK drops, declarer can afford to play @sA, @sJ|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ahollan1:  4 [3@HN=]  Westra 1N South|pg||

nt|petergill: Fascinating position for South again - now|pg||
nt|petergill: Should he play for singleton @S7? or doubleton?|pg||
nt|petergill: most likely, Pass of 2@H probably denied 3 spades|pg||
nt|rv: if he ducks,Helgemo should make it|pg||
nt|petergill: If @SA, then @d back also works |pg||

nt|petergill: 2 @D's will go on clubs|pg||
nt|petergill: and 3 @H's ending in dummy to run @S10 for finesse which is marked on the bidding|pg||
nt|rv: if Zack had ducked @cj would have been more interesting|pg||
nt|petergill: It's easy for us, looking at 52 cards. |pg||
nt|rv: would Helgemo still have got home if Zack had ducked? on the surface it looks like he still has to lose 3@ds and 1@s|pg||
nt|petergill: A Sydney player David Wiltshire followed the NEC Cup on BBO by making himself one player , unable to see the other hands. He reported back to me that even I, who try like crazy not ...|pg||

pc|d8|pg||
mc|10|nt|rv: I would have backed Helgemo to still make contract|pg||

nt|twcho: EW are ladies while NS are gentlemen|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: EW came back, discussing about the 5@C board board  6 that is|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so Verhees X only cost 2 imps   unless it helped Wortel make 5@S|pg||
nt|gsper:  I think E will apologise too|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Bertens apologising now :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes....thats why they are playing and we are mere commentators |pg||
nt|sybarra: Bertens "on fire"  as one spec said |pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Both apologised :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  5  Jansma has described his short @S opposite 1N opener  so they find 5@D|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Ton looking for coffee|pg||
nt|ahollan1: make mine a coke|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS system has 2@S as only weak 2 -- but it requires 6 card suit    but down a bunch, will vP slip @C into @S???|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if that was the actual play he made one|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe not|pg||
nt|psyck: and Zaleski continue to score in binary|pg||

mb|2D|nt|gsper:  My predictions are unusually accurate today:)|pg||
nt|kemperg: teammate of me agrees too:(|pg||
nt|hedyg:  results for the pairs tourney: http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava12t40/slava12t40r.htm|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  2@D = 10-13, 5+ @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  only 11 tricks here in @S due to king off side|pg||
nt|fabsayc: too early in the morning perhaps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S [in my opinion a lucky stop]  big pickup|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 1@D - X?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@D should be invite after redouble and 2s, to force would need to bid 3@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: oh  i said overtrick -- sorry  10@S on time|pg||
mb|2H|nt|roswolf: this might be dangerous for e/w|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was going to ask if east opens 1@S or 2@S   [the only weak 2 in the system]|pg||
nt|dkkello:  all 4 dammend good bridgeplayers , we danes envi you big time!|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: westra a big fan of responding light to partner's 1M-opening, especially at this vul|pg||
nt|gsper:  If kibs want response to chats, it is polite to have your full name in your profile|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N="almost forcing"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS need decent 12 to open 1@D with balanced hand|pg||
nt|xenya: 2N invitational with 4 @Hs?|pg||
nt|pelu:  5+ HCP and 4+@h|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks Peter|pg||
nt|psyck: 2N = 5-9 4crd raise, 7-9 3crd, or 8-11 with sing., may have 5+S|pg||
nt|psyck: my cc may be old though|pg||
nt|xenya: remember that 1@H by N promises 14 hcp|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|dkkello:  1 NT  ..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no transfers after DBL either -- that's a surprise to me|pg||
nt|ady: difficult re-bid   3@H   looks too high|pg||
nt|mcphee: oh|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: that is a hefty 1@H overcall :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: it looks as if the table with bauke(muller) will finish before the one with hubbke(bertens) incredible :)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  keep the flies away sometimes|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thats the 3rd sub-standrd opening now, quite frankly I am shocked|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe N will balance with an x if passed to him|pg||
nt|psyck: another good result for Monaco|pg||
mb|3S|nt|roswolf: e/w sensibly keeping their heads down|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s mustnt get carried away|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: NS might reach 4@S, guess West will dbl that|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup with relish|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is 4@C a cue bid andy and jordan for you|pg||
nt|psyck: wrong time to show trump q with 5 cards|pg||
nt|aap00: in OR S ducked @s opening lead playing for N has 2@s and @h A|pg||
nt|aap00: this was enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unfavorable,  ambivalent suit,  7222 [i.e. outside losers]    3@S still doesn't occur to me|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: 3NT looks lik an reasonable contract in EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tough choice vul at imps|pg||
nt|ady: even higher|pg||
nt|mcphee: i think 3@H a bad bid|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: no support doubles|pg||
nt|ady: 3 hearts should make  as south has only 1 entry to play diamonds threw the king|pg||
nt|riccho:  the most volatile choice here...|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, could get interesting|pg||
nt|xenya: nice game, duly reached in both rooms|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: good flying from brink drijver :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: but i think it's becoming common practice to respond light here|pg||
nt|dkkello:  not against theese guys however , the can smell a vul game |pg||
nt|dkkello:  or more!|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@D anyone ?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: jansma might have doubled 2@C if negative|pg||
nt|psyck: Deal 6 East hand: 14.75KnR, 30 Zar.  Deal 8 W hand: 11.7KnR, 24 Zar.  (26+ zar recommended to open)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 2@S strikes me as bold and has tempted north to go on|pg||
nt|sybarra: suggested by another spec:  If he knows that trumps never break for him it is easy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D10 prevents defense from taking 3 tricks in the suit without declarer's help|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@D did make    22-0 set for White House|pg||
nt|ady: has the look of 1 down|pg||
nt|psyck: S takes a safer option with poor @h's|pg||
nt|jcwla:  yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: y DD:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: given today's hand agree |pg||
nt|kemperg: 1N = @S and 1@S was max. 3 @Ss|pg||
nt|ady: well this has pushed to game  ?|pg||
nt|psyck: This one is 10.3KnR, 23 Zar.  they hear my comment about quacky 12 counts & wanted to prove me wrong|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  here the spade lead (if made) will be unambiguous|pg||
nt|psyck: even a passive trump lead can beat it|pg||
nt|psyck: debating @s lead or @ca manybe|pg||
pc|s7|nt|twcho: not everyone will open North hand|pg||
nt|twcho: 2@c is probably 2-way checkback|pg||
nt|roswolf: west asleep!?|pg||
nt|penseur9:  we're seing very agressive bidding here|pg||
nt|penseur9:  good stop here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you mean to pass 2@S?|pg||
nt|ady: 5@D a good contract to reach    a nice fight back|pg||
nt|ady: might make on a cross ruff    will need to ruff 3rd club with 8@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  6 [4@SN=]   Paulissen in 4@HX   that should be another pickup for trailing team|pg||
pc|s6|nt|twcho: forcing his partner to bid 2@d|pg||
nt|twcho: and then 2@h is an invitaional bid showing at least 54 M|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: NS are still juniors, what do you expect :)|pg||
nt|ady: spade lead best to try and remove entry to 4th club   but 8@H is an entry|pg||
nt|psyck: *4333|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: wonder why Zar never caught on lol, too complicated, KnR?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|roswolf: indeed with age comes caution because only juniors and madmen know no fear:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: helps to play some form of Bart or Gazilli|pg||
nt|psyck: is is very easy to calculate zar at the table|pg||
nt|psyck: but is is just another tool, has its pros & cons|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@h -1 at best...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the multi hand gained another 9 imps|pg||
nt|xenya: i stand corrected -- it can be 12 hcp if 5-4 in the majors|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice @D10 in East hand    for 4@H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: for most of us 2@D would promise a rebid|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'm told 2@D=both majors, X would be only one (rather strange)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: 3 swings this set   all double digit|pg||
nt|penseur9:  we have big swingers :0|pg||
nt|ahollan1: expect @H10 to show @D preference?|pg||
nt|penseur9:  :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: if you see ew only and know N opened you want to be in 6@D|pg||
nt|mcphee: i think this is even worse than 3@H:)|pg||
nt|riccho:  not 1 imp but an exciting 2 imp score here? |pg||
pc|s5|nt|twcho: of course, north decline his partner's hearty invitation. :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think the tone of the set proves that @D won't run|pg||
nt|gsper:  Instructions for voice commentary: http://webutil.bridgebase.com/v2/news_fetch.php?id=743|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6 requires a revoke|pg||
pc|h4|nt|penseur9:  with the 4@H preempt, declairer knows that trumps are mostly in East|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H2?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H @H makes for interesting hand too|pg||
nt|kemperg: both majors spec tells|pg||
nt|ady: might try for trumps 3-2  which is 8 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and helps show why van Prooijen didn't open a non-systemic 'state of match' 2@S |pg||
nt|ahollan1: isn't @C ruff with @S8   8 tricks?|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|h6|nt|penseur9:  :)|pg||
nt|penseur9:  untill N finds the @s king he may think they missed slam|pg||
nt|ady: well we can see J9 spades with east|pg||
nt|psyck: or 5|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: what is right    2@H  a little conservative|pg||
nt|psyck: if it makes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: making 4 is a lot|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: right  north just guessing|pg||
nt|mcphee: however exact methods are not known to us|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Jean and Gad|pg||
nt|baldjean: Hello all|pg||
nt|viren169: Hello all|pg||
nt|viren169: Come in on an interesting hand...|pg||
nt|baldjean: Unfortunate crowding of hcp in @s here|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like 1-off whatever East does|pg||
nt|viren169: from here...|pg||
nt|psyck: yeah, declarers tried for his only chance of a @c duck|pg||
nt|psyck: @s6 was discouraging (o/e discards)|pg||
nt|viren169: I'm not a great fan of o/e discards|pg||
nt|psyck: any particular reason? i've rarely used them & don't know the pros & cons|pg||
nt|viren169: simple std or better still udca is much better... |pg||
nt|viren169: I never have the correct odd/even card that I can play for the signal I want to give|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D also down 3  so Verhees bidding 1@S with junk  equates to push|pg||
nt|mcphee: 3@H for me shows a trick taking suit, one where you do not have to give up the elad 3 times:)|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  North sadistically waits|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  and correctly so ... his minor suit tricks are not going anywhere|pg||
pc|hA|nt|twcho: this is not a nice dummy for declarer|pg||
nt|penseur9:  very hard to guess how declarer will handle this hand here|pg||
nt|roswolf: well he is going off -probably a few|pg||
nt|penseur9:  @D ruff ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes K and anor seems best|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer is fortunate that the @HJ falls|pg||
pc|d2|nt|penseur9:  now wat a relief it is :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: and she knows, as Jans girlfriend:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  wife - just married!|pg||
nt|psyck: for kibs who ask, Zar Count=Number of high card points + length of two longest suits + number of controls (A=2, K=1) + (length of longest suit minus length of shortest suit)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: there are good 11 counts and there are flat poop with 2XAces and 1 King, it doesnt need Zar to work out if one is worth opening|pg||
nt|psyck: some use just the 1st 2 factors as a rule of 20|pg||
nt|psyck: Zar requires 26+ to open|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I just use common sense|pg||
nt|psyck: there are also some corrections like adding 1 zar for 4+ @s suit|pg||
nt|psyck: you can download a 4 in 1 opening bid evaluator here: http://tedmuller.us/Bridge/Software.htm|pg||
nt|psyck: the help section in that software will explain the reasonings behing each of the evaluatiors|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: or you can use your eyes :)|pg||
nt|psyck: but you always have to fall back on your experience & judgement, e.g. zar may not factor in values in short suits instead of long ones...|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how close is 4@H for NS?|pg||
nt|sybarra: congrats to them@H@H |pg||
nt|ady: heaty seems best|pg||
pc|h2|nt|penseur9:  @C now ???|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 22  final contract 4@HX|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ady: now ruff and trump|pg||
nt|ady: dont think it is right to re-bid 3NT to show 6 hearts and 3 spades  with that strength|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: @HA  then @HK shows @D|pg||
nt|ady: nice position though if south has 1 big diamond  queen or jack to give a guess what the play is from?|pg||
nt|mcphee: rather than be pushy with a poor suit if you make the 2@H rebid you are well placed if partner bids again|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|penseur9:  4@Sx makes for headaches for declarer and commentators alike :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|psyck: normal to go down here, only the previledged in the gallary like us can read the cards :)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mcphee: if they pass 2@H most days you will be a happy camper|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|penseur9:  should have played low|pg||
nt|aap00: FN don't open at 2nd level with 5422|pg||
nt|aap00: so, here @s for singl for sure|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, that is 1n for them|pg||
nt|psyck: unless majors|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|viren169: here they play o/e on 1st dicard and udca otherwise (thks specs)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|psyck: @c spots good enough to make|pg||

mb|5C|nt|petergill: How many clubs should North bid? 2, 3 , 4 or 5?|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|rv: I am getting old, 4@c for me|pg||
nt|petergill: Yaniv Zack make the bid that I think Joel Wooldridge (recent ex-youth player, came 2nd in Bermuda Bowl) would make. |pg||
nt|rv: at these colors, I wouldn't consider 5@c|pg||
nt|petergill: I too am so old that I would be restrained. |pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: but most of the players who appear in Grand Finals of major events all bid a lot ... so I might be out-of-it|pg||

nt|ahollan1: can we replay that with a 2@S opener??|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3x yes so must been unbeatable:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: jaap you were rigth about DD i forgot the @D T|pg||
nt|penseur9:  10 IMPs diff with 9 boards to score|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Sorry play sped up there I may have missed something/ got something wrong|pg||
nt|gsper:  You can not have missed anything very interesting|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=10-15 HCP, 4+@S  if 2-suit then 2nd suit is LONGER|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S rebid without those toys is wide range|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final board of the set|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think is more a matter of weak two bids are weaker in Europe than NA, so south can be quite light for 1 and 2 spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's nice score for NS|pg||
nt|mcphee: that will lose a few imps I think|pg||
nt|psyck: yeah, they should stop making those questionable openings :)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ady: should be able to get to 6 clubs  with wests great hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS play Ghestem|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  looking at wrong card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: michaels|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what am i saying??   28 is last of the set|pg||

mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: =4+@S, 10-15 HCP  a) 5@S(332)  b) canape, 4+@S & longer any  c) 6+@S no biddable 4other   NOT 5@S & 5@H|pg||

nt|fabsayc: bergen raise, or is it bergeno in italy :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: great hand for the system!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=0-7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does south reopen with DBL?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sunday afternnon so we are all so peacefull:)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  sunday morning IMHO|pg||
nt|bobholl: no alert for 4@S ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S = 1-suited, 6+suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6 more imps    only 35 imps behind now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=3-fit Drury  [2@D=4-fit]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 18+ bal|pg||
nt|mcphee: I didn't think he was light at all|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: well   vP also had to decide to treat the hand as opener rather than preempt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh right   east gets to bid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the first place team in each group plays 2nd in other group|pg||
nt|aap00: y|pg||
nt|aap00: 5@c-5@d here?|pg||
nt|psyck: yes looks reasonable|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  plausible|pg||
nt|psyck: @h ruff would beat 5@d too|pg||
nt|aap00: W probably is thinking how to introduce @s for play|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Double here is the sort of bid my partner makes when he wants to see me squirm|pg||
mb|5D|nt|penseur9:  5@D seems to make EW but can it be bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't know about 4@H :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: possible  slam try in @C???|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would be kool if 4@H is RKC|pg||
nt|ady: 6 diamonds a good save  800 if 6 clubs is bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does anyone know if screens in use?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 03:10 where i'm trying to stay awake|pg||
nt|ahollan1: short suit game try???|pg||
nt|fabsayc: winners take home 12000 dollars|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzvc: West before he sees dummy: down 2|pg||
nt|xenya: S is maximum for the 1N opening|pg||
nt|psyck: wide ranging weak nt, x showing values likely|pg||
nt|reisig: You play w the same partners as me :) :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzvc: Yup screens|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i assume so    seems operator is waiting to display bids until after both screenmates bid|pg||
nt|kemperg: dbl might give the save|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@D not a RKC response    looks like cue showing 1st/2nd round control|pg||
nt|ady: as pointed out 6NT can make by east    so n/s would need to go to the 7 level for 1100  for a save|pg||
nt|baldjean: 3nt should work well here|pg||
nt|aap00: double is not good with W hand - he doesn't want to play 4@cX|pg||
nt|psyck: hmm i'd have expected a stronger bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: the nebulous 1@d deprive NS from competing|pg||
nt|aap00: may be 4@s is correct|pg||
pc|sK|nt|roswolf: well this could be manna to n/s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it might be hard to believe, but 1st 3 boards of the set actually were contracts that MADE|pg||
nt|penseur9:  quite unusual wasn't it? :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might be blasphemy,    is west hand automatic 2@S bid opposite passed hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: they do not always alert all bids that need to be alerted|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no problem for me, i am on Marshall Islands time|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Verhees did NOT have weak 2@H bid available|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but he could have responded 2@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for EW  2@S is the only weak 2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C/@D/@H are all intermediate hands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S = 8-11  3-places to play   so 5431/4441, some 5440|pg||
nt|fabsayc: which should just about cover the vodka and hotel :)|pg||
nt|psyck: looks like a puppet stayman|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  I don't think Claudio is gonna find the @HA lead|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: if 5431 then yes   but here with wasted round jacks, i'm not so sure|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @CA lead destrys all hope of N here|pg||
nt|dkkello:  it is on the lead  and some more |pg||
nt|psyck: could be a 3rd push in a row if -1|pg||
pc|s8|nt|xenya: looks more like -2 to me|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|twcho: 5@d is a cheap sacrifice|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S rebid is invitational|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i know i'd bid at the table, but not sure it is right|pg||
nt|ady: would you believe that     why save|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tough to show those solid 8-baggers :(|pg||
nt|kemperg: no save needed:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Verhees obviously expected better trump with 3@S|pg||
nt|ady: well surely even if the spades are solid   6 clubs will be a certainty|pg||
nt|ady: east could have had AQJXXX   and stil there can be a 5-1 split    cant be better than playing a solid  8 card suit?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i've checked   after 2@S Michaels  they use both cue bids to show @S raises|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so DBL starts all good hands with 4th suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but  agree with voices from above   why not just Ask Aces|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since there are 2 ways to set @S then I think immediate 4N should be Standard Blackwood [not Keycard]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i shouldn't use term "2 cues"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they use 2N and 3@H to show different strength 4+@S raises|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so now i'm confused about why not 3@C -- still looking to see if i've made note about it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Verhees bids RELAYS|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C = 1@C|pg||
nt|ady: solid 4@S for n/s|pg||
nt|fabsayc: an excellent save here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: keep in mind monaco needs only to avoid a blitz to qualify for playoffs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava12/slava12r.htm for standings after 2 rounds|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, black suit normal|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: @D preempts  would also get votes|pg||
nt|bobholl: it is agressive anyway but mostly on the 3@D bid :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Verhees apologising, saying 6NT may be the top spot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: also checking the draft of book  "the art of bidding solid 8 card suits"|pg||
nt|ady: amazing  clubs never mentioned once  with AKQJXXXX|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or semi-solid 9-baggers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so in Ultimate Canape  you either open 3@H or PASS with what others open 2@H or multi 2@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=3@H|pg||
nt|psyck: i suppose declarer could have 4@s in this seq|pg||
nt|viren169: 3@S suggests 4-hearts|pg||
nt|viren169: spade lead looks normal unless there is some confusion who has spades|pg||
nt|viren169: anyway @C is a good lead for defence|pg||
nt|psyck: if 3@d just denied 5 card maj & does not necesarily promise a 4 card maj either, dec could still have 4 card @s, hence the non @s lead i guess|pg||
nt|baldjean: short lunch rbeak here. I will be back asap|pg||
pc|dT|nt|jaapfr: y N feels he has a beauty|pg||
nt|fabsayc: al, what is a 2h opening in VV system|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe puppet to 2N to then show long suit try in @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: regardless of meaning   they got there|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and layout very declarer friendly|pg||
nt|ady: nice red suit splits    |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|kiwibridge: even after 4 @S tricks they can't help but make :)|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|twcho: but they don't have any chance to find it|pg||
nt|roswolf: east's lack of defence will be a deterrenr for future adventures!?|pg||
nt|kemperg: undo|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D completes exact shape|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Martin  the responses change a bit for passed hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i have no life :(|pg||
nt|psyck: Versace decision to open 1NT fetches about 7 imps of so|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: auction says nothing about vP's @H length|pg||
nt|penseur9:  might make 4 here|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: West hoped East could bid 3N over 3@S :)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  the 10 of @D an importent card once again |pg||
pc|d4|nt|roswolf: declarer should get the guesses right|pg||
nt|roswolf: or at least 1 of them|pg||
nt|penseur9:  pretty difficult decision to finesse here|pg||
nt|roswolf: not much else for west's double than Qxx(X) IN @h +@c|pg||
nt|penseur9:  right, no entry to is hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might think Verhees short in @C rather than @D   but can't make in that case|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: South asked about possible shapes in East, not sure what the questions were, answers were 1@D and 1@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: that makes more sense |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 10-15 hcp  5+@H 4+@C     2@D = @H & @D|pg||
nt|psyck: lot of work to do, but with @d33 & @ha well placed, will likely make|pg||
nt|viren169: East has denied 4-spades by bidding 3@S|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ady: leaders pulling away again|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NONE of the Bermuda Bowl partnerships is known for timidity :)|pg||
nt|gsper:  With the @C9 falling this makes, rather surprisingly|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at the practical level, 2D by S might have fetched a making 3N by N. E might well lead spade honor against that auction|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or a heart|pg||
nt|psyck: E showed 4@h & W denied 4...@s is ambiguous as we do not know their methods|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: 3@S forced 3N|pg||
nt|riccho:  If W has a systemic 2c opening, E had to do sth more than pass|pg||
nt|viren169: @d to the T will solve all declarer's problem at some stage|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ady: 28-0 so far this set for Het Witte and boards 8 and 9 dont look bad for them|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bobholl: small @D ducked and it can be made|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|penseur9:  will go down now|pg||
nt|roswolf: now declarer is in danger|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room playing  10 in 4@SX|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: @SK @D away, @H still works?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: now 4@S mild slam try in @S|pg||
nt|ady: 20 bids to get to 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: amateurs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: van Prooijen showed 5341 with bad spades|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: and 9-11|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i kibitzed Burgess-Marston  they ran BOTH opponents out of PASS cards before reaching 3N|pg||
nt|ady: 1 for the 5th spade|pg||
nt|aap00: however - 12 imps back |pg||
nt|aap00: but the gap is too big anyway...|pg||
nt|henryb:  Or even 13|pg||
pc|s2|nt|penseur9:  I could be wrong :)|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how loud were the gasps when dummy came down?|pg||
nt|ady: a bigger lead for Onstein after this|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that is result of using 1-level canape openings|pg||
nt|fabsayc: notice these strange meanings are forced to allow consistency in canape structure|pg||
nt|psyck: tough to get 40 in the 6 more comparisions to come|pg||
nt|aap00: yes, 13  )|pg||
pc|h6|nt|viren169: have fillers in the majors to stop defence taking too many tricks to defeat this contract|pg||
nt|psyck: a @c after @hq may have created more problems, cutting off declarers communication|pg||
pc|h9|nt|roswolf: declarer may however muddle it|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  8  [the very bizarre 2@SX-2]  Paulissen 3N East|pg||
nt|ady: another 3 or 4|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: but look at the score|pg||

nt|fabsayc: i am told 3@D game unspecified singleton, but in that case i dont understand versace double of 5@H|pg||

nt|psyck: tough hand...to play or defend at the table|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: at least the play will be speedy|pg||

nt|petergill: my guess: West thought North must have very good clubs to bid 5@C vulnerable, so West thought it was like a 30 point deck if North has the high clubs ...|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|rv: Zack's 3@d looks like both minors GF|pg||
nt|petergill: bd 26: change @HQ to @HA ---> then West guessed right - Zack did well to make EW guess|pg||
nt|rv: it possibly shows longer @ds|pg||
mb|3H|mb|d|mb|p|nt|petergill: Zack and Herbst are not a regular partnership (to the best of my knowledge) - Zack played with Michael Barel and Herbst with his brother when Israel came 2nd in the latest European ...|pg||
nt|petergill: Championships and 5th in the 2011 Bermuda Bowl|pg||

pc|cK|pg||
nt|rv: not best start to defense though, after @CA and pd's discourage, @dA and back was best|pg||
nt|petergill: I think tor Helness would not have risked 3@H if he did not have @DH9 - he wanted to get partner off to the best lead|pg||

nt|penseur9:  Hi Al|pg||
nt|penseur9:  de Lombard made another 11 IMPs on  23... only 3 IMPs diff now|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: players discussing how many 5@h or 5@c would have been off|pg||
nt|gsper:  That was nonsense by me, but it still made|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Verhees saying he thinks 6 poor @S is not good enough to rebid 3@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Westra will open Verhees' hand with 2@D  = weak @H or various strong hands|pg||
nt|ady: that seems wrong|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no overtrick???|pg||
nt|mcphee: back 2 mins|pg||
mb|1H|nt|roswolf: @DQ was a BIG clue|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  8   v Lankveld  5@D west|pg||
nt|psyck: yes E could bid eventhough W is limited hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  5@S for sure NS |pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3nt or 4@H?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 18+ bal|pg||
nt|ady: maybe west just condeeded a club|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 22 was another 8 for leaders   [that was 4@S hand that took so long   the other table was 4@HX]|pg||
nt|ady: 5@C   6 if taking a peep at the diamond position|pg||
nt|psyck: South lead @h other room in that 3N, Ginossar did well not to here|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: what else?|pg||
nt|viren169: Moving on swiftly...|pg||
nt|xenya: he had to ruff a @D perhaps -- but playing for 3-3 @C doesn't look all that silly|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  F-N are going to have a fairly natural auction here, I expect|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: ns 2@H/@S openers are natural weak 2's    go figure|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: good lay for game in hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL = 5-7 hcp|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Nope ... they've gone for the 3-way 2@C response|pg||
nt|aap00: ... ending in 3n|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|ahollan1: wrong Al    westra 2@D is weak EITHER major or ...|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe took a conservative view as NV|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: make sure your partnership knows whether 4N or 5@C is asking for partner's minor|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: with strong leaping michaels they just bid 4m|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: they know :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: options include using 5m as saying  I have my own suit   or   using 4N/5@C to differentiate strength|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @C like the precision 2 @C  can have a 4 card major |pg||
nt|ady: trumps 2-2  and diamond finesse helps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and 100 honors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this interference probably helping EW   both in auction and in play|pg||
nt|andyv:  almost a classic dbl|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@d xfer to @h...probably a better raise than 2@h directly|pg||
nt|riccho:  Ew play some sort of polish club?!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: each match has two segments of 12 boards with about a 15 minute break|pg||
nt|viren169: 3N E/W here|pg||
nt|aap00: for 430|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  2@C = 10+, balanced or clubs or hearts|pg||
nt|aap00: 6@c is not a great contract|pg||
mb|3D|nt|penseur9:  I beleive to take with the ace and play trump is best line here|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, def did well to endplay dec instead of getting endplayed themselves|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  2NT = natural, 14+,vbalanced|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: 4@H i guess|pg||
nt|penseur9:  still may go down one though|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H = natural, forcing   not sure why it gets alert|pg||
nt|ahollan1: voices discussing 3@S bid on last hand|pg||
nt|ady: not sure where n/s were going    but now we know|pg||
nt|ady: surely south will not remove|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one twist is   1@S only promised 4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure, but it is possible that other bids/pass  show  canape/5332 shapes|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  9 [3@HW+1]    Jansma playing 2@S South|pg||
nt|ady: an easy 300 to 500|pg||
nt|ady: 3@H    some action|pg||
mb|4C|nt|vugraphzxn: the second segment will start in 10-20 minutes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@D is a sound heart raise|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we must forgive them for not paying attention, as there is nothing at stake in this match, zimmerman has qualified, vainkonis already eliminated|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: must be puppet stayman,   3@S=4@H, not 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if Wortel gave any thought to leading trump|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how close is North to making a stronger bid over 3@S?   other than 4@H  [which endplays partner] what else can he try without playing adjective bridge?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Westra hand got a lot better on this auction   but only because East bid 3@S|pg||
nt|ady: K@C   or Q@H lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @HQ for me|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|xenya: he had almost an opener opposite W's 2@C bid|pg||
nt|riccho:  kibs explains to me that 2@c was limited to 14 HCP. |pg||
nt|fabsayc: last night first hand had lots of dull flat boards, the second half lots of slams, i wish for that again|pg||
nt|fabsayc: direct 2@S over 2@D would be better hand for me|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@D multi so direct 2@S also could be conventional|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am just guessing :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: nevertheless, a very poor showing|pg||
nt|aap00: think it's chances below 50%|pg||
nt|aap00: here, @d lead defeats it in a moment|pg||
mb|4N|nt|ahollan1: who knows   @C lead could kill entry to partner's hand|pg||
nt|ady: east badly of whichever  lead king of clubs or queen of hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: remember when most common distributions were  5431 and 4432 ??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from what i've seen  all of the Bermuda Bowl winners make bids like this|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 4@C slam try in @H|pg||
nt|dkkello:  coffe hand ?  ( i am told no hand is a coffehand! )|pg||
nt|jaapfr: this one is with @S 4-3 and @H 3-2 and @DK ok:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H does NOT show @S length  it is 'normal'  1-suiter|pg||
nt|riccho:  Than it was W who did the mistake. The hand is certainly worth more than 14 HCP (Bd 34)|pg||
nt|aap00: or not?|pg||
nt|aap00: @d, 3 rounds of @s, discarding 2nd @d...|pg||
mb|5C|nt|dkkello:  The coffeshops in Netherland is also better than ours ;)  |pg||
nt|gsper:  Voice commentator suggests that N had not shown 4@H|pg||
nt|gsper:  *5@H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: safest line win spade ace, lead heart queen|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if he has not shown five hearts i dont like this method, more likely jansma took a view|pg||
nt|sybarra: so even this hand Bertens gets a 3/1 break |pg||
nt|sybarra: better than 4/0 |pg||
nt|sybarra: but I bet he is thinking about that option |pg||
nt|ahollan1: good defense, but declarer will prevail|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  21  [3@CW=]  Westra 2@H after opening 1N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in 4th seat|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: 4@h can be defeated it seems|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just guessing|pg||
nt|bobholl: boils down to the @C decision i guess|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  10  Frank Bakkeren  thinking over the Michaels bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  15-15 VPs|pg||
nt|viren169: Not so easy here either...|pg||
nt|psyck: @d pips just good enough with @s well placed|pg||
nt|viren169: Need to find the 9th trick...|pg||
nt|aap00: and cross-ruff... will it work?|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: what is the best strategy for N to bid his hand against strong @c?|pg||
nt|twcho: it is an interesting problem indeed|pg||
nt|ady: nice 1 suiter?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice in context of  favorable vul opposite passed partner :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: EW has missed their par contract of 3NT but N came to their rescue|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y before 5 losers so a dutch coffeeshop hand:)|pg||
nt|gsper:  They have a number of canape positions|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Jansma explained 3@D as showing 5-5 btw|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thanks operator, smooth job @H|pg||
pc|s4|nt|penseur9:  seems a resonnable stop here|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: North puts dummy down; to bad trumps|pg||
nt|bobholl: not necessary in 4@H :) |pg||
nt|kemperg: duck! @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: should Frank play for Ton to have underled @CA?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: honest   i typed that before he returned @C9|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well he needs a second club trick to have a chance, so pretty normal|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, that seems to work|pg||
nt|aap00: looks like declarer can take @h, @d, 3@s and 7 trumps...|pg||
nt|aap00: GiB says 12 tricks now :)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|penseur9:  should make now|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|twcho: I think east shd bid 3NT with regard to her sheer strength|pg||
nt|jaapfr: now @D creates a lot of pressure |pg||
nt|dkkello:  do you agree on the 2 @D bid?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4333333333333 for me ok to deny|pg||
nt|dkkello:  i agree it looks like a NT hand to me!  |pg||
nt|bobholl: don't even understand because 4@H stay 4@H without an hounour :)|pg||
nt|gsper:  Ty|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vP might have bid 3@S thinking that 3@H was a psych    so - rather than losing a chance to defend 4@H  worried about what he would do over 4@C-P-P|pg||
pc|h8|nt|vugraphzvc: South really took @C10 with the A|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ok 2 different views (half specs agree and other disagree as we do)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for those who started with duplicate    in the old days   holding 4 of top 5 trump got a bonus of 100 points, 5 of 5 got 150 for honors  [and all 4 aces in NT was 150]|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bobholl: but huubke needs swings :)|pg||
nt|ady: duck a spade  and if trumps 3-1   hope 3rd trump has the length in spades|pg||
pc|hA|nt|twcho: her 12 points + her partner's 16+ make 3NT a hot favorite to make|pg||
nt|riccho:  Aces are structurally undervalued in point-coint|pg||
nt|viren169: 9-8 of diamonds is gold dust|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|jaapfr: too much frustrated in the past with a 4333 and missing NT|pg||
nt|dkkello:  need right wiew in clubs and teammates will never notice what happend, my money goes on declarer here |pg||
pc|h3|nt|djneill:  North may pitch a @d, assuming needs South to have @dQ to set it, right?|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  23  11 to the trailing team|pg||
nt|psyck: yes Ekaterina was flawless|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2NT shows both majors i believe, french agreement|pg||
nt|viren169: Now 9 tricks|pg||
nt|aap00: however, GiB can finess @d, human - no|pg||
nt|psyck: 12 tricks on your line on @d lead too|pg||
nt|psyck: w/o any finesse :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: Frank Bakkeren jumps to 4N over Michaels|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: :) indeed|pg||
nt|riccho:  count |pg||
pc|c4|nt|twcho: while the opponent's bidding shows a likely chance of bad break|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|jaapfr: especially this one:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course he doesn't have to worry about canape -- but i don't think that should have factored in here either|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if 2@D was multi 2nt followed by 3@H is invite|pg||
pc|d5|nt|baldjean: sorry for the interruption|pg||
nt|viren169: np...|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final board is 28|pg||
nt|ady: on 23  with the 6 hearts and 3 spades  west chose to re-bid 2 hearts rather than 3NT   and gained 11 imps|pg||

nt|mcphee: we forgive you this one time|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no real life kibitzers in the room??|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: nope, not allowed|pg||
nt|mcphee: anyone a 3@H bidder as E?|pg||
nt|ady: reasonable|pg||
nt|mcphee: i suppose dble need not be 5/5  major tho|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: was that a transfer to NY :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: NT:)|pg||
nt|psyck: other room sacrificed in 5@h|pg||
mb|2H|nt|marlowepi: S ostensibly very strong for this sequence but presumably wishing to prevent EW finding viable save|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would be more worried about missinbg a slam than about that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm uncertain of auctions after the interference :(|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thanks Andy and martin, great operator and amazing specs @H|pg||
nt|andyv:  and ty specs for joining us and making this so much fun.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|twcho: need to drop the offside K, highly unlikely|pg||
nt|kemperg: on board 22 2 down in 3NT, big win for Onstein|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not this opening is very preemptive on partner, this is excellent 4@H game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Verhees could raise with something exceptional|pg||
nt|ady: will have to play on spades|pg||
nt|ady: I suppose could run 10@S   first round|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes NY here we come :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: last hand, thanks everybody|pg||
nt|viren169: Ouch...|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 2@D= ANY INVIE!?|pg||
nt|roswolf: invite|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry   2@D=ART INV  a) 3/4@S  b) NT  c) 3@H/@S & 6@C/@D|pg||
nt|penseur9:  good stop here|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@H jump probably does NOT set up forcing pass situation|pg||
nt|sybarra: that was that crazy hand "wrong sided" at both table |pg||
nt|ahollan1: voices from above make great point   why ONLY 2@H from east|pg||
mb|4S|nt|roswolf: ty al|pg||
nt|sybarra: has to find the 9th trick here |pg||
nt|sybarra: but hts are 3/3  so should not be difficult |pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to try a @H early,  that gets the club ace out of N hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry I mean a @C early |pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  will declarer guess the trump the right way?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: total performance of all 4 here very high imo|pg||
nt|dkkello:  agree |pg||
nt|fabsayc: this 3@D raise covers a lot of hand types, it seems|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Bergen style|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: last set almost half of the boards were double digit swings   here, the biggest exchange is 3 imps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S good bid -- took away Verhees Michaels call -- so vP limited info|pg||
nt|ady: dbl showes majors?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: at 04:36  i should copy/paste rather than try to remember :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh my     Ton bid over 6@C  so he really did think 4N was keycard|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final is 7@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: west's dbl  yes  @H & @S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a decent slam if no club lead|pg||
nt|psyck: that sums it up i guess|pg||
pc|c2|nt|penseur9:  :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but 5@H isn't exceptional|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H  not guaranteed    need correct diamond guess|pg||
nt|ady: certainly must defend 4@S|pg||
nt|viren169: strange lead |pg||
nt|psyck: yes @c looked normal|pg||
nt|baldjean: out of the frying pan into the fire|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like a normal @C lead|pg||
nt|psyck: 1 or 2 down now i guess|pg||
nt|psyck: thanks all|pg||
nt|viren169: East needs to switch to K of clubs to stop Declarer making 9/10 tricks|pg||
nt|viren169: West|pg||
pc|cK|nt|penseur9:  looks like +2 here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think will go down 1|pg||
nt|henryb:  perfectly avoidable if W is going to bid 3@s on that hand - I agree that 2@s was really enough|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: on  25  vLankveld overcalled 4@H immediately|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  9  [vP's 3@S opener]    Bos opened 1@S and Lankveld declaring 3N West|pg||
nt|penseur9:  we seam frozen here|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: no North thinking|pg||
nt|ady: unusual to be doubled in a solid 10 card fit   but should get 300|pg||
nt|mcphee: not always 5/5 though correct Al?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: sometimes even the world's best look just like us humans :) see you sson for the next set @H|pg||
nt|xenya: this might not be easy|pg||
nt|xenya: for the defence as well of course :)|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ady: run 10@S   soade to ace and diamond|pg||
nt|ady: spade|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no lengths given on CC  but vul|pg||
nt|viren169: Not easy for West but will probably find the K of clubs based on nothing else looks sensible!|pg||
nt|viren169: North did very well to pull 4@S to 4N|pg||
nt|baldjean: indeed, @h lead does not look promising|pg||
nt|psyck: 4@s would have been -2 ...|pg||
nt|viren169: He may go passive and exit a diamond|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ady: switch to stiff A@C    and low diamond best|pg||
nt|ahollan1: alert of PASS implies they play PASS/DBL Inversion here   where PASS says willing to defend  and DBL says "i'd like to bid more"|pg||
nt|ady: can get 500|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1:  9 [2@SN=]  Bertens opened 2@S [2-suiter] and was raised  that should mean yet another pickup for White House|pg||
pc|sA|nt|twcho: Is 6@s an odd on bid?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: about this hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: yes, she is.. |pg||
nt|penseur9:  ok tks :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my guess would be 55 highly probable|pg||
nt|fabsayc: time for spade lead|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|penseur9:  again a reminder that EW had a 10 IMP carry over so very thight play here |pg||
nt|riccho:  15 Imps or so if 4@s goes down; even 10 Imps if they let 4@s thru|pg||
nt|psyck: this on escaped -1 with @c not played|pg||
nt|baldjean: N will probably lead K@H now|pg||
nt|viren169: Declarer will be happy to escape for -200 here |pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: as you see   responder does NOT promise 3+fit|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: soon|pg||
nt|xenya: so why didn't E lead a @H? Perhaps because he has the ace?|pg||
nt|xenya: if so, @CK must be with W|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1:  25  Jansma playing 6@C|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mcphee: so E should have perhaps considered 3@H|pg||
nt|ady: thats why I am not a great believer in these defences to strong club   if you dont play the hand the auction reveals too mcuh|pg||
nt|mcphee: i am a major believer you get in their face|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on the flip side   you really don't like giving Relay pair a free run in the auction|pg||
nt|mcphee: conventions like Suction or crash dak are good against strong @C|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 3@D  limited splinter, 3@H asksm 4@D =@Hx not @C cue thx unox for that|pg||
nt|vugraphzxn: Next segment will start in 15 minutes|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  11.00 Moscow, 8.00 Paris, 7 am UK|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the other room on 9 west axed 4@S to gain 5 imps|pg||
nt|bobholl: berry zal (een beetje) verrast zijn als @H 4 1 zitten|pg||
pc|c7|nt|kemperg: wow|pg||
nt|sybarra: now will explore the red suits |pg||
nt|jbennet: west still have sort of guess.|pg||
nt|jbennet: play for klub king south??|pg||
nt|jbennet: or play for at least 1 red suit 3-3?|pg||
nt|kemperg: lots of options now|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: a) he thought 4N keycard   b) he thought 6@C asking 3rd round control|pg||
nt|ady: will not be good if 4 spades reached in OR    but better than 2 spades passed out|pg||
nt|ahollan1: suction is called something different in other parts of the world    i think much of europe calls it Kelsey [or maybe Yeslek]   can't recall name in New Zealand/Australia :(|pg||
nt|viren169: with a small chance of making if he can end play East!|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|sybarra: :( |pg||
nt|aap00: no chance |pg||
pc|c8|nt|kemperg: even discarding a @H wont matter|pg||
nt|psyck: the saftly play for 3 tricks was @c to a & easier to make here too|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bobholl: sry berry will be surprised (a bit) with @H 41|pg||
nt|dkkello:  he will come to 8 tricks now one way or another  |pg||
nt|sybarra: now all ok |pg||
nt|kemperg: claim|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@D was doubled  but Frank didn't give his brother a chance to bid 6N|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that explains a lot including the lead|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphzvc: brink smashing his @hJ on the table|pg||
nt|dkkello:  pitch spade  |pg||
nt|bobholl: didn't come to mind at first but it is a good idea|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i miss why he does not play @S7 in a split second?|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thanks again all, I am staggered by the score :(|pg||
nt|andyv:  quite a shock|pg||
nt|andyv:  good night all|pg||

nt|petergill: -1, 50|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: Patchman led @CA on 6@s slam on brd 24, made it lot easier for declarer|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|d5|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|nt|petergill: it is not the job of the BBO operator or us to question the outcome = regarding that last hand|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|pg||
nt|petergill: with its curious ending - the play sometimes is not exactly as we think it is|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|pc|c3|pc|c8|pg||
nt|petergill: The smooth duck of @DK was nice defence|pg||
nt|rv: Zack seems a trick short here|pg||
nt|rv: small @h now is best line as cards are|pg||
nt|petergill: @H5 exit to king maybe - what does East then do?|pg||
nt|rv: East's best defense is to win @HK and back a @d smoothly|pg||
nt|petergill: then @S7 to king but N does not seem to have the entries to apply pressure to East's discards|pg||
nt|rv: after Helgemo's earlier duck of @DK, Zack would not finesse |pg||
pc|c6|pc|h4|pc|c9|nt|petergill: I see - perhaps N can take black winners then throw East in|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|nt|petergill: playing for friendlier club layout - @CQ play was unlucky misguess|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c5|pg||
nt|rv: there seems to change of play in @cs, he is making now |pg||
nt|rv: Helgemo apparently shifted to @CT and not low @c after winning @DK|pg||
nt|petergill: I see, West played earlier for North to hold less than 4 clubs|pg||
nt|petergill: declarer might still have to guess spades or the ending|pg||
nt|petergill: @CT play explains @CQ play|pg||
nt|rv: I suspect Zack should get this ending right, he should figure out Helgemo has most of entries for not continuing pd's suit|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|nt|rv: Zack is thinking can be afford low @h now or just play @S to @SA, cash @DA check if @ds break, else play @s from dummy and guess|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h9|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||
nt|rv: well played|pg||
mc|9|nt|petergill: Yes |pg||

nt|twcho: I think a cautious pass will express his interest in slam too. Clearly forcing pass situation|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they also play 4@SX|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and both Bakkerens in other room |pg||
nt|ahollan1: another strong 1@C|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ahollan1: unimpressive defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: and south will double and north can then bid 5@s to show his genuine interest|pg||
nt|ahollan1: harder to make 3N here|pg||
nt|ady: 17 opposite 5     3NT|pg||
nt|ady: this may be a swing back to the leaders|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D 10-15, 0+@D  often [as here] weak NT|pg||
nt|xenya: well done|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|ahollan1: 1@C = 2+|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: south will definitely pass then|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 16+ unbal  18+bal|pg||
nt|dkkello:  but you were right with the calculator somehow! |pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: it was claimed for 2 down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 10-15, 0+@D  maybe @D and LONGER @S/@C, but as we saw with  26  NOT longer @H|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  1@S = 0-11, no major|pg||
mb|1N|nt|penseur9:  the 10 IMP carry over is the difference just now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=0-7|pg||
nt|sybarra: just the bid W wanted to hear |pg||
nt|fabsayc: it seems 4@H should make|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: and they can stay on the makeable level|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H is the exception -- it can have 5@S 5@H, 1-suit or  longer 2nd suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=7+ HCP, maybe longer @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: PASS = 0-4 or Penalty|pg||
nt|ady: defend  seems right|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: 2@S is also forcing|pg||
nt|jaapfr: mb dennis had another ending od the last cards:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: i think the cards were as i entered, but they didn't see the ending|pg||
nt|penseur9:  somebody could get in trouble her|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: sometimes 8 bal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as you see here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=INV, 2/3@H, usually not 3@S|pg||
nt|penseur9:  good stop|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 0-5 or penalty|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  a 7 IMP swing for O2 on board  11|pg||
nt|ahollan1: many big clubbers have a bid over 1@D-(X)- to show weak hand with BOTH minors   but our EW need 5+5+|pg||
nt|mcphee: if 2@D is natural 2@H looks odd|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: I didn't notice an alert from Ton Bakkeren, but he still bid 2@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: good lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: key point for partnership discussion    when you play against Big Clubbers where 1@D could be less than 3   are later @D bids natural or cue??|pg||
nt|xenya: lively auction all of a sudden|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: looks like a 2-way checkback sequence|pg||
nt|ahollan1: where 2@C Puppet to 2@D   then 2@H shows 5@H invite|pg||
nt|ady: 2 clubs  check back   2 diamonds  not 3 cards in hearts|pg||
nt|ady: sorry Al    |pg||
nt|ady: tht checkback   but apparantly not|pg||
nt|ahollan1: XYZ same after 1N rebid  but also applies after  first 3 bids are suits|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  there's a lot to the play here|pg||
nt|henryb:  suppose W wins the @d and shifts to a spade|pg||
nt|aap00: a lot of work for declarer...|pg||
nt|henryb:  is it possible to go down? I think so|pg||
pc|hT|nt|vugraphzvc: South put the @h2 on the table like it felt bad to lead it|pg||
nt|jaapfr: tx Dennis you were as great as operator as the very high level performance of the 4 players ty|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT looks poor contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i see down 2  any chance for down 3?|pg||
nt|mcphee: wow|pg||
pc|h9|nt|marlowepi: good in the sense of productive for the defense. pretty normal to lead a heart though|pg||
nt|ady: can only see 5 tricks|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT likely to make on the lay out|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S 3@H 2@D 1@C   oh  4th @H promotes 2nd trump trick|pg||
nt|aap00: yes...|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, @c shift other room helped|pg||
nt|henryb:  I am sure declarer wil lead a low @d at trick 2|pg||
nt|aap00: playing on @d looks natural, but probably will fail|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: when partner played @H6 he should have withdrawn the lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: EW both wondering if they could pass 3@H :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tomorrow  3 sets of 14 boards -- but sessions begin 30 minutes earlier than today|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@C made|pg||
nt|mcphee: the trian went off the rails here|pg||
nt|ady: lucky to escape the red card here|pg||
nt|mcphee: I'll say|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: EW teammates in the Bermuda Bowl   wiijs-muller  playing Tarzan Precision also open 1@H with 5@H and 5+@S  but not as part of canape - it helps their relay structure|pg||
nt|chmitty: new leader :)!!|pg||
nt|sybarra: and Berten again gets another "yukky" trump break |pg||
nt|fabsayc: note verhess can not have four spades and 5 diamonds (no 1@S opening)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3 to compare  12 imp difference|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d8|pg||
nt|penseur9:  this more about how many extra tricks here|pg||
nt|penseur9:  should not have any problem here since cards lye well for declarer|pg||
nt|ady: was missed in OR  so an opportunity for leaders to extend their advantage|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  heart to king?  diamond out?|pg||
nt|aap00: to make it decl had to play for 3@c and 2 in each other|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: or best line for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not fourth best?|pg||
nt|sybarra: "yukky"  is the technical term |pg||
nt|Gerben42:  4-2 is the most likely break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bertens likes his hand in context   @HQ, 5 card suit  ..|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jaapfr: tx specs Kjeld and Bob|pg||
nt|bobholl: tytoo|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and a new lunch leadr|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but in EW system   opener could be 4@D 5+@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so no reason to get spades wrong|pg||
nt|ady: maybe one more in end position|pg||
nt|xenya: this looks unbeatable|pg||
nt|henryb:  Gino knows declarer has 4 hearts, from the play at trick 1|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: develop a line of play WITHOUT looking at south's  doubleton @HKJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: knowing 2@D losers -- how to you cover the @S and trump losers|pg||
nt|penseur9:  how about @H finesse now?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i must hockey so bye|pg||
nt|ahollan1: odd/even discard|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lucky vP didn't play 7|pg||
nt|aap00: thk y, passive defense left declarer a trick short... back in control now|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  I guess it was natural for West to play on clubs ... declarer doesn't have to have 4 of them|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: example   how do you play if trump 41|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: the other semi final is afer 24 of 80 97-19 to 't Onstein 1 (Drijver-Brink, Muller de wijs)|pg||
nt|ady: double of this could have put Het Witte almost level|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: and maybe that is the difference between 2@S and 2N      |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@CXX  stalled after trick 3|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: good play of K rather than J|pg||
nt|penseur9:  I meant a @S finesse sorry :(|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|henryb:  I see no reason for West to panic at trick 3|pg||
nt|aap00: now @c, duck @h and wait for 9th trick|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Henry, against this pair, "panic" is the default mode|pg||
nt|aap00: me too: he knows that @d's are not good for declarer - looks like no reason to hurry|pg||
nt|henryb:  Indeed, several kibitzers have suggested that|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: that's the rest of the winning Bermuda Bowl team|pg||
nt|penseur9:  tks Gerbrand... quite a lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: so for the 3rd set of the day we will broadcast this match.. |pg||
pc|s8|nt|penseur9:  @C ???|pg||
nt|dkkello:  @H ?|pg||
nt|penseur9:  yes @H ruff best|pg||
nt|penseur9:  sorry missed that|pg||
nt|dkkello:  will give 8 tricks |pg||
pc|c8|nt|fabsayc: i meant that many would lead a spade|pg||
nt|ahollan1: confession time -- how many of you said this was a blowout after 4th set?|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|ady: will be around 44 up adfter this the leaders|pg||
nt|mcphee: i might have passed 1NT dble was W actually|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|nt|ady: anythin but a trump now   down 3|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: creates doubt about distribution|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i like Bertens moving over 2@H a lot more than Paulissen PASS|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1:  26  3N North but EW never bid|pg||
nt|ady: Jansma lost a heart in 6@C   and ran the whole club suit   and got the diamond right in the end game|pg||
nt|ady: yes I would have tht so|pg||
nt|ahollan1: played as voice commentators suggested|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  And now East is endplayed into starting the spades|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rv: yes it takes approx 7 hrs or so from Chennai to Mysore, alternately you can Cauvery express leaves Chennai at 9.30 PM and reaches early morning in Mysore|pg||
nt|xenya: time for coffee|pg||
pc|sK|nt|marlowepi: in my view -- perhaps skewed -- the consensus approach would be to hope that declarer has wasted cards in spades and  may have to guess the suit, and try to build tricks elsewhere. ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: leading a spade puts all the eggs in one basket, whereas if it is right for the defense to play spades  they rate to get another crack at that suit (though adnmittedly it might be ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: too late)|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|twcho: as the card lies, there is no making game contract for NS|pg||
nt|twcho: 4@h, 5@d and 3NT all go down|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: East tells to north it isn't going down..|pg||
nt|dkkello:  problems now |pg||
nt|penseur9:  in trouble now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other table on their final board|pg||

nt|roswolf: north can you find a green card|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: North asked about 3@D, and north was about to pass, but now east changed it, and North reconsidering|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: law followers bid 4@S|pg||

pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: nv  1N = 14.5-17    that's really what the CC says|pg||

nt|fabsayc: 3@D is a new one on me, is that a type?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=2-way Multi  a) weak 2@D  b) Strong   CC says front=FG  b) FG @C/@D  c) SF @H/@S  d) 22-23 BAL|pg||
nt|fabsayc: typo|pg||
nt|ady: if west can find a pass can get a few back|pg||
nt|ady: nice swing for the leaders|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: 3@D  assumes weak @D hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi al, so what is 3@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Pre-emptive if East has the weak 2 in diamonds|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to Germ writing with me |pg||

pc|h2|nt|twcho: 4@h seems makeable here|pg||
nt|roswolf: not the most inspired lead in the world|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i believe 3@D is supposed to be invitational|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D would have allowed EW to find @S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Last board of the set now, we will resume at 1:15 PM local (Paris time) which is 12:15 PM London|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  Last hand of the segment - thanks to our excellent operator Bas van Beijsterveldt, organisers Marc van Beijsterveldt en Ad Cosijn, and the Dutch Bridge Federation NBB|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they may survive this but playing 2@C multi way you pay a heavy price on the strong hands|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, then 3D makes a bit of sense, though if E has that handtype the "preempt" is unlikely to hurt NS much. this is a congenital disadvantage of 2-way "weak or strong" bids --  ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: until partner gets clarification he can't bid in a way that does justice to his hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Thanks Gerben :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and to Cornelia and Gerben on voice |pg||
pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: 1@S is 4 or 5@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@S is four or five spades|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ditto|pg||
pc|hK|nt|twcho: despite the bad break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: was 3@C showing @D or  a Relay?|pg||
nt|penseur9:  what's a semi-alert?|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|kemperg: and all kibs for their questions and comments|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: ok, i should have waited for Gerbrand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's when a partially pregnant ...|pg||
nt|penseur9:  while we wait, a quick reminder that the final will take place on February 4th and 5th... don't miss it|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: Ton thinking of bidding, but he knows partner probably has 4-4 in the Majors, so fit not very likely|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: bd 15 and 16 do not provide good hopes for Onstein 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: so they need to score some imps quickly|pg||
nt|penseur9:  2@S should make but a 2NT by NS probably down... so....|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx Bas....have a beer on me :)  always helps |pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Hahaha, good idea|pg||
pc|c2|nt|penseur9:  still much to do for 9 tricks here|pg||
nt|roswolf: invitational to suicide?|pg||
nt|penseur9:  :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at other table  Bakkeren brothers play 2@C/@D AND 2@H as multi|pg||
nt|ahollan1: played from other side  this still won't be a treat for declarer|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if you have two nearly identical suits (like north here) does anybody have a rule on which to lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS do play Smith Echoes vs NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Roland just announced that restart will be 15 minutes earlier than what is posted on BBO Schedule|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so top of the hour|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Thanks all - regretfully I will not be around for the last set|pg||
nt|ady: 26 hcp   stop in part score    last hand in game on nothing and 4-3 fit|pg||

nt|ady: 14 imps on 26    3NT down   |pg||
nt|ahollan1: what an incredible comeback|pg||
nt|mcphee: you were right on that one David, bidding over the @C helped|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh  i''m sorry  missed final score |pg||
nt|ady: 6 on last hand  swung it back|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Onstein pickup to win by 4|pg||
nt|ady: incredable finish|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry about the confusion :(|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: sorry|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: 4 hearts was doubled|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: on the second last board|pg||
nt|ady: on hand 26   3NT down 3    declarer had no information from defence bidding and misguessed 2nd heart to go down 3|pg||
nt|ady: bye all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: dank|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we'll try to stay open to confirm final score|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: My apologizes, I didn't notice Verhees doubled 4@h when EW had the misunderstanding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no worries Joris   i didn't want to go to sleep anyway|pg||
nt|ahollan1: where was this event played?     bridge club, hotel ???|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: okay, Onstein confirmed the double|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: nope, in Utrecht (the central location of the Dutch bridge federation)|pg||

nt|Vugraphzvc: bye all!|pg||

nt|sybarra: and thx specs,  great comments and questions   |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|penseur9:  ruffing @Cs may not provide an extra trick here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1st time i played after reading Larry Cohen's 1st book sure enough 2 boards against cohen-berkowitz    i followed the rules, went for 800 and got sympathy   but still a zero|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Bye all|pg||

nt|petergill: The problem on Bd 26 in this table was in part that East's Dbl of 5@c could be a hand with extras (hence 6CD), whereas at the other table Pass of 4@C clearly showed a poor opening|pg||
nt|rv: Peter, I believe Helness erred in doubling 5@c though I am not aware of their methods|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|pc|cK|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|hT|pg||
nt|rv: If my partner's doubles 5@c on that auction, I will bid slam with Helgemo's hand as well|pg||
nt|petergill: I think Zack should win @CQA not @CK, but either card is OK (certainly not @CQ)|pg||
nt|petergill: win @CA I mean|pg||
pc|d6|nt|rv: he needs to win this and cash @cs to escape for 1 down|pg||
nt|petergill: still on Bd 26: but if Helgemo is planning to pass out 5@c with an ordinary hand, isn't it reasonable for Helness to increase the (100 or 200) to (200 or 500)?|pg||

pc|c9|pc|c8|pc|h6|nt|petergill: Bd 26: another way of looking at it is that East dbls 5@C only if East thinks his side is being robbed by 5@C of a possible game - that's argues for Venky not for me |pg||

mb|2S!|nt|ahollan1:  26  Bos in 4@S  where vP made 3@S exactly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S showing @S was a fluke in this auction|pg||

mb|p|nt|jaapfr: tx dennis|pg||
