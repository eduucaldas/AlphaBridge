nt|petergill: previous hand: and with pard being a passed hand, he won't bid too much, you hope when you overcall 1@H|pg||
nt|beauch:  true - but recently played two top usa players - who bid on every hand:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some play Snapdragon DBL  where vP would have bid DBL to show the 4th suit AND tolerance for partner's overcalled suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: deep finness of @h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i believe   standard count in partner's suit   reverse count in declarer's|pg||

nt|petergill: Play of this 2@S has many options for both declarer and defence|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well   no problem because we see @SA in south|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  19 [4@H-1]   Isporski playing 4@C North|pg||
pc|s3|nt|fabsayc: trick one looks very wrong|pg||
nt|petergill: @D not easy to pick for declarer on this bidding|pg||
pc|sA|nt|fluffy: even with double fit and good lie of cards 3@h is doomed|pg||
nt|petergill: Well done in @D - South decided it's too risky for West to underlead @DA there|pg||
nt|beauch:  now declarer may get home|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @CQ onside is first bit of bad news|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: for what it is worth -- no guarantee that EW get to 4@S after 1@S opener|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: bd 19 is 3NT |pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: 3NT ?|pg||
nt|fluffy: Nakamura has to decide between 1NT and 3@c with normal methods first|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: i vote 1NT|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: maybe 1@d is there ?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: humm, off shape 1NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i shouldn't waffle|pg||
nt|beauch:  auction at other table was a little unusual- east overcalled 4@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh   that one :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in context of a Big Club system    jumps to 4 of partner's major are wide range|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: oh ! south trys!|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 3NT ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they can be the typical  preempt OR  an opening bid with no slam interest [typically 3-fit]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D relay  but unlike Precision  doesn't show ANY points|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=5+@S|pg||
mb|p|pc|dK|nt|eamongall: its about 2 years since I did vugraph so I don't remember exactly |pg||
nt|eamongall: how to change the score|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: but i also do|pg||
nt|ahollan1: rumor mill [web page not updated yet]   thru 7 of 12 rounds    china W2 134, Bulg A stars 131, ontaka 130, china Geely auto NEDUK down under 129 , Hackett 126 Stmatov 123|pg||
nt|petergill: Because their other openings are mostly 9-13, NS regard 14+ as "strong"|pg||
nt|petergill: North feeling uncomfortable, as 3@D might be a 4-2 fit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL was takeout|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S invite|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: certainly he had better chance than in other room|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if this is not good enough they need to revise system, considering east also had 2nt for minors|pg||
pc|d4|nt|fluffy: 1NT will make 3NT a make because east won't lead a diamond|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: same as OR. and plsy ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems rich with minimum 1@C opener and weak suits|pg||
nt|petergill: Best for N to pass, as 3@S would be doubled by W|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Newell PASS just denies ability to game force|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 3rd hand should open on good suit, i dare say. |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: so i may open 1@h.|pg||
nt|kemperg: why not 3@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  20  the ladies are in 2N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D implies desire to play in suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: here South has @C stop  and they tend not to lead @S after showing 4+|pg||
pc|dA|nt|beauch:  looks like 2 down?|pg||
nt|cc469: I think if you bid 2@C you have to be prepared to bid your 4 card @S suit if the opportunity arises ( which it did here)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so invite for most likely game   with 2N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can't jump with south hand when playing standard because the 1@H opener could have up to  20 hcp|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: @D lead looks normal  but  will be wrong|pg||
pc|d8|nt|kemperg: but only invite?|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: difficult contruct. to make and to defend|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: East can easily slow-in and end-played, nightmare|pg||
nt|xenya: one can sympathise with S. who wanted to show good cards in @C with the 2N bid -- still her hand is more suit=oriented|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|pole_as_ch: humm. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: for both of our pairs non 1@C openers have maximum of 15 hcp|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thru  21   Oz Players over Bulgarian All Stars by 5 imps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Stamatov is also a team of Bulgarians|pg||
pc|s3|nt|fluffy: the hand will make 11 tricks comfortable, but if you look in isolation the hand you would rather play 6@c than 3NT before the lead since clubs 2-2 mean 6@c makes and @c3-1 put 3NT ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: in danger|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kemperg: right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course easier to bid South hand when you have tools like Gazilli or Cole |pg||
nt|ahollan1: if I was North   i would have rebid 2@S instead of 2@D|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|h8|nt|pole_as_ch: c.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 8 or 9 trick.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: EW play GhN)estem  but that still uses  1M-(2N) as 2 lowest unbid|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: this bd now is 17imp swing. +10 or -7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and that is actually what Gold did|pg||

mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: BD 22, 3@h by NS in OR !|pg||

pc|h6|nt|beauch:  perhaps North should rebid 2@S?|pg||
nt|beauch:  not 1NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @C from East is no treat against 4@S|pg||
nt|kemperg: 2@S would be minors|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i found a convention card for South from 2009 Bermuda Bowl -- but different partner|pg||
nt|eamongall: EW play Carrot Club which is similar to Polish Club .. with 1@C opening being 10-12 balanced or 17+ anything |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: then 5@s ?  get down ??  looks like to make, but...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=game force relay|pg||

nt|ahollan1: but no pressure|pg||

mb|p|pc|s5|nt|pole_as_ch: 5@c is defensive call|pg||
nt|beauch:  yes so keep bidding the dogy vulnerable games |pg||
nt|marlowepi: N obviously double normal despite the dull shape. given more room to maneuver NS might find 5m, but in the present claustrophobic environment S made a practical choice|pg||
nt|gizzydrop: already played this board?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: 2N=weak nt, some 4333|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duck to keep declarer out of dummy|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: that pair had a way to show 2 suits after Strong 1@C - P - 1@D   but should that apply when this 1@C often 11-13 bal???|pg||

pc|s7|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: 2@S is the ONLY weak 2 played by EW    I actually thought that would be vanProoijen's opening bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but @S duck too tough|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s8|nt|pole_as_ch: funny, little short for 2@c i think !|pg||

nt|ahollan1: DBL of 5@H     when was last time you saw that bid GAIN|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1974|pg||

pc|d7|nt|beauch:  cu later|pg||
nt|petergill: Despite Mike Cornell's success with many partners, I think Newell and Reid have been New Zealand's premier pair for about 15 to 20 years. Before then, Newell and Blackstock had ...|pg||
nt|petergill: great success for a few years.  |pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@S rebid shows 6+@S|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Eddie Manfield wouldn't approve    "thinking of bidding 5 over 5?  DON'T   the 5 level belongs to the opponents"   was a BOLS Bridge Tip from Ed|pg||
nt|xenya: very true|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 24  2@D made  5 imps to Indonesia|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Gold opened the North hand|pg||
nt|kemperg: and more to come on this hand:(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS has found a @S fit - just a question of how high the bidding goes|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i'm told both Bulgarian Pairs are playing Precision|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the threatening defense was a heart lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's consistent with what i found for 2009 Bermuda Bowl|pg||
nt|fabsayc: should put in the 10 for extra dummy entry|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: no, @d ruff i lost. sry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course   sometimes the opponents bid 6 over 5 :)|pg||
nt|petergill: I don't like 6@h much. The assumption that partner has very short spades can be faulty, as on the actual hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and the Kings are defensive, not offensive|pg||
nt|petergill: Also, the partner of a fav vul prempter has to take into account that the fav vul prempt might make bidding a lot later very risky|pg||
nt|petergill: @DQ lead would be good for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: but now declarer can manage 11 tricks |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Dawei's hummar would strick the 7 ??|pg||
nt|petergill: Trump lead looks dangerous - opponents might have hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@H snatching defeat from the jaws of victory|pg||
nt|kemperg: who is to blame:(|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: Verhees could not overcall 1N   that would show  4@S and 5+@C/@D|pg||
pc|s2|nt|petergill: E thus finds the best lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure what S showed with his auction. on surface one would suspect just a lot of shape (since no cue over 4C), which would mean 6C was a bit of a punt, but very likely there are ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: minimum expectations and possibly other 4-level calls over 4C would have some specialized meanings that dont fit the hand|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: 14 board matches, but we started with  17    so don't leave after  28|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thinking about whether to play @D before @H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: By the way, we already have "rag" among bridge slang. Unimportant card. "My spade holding was the king and four rags"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he has to play a diamond eventually, so this does not justify thinking very long|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but how many  UMJOODOs?    Rod tells where that name came from  but i'd like to thank whoever decided to popularize Reverse Flannery|pg||

nt|ahollan1: how's that for useless trivia?|pg||

nt|brgpro: 7@dXX...hmmm|pg||
nt|marlowepi: NS were on their way to +100 there. double dummy S can pass of course for 200, but the danger in that course was not lost on S. still, partner is extremely unlikely not to have 3 ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: defensive tricks and the hearts are woeful, so there is certainly a case for pass. at MPs it would be clear to do so|pg||
nt|kemperg: On 9 also in 6@C|pg||
nt|kemperg: in OR|pg||
nt|gizzydrop: i think pass in down the middle of the fairway|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 11-13 bal or any 17+|pg||
nt|eamongall: was wondering about the new 2@D opening by Hanlon |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes had me enthralled|pg||
nt|eamongall: operator just said board is upside down so probably we will just see the result |pg||

nt|brgpro: both X and XX are funny i think...u dont gain much (maybe 1 imp) by Xing but mightta lose more|pg||

nt|marlowepi: side fairly small. meanwhile they might not make game for a variety of reasons.|pg||
mb|1D!|an|5+!S|nt|pole_as_ch: No game for NS|pg||
nt|petergill: these two teams were =4th, though obviously that is no longer the case|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the closed room, Gold showed 25+ balanced with his 2NT rebid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this bidding should help them get to slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: why?   3N - all pass very possible|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW have done great job taking away bidding space|pg||
nt|petergill: EW have pinpointed likely short spades in South, from North's point of view|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=INV, 6+@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  INV+|pg||
nt|brgpro: once W opens 1@d (11-15) i don't think they will be in grand |pg||

nt|ahollan1: on 24  [5@D-2]  Gold sold out to 4@H North|pg||
mb|d|nt|pole_as_ch: what side gain + score ?|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@C by South, and I think North, either slowly or quickly, will go all the way to 6@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lucky not to get 4@DI would say|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=good 11-14|pg||
nt|xenya: i might pass as S -- but Tueje has no fear|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'd expect pretty much this distribution of hcp  so PASS figures to lose a couple of imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=4518  Tom Hanlon, also a world class poker player|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=4519  Hugh McGann|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahhh  a picture of Hanlon|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@S is about as ugly a bid as imaginable, i treat 2@C as a cue bid on that auction|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: it looks like push.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh buyed 3@D, and....|pg||
nt|petergill: cf Bd 19 where at fav vul sometimes they break 4-4|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Great point by Martin, assuming EW spades 5-4 not 4-4|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: Lead of @s2 is showing 3 card, maybe. |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Ito should call this, he surely|pg||
nt|brgpro: E will pull this|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: i wager 2@H would get some votes in Master Solvers' Club|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: board upside-down|pg||
nt|gizzydrop: this looks like final contract, nowhere for north to go and some defence to 4@S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: these are very instructive hands for us, because all these ill-starred decisions could easily be triumphs on a different day|pg||
nt|gizzydrop: looks like a trump lead would have been best|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so failure of NS to DBL 5@D more costly than feared|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: He'll raise|pg||
nt|petergill: I expect and hope for 6@C now|pg||
nt|kemperg: not the first 26  pts hand in this tournament:|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Reid's problem is that Newell could be 1444 with no @CQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but does that hand rebid 5@C over 4@S?|pg||
nt|petergill: It's not so obvious to NS that the match has turned out badly so far - e.g. their 2@H making five (Bd 23?) might be a pickup from their point of view|pg||
nt|fabsayc: even then he has diamond hook, also 7 not impossible|pg||
pc|c3|nt|pole_as_ch: UG. ducking ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N should be delighted to pass. not simply endplayed into it|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H by South|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlucky choice of leads|pg||
pc|d8|nt|cc469: a dearth of entries to dummy|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: so  my guess of 3N-all pass was just a little off|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe that hand would bid 4NT, Al, choice of games|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very well done Martin Reid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right  so Newell 5@C does sound like 5+ suit|pg||
nt|petergill: also well done to Sartaj Hans not to bid 2@S at other table which might lead NS to 6@C|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks to everyone in Yokohama in Japan for today's broadcast. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: tomorrow  final 4 rounds of 14-board matches in the Qualifying Swiss.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: top 8 teams advance to Knockout|pg||
pc|d5|nt|pole_as_ch: humm.  can make by @s finess.|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: sry bd 24 & 25|pg||
nt|brgpro: that is a good call...4NT...he will get 2 KC answer...what would the KC be?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|nt|marlowepi: trump lead comes best from S hand, i think|pg||
pc|sA|nt|brgpro: what about 5@c on 3NT Al?|pg||
nt|brgpro: after he has shown 6+@s and preference for @d, that must be exclusion for @d|pg||
nt|ahollan1: have to confess   this is first time i've seen the auction where 2@H bidder had game force hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so i'm not sure about the rest of the bids|pg||
nt|brgpro: he will get the right answer but, then if pd has 2+@h and no @h control, he will also be in trouble|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but  Exclusion Keycard  .... very dangerous when partner has shown the suit|pg||
nt|brgpro: so 4@d was OK as long as he gets a @h cue and , he wasn't looking for a perfection 7 anyway, after all, his pd opened a limited 1@d|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: don't run away our last board is  30   [started with  17]|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N will be ready to play a heart honor when declarer leads one from dummy to his king or queen|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|nt|pole_as_ch: No damaged.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|eamongall: ah yes ..I remember .. 2@Ds includes a 4414 distribution |pg||
nt|kemperg: @C now will promote @S9|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now @C hook?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: EW 1N opening is 14-16  so  McGann rebid shows 17+|pg||
nt|ahollan1: declarer didn't start out thinking 4 @H tricks|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s6|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: bd 26 is 3NT by E !|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh! can reach to dummy and run @d !!|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: but if @cK comes then|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: surely Hans will lead it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We are adding voice commentary from the quarter-finals Friday and onwards -->|pg||
pc|hK|nt|pole_as_ch: Chen should make for -3 imps, sigh !|pg||
nt|brgpro: now he might make 7|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: taking the plus score|pg||
pc|h2|nt|brgpro: that makes no difference in imps anyway|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: am trying to understand ace of hearts|pg||
