mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|aap00: NS have near-game balance, but 10 tr in @c is their limit|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|mich-b: some "modern" players would respond 1@H with the South hand , though personally I like to be able to bid AKxx in front of xxxx|pg||
mb|p|nt|aap00: even @h Q lead is not enough to let 3n|pg||
nt|mich-b: North can bid 2@D now|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|mich-b: showing extras|pg||
nt|aap00: even 2nt can be defeated|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mich-b: That would allow them to play 2@D which is a better contract than 2NT|pg||
nt|aap00: if defence will play @h only after seeing dummy|pg||
nt|mich-b: It is important for partnerships to agree that 2@D here by North is strong and invitational , not just correcting|pg||

nt|Vugraphzvc: Hey all welcome back :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: 5@S is the par|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hoi Bas|pg||
nt|xenya: Link to results:  http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava12/slava12r.htm -- but it still only gives the semis  |pg||
mb|3D|nt|vugraphzvc: welcome back all|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: this is the 5th and final session of the semi-finals|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: both matches are very close, Witte Huis leading de Lombard by just 6 imps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi all|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: interesting 1st hand 2nd set, hi Martin|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi Gary, i would be tempted to blast to slam with versace hand, but perhaps 2@S first does no harm|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: No, 5@H is -3 on a @D ruff|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont believe this bid|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: seems odd unless a transfer :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphzvc: drijver is thinking very long|pg||

nt|ahollan1: both pairs  upside-down count & attitude|pg||

nt|fabsayc: apparently 3@H is some kind of artificial bid, 2@H showing spades|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: now GSF maybe it was|pg||
nt|psyck: 3n has chances|pg||
nt|xenya: not if E leads a small heart :)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|psyck: double dummy, dec can get 4@d, 2@s, 2@c & 1 @h now|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: Open Room starts with board 13 so we won't see their results but they'll have ours for comparison|pg||
nt|psyck: after all @hq is normal lead & as cards are dec has a stopper now|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: that or browser login gives access to Voice Commentary|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|twcho: And this is the last round of this event|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6@H probably shows king or ace (bidding by steps)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: wow|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 7@C has some extra chances, including counting the hand|pg||
nt|psyck: if he placed pd with a honor for the 2@h raise, low @h was possible|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: voice commentary available in both rooms|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzvc: convention card says nothing about Q lead from KQ|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Martin|pg||
nt|fabsayc: welcome Andy|pg||
nt|xenya: the situation looks desparate, so declarer may find the winning @D line|pg||
pc|h3|nt|penseur9:  5am here, O'll try to get up to speed shortly|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: you're up really early :)|pg||
nt|penseur9:  that was fast|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|penseur9:  with only 2 IMPs difference, every hand becomes very important|pg||

nt|ahollan1: latter also allows you to view multiple tables  [one per window]|pg||
nt|xenya: on the other hand, hi might play for a favourite break in the clubs|pg||
nt|xenya: Hxxx with W|pg||
nt|psyck: will play 1 @c anyway 1st|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, @CA first|pg||
nt|psyck: if @c honor falls, try to guess @c position, else fall back on @d'''|pg||
nt|xenya: when no honour appears, play for a miracle in @Ds |pg||
nt|xenya: is there a better chance?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: both pairs upside-down count & attitude   NS  odd/even discard|pg||
pc|c8|nt|penseur9:  yes, what won't I do for bridge :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi everyone|pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart ace lead might tip the spade position|pg||
nt|psyck: if he plays for either QJ both with W or doubleton with E, he does not need @s fin|pg||
nt|psyck: so, 1st decision now|pg||
nt|xenya: double (or is it triple) finesse in clubs is certainly an alternative|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mcphee: as we can see this one is going down|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a rather dull hand to start with|pg||
nt|psyck: 1st guess rite|pg||
nt|xenya: first hurdle overcome|pg||
nt|psyck: now with no @c dropping, has to go after @d|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like it|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bobholl: wd huub :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: the early @c discard made it easy to set up @c|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: but if Frank ducked the @cA it would be more difficult|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs upside-down count & attitude   EW odd/even discard|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the Open Room starts with Board 27  so we won't see comparisons -- but they will|pg||
nt|mcphee: might make via and end play|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am asked which way, well given lauria is declarer i will say right way for declarer|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the idea is no trump lead, but zia exposed the flaw of leading a trump versus 7 in his book|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: both pairs  upside-down count & attitude   EW odd/even discard|pg||
nt|psyck: i think there will be 3 round robin games followed by semi & finals|pg||
pc|d9|nt|penseur9:  declarer will probably decide to make it and run|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|twcho: now possibly 12 tricks|pg||
nt|gsper:  Hi, all|pg||
nt|mcphee: i always hate these postions, you know the @D hook is losing:(|pg||
nt|mcphee: even though E has tried to mislead declarer discarding 7@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you enjoy watching NS   after this event they jet off to Yokahama for the NEC Cup  http://www.jcbl.or.jp/home///tabid/223/default.aspx|pg||
nt|psyck: wd :)|pg||
nt|xenya: made|pg||
nt|psyck: gr8 board to start with|pg||
pc|c4|nt|vugraphzvc: the 10 Imps that are on the scoreboard are carry over from the round robin. |pg||
pc|c5|nt|aramesh_:  Welcome to Goran Sperber|pg||

nt|aap00: I agree with 2@h |pg||
nt|mich-b: NS are in deep trouble now in theory (in 3@C)|pg||
nt|mich-b: but probably EW can not double them there|pg||
nt|aap00: I think , that now E must double all, but @s|pg||
nt|mich-b: I agree , I think if East doubles 3@C that would be a very good decision|pg||

mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: NS system = Ultimate Canape [big club, canape openings]    EW  Dutch Doubleton|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: Zaleski had an unfortunate start losing 25-1 to Israel|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|penseur9:  probably another 3nt NS here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15 HCP, 0+@D   if 2-suit LONGER @C/@S but not @H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if you dont lead a trump, is because you dont half the queen|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: possible 6@h for NS|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good slam, should be found|pg||
mb|p|nt|gsper:  NS can make a lot in @C but the vul will hold them back|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=7+ hcp, 4+@H, maybe longer @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=game force relay|pg||

nt|mcphee: 3N = same result they had last time,,,,,,,,,,,,,maybe 2 down tho:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it is not much of a clue, but enough perhaps to change the odds|pg||
pc|d6|nt|penseur9:  part score seems indicated here... possibly in @H by NS|pg||
pc|dT|nt|vugraphzvc: 1@h might be only 3 sometimes, that's probably the reason that Ton did not bid 2@h|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if east were not a passed hand, i would respond 1nt to slow the auction|pg||
nt|fabsayc: even 2 is an overbid|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: more likely 6N|pg||
nt|penseur9:  this is not a forgone conclusion... lot's of work to do|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|penseur9:  seems that N is tempted to go for slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4N is regressive  [doesn't like either of responder's suits]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N range  20-21(22)|pg||
nt|penseur9:  hi Al, welcome back|pg||
nt|fabsayc: because you have the queen (i typed it wrong)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|penseur9:  some work to do here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H lead brutal   it gives declarer hope|pg||
nt|mcphee: N please no @S lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: are there options other than playing Ton for @DH10?|pg||
nt|psyck: looks like both pais play a fairly natural system, so hopefully we will be able to follow most of their biddin|pg||
pc|sA|nt|penseur9:  good lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: and he showed 4@h already|pg||
nt|ahollan1: most of the Onstein2 lead came in 2nd set where they more than overcame the White House 20 imp carryover [from Round Robin match]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i vote for 5@C instead of 5@H    just in case NS bid 5@S, i'd like @C lead|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
pc|s9|pg||

pc|d8|pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: i wonder if same bad breaks in the other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but they start with board 31  so we won't know until the end of the set|pg||
nt|penseur9:  it seems that both rooms started on board 17, so comparisons may be available soon|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: Was a minor mistake, they are playing 31 now|pg||
nt|gsper:  With the @S finesse marked, this should make, so the 5@C sac...|pg||
nt|gsper:  would have paid, or possibly even made|pg||
nt|gsper:  The voice commentators are discussing various lines. They have lost me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: terrible hand to lead from |pg||

pc|c4|nt|aramesh_:  Hello Hasan - Welcome|pg||
nt|famus: Tommy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: initial thinking   how do i combine chances in the majors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but that assumes 5@C tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: don't know why bertens played the @d10 here, Q looks better|pg||
nt|bobholl: in practice surely :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: if you play for Kx low is best of course, but against 98 the Q is the same as 10, but it gains with J9|pg||
pc|c3|nt|penseur9:  I'm not sure I would have played @D here... most likely|pg||
nt|penseur9:  trump most likely*|pg||
nt|penseur9:  always difficult to second guess declarer on these part score contracts|pg||
nt|gsper:  Yes, I also thought it was that simple|pg||
pc|cA|nt|dkkello:  they used to play chess, but that whent to fast for them |pg||

nt|gsper:  Welcome, Martin|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in fact he can claim now, and should :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but westra perhaps has to keep up his reputation for slow play|pg||
nt|gsper:  S may be considering a low @D return|pg||
nt|fabsayc: for what purpose|pg||
nt|gsper:  In case W has Qxx|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: similar problem in 6N - except that declarer probably won't suffer @S ruff|pg||
nt|penseur9:  looking like -1 here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's one wrong guess|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi al, spectators|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think i would have won first spade in hand to play clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: perhaps Verhees went wrong at trick 1?  yes, he picked up trump, but being in dummy left too few options |pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)  sorry marshall  i was typing   didn't see you got there first|pg||
nt|ahollan1: MARTIN|pg||

pc|h9|nt|Vugraphzvc: lol|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not good defense, should have been down 2|pg||
pc|hT|nt|bobholl: only good plays (as usual) from huubke (bertens)|pg||
nt|bobholl: i guess that a misguess in @H makes no difference :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ton duck whichever round suit is led  then Frank can win next round to play 4th @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oops|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|ady: ruff a spade     same|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room started with board 13, so we won't be seeing comparisons this set|pg||
nt|ady: 4 trump tricks for west   800|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i guess now  win @HA exit @H|pg||
