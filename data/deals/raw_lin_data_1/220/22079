nt|pole_as_ch: oh! 3 make !|pg||
nt|cc469: a missed opportunity|pg||
nt|ahollan1: these teams did not meet in the Qualifying Swiss|pg||
nt|ahollan1: forget that  @HK was still out, wasn't it|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@S=10-15 hcp, 4+@S  if 2-suit, 2nd is LONGER|pg||
mb|1S|an|4+ may have longer !C|nt|beauch:  newell reid play big club system|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Neduk [defending title won in 2011]  ended up tied 4/5   Stamatov 7th|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: DBL=Responsive  [takeout for unbid suits]|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15 hcp, 0+@D  if 2 suits then 2nd is LONGER|pg||
pc|s4|nt|pole_as_ch: 3NT ?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: South is little bit aggressive player|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL = Relay   @S length is coincidental|pg||
nt|frankaus: EW CC at - http://www.abf.com.au/events/playoffs/2011/open/Jacobs-Thompson.pdf|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15, 0+   usually 11-13 when balanced   but 3rd seat ...|pg||
pc|sK|nt|fabsayc: but with tolerance for clubs also, this hand typical|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good point   extrapolating  many play 2N would have been the other suits without tolerance|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  18   3@C South|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or  Good/Bad  or  or  or    lots of possible agreements|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 3NT would be !|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: east may 2@s OC, i might do|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if 1@D not alerted  then NS probably  Bojoh-Tueje|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S confirmed 6+@S, 1-suiter|pg||

nt|beauch:  yes good to play with different pds - cant forget system|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: BD 18 is 4@S in OR, and 1 off must be !|pg||
nt|beauch:  i like to play 2/1in honeymoon partnerships|pg||
nt|beauch:  not necessary to have lots of complex agreements|pg||
nt|petergill: North's aggressive overcall, well suited by the vulnerability, talked EW out of 3NT, but 5@d is safe enough|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in other room  South hand was opened 1NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then North used Texas transfer so South in 4@S|pg||
pc|s7|nt|pole_as_ch: 2 off or more !  @c is not good , sigh !|pg||
nt|ahollan1: convention cards online from 2011 Bermuda Bowl|pg||
nt|cc469: not   a very friendly hand for declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: largest lead in any of the matches   11 imps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think @D shift for -3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H underlead maybe -3 too, but no way that play will be made|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both 8s  discouraging  [upside-down count & attitude]|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|pc|sQ|pg||

nt|ahollan1: that should work too, but i thought he'd try @Dx|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 1 loser in @c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but in 2@S  declarer should be safe|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dT|pc|dA|nt|beauch:  any view peter about merits of overcall of 1@h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other match  Down Under, the last of 8 qualifiers, leads Oni-Taka by 30 |pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|xenya: NS at other table play a 14-16 no-trump |pg||
pc|d5|nt|pole_as_ch: @s ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh   @DK caters to Declarer holding @D10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: potentially creating entry to Verhees's @DQ|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h2|pc|c9|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: how do he banished @h loser ??|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: probable final score  -2   which will give Stamatov a 3 imp gain|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bad math all  -2 = 300   so 7 imps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Stamatov should know trump situation|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pole_as_ch: but not buck entry !?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: if vP had one -- it would have been led a long time ago|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: they know each other very well.  so many times battle they did .|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|cT|pc|s9|pc|s8|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: at first glance, dec will try @d est|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: @s  oc will be good hint ?  or not.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but 1453 shape still raises doubts about the choice|pg||
nt|xenya: exactly|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: our NS pair plays  1N=good11-14 throughout|pg||
pc|s2|nt|pole_as_ch: @d finess is one of option, he did not |pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: credit for this pickup goes to the 3rd seat actions by Stamatov|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice unblock in @H|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|nt|pole_as_ch: oh! unblock by south, and get down !|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: anyway, push !|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@S    1st/2nd/3rd  6+@S, 5-10 HCP, weak|pg||

mb|4S|nt|petergill: The NEC Cup is Japan's main international event, held annually in Yokohama, with this year's field having players who came 1st, 7th, 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th in last year's Bermuda ...|pg||
nt|petergill: Bowl plus whole women's teams who came 1st, 2nd and 4th in the 2011 Venice Cup |pg||
nt|beauch:  most expert players throw away the green pass cards|pg||
nt|frankaus: 2@C 10-13 6@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: 2@c ??|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 2@h may be TRF to @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: exciting match, maybe.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: King asks unblock or count|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Verhees trying not to think   "i should have opened 1@S"|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: when not vul against vul|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=@S & @C/@D|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pole_as_ch: 2@C may be 18-20 BAL ?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 4@s can make if y r immotals|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: looks like cold.|pg||
nt|petergill: previous hand: and with pard being a passed hand, he won't bid too much, you hope when you overcall 1@H|pg||
nt|beauch:  true - but recently played two top usa players - who bid on every hand:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some play Snapdragon DBL  where vP would have bid DBL to show the 4th suit AND tolerance for partner's overcalled suit|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|pole_as_ch: deep finness of @h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i believe   standard count in partner's suit   reverse count in declarer's|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|xenya: no problem with this contract of course -- a matter of overtricks actually|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|pole_as_ch: 3@h 1 off ?|pg||
nt|fluffy: double is a tad agressive|pg||
nt|cc469: doesn't want to lose control of the trump suit|pg||
nt|cc469: tough - who has the @SK?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|eamongall: real score will be 20-12 to Hackett |pg||
nt|beauch:  looks like 1 down here|pg||
nt|petergill: Play of this 2@S has many options for both declarer and defence|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well   no problem because we see @SA in south|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  19 [4@H-1]   Isporski playing 4@C North|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: trick one looks very wrong|pg||
nt|petergill: @D not easy to pick for declarer on this bidding|pg||
pc|sK|nt|fluffy: even with double fit and good lie of cards 3@h is doomed|pg||
nt|petergill: Well done in @D - South decided it's too risky for West to underlead @DA there|pg||
nt|beauch:  now declarer may get home|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @CQ onside is first bit of bad news|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: for what it is worth -- no guarantee that EW get to 4@S after 1@S opener|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in other vugraph match  both tables played 2@S|pg||
pc|s7|nt|pole_as_ch: bd 19 is 3NT |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nunn playing weak NT had to start with 1@D  now in 2N West|pg||
nt|petergill: Heart back causes more problems for S than @S back by E|pg||
mc|10|nt|petergill: Good defence|pg||

pg||

mb|2D|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|xenya: presumably 2N shows the reds in this context|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andyv:  the usual lead in these types of auctions...trump leads tend to be effective more often than not.|pg||
nt|xenya: but wasn't S worth another bid over 3@D?|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: 11imps maybe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Neduk currently 5th  Indonesia Ladies  8th|pg||
nt|ahollan1: top 8 advance to KO|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what tools will Danailov have after 1@H-(2@S)-?|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=forcing, (good 13)14+ HCP unbal, 15+ HCP BAL [16+ BAL unfav]|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C strong|pg||
nt|petergill: sory, let Al do the system stuff, not me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C from east?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: ho hum   just another 4N jump overcall|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: @h is bad break.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: West will OC @s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another 2@C opener   10-15 HCP  a) 6+@C, 1-suit  b) 4+@C & 5+@S  [equal or longer @S]|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: mcgann should bid 6@C|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: where do they go ?  5@c is safe.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 3NT ?|pg||
nt|fluffy: Nakamura has to decide between 1NT and 3@c with normal methods first|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: i vote 1NT|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: maybe 1@d is there ?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: humm, off shape 1NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i shouldn't waffle|pg||
nt|beauch:  auction at other table was a little unusual- east overcalled 4@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh   that one :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in context of a Big Club system    jumps to 4 of partner's major are wide range|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: oh ! south trys!|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 3NT ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they can be the typical  preempt OR  an opening bid with no slam interest [typically 3-fit]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D relay  but unlike Precision  doesn't show ANY points|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=5+@S|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|eamongall: its about 2 years since I did vugraph so I don't remember exactly |pg||
nt|eamongall: how to change the score|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: but i also do|pg||
nt|ahollan1: rumor mill [web page not updated yet]   thru 7 of 12 rounds    china W2 134, Bulg A stars 131, ontaka 130, china Geely auto NEDUK down under 129 , Hackett 126 Stmatov 123|pg||
nt|petergill: Because their other openings are mostly 9-13, NS regard 14+ as "strong"|pg||
nt|petergill: North feeling uncomfortable, as 3@D might be a 4-2 fit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL was takeout|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S invite|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: certainly he had better chance than in other room|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if this is not good enough they need to revise system, considering east also had 2nt for minors|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: 1NT will make 3NT a make because east won't lead a diamond|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: same as OR. and plsy ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems rich with minimum 1@C opener and weak suits|pg||
nt|petergill: Best for N to pass, as 3@S would be doubled by W|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Newell PASS just denies ability to game force|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: 3rd hand should open on good suit, i dare say. |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: so i may open 1@h.|pg||
nt|kemperg: why not 3@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  20  the ladies are in 2N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D implies desire to play in suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: here South has @C stop  and they tend not to lead @S after showing 4+|pg||
mb|p|nt|beauch:  looks like 2 down?|pg||
nt|cc469: I think if you bid 2@C you have to be prepared to bid your 4 card @S suit if the opportunity arises ( which it did here)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so invite for most likely game   with 2N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can't jump with south hand when playing standard because the 1@H opener could have up to  20 hcp|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: @D lead looks normal  but  will be wrong|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kemperg: but only invite?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|pole_as_ch: difficult contruct. to make and to defend|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: East can easily slow-in and end-played, nightmare|pg||
nt|xenya: one can sympathise with S. who wanted to show good cards in @C with the 2N bid -- still her hand is more suit=oriented|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: humm. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: for both of our pairs non 1@C openers have maximum of 15 hcp|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thru  21   Oz Players over Bulgarian All Stars by 5 imps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Stamatov is also a team of Bulgarians|pg||
pc|sT|nt|fluffy: the hand will make 11 tricks comfortable, but if you look in isolation the hand you would rather play 6@c than 3NT before the lead since clubs 2-2 mean 6@c makes and @c3-1 put 3NT ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: in danger|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kemperg: right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course easier to bid South hand when you have tools like Gazilli or Cole |pg||
nt|ahollan1: if I was North   i would have rebid 2@S instead of 2@D|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: c.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 8 or 9 trick.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: EW play GhN)estem  but that still uses  1M-(2N) as 2 lowest unbid|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: this bd now is 17imp swing. +10 or -7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and that is actually what Gold did|pg||
pc|s3|nt|beauch:  peter what would you overcall with east hand over a1@S opener|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes it does|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: @dQ steal and @c ruff will be 10 |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: he not yet knows bad break of trump|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|nt|pole_as_ch: if my method, @c is good. so 6@c would be in scope.|pg||
nt|fluffy: lead directing openings in third are fine but they are most useful when you open light on the 10-12 range, with 16 there is not as much lead directing need IMO|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: well.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: !Q ?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|petergill: Not sure - 4@C? 3@C? 2@C?  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course, now they're getting too high in the other room, but I'd still bid 2@S :)|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: comes !|pg||
pc|d9|nt|pole_as_ch: @cQ ??|pg||
nt|petergill: David, your choice is?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|pole_as_ch: hum, 2 from @s & 1 from @d, so 1 off, likely|pg||
pc|d8|nt|eamongall: jokowi says ..."if not wrong : click on the contract : 4sn-1"|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: he trys @d ruff by hand, maybe.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: @d ruff 2 times and @h will finess ??|pg||
nt|kemperg: they are in 3@D |pg||
nt|ahollan1: retraction    they stopped in 3@D!!|pg||
nt|kemperg: amazing for me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N asked and 3@D was natural with 3@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i forgot about that possibility|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cQ|nt|pole_as_ch: west thinking.  @s lead now will something halmfull ??|pg||
nt|beauch:  tough call|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not 2@C  leaves them too much room to get into Relay mode|pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer's plan here is to ruff spades from dummy - I think all lines lead to -200|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pole_as_ch: hum @d3 of West show something, likely.|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh @d !!|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|d4|nt|petergill: Does it affect your choice of overcall - if they open 1@S or if they open 1@C (Strong)|pg||

nt|beauch:  a few more imps to neduk team|pg||

mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: ah, but bad vul for Chen. humm.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: c |pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS do NOT play Namyats, so 4@H wide range|pg||
nt|petergill: The defence to beat 4@S is fairly easy to find|pg||
nt|petergill: but it seems normal for S to bid 5@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=10-15 hcp, 5+@H & 4+@D|pg||
nt|kemperg: ty|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 5C by S is best but 3N obviously maes as cards lie|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S is the ONLY weak 2 in the NS arsenal|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: Verhees still has a chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: yes six was a total mystery in open room also|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so we're skeptical about overtricks on 22 & 24|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H = max of 15 HCP|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S wishing he had more room, is coming straight off a hand where lack of space kept his side out of 5m as only making games|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Danailov might be playing Precision here|pg||
nt|petergill: The suitable vulnerability, position (dealer) and suit texture are the reasons for Martin Reid's expert 4@H opening|pg||
nt|petergill: which has vaulted the World Champions overboard|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=relay   game force or INV in @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL includes strong NT   so not necessarily traditional shape|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: 3N = 55 with 1@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but what a singleton|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that is result of playing artificial 1N Overcalls  [Raptor]|pg||
pc|d4|nt|pole_as_ch: 4@h can make for EW ???|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems contradictory to use @SK to have points to open then show singleton @S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: will achieve half the goal of reaching 5C by S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: H lead on the way|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d2|pg||
nt|eamongall: 2@Hs and 1 @C was originally to be lost ..|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: why ?  13 tricks are there !?|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: EW stealed the contruct, but can make ??|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: this can reach there.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Eddie Manfield wouldn't approve    "thinking of bidding 5 over 5?  DON'T   the 5 level belongs to the opponents"   was a BOLS Bridge Tip from Ed|pg||
nt|xenya: very true|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 24  2@D made  5 imps to Indonesia|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: Gold opened the North hand|pg||
nt|kemperg: and more to come on this hand:(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS has found a @S fit - just a question of how high the bidding goes|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: i'm told both Bulgarian Pairs are playing Precision|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the threatening defense was a heart lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's consistent with what i found for 2009 Bermuda Bowl|pg||
nt|fabsayc: should put in the 10 for extra dummy entry|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: no, @d ruff i lost. sry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course   sometimes the opponents bid 6 over 5 :)|pg||
nt|petergill: I don't like 6@h much. The assumption that partner has very short spades can be faulty, as on the actual hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and the Kings are defensive, not offensive|pg||
nt|petergill: Also, the partner of a fav vul prempter has to take into account that the fav vul prempt might make bidding a lot later very risky|pg||
nt|petergill: @DQ lead would be good for NS|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|eamongall: but now declarer can manage 11 tricks |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Dawei's hummar would strick the 7 ??|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 6@H snatching defeat from the jaws of victory|pg||
nt|kemperg: who is to blame:(|pg||
mc|12|nt|ahollan1: Verhees could not overcall 1N   that would show  4@S and 5+@C/@D|pg||
