nt|kdr_fm: hi all exciting match this scot 97 / eng 97 so this will certainly play a large part in the probable winner|pg||
mb|1S|nt|paulg:  i'd have bid Michaels on the East hand, but perhaps EW play weak or strong|pg||
mb|d|mb|2S|nt|cuttysark: The NI West overcalled 2@H on that scrappy suit. but East has not solved the problem by doubling|pg||

pc|dK|nt|vugraphzzj: sorry lost play trying to see the table|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I suppose West can infer that North has ost of the high cards - backward finesse, anyone?|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||
nt|cuttysark: But he's down before he starts|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 5@D also doomed, seems a little unlucky|pg||
pc|dA|nt|cuttysark: and I agree with Nichaels - this weak or strong stuff just gives me a headache|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: West had a tough call.  opposite a "decent " overcall eg AKxxx 5S should be laydown even opposite AJTxx its on a finesse|pg||

nt|henryb:  Hi|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mamos: Robertson may feel he has a lot of points for his sikence|pg||
nt|henryb:  4@h, at least in my book, is trumps, shape, not terribly different from 1@h - P - 4@h|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mamos: lol I didnt say iy was a bad idea  - i do think it makes North's double less of a good idea|pg||
nt|henryb:  4@d over 3@d says "I would have shown a constructive gf if left alone"|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mamos: im sure you are right Henry  it was a good bid |pg||

pc|h3|nt|penseur9: I think we're looking at 4 IMPs for NIBU|pg||
nt|mamos: yes well North's bid may have the same ambition but he perhaps has lead his partner rather than the oppo to think he has more|pg||
nt|henryb:  how about 6: 690 vs 450|pg||
nt|mamos: or 990- vs 650|pg||
nt|penseur9: could be :)|pg||

nt|kdr_fm: 6S on here lets see how N/S do|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|yorkbeach:  some do not like to splinter with a singleton ace|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  the fifth spade is going to come in hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  i like the 2@s raise but it will not be to everyone's taste|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  handy|pg||
pc|s5|nt|cuttysark: Agreed - much the best bid with a minimum and a worthless doubleton|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|nt|kdr_fm: 4H also takes up sooo much room - but its a reasonable bid on this hand.  May be better slower routes available|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 3@C presumably intermediate strength - even so, this hand looks a bit good|pg||
nt|vugraphzzj: Explained as "invitational" both sides of screen|pg||
pc|c3|nt|yorkbeach:  5@d asking for the @sQ|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: Q ask so looks like theu'll get there - good bidding|pg||
pc|c2|nt|cuttysark: Morgan does seem to be overegging the pussing here - surely partner does not have the right cards for slam|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Pudding!|pg||
pc|c6|nt|yorkbeach:  6@c yes plus the @cK|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|d7|nt|dkkello:  still , I like the 4 @D bid , lots of controls |pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|dkkello:  but enough is enough ..|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: S happy now the CK + SQ + 1ace is perfect|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: nicely bid|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  choice between a trump and a @d lead|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West's hxK is a clue for a trump lead|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: trump for 2 reasons - you want to try and cut down ruffs (maybe your @HK may turn into a trick) ... @d may be into AQ ...|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @hK|pg||
nt|vugraphzzj: He's still agonising here|pg||
nt|vugraphzzj: Now he's scribbling a question for Morgan|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|cuttysark: In the other room East West trsnspose 1@S and 1NT, so East was decalrer. Diamonds were not mentioned and South led @DQ, which helped|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|pc|h2|pc|c5|pg||
nt|cuttysark: The nine is probably zero or 2 higher|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|d4|nt|yorkbeach:  declarer's concern is a possible 5-2 @h break, when East may be overruffing dummy|pg||
nt|pitiful:  nicely done here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  so may be safer to take ruffs in hand and ruff 1@h only|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|pc|h4|nt|cuttysark: Looks a fai 6S to protect against the diamond lead, but there there might be a club ruff....|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Well, 2 hearts, 2 diamosd, 2 clubs with the ruffing finesse, and 3 trump tricks - was there a problem?|pg||

nt|paulg:  but this is always clearer to the player making the call|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Actually this pair are well established - have been playing together since they were about 12 - but they do not get together very often, and they are prone to the occasional ...|pg||
nt|cuttysark: misunderstanding|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Well, one is always in doubt, but that does not make trump leads right!|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|paulg:  Scotland went into the final match with a lead of 15 VPs, so are clear favourites|pg||
mb|d|nt|paulg:  England need to beat Northern Ireland well and hope that the Republic of Ireland team can help them|pg||
nt|paulg:  Concurrently the Peggy Bayer for the under 20s is being held, using the same hands and format|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Jake Corry plays his bridge in Edinburgh these days - can't imagine what they have been teaching him|pg||
nt|paulg:  Corry can only be wondering whether to bid 5@d or 6@d?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  giant defense misunderstanding at other table..  |pg||
nt|cuttysark: I much prefer the direct approach of Alex Wilkinson - calling his 8-card suit trump|pg||
nt|paulg:  England were big favourites for this, but a stuttering performance is giving Scotland a small chance|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: though yes, the defence to 5@D was not best|pg||
mb|4H|nt|cuttysark: As long as they avoid 4@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Well, we Edinburghers have surely taught jake the optimisitic approach|pg||
nt|paulg:  i doubt South has seen this auction before|pg||
nt|paulg:  unless she has played in a number of late-night games on BBO|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not sure I ahve either :)  West will know what to do to 7@H|pg||
nt|cuttysark: And they have - I guess North thought AK doubleton would be adequate support, and he was right|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Though I think  would rather be in 4@H|pg||
nt|paulg:  the U20 table before the final match was England 157, Scotland 149, Northern Ireland 100, Ireland 65  |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|cuttysark: 2Nt some form of Jacoby, a game-forcing raise; 3C some minimum|pg||

mb|1S|nt|diumraid: Viewgraph Operator - Bridgemate scoring has Board 2 as X -3 not -2 ?|pg||

nt|kdr_fm: very tight double but excellent underlead in the @s|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|cuttysark: Yes indeed Martin (or whoever?)- you deserve your glass of wine now|pg||
nt|paulg:  wow, a classic takeout double ... we have not seen many of those this weekend|pg||
mb|r|nt|cuttysark: Ierland picked up 4 imps on Board 17 when they lost 50 in 2@S but England were well overboard in 3NT|pg||
nt|paulg:  The competition continues tomorrow morning at 11am GMT, 12pm Paris, 7am New York, 11am Berwick-upon-Tweed|pg||
nt|paulg:  we have seen lots of takeout doubles, some of which have been taken out, but a lot have been ridiculed by many of the commentators :)|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  at the other table South did not find the @s switch|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West think about a club slam or perhaps just whether 5@c may be safer than 3NT|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  and possibility of playing in 4@h if East gives preference|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Some sotr of Fit nonjump  but West should turn down the invitation|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzzj: Paul puts his hands over his eyes. It could be a while.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I believe the JC is using screens for the first time this year|pg||

nt|cuttysark: The NI pair did well to cash their 2 winners here|pg||
nt|vugraphzzj: Passed.... with a shrug|pg||
nt|paulg:  Paul makes the value raise to 3@s and DanMac cannot pass quickly enough|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S enough, maybe, after a redouble? i suppose it's a pretty nice ten count|pg||
pc|c3|nt|cuttysark: But they now have a couple of por results to score|pg||
nt|cuttysark: (And feel free to charge your wine to my room...)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  well judged|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|cuttysark: 12 tricks with everything breaking and @SA onside|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the uneven breaks in the minors would make 5@c difficult|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but they hamper the defenders in NT|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|nt|cuttysark: Poor, even|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|cuttysark: The Scottis-Polish South did not open on Board 31, surely regretting opt doing so when the auction came back at 3@H. SO they ended in an unispired 5@D contract, also 1 down |pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|nt|cuttysark: A club switch now will hold declarer to 7 tricks|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Declarer taking no risks in his game contract|pg||
nt|paulg:  Northern Ireland have played this event four-handed, so tiredness will be setting in now|pg||
mb|p|nt|kdr_fm: is that a slam you'd want to be in ?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Ugly weak 2 with an ace empty suit and two aces, but...|pg||
nt|cuttysark: (And no, I would not want to be in slam on the last board :))|pg||
nt|cuttysark: In the other Room West overcalled 2NT over a Multi, but 3NT was doomed on a heart lead|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 3nt doesnt make as in the other room - 4@s has chances ..|pg||
nt|athene: i don't see how south could have only three diamonds, given the bidding and play|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  especially as play did not finish until 23.30 last night|pg||
nt|athene: she is known to have one spade and four clubs|pg||
nt|athene: and north did bid 2@H|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|cuttysark: Tough hand to bid - but 3@H looks a bit weird, should be either Michaels or a stopper ask|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: An Irish slam? Fails on a diamond lead, but who leads from Jx (unless North bids the suit, of course|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|vugraphzzj: I can just about read "Stopper ask" on the notepad|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: This looks like a Kokish sequence to show a big balanced hand - not sure of their ranges, but most would have bid 2NT by now|pg||
mb|2S|nt|cuttysark: I think 2@H is Kokish, when he rebids 2N he will show 22-23 balanced, I hope|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Sorry, my contact has developed a slow-to-nonexistent motion|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Assuming that North has shown hearts with this double, South is unsure how many hearts to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  looks like Multi from South and 4@c = please transfer into your suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|kdr_fm: well lets see how the defence goes|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Well, they got to 4@S but does 3@S show spades? For me it shows a weak hand with no stopper|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|cuttysark: East should be worried about his red suit holdings for slam purposes|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I do not believe the auction from the other room, where apparently South opend 4@s|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|cuttysark: 2@S is a relay, and now 2@H is a transfer|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: needs a club switch at trick 2 or this is home|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|sT|nt|cuttysark: And 4@H a retransfer|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|d2|nt|cuttysark: Ireland gain 3 more imps from their advnturous 3D -1 on board 19: england tried 2@H, two down|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
pc|s7|nt|yorkbeach:  we have confirmation that the auction was indeed longer|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|cuttysark: Not an easy switch to find, that club.|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: big swing 13 imps i'm informed|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes, provided he keeps his eye on the ball NI win 13 imps here|pg||
nt|cuttysark: and they get another 4 on Board 30 where England played in 4@S-1 and Corry doubled 4@H, also -1|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Scotland now leading NI by 6 imps|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|dT|pg||
pc|hT|nt|cuttysark: East is going to have to bank on the heart finesse here|pg||

mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Irlenad collect 2 imps by finding a rather better lead against 2@S on Board 32|pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: 1@C pretty loose for this EW so he won't be bidding 3@C, i shouldn't think|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Deathy trap hand for EW - no making game|pg||
mb|1N|nt|vugraphzzj: connection bad|pg||
nt|paulg:  2NT if you open light, 3NT otherwise|pg||
nt|cuttysark: nasty problem for South|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Sometimes you wish you had not opened, though this is a perfectly norma opener|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: I expect they open loght, but he bids 3NT anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Thanks to our excellent operator and everyone in the CBAI and BGB who have brought us this broadcast over the weekend|pg||

pc|s6|nt|cuttysark: ireland attemtping to make 1NT in both directions on this board - North succeeded, can West?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: ot the time for an imaginative lead - the trusy 4th highest does the job|pg||
nt|dkkello:  13  |pg||
nt|cuttysark: A keycard ask gest disappointing results. Looks like 5@D could easily go down more than one|pg||
pc|s3|nt|diumraid: http://bridge.silvertexter.eu for LIVE SCORES|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|paulg:  a lot to be said for bidding 3NT .. either hearts or diamonds may be source of tricks even if minimum|pg||
pc|d7|nt|cuttysark: Well she though partner had to have 4 keycards rather than one, and fortunately no-one has doubled|pg||
pc|d8|nt|cuttysark: Can't have 4 - I guess it's jist a miscount by somebody|pg||
