nt|kdr_fm: hi all exciting match this scot 97 / eng 97 so this will certainly play a large part in the probable winner|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  i'd have bid Michaels on the East hand, but perhaps EW play weak or strong|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: The NI West overcalled 2@H on that scrappy suit. but East has not solved the problem by doubling|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzzj: sorry lost play trying to see the table|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I suppose West can infer that North has ost of the high cards - backward finesse, anyone?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s8|pg||
nt|cuttysark: But he's down before he starts|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 5@D also doomed, seems a little unlucky|pg||
pc|hK|nt|cuttysark: and I agree with Nichaels - this weak or strong stuff just gives me a headache|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|pc|h8|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: West had a tough call.  opposite a "decent " overcall eg AKxxx 5S should be laydown even opposite AJTxx its on a finesse|pg||

nt|kdr_fm: 6S on here lets see how N/S do|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  some do not like to splinter with a singleton ace|pg||
mb|4H!|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  the fifth spade is going to come in hand|pg||
mb|4N!|nt|paulg:  i like the 2@s raise but it will not be to everyone's taste|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  handy|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Agreed - much the best bid with a minimum and a worthless doubleton|pg||
mb|5C!|mb|p|nt|kdr_fm: 4H also takes up sooo much room - but its a reasonable bid on this hand.  May be better slower routes available|pg||
mb|5D!|nt|cuttysark: 3@C presumably intermediate strength - even so, this hand looks a bit good|pg||
nt|vugraphzzj: Explained as "invitational" both sides of screen|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  5@d asking for the @sQ|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: Q ask so looks like theu'll get there - good bidding|pg||
mb|6C|nt|cuttysark: Morgan does seem to be overegging the pussing here - surely partner does not have the right cards for slam|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Pudding!|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  6@c yes plus the @cK|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|dkkello:  still , I like the 4 @D bid , lots of controls |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dkkello:  but enough is enough ..|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: S happy now the CK + SQ + 1ace is perfect|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: nicely bid|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  choice between a trump and a @d lead|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West's hxK is a clue for a trump lead|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: trump for 2 reasons - you want to try and cut down ruffs (maybe your @HK may turn into a trick) ... @d may be into AQ ...|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @hK|pg||
nt|vugraphzzj: He's still agonising here|pg||
nt|vugraphzzj: Now he's scribbling a question for Morgan|pg||
pc|d7|nt|cuttysark: In the other room East West trsnspose 1@S and 1NT, so East was decalrer. Diamonds were not mentioned and South led @DQ, which helped|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|cuttysark: The nine is probably zero or 2 higher|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d3|pc|d5|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer's concern is a possible 5-2 @h break, when East may be overruffing dummy|pg||
nt|pitiful:  nicely done here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  so may be safer to take ruffs in hand and ruff 1@h only|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Looks a fai 6S to protect against the diamond lead, but there there might be a club ruff....|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|cuttysark: Sensible to play on the side suit here|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|sQ|pc|h9|pg||
pc|s5|nt|yorkbeach:  another possibilty is to combine chance of a 4-3 @h break with the @c finesse in reserve|pg||

mb|p|pc|h5|pc|h4|nt|paulg:  i wonder if 3@d was invitational or game-forcing|pg||

pc|c5|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|nt|cuttysark: 2S was in case partner was 4-4 in the Majors, but perhaps 3@D was just talking to himself|pg||
pc|c3|nt|cuttysark: Easy overtrick or two now|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Well, 2 hearts, 2 diamosd, 2 clubs with the ruffing finesse, and 3 trump tricks - was there a problem?|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: splinter bid and a trump lead generally a good idea with known shortage in dummy|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sK|pc|s8|nt|cuttysark: True - but all the Irish players seem to like trump leads against all trump contracts :)|pg||

nt|paulg:  but this is always clearer to the player making the call|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Actually this pair are well established - have been playing together since they were about 12 - but they do not get together very often, and they are prone to the occasional ...|pg||
nt|cuttysark: misunderstanding|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Well, one is always in doubt, but that does not make trump leads right!|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|cuttysark: Jake Corry plays his bridge in Edinburgh these days - can't imagine what they have been teaching him|pg||
nt|paulg:  Corry can only be wondering whether to bid 5@d or 6@d?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  giant defense misunderstanding at other table..  |pg||
nt|cuttysark: I much prefer the direct approach of Alex Wilkinson - calling his 8-card suit trump|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|cuttysark: though yes, the defence to 5@D was not best|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: As long as they avoid 4@S|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|cuttysark: Well, we Edinburghers have surely taught jake the optimisitic approach|pg||
nt|paulg:  i doubt South has seen this auction before|pg||
nt|paulg:  unless she has played in a number of late-night games on BBO|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not sure I ahve either :)  West will know what to do to 7@H|pg||
nt|cuttysark: And they have - I guess North thought AK doubleton would be adequate support, and he was right|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Though I think  would rather be in 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: 2Nt some form of Jacoby, a game-forcing raise; 3C some minimum|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s6|nt|paulg:  Morgan's double asking for a heart lead|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes - @HAK and diamond to the ace, clear hearts - but that is only 8 tricks|pg||
pc|s5|nt|cuttysark: He will play clubs to as to keep West off lead: a switch to @DQ would be annoying|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Maybe he can afford to cash @SA while he is in dummy|pg||
pc|h3|nt|cuttysark: True. I guess West was hoping he might hear more about hearts|pg||

mb|p|nt|cuttysark: A confident prediction :)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|paulg:  there is very little that is compelling about the West hand, with only a single king|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Correct of course - this West hand is too quacky for a try|pg||

nt|vugraphzzj: Misclick from your under-caffeinated operator, I'm afraid!|pg||
nt|cuttysark: (Must watch the screen rather than the keyboard)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 4@S has very few losers, but a bit short of winners|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: East may well be forced to bid 4@S due to the length of time he's taking|pg||
nt|vugraphzzj: Corry still in the box here|pg||
nt|cuttysark: if he doubles would East pass? Without the hesitation?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|cuttysark: Rather a thin 1Nt overcall vulnerable - a risky tactic|pg||
nt|paulg:  a good result for Scotland in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|diumraid: Viewgraph Operator - Bridgemate scoring has Board 2 as X -3 not -2 ?|pg||

mb|4S|nt|cuttysark: Another making slam, but not a great one|pg||
nt|vugraphzzj: Many of the players here have been playing this for years, know each other well, are clearly having a great time. Part of the challenge is building that kind of community for ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzzj: juniors at lower levels also. Youngsters want to play with/against youngsters!|pg||
