nt|paulg:  but this is always clearer to the player making the call|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Actually this pair are well established - have been playing together since they were about 12 - but they do not get together very often, and they are prone to the occasional ...|pg||
nt|cuttysark: misunderstanding|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Well, one is always in doubt, but that does not make trump leads right!|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Jake Corry plays his bridge in Edinburgh these days - can't imagine what they have been teaching him|pg||
nt|paulg:  Corry can only be wondering whether to bid 5@d or 6@d?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  giant defense misunderstanding at other table..  |pg||
nt|cuttysark: I much prefer the direct approach of Alex Wilkinson - calling his 8-card suit trump|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: though yes, the defence to 5@D was not best|pg||
mb|3N|nt|cuttysark: As long as they avoid 4@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Well, we Edinburghers have surely taught jake the optimisitic approach|pg||
nt|paulg:  i doubt South has seen this auction before|pg||
nt|paulg:  unless she has played in a number of late-night games on BBO|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not sure I ahve either :)  West will know what to do to 7@H|pg||
nt|cuttysark: And they have - I guess North thought AK doubleton would be adequate support, and he was right|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Though I think  would rather be in 4@H|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|cuttysark: 2Nt some form of Jacoby, a game-forcing raise; 3C some minimum|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|cA|pg||

pc|hK|nt|cuttysark: Yes - @HAK and diamond to the ace, clear hearts - but that is only 8 tricks|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|cuttysark: He will play clubs to as to keep West off lead: a switch to @DQ would be annoying|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Maybe he can afford to cash @SA while he is in dummy|pg||
pc|hA|nt|cuttysark: True. I guess West was hoping he might hear more about hearts|pg||
