nt|fabsayc: hi Gary, i would be tempted to blast to slam with versace hand, but perhaps 2@S first does no harm|pg||

nt|vugraphzvc: the early @c discard made it easy to set up @c|pg||

nt|ahollan1: both pairs upside-down count & attitude   EW odd/even discard|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the Open Room starts with Board 27  so we won't see comparisons -- but they will|pg||
nt|mcphee: might make via and end play|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am asked which way, well given lauria is declarer i will say right way for declarer|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the idea is no trump lead, but zia exposed the flaw of leading a trump versus 7 in his book|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: both pairs  upside-down count & attitude   EW odd/even discard|pg||
nt|psyck: i think there will be 3 round robin games followed by semi & finals|pg||

pc|h4|pg||

nt|mcphee: i always hate these postions, you know the @D hook is losing:(|pg||
nt|mcphee: even though E has tried to mislead declarer discarding 7@D|pg||

mb|2C|mb|d|nt|psridhar: 1N opg will lead to 3@H via trf and super acceptance; while 1@H opg wd hv helped them stay lower|pg||

nt|psyck: top 2 teams of two groups go to semi mAYBE|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: NS system = Ultimate Canape [big club, canape openings]    EW  Dutch Doubleton|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: Zaleski had an unfortunate start losing 25-1 to Israel|pg||

nt|fabsayc: if you dont lead a trump, is because you dont half the queen|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: possible 6@h for NS|pg||

nt|fabsayc: it is not much of a clue, but enough perhaps to change the odds|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  part score seems indicated here... possibly in @H by NS|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzvc: 1@h might be only 3 sometimes, that's probably the reason that Ton did not bid 2@h|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if east were not a passed hand, i would respond 1nt to slow the auction|pg||
nt|fabsayc: even 2 is an overbid|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: more likely 6N|pg||
nt|penseur9:  this is not a forgone conclusion... lot's of work to do|pg||
pc|h9|nt|penseur9:  seems that N is tempted to go for slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4N is regressive  [doesn't like either of responder's suits]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N range  20-21(22)|pg||
nt|penseur9:  hi Al, welcome back|pg||
nt|fabsayc: because you have the queen (i typed it wrong)|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|penseur9:  some work to do here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H lead brutal   it gives declarer hope|pg||
nt|mcphee: N please no @S lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: are there options other than playing Ton for @DH10?|pg||
nt|psyck: looks like both pais play a fairly natural system, so hopefully we will be able to follow most of their biddin|pg||
pc|s2|nt|penseur9:  good lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: and he showed 4@h already|pg||
nt|ahollan1: most of the Onstein2 lead came in 2nd set where they more than overcame the White House 20 imp carryover [from Round Robin match]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i vote for 5@C instead of 5@H    just in case NS bid 5@S, i'd like @C lead|pg||

nt|penseur9:  it seems that both rooms started on board 17, so comparisons may be available soon|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: Was a minor mistake, they are playing 31 now|pg||
nt|gsper:  With the @S finesse marked, this should make, so the 5@C sac...|pg||

nt|famus: Tommy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: initial thinking   how do i combine chances in the majors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but that assumes 5@C tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: don't know why bertens played the @d10 here, Q looks better|pg||
nt|bobholl: in practice surely :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: if you play for Kx low is best of course, but against 98 the Q is the same as 10, but it gains with J9|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|penseur9:  I'm not sure I would have played @D here... most likely|pg||
nt|penseur9:  trump most likely*|pg||

nt|gsper:  Yes, I also thought it was that simple|pg||
pc|cA|nt|dkkello:  they used to play chess, but that whent to fast for them |pg||

nt|fabsayc: in fact he can claim now, and should :)|pg||

nt|fabsayc: for what purpose|pg||
nt|gsper:  In case W has Qxx|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: similar problem in 6N - except that declarer probably won't suffer @S ruff|pg||
nt|penseur9:  looking like -1 here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's one wrong guess|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi al, spectators|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think i would have won first spade in hand to play clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: perhaps Verhees went wrong at trick 1?  yes, he picked up trump, but being in dummy left too few options |pg||

nt|fabsayc: they are not handicapped by having to type|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 15-17|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@H=5+@H   note: 5@S 5@H opens 1@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: eventually it will come up so a pre-alert   NS opening 2@C/@D/@H are all multi-purpose  either weak in next higher suit  [think transfer preempt]  or various strong hands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but 3@D avoids all alerts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is west worth another bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which slam try now from Verhees?|pg||
nt|mcphee: intersting hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  W probably can't make 3@h|pg||
nt|fabsayc: undo|pg||
nt|andyv:  we can see that 7N or 7@h makes...reasonable to get to 6 but finding out about the 4th @c is difficult|pg||
nt|psyck: hi Richard|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think this is polish club|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|bobholl: reach 4@S (3nt down on @C lead)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW system is called Ultimate Canape|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i'm surprised by action from EACH player|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ok 3@H could be a form of micheals, spades and a minor|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok, EW are out of the picture|pg||
nt|psyck: Zaleski needs two good wins, but the Russians & Bulgarians are tough opponents.|pg||

nt|twcho: but in Chinese characters|pg||
nt|ahollan1: must be worth at least one try   @D under control, stiff @C  @SA|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: "must" was an overbid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on the downside, king and jack of diamonds may be worthless|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looking for justification - maybe Verhees worried about @H losers when vP holds less then 4@H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Jokes all around about the quality of Ton's preempts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they always seem to have 13 cards|pg||
nt|andyv:  UNDO PLEASE!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no andy i think this is correct|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok...so W bid 3@h|pg||
nt|fabsayc: versace taking advantage of vulnerability|pg||
nt|andyv:  sorry everyone....my senior moment!|pg||
nt|riccho:  dangerous field here entered by E... NS may reach slam |pg||
nt|psyck: maybe E could have entered the auction with a @c bid|pg||
mb|2S|nt|twcho: EW is now sitting at 3rd position before this round starts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 7 small is similar to Kxxxxx so often bid the same way|pg||
nt|gsper:  Me too, but some people would not dream of it|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Site: http://www.bridge.nl/uitslagen |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=3-fit Drury  [2@D=4-fit]|pg||
mb|p|nt|famus: a big B UT!!!:)|pg||
nt|twcho: NS lying 8th|pg||
nt|twcho: so EW still has chance to clinch the title|pg||
nt|penseur9:  good lad should still make easely|pg||
nt|gsper:  Especially Law devotees|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS system is Dutch Doubleton|pg||
nt|mcphee: so 2@D was some game try or just annouced opening values?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=RELAY  but i don't follow-ups|pg||
nt|mcphee: just see if I ask you any more questions :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you'll have to yell them   i'm having trouble staying awake :(|pg||
nt|mcphee: OK|pg||
nt|fabsayc: could pass 2@D but 2@S is fine|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: seems quite a no. of options available for declarer here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: West could try 3N at these colors|pg||
nt|fabsayc: pass is 0-3 we think|pg||
nt|andyv:  this can go down 6 |pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  *lead|pg||
nt|penseur9:  nothing much the defense can do to defeat this contract here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs  upside-down count & attitude|pg||
nt|penseur9:  good bidding from EW here|pg||
nt|dkkello:  yes |pg||
nt|ahollan1: vP might have raised|pg||
nt|mcphee: E hand getting worse|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not sure if 5nt is queen ask, looks that way|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in any case we are into a sequence i have never ever seen before|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2nt was some form of super accept of transfer, probably max with three trumps|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ady: 4-1 trump split    but should arrive at 10 tricks  losing 2 hearts and a club|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  1  Bakkeren brothers get to 5@S|pg||
pc|sA|nt|twcho: but @d is the most promising|pg||
nt|twcho: @c can wait and @s suit is not robust enough|pg||
nt|famus: he exercised one of em--next ought to be a small @s to Q to wind up |pg||
nt|penseur9:  this COULD make but difficult to figure out double dummy|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: @HJ from QJxx(x) or JT(x)     @HQ from QJ(x)|pg||
nt|penseur9:  probably will go down now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this could be a form of Slawinsky honor leads,   which i never remember|pg||
nt|penseur9:  remember though that they are much better then I am :)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  should make in 12-15 min or so .. |pg||
nt|penseur9:  on board  1, OR in 4@S -1 for 5 IMPs Onstein1|pg||
nt|bobholl: would play @CK now|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  15  3N in South|pg||
nt|psyck: opening 2@h would also have got them to the same spot|pg||
nt|psyck: other room gets there via a multi opening|pg||
nt|psyck: multi enabled it to be played by E, not that it matters here|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: ah perhaps now some realistic bidding|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mcphee: west doesn't care|pg||
nt|djneill:  East could have had @hK, @dA, @cK, opposite singleton @s, that would have been nice|pg||
nt|mcphee: very nice|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard to sac in 7 spades now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: kudos to pachtman for negotiating this auction|pg||
pc|hA|nt|fabsayc: jansma looking for a line to make this hand, needs a miracle for that|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: Ton  not balancing with all of that shape seems very deep|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|bobholl: direct ak of @S best now ?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mcphee: not exactly a claimer, but he should manage|pg||
nt|ahollan1: defense decides   @D ruff or @C trick|pg||
nt|mcphee: only a @S lead had a shot to beat it I think|pg||
pc|d5|nt|penseur9:  well done|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT speculative      poor trick taking potential|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|kemperg: @D onside, so its made|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jansma in South passing throughout on  2   4@S East|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ady: could be a problem  with spades 4-1|pg||
nt|mcphee: this will also beat it if defenders are on the ball|pg||
nt|mcphee: low @S see S hop ace|pg||
nt|djneill:  for the locations of the @sA, @hK, and @cK, this is the only arrangement that provides danger for West, can he do something about it|pg||
nt|mcphee: and now a @C will get them the setting trick as W can not reach the dummy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but then doesn't @C go on @S?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh  i get it|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kemperg: both sides bidding up to par:)|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: curious line|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bobholl: always 5 made now|pg||
nt|bobholl: at least|pg||
nt|ady: needs to ruff a diamond and a club with 5 and 3 of spades    has not got the entries|pg||
pc|d2|nt|famus: after surrendering @d and @h back--puts dec on his back foot to cash out|pg||
pc|d7|nt|dkkello:  since Laura Dekker  spent 500 days on the sea(congratulation) ..|pg||
nt|bobholl: but this is better|pg||
nt|gsper:  He hoped to discard the @C3 on a @H and lose no trump tricks|pg||
nt|gsper:  Rather forlorn in view of the 3NT bid, but you can try|pg||
nt|fabsayc: defense could always force him to ruff a club if necessary|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but van Prooijen needed to duck, didn't he?|pg||
nt|mcphee: y|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|gsper:  Yes, it was a bit of an insult to opps|pg||
nt|kemperg: has he entrys left for @D play?|pg||
nt|kemperg: yes @C anD @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: are all 3N overcalls of 3-level preempts speculative?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now @H entry to @S|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mcphee: difficult defence|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h3|nt|mcphee: over taking?|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but all is well with @H3-3|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|pc|sK|pc|sT|pg||

nt|dkkello:  guess the dutch people have a lot of patient |pg||
nt|dkkello:  that was quick  ..|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all  and hoi Germ |pg||
nt|ahollan1: and when right  vul game bonus much better than +50|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Loek talking about asking for a director|pg||
nt|djneill:  what should North do over the takeout double|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL can be strong NT   [1N overcalls are artificial]|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: for the slow 3@h|pg||
nt|andyv:  for all those who want 8@s, it would only go down 2000|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: slam time|pg||
nt|penseur9:  NS may have missed a @H trick in previous hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15 hcp, 0+@D often weak NT    maybe @D and LONGER @C/@S [canape] but not longer @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think that skews advancer's ability to bid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is 1000 an undertrick if you bid at 8 level|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|fabsayc: marginal slam here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 18+ bal|pg||
nt|penseur9:  we should see some scoring soon since the OR started on boards 14 to 16|pg||
nt|bobholl: authorities (especially school people) didn't like the way it went :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi Shirley|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Hola Shirley|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=10-15 HCP, 4+@H  could be 5@H 5@S or 2nd suit LONGER|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N @H raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15 hcp, 0+@D  often weak NT   maybe 4@D and LONGER @S/@C [canape] but not longer @H|pg||
nt|djneill:  there is one bid that shifts the blame back to doubler, I think North will find it|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=a) 6+@C 1-suit    b) 4+@C and LONGER @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: and hello to Bas! |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@C shortness   still don't know if 1-suit @H or  longer @S/@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't think they can find @S now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S usually less than game force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D = 5+@H  invitational or stronger|pg||
nt|riccho:  @s dominates this hand (as it is so often the case)|pg||
nt|andyv:  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008MindSortGamesBeijing/Open/France/multon-zimmerman.pdf|pg||
mb|2N|nt|vugraphzvc: 1@D was 3+@D|pg||
nt|penseur9:  rare 1@D contract, S could hardly bid 1@H with that hand|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: incredibly Lauria-Versace goad the opps into another 13 imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: so we can conclude that both pairs are playing precision, probably the most popular system in China|pg||
nt|penseur9:  hi AL welcome back|pg||
nt|sybarra: easy 4 @H's probably +1  |pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Van Prooijen always has a short suit, Verhees explained|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very practical rebid from Verhees|pg||
nt|djneill:  that's a nice bid|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|ahollan1: is it best for Wortel to bid now with the lousy 6@S or later?  and show both majors or ...|pg||
nt|penseur9:  does not look like any contract can ake either side|pg||
nt|penseur9:  *can make...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S looks good |pg||
nt|penseur9:  yes @S contract looks best here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no entry to West hand for @H ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D does not promise any points   because may prefer @S over @C|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3@H from bertens now i guess|pg||
nt|dkkello:  well she didnt went owerboard  |pg||
nt|kemperg: 1@S a nice 3rd hand opening|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N shows any 8+ hcp|pg||
nt|psyck: a fav vul 3@h opening...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: two way finesse|pg||
mb|3H|nt|twcho: 3@h should say solid suit|pg||
nt|twcho: and invite cuebid|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: good save|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well  Kit Woolsey defines a good save as one that makes, but this is better than letting NS play 4@S|pg||
nt|gsper:  I wonder if W liked that opening or if he was forced by system|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we lost the clubs in the 60's, diamonds in the 70's, balanced nt bids in the 10's|pg||
nt|fabsayc: trump lead?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  15  [3NE+2]   Bertens in 5@D after Paulissen got to make lead directing DBL of @C |pg||
nt|fabsayc: israel can do no wrong|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|twcho: 4@c probably deny @s control|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the running total includes 10 IMPs for Het Witte Huis  [White House] for winning the round robin|pg||
nt|penseur9:  didn't somebody say that the five level belongs to the oponents|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL would have shown cards rather than typical negative double|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  *opponents|pg||
nt|kemperg: no retransfer from Jan|pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is because he wants to stop the auction in 4 @H |pg||
nt|kemperg: retransfer has not to mean slam interest|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not a great hand for the system|pg||
nt|ady: 2 diamonds and 2 trump tricks to be lost for sure    might scrape home|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL = takeout|pg||
nt|psyck: other room did not go for o/t as only in 4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont consider 50% as a good slam and this is no better than that|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|vugraphzvc: meanwhile onstein 2 won 5 imps on bd 17, letting them play 4@h undoubled|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: dbl by Drijver was GF|pg||
nt|gsper:  Not many losers, but a bit short on winners|pg||
nt|gsper:  He can ruff a @D high, but he does not know that|pg||
nt|gsper:  Could try something mundane like the @D finesse|pg||
nt|kemperg: I think 3@D had been the retransfer|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4@D splinter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ruffing finesse in @D works -- but will it be taken?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: immediate 2-level suit bids would be natural 0-7|pg||
nt|psyck: mildly aggresive 3n, some would rebid 2n, but vul...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Gary Hanna|pg||
nt|psyck: lead will give 9th after @c fin|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Krishna, Roland and everyone|pg||
nt|psyck: Hi Gary|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: A pleasure to see my fravourite partnership in action|pg||
nt|psyck: so we may continue to see 1 imp scores every deal|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Ed Manfield in a BOLS Bridge Tip back in the 1980s|pg||
nt|andyv:  true...very evident the first set|pg||
mb|4D|nt|famus: actually observing the Bermuda Bowl etc recently--the most favoured system appeared to be a combination of 2/1 with precision @c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW flip-flop PASS/DBL     i think Eric Rodwell gets credit for that inversion|pg||
nt|bobholl: difficult to stop in 4@C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: depends if they take their trump winners|pg||
nt|ady: very likely to go down|pg||
nt|kemperg: @H 41 is rather unlucky|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  already 4 IMPs for EW on board  1... only down one in OR|pg||
nt|mcphee: they only use that over 1@S dble or other suits also?|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|twcho: the winner - Netherlands having three pairs playing 3 different systems IIRC|pg||
mb|5C|nt|famus: run of the mill board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: honestly   i don't know why a 1@D bidder opposite a hand that was willing to play a partscore would be in a forcing situation|pg||
nt|bobholl: berry wondering were the @S are on the bidding off course with huub|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi gm ga all|pg||
nt|bobholl: hi jaap :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi bob:)|pg||
nt|gsper:  Finis|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2nd @S from hand rather than @H to dummy then @S  since very possible for North to duck with @SA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then could lose @SA AND defense gets to play 2 round of trump and another potential @S loser|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: even DD i see no way of making this|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2 @H ruffs and @D 33 looks as best (and only) chance|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Carl -- DBL isn't always traditional takeout shape since 1N overcalls are artificial|pg||
nt|djneill:  good stop, 25 HCP, no game|pg||
nt|psyck: sooner or later E will give dec the 9th trick|pg||
mb|6C|nt|fabsayc: lauria can develop two spade tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  the Italians had two poor results opening 11 hcp hands with A, AK in first set|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: wow   18  the doomed slams    Paulissen-Jansma stop in 3N!!|pg||
nt|jaapfr: exchange @D 6 with 8 and it can be mad|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@S cue, 4NT blackwood, 5@D queen ask, 6@C side king|pg||
nt|jcwla:  http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=KT4+AKQ6+A53+K54  19.25|pg||
mb|7N|nt|ady: settling for down 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course seeing all 4 hands -- we know better :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|kemperg: kib thinks he wanted opener on lead, wich is right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: opener will hold 4@H only if   a) weak NT  b) 4@H(441)  c) 4405    so i'm a bit surprised at choice of 3@D|pg||
nt|mcphee: i would want to be in 4@H though|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: or S will just take them|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but that is still down one|pg||
nt|fabsayc: best slam is 6NT avoiding a club ruff|pg||
nt|fabsayc: kibitzers think 7NT is a marginal slam :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: multiple tables are visible without login via http://bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  that also gives access to voice commentary|pg||
nt|jaapfr: e|pg||
nt|psyck: dec does not have comm , but E will have to provide|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamond jack lead seems safe enough|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|nt|ahollan1:  1  5@D went down so 11 to White House|pg||

nt|jaapfr: but even then is communication well enough?|pg||
nt|penseur9:  could have made one more on a @H finesse|pg||

nt|kemperg: we all agree:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: That's what Verhees just said|pg||

nt|andyv:  and 5 more imps to Israel as they played 1@s in OR|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4 coffees for this table|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: the percentage play in heart is low to ace in isolation so 4@H probably down|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|twcho: we have 3 consecutive tie bds|pg||
nt|famus: possibility of going over board|pg||
nt|penseur9:  slam here for NS|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another 2@C opener  this time  @C    go figure|pg||
nt|ady: e/w need to find their way to 5@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL=4@H/@S & 5+@C/@D    if he wants in|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|ahollan1: but expect other room 6@H or @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=multi  a) 5+@D, 3-10 HCP  b) 1-suit, FG  c) BAL, 20-21/26-27   wonder why Frank didn't try that 1st seat favorable|pg||
nt|riccho:  some reason here for S to let 1NT play|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|penseur9:  any chance for slam here?|pg||
nt|penseur9:  EW|pg||
nt|penseur9:  actually a gran slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=4+ but could be balanced|pg||
nt|djneill:  verhees thinking "typical"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so treating it as 1-suit|pg||
nt|mcphee: and 3@C = @C if he wants in:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  W passed initially|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@c presumably for majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: not sure what is 3@c here|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: a bit surprising that NS not playing transfers over 1@C|pg||
nt|penseur9:  is 4@H making NS here?|pg||
nt|bobholl: not imo whwn vulbarable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs strong NT|pg||
nt|kemperg: 6@D down on @H ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  1  where our North opened 2N to show minors, East opened 4@H   North balanced with 4N and Westra in 5@CX South|pg||
nt|psyck: good bad 2n likely|pg||
nt|psyck: *2NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: but shd be GF hand with @s support|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will NS ever bid???|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@S easy make so 5@HX-2 excellent save|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Verhees saying 'short but nice' when he puts down the @cK|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: obviously 3@D some form of @H raise -- but what are the specifics?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: curious   hand upgrades for cuebid  but not good enough for 2@C opener  |pg||
nt|mcphee: 6 losers|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good falsecard from K10x or Q10x|pg||
mb|3H|nt|famus: modified bergen:)?|pg||
nt|twcho: possibly|pg||
nt|penseur9:  1@D transfer to @H|pg||
nt|penseur9:  good question :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=INV a) @C/@D  b) 5@H/@S  c) NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that pretty much covers it all, doesn't it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: to me this method of 4+ spades is unplayable without support doubles, and i think north could double 3@D on this auction to show 3 spades|pg||
nt|fabsayc: north should probably double for takeout|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2N=bal max|pg||
nt|bobholl: would play @D myself now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: specs say 5@D a better save but i doubt that with this awful distribution|pg||
nt|bobholl: in spite of @S 3 :)|pg||
nt|psyck: (when rho bids at the 2 level, 2N is often used a good bad, with direct 3 level bids stronger & via 2n weaker)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hard to belive this is Lauria - Versace, seems like Overbid and Guggenheim :(|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6@H would be good contract if souths diamond 8 were the 9|pg||
nt|andyv:  their aggressiveness has backfired on several boards|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: polite word aggressiveness :(|pg||
nt|andyv:  another good slam for NS|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes we can all make 6 but i dont think will make if bid|pg||
nt|riccho:  tricky @h lead to convince decl not to finesse in @h ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  2nt makes but 3 ????|pg||
nt|ady: may play 3NT   down on spade lead|pg||
nt|psyck: some reverse it & play bad-good 2NT|pg||
nt|pelu:  and CC for EW: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Italy/lauria-versace.pdf|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: now vP needs to find @S lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C was a relay  did not promise a 4 card major|pg||
nt|psyck: thanks Peter|pg||
pc|cT|nt|vugraphzvc: EW CC: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Netherlands/vanprooijen-verhees.pdf|pg||
nt|penseur9:  that helps|pg||
nt|ady: low spade best|pg||
nt|ady: should survive  |pg||
nt|djneill:  a ruff, a palpable ruff, not that it gained much|pg||
nt|psyck: risky to enter such auctions vul...as happened in other room, more placid this room|pg||
pc|c7|nt|gsper:  N may have wanted a little extra strength for that|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this seems to have marked the lead, lets see|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems @S is only logical choice   |pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlikely that @CA @C would get partner ruff|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Peter :)|pg||
nt|psyck: Peter and Andy on voice commentary this room|pg||
nt|psyck: kibs can listen using the browser version|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|penseur9:  4@D is pick a major|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if Gerbrand doesn't tell us -- the opponents don't know either|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D says  not 3@H/@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzxn: sorry|pg||
nt|andyv:  you were right, Martin...probably too hard to bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  np:)|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|penseur9:  :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@C  0/3 keycards   5@H a bit of a mystery to me   maybe thinking 5@C showed 1 keycard??|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: 5@C showed 1 KC|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Frank just told me he made a mistake|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Frank seemed to be stressed out|pg||
nt|fabsayc: blame it all on Kantar|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: That explains it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks Bas  that explains 5@H :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: He says he made three wrong calls :)|pg||
nt|ady: need the club finesse|pg||
nt|fabsayc: operator, what was 2@C please?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: so   2236 or 2227|pg||
nt|ahollan1: invite opposite max -- seems forcing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe vP can change his mind|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yep  otherwise i'd sleep|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS leads vs NT = 4th|pg||
nt|riccho:  more than a single imp now...|pg||
pc|s9|nt|bobholl: good news for drijver knows his save is good now|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: westra might get a long trump if drijver misguesses in @c|pg||
nt|jaapfr: he is thinking about not becoming trump short|pg||
nt|mcphee: ruffed with a natural as it happens|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|twcho: both this bd and the last one looks like another 2 flat bds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wrong side but can the defense take their @H AND kill dummy?|pg||
nt|penseur9:  probable @C lead here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: really?   auction seems to highlight @H weakness|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Kantar would have been able to ask for keycards at lower level|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i agree 4@H would make after 1nt opening|pg||
pc|sT|nt|gsper:  Voice comentators suggest that they may not support D this high|pg||
nt|ady: there are losing options|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm a @D leader too -- which is why systems in college geared to having me on lead|pg||
nt|ady: if declarer guages this a 4 card suit  then best to cross and take heart finesse|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in this case 3 wrongs = a right|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|penseur9:  you have a point Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and @SKxxx might look for tap|pg||
nt|ahollan1: see   just as i told you   my leads are terrible|pg||
nt|gsper:  A kib confirms that|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi all:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good-o  so now he agrees that he did have 2@C opener :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: anyway  nice recovery|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Verhees asking why vP didn't lead @S|pg||
nt|djneill:  may see a supernatural resurrection|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H @H promotes a trump trick, doesn't it?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pg||
nt|jaapfr: oeff luckily @CA and @DA not in other hands|pg||
nt|gsper:  Wlc, Marshall|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a few pairs can jump to 3@H/@S to show 4441 hands, but most use to show (31)(54)|pg||
nt|mcphee: could try 9@C|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: now down a lot|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: south has 2 @H entries AND @C length to give ruffs|pg||
nt|bobholl: 380 difference indeed|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry 800|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: 5@c -1 on bd 20 a push with 110 in 2@h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: must cash @DA first|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: nice finesse|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzvc: Schollaardt ai, when he sees @Hq|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: West takes a toilet break|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: 3@D was 15-17 with 4@H, like a old school 3@H bid|pg||
nt|penseur9:  13 IMPs on  18 for HWH OR in 3nt only|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Gerbrand -- can you explain this tournament   is it a seasonal/year long event??  does it impact selection of international team??|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: it's basicly the premier league|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: it was a 12 team double round robin|pg||
nt|bobholl: so 3@H from bertens not as good as i said :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: well, that depends, without 3@h brink-drijver might have stopped below 5@c|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|ady: in 5@D  if south leads a heart   must duck first round and later discard a heart on club|pg||
pc|d2|nt|psyck: didnt expect trump to break i guess|pg||
nt|psyck: may have escaped for -1 if a 3rd round of trumps were drawn as cards are|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|nt|bobholl: good guesses always help :)|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ady: when this loses   has the option of diamond break   or club finesse|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|c3|pg||
mc|10|nt|twcho: maybe a imp to EW|pg||
nt|famus: this needs handling|pg||
nt|vugraphzxn: 2c = h+?|pg||
pg||
