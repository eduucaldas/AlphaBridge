pc|s7|nt|fluffy: even with double fit and good lie of cards 3@h is doomed|pg||
nt|petergill: Well done in @D - South decided it's too risky for West to underlead @DA there|pg||
nt|beauch:  now declarer may get home|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @CQ onside is first bit of bad news|pg||
pc|sT|pg||

nt|ahollan1: in other vugraph match  both tables played 2@S|pg||

nt|beauch:  apparently won dutch teams by 1 imp!|pg||

mb|2C|mb|d|nt|fabsayc: mcgann should bid 6@C|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: 3NT ?|pg||
nt|fluffy: Nakamura has to decide between 1NT and 3@c with normal methods first|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: i vote 1NT|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: maybe 1@d is there ?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: humm, off shape 1NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i shouldn't waffle|pg||
nt|beauch:  auction at other table was a little unusual- east overcalled 4@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh   that one :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in context of a Big Club system    jumps to 4 of partner's major are wide range|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|pole_as_ch: oh ! south trys!|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 3NT ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they can be the typical  preempt OR  an opening bid with no slam interest [typically 3-fit]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D relay  but unlike Precision  doesn't show ANY points|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=5+@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|eamongall: its about 2 years since I did vugraph so I don't remember exactly |pg||
nt|eamongall: how to change the score|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: but i also do|pg||
nt|ahollan1: rumor mill [web page not updated yet]   thru 7 of 12 rounds    china W2 134, Bulg A stars 131, ontaka 130, china Geely auto NEDUK down under 129 , Hackett 126 Stmatov 123|pg||
nt|petergill: Because their other openings are mostly 9-13, NS regard 14+ as "strong"|pg||
nt|petergill: North feeling uncomfortable, as 3@D might be a 4-2 fit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL was takeout|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S invite|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: certainly he had better chance than in other room|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if this is not good enough they need to revise system, considering east also had 2nt for minors|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|fluffy: 1NT will make 3NT a make because east won't lead a diamond|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: same as OR. and plsy ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems rich with minimum 1@C opener and weak suits|pg||
nt|petergill: Best for N to pass, as 3@S would be doubled by W|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Newell PASS just denies ability to game force|pg||
pc|c8|nt|pole_as_ch: 3rd hand should open on good suit, i dare say. |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: so i may open 1@h.|pg||
nt|kemperg: why not 3@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  20  the ladies are in 2N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D implies desire to play in suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: here South has @C stop  and they tend not to lead @S after showing 4+|pg||
pc|c5|nt|beauch:  looks like 2 down?|pg||
nt|cc469: I think if you bid 2@C you have to be prepared to bid your 4 card @S suit if the opportunity arises ( which it did here)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so invite for most likely game   with 2N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can't jump with south hand when playing standard because the 1@H opener could have up to  20 hcp|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D lead looks normal  but  will be wrong|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kemperg: but only invite?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|pole_as_ch: difficult contruct. to make and to defend|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: East can easily slow-in and end-played, nightmare|pg||
nt|xenya: one can sympathise with S. who wanted to show good cards in @C with the 2N bid -- still her hand is more suit=oriented|pg||
pc|c4|nt|pole_as_ch: humm. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: for both of our pairs non 1@C openers have maximum of 15 hcp|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thru  21   Oz Players over Bulgarian All Stars by 5 imps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Stamatov is also a team of Bulgarians|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|fluffy: the hand will make 11 tricks comfortable, but if you look in isolation the hand you would rather play 6@c than 3NT before the lead since clubs 2-2 mean 6@c makes and @c3-1 put 3NT ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: in danger|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kemperg: right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course easier to bid South hand when you have tools like Gazilli or Cole |pg||
nt|ahollan1: if I was North   i would have rebid 2@S instead of 2@D|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d6|nt|pole_as_ch: c.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 8 or 9 trick.|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW play GhN)estem  but that still uses  1M-(2N) as 2 lowest unbid|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: this bd now is 17imp swing. +10 or -7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and that is actually what Gold did|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|beauch:  peter what would you overcall with east hand over a1@S opener|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes it does|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|nt|pole_as_ch: @dQ steal and @c ruff will be 10 |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: he not yet knows bad break of trump|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|pole_as_ch: if my method, @c is good. so 6@c would be in scope.|pg||
nt|fluffy: lead directing openings in third are fine but they are most useful when you open light on the 10-12 range, with 16 there is not as much lead directing need IMO|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: well.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: !Q ?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|petergill: Not sure - 4@C? 3@C? 2@C?  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course, now they're getting too high in the other room, but I'd still bid 2@S :)|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: @cQ ??|pg||

nt|ahollan1: @C from East is no treat against 4@S|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@D=10-15 hcp, 5+@H & 4+@D|pg||
nt|kemperg: ty|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 5C by S is best but 3N obviously maes as cards lie|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S is the ONLY weak 2 in the NS arsenal|pg||
mb|2D!|an|puppet to 2!H|nt|ahollan1: Verhees still has a chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: yes six was a total mystery in open room also|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so we're skeptical about overtricks on 22 & 24|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H = max of 15 HCP|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S wishing he had more room, is coming straight off a hand where lack of space kept his side out of 5m as only making games|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Danailov might be playing Precision here|pg||
nt|petergill: The suitable vulnerability, position (dealer) and suit texture are the reasons for Martin Reid's expert 4@H opening|pg||
nt|petergill: which has vaulted the World Champions overboard|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=relay   game force or INV in @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL includes strong NT   so not necessarily traditional shape|pg||
mb|2N|an|puppet to 3!C|nt|ahollan1: 3N = 55 with 1@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but what a singleton|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that is result of playing artificial 1N Overcalls  [Raptor]|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: 4@h can make for EW ???|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems contradictory to use @SK to have points to open then show singleton @S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: will achieve half the goal of reaching 5C by S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: H lead on the way|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|eamongall: 2@Hs and 1 @C was originally to be lost ..|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: oh ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Eddie Manfield wouldn't approve    "thinking of bidding 5 over 5?  DON'T   the 5 level belongs to the opponents"   was a BOLS Bridge Tip from Ed|pg||
nt|xenya: very true|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 24  2@D made  5 imps to Indonesia|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Gold opened the North hand|pg||
nt|kemperg: and more to come on this hand:(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS has found a @S fit - just a question of how high the bidding goes|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: i'm told both Bulgarian Pairs are playing Precision|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the threatening defense was a heart lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's consistent with what i found for 2009 Bermuda Bowl|pg||
nt|fabsayc: should put in the 10 for extra dummy entry|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: no, @d ruff i lost. sry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course   sometimes the opponents bid 6 over 5 :)|pg||
nt|petergill: I don't like 6@h much. The assumption that partner has very short spades can be faulty, as on the actual hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and the Kings are defensive, not offensive|pg||
nt|petergill: Also, the partner of a fav vul prempter has to take into account that the fav vul prempt might make bidding a lot later very risky|pg||
nt|petergill: @DQ lead would be good for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: but now declarer can manage 11 tricks |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Dawei's hummar would strick the 7 ??|pg||
nt|petergill: Trump lead looks dangerous - opponents might have hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@H snatching defeat from the jaws of victory|pg||
nt|kemperg: who is to blame:(|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Verhees could not overcall 1N   that would show  4@S and 5+@C/@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: E thus finds the best lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure what S showed with his auction. on surface one would suspect just a lot of shape (since no cue over 4C), which would mean 6C was a bit of a punt, but very likely there are ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: minimum expectations and possibly other 4-level calls over 4C would have some specialized meanings that dont fit the hand|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|pc|s6|nt|pole_as_ch: no! same contruct! reasonable one !|pg||

nt|ahollan1: how's that for useless trivia?|pg||
nt|eamongall: we can see the correct board but maybe the players have a different one ...probably gets cancelled unless played same in other room |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we've had it all this match esp boards 1 & 2|pg||
nt|eamongall: I missed those 2 boards ... only landed for boards 3 forward |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: was played correctly with W opening|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Nakamura's skill gains 11 imps.|pg||
nt|petergill: Scores after Round 7 at http://www.jcbl.or.jp/home/English/nec/17th/results/tabid/659/Default.aspx|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  27  identical auction in other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: upgrade to 1@C opener?|pg||
nt|brgpro: 7@dXX...hmmm|pg||
nt|marlowepi: NS were on their way to +100 there. double dummy S can pass of course for 200, but the danger in that course was not lost on S. still, partner is extremely unlikely not to have 3 ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: defensive tricks and the hearts are woeful, so there is certainly a case for pass. at MPs it would be clear to do so|pg||
nt|kemperg: On 9 also in 6@C|pg||
nt|kemperg: in OR|pg||
nt|gizzydrop: i think pass in down the middle of the fairway|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|ahollan1: 11-13 bal or any 17+|pg||
nt|eamongall: was wondering about the new 2@D opening by Hanlon |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes had me enthralled|pg||
nt|eamongall: operator just said board is upside down so probably we will just see the result |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Now Senior is leader, but only 2 imps.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 3 bd remains, include this.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 3 bd remains include this.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: oh! light open by Dawei !|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 14+|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15 hcp, 0+@D  if 2-suit then LONGER @C/@S, but not @H|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|Walddk4: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=19597|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh! ugry weak 2 open !|pg||
nt|brgpro: both X and XX are funny i think...u dont gain much (maybe 1 imp) by Xing but mightta lose more|pg||
nt|kemperg: but there S bid 4@H cue after 4@C, so N could not get on the brakes|pg||
mb|1S|nt|fabsayc: i am still trying to figure out who M.I.A is, sounds like some spy organization|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N took a shot on this last one of blwng EW out of 4S. would rate to be more effective at favorable colors, as you might go down enough at 3N to keep any prospective gain for your ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: side fairly small. meanwhile they might not make game for a variety of reasons.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|pole_as_ch: No game for NS|pg||
nt|petergill: these two teams were =4th, though obviously that is no longer the case|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the closed room, Gold showed 25+ balanced with his 2NT rebid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this bidding should help them get to slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: why?   3N - all pass very possible|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW have done great job taking away bidding space|pg||
nt|petergill: EW have pinpointed likely short spades in South, from North's point of view|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=INV, 6+@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  INV+|pg||
nt|brgpro: once W opens 1@d (11-15) i don't think they will be in grand |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 suiters bad for Relay|pg||
mb|4S|nt|fabsayc: 3nt not making unless clubs run, and if so isnt 6c on?|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk4: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=3564  Jerry Stamatov|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Same auction as OR, and ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 24  [5@D-2]  Gold sold out to 4@H North|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: what side gain + score ?|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@C by South, and I think North, either slowly or quickly, will go all the way to 6@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lucky not to get 4@DI would say|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=good 11-14|pg||
nt|xenya: i might pass as S -- but Tueje has no fear|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'd expect pretty much this distribution of hcp  so PASS figures to lose a couple of imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=4518  Tom Hanlon, also a world class poker player|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=4519  Hugh McGann|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahhh  a picture of Hanlon|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@S is about as ugly a bid as imaginable, i treat 2@C as a cue bid on that auction|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: it looks like push.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh buyed 3@D, and....|pg||
nt|petergill: cf Bd 19 where at fav vul sometimes they break 4-4|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Great point by Martin, assuming EW spades 5-4 not 4-4|pg||
pc|dA|nt|pole_as_ch: Lead of @s2 is showing 3 card, maybe. |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Ito should call this, he surely|pg||
nt|brgpro: E will pull this|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: i wager 2@H would get some votes in Master Solvers' Club|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: board upside-down|pg||
nt|gizzydrop: this looks like final contract, nowhere for north to go and some defence to 4@S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: these are very instructive hands for us, because all these ill-starred decisions could easily be triumphs on a different day|pg||
nt|gizzydrop: looks like a trump lead would have been best|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so failure of NS to DBL 5@D more costly than feared|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk2: He'll raise|pg||
nt|petergill: I expect and hope for 6@C now|pg||
nt|kemperg: not the first 26  pts hand in this tournament:|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Reid's problem is that Newell could be 1444 with no @CQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but does that hand rebid 5@C over 4@S?|pg||
nt|petergill: It's not so obvious to NS that the match has turned out badly so far - e.g. their 2@H making five (Bd 23?) might be a pickup from their point of view|pg||
nt|fabsayc: even then he has diamond hook, also 7 not impossible|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: UG. ducking ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N should be delighted to pass. not simply endplayed into it|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: 2@H by South|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlucky choice of leads|pg||
pc|s2|nt|cc469: a dearth of entries to dummy|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: so  my guess of 3N-all pass was just a little off|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe that hand would bid 4NT, Al, choice of games|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very well done Martin Reid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right  so Newell 5@C does sound like 5+ suit|pg||
nt|petergill: also well done to Sartaj Hans not to bid 2@S at other table which might lead NS to 6@C|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks to everyone in Yokohama in Japan for today's broadcast. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: tomorrow  final 4 rounds of 14-board matches in the Qualifying Swiss.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: top 8 teams advance to Knockout|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: humm.  can make by @s finess.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|pole_as_ch: sry bd 24 & 25|pg||
nt|brgpro: that is a good call...4NT...he will get 2 KC answer...what would the KC be?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|nt|marlowepi: trump lead comes best from S hand, i think|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|brgpro: what about 5@c on 3NT Al?|pg||
nt|brgpro: after he has shown 6+@s and preference for @d, that must be exclusion for @d|pg||
nt|ahollan1: have to confess   this is first time i've seen the auction where 2@H bidder had game force hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so i'm not sure about the rest of the bids|pg||
nt|brgpro: he will get the right answer but, then if pd has 2+@h and no @h control, he will also be in trouble|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but  Exclusion Keycard  .... very dangerous when partner has shown the suit|pg||
nt|brgpro: so 4@d was OK as long as he gets a @h cue and , he wasn't looking for a perfection 7 anyway, after all, his pd opened a limited 1@d|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: don't run away our last board is  30   [started with  17]|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N will be ready to play a heart honor when declarer leads one from dummy to his king or queen|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|pole_as_ch: No damaged.|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|eamongall: ah yes ..I remember .. 2@Ds includes a 4414 distribution |pg||
nt|kemperg: @C now will promote @S9|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: now @C hook?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: EW 1N opening is 14-16  so  McGann rebid shows 17+|pg||
nt|ahollan1: declarer didn't start out thinking 4 @H tricks|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|c3|pg||
pc|hK|nt|pole_as_ch: bd 26 is 3NT by E !|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh! can reach to dummy and run @d !!|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: but if @cK comes then|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: surely Hans will lead it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We are adding voice commentary from the quarter-finals Friday and onwards -->|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|pole_as_ch: Chen should make for -3 imps, sigh !|pg||
nt|brgpro: now he might make 7|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: taking the plus score|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|brgpro: that makes no difference in imps anyway|pg||
pc|hT|nt|marlowepi: am trying to understand ace of hearts|pg||
nt|kemperg: still 1 trick short|pg||
nt|kemperg: duck had given leader more to think about|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: open room 6@C-1 is same score|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: right   overkill|pg||
nt|brgpro: 17|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|nt|brgpro: he will claim 7 after N shows a @s on this|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s9|nt|ahollan1: good discarding by south|pg||
