nt|sybarra: we have you Al, and will rely on you |pg||
nt|ahollan1: they play a forcing 1@C  [but weaker than precision]  and transfer openings|pg||
nt|sybarra: so hang on to you seats specs |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i belive China Geely Auto pair in other room is playing Precision|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think e/w play precision |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: this also looks good fight|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: hello all|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Kazuo and welcome back |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: hello Gary|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: humm, same line up|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: might change members , i think|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so a 33 imp lead to the Down Unders may be hard to peg back for ONI|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 64 board Championship match   4x16-board segments|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the Swiss Qualifying  Down Under eeked out 16-14 VP win|pg||

nt|ahollan1: other table visible with bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||

mb|2C|an|PRECISION|mb|2S|nt|andyv:  we will have the names up shortly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW might be Verhees-van Prooijen  with 1@C=16+ unbal or 18+ bal|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hey Andy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N(11)12-14 HCP  EXCEPT unfav = 13-15|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 32 board final  split in 2 16-board segments|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Hi Gary|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: u forget, 16 bd are there|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: @H 9-13|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=9-13 hcp, unbal, 4+@S  maybe longer @C/@D|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this looks like moscito|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C strong|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S weak two, can be five cards|pg||
nt|petergill: There was an earthquake today in Japan, but in both this Final and in the Consolation event, the players just kept on playing bridge - that's bridge for you.|pg||
nt|petergill: thanks to Heather Dhondy in Yokohama for that information|pg||
nt|petergill: there is some danger of EW getting overboard - 6NT by West needs @D 2-2|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|andyv:  http://www.jcbl.or.jp/home////tabid/223/Default.aspx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S consistent with Dutch system    when 1@H overcall artificial  1@S=game force balanced hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: we have the ladies agst the women,  not sure difference  age maybe?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Alert of 1@D implies  West=Verhees  East=vanProoijen|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Name is not right ! Operater pls|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 1@C 14+|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: oh no I just think 33 a LOT|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: sure! very big|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: fit showing jumo|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: not so long|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D = 6+@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: PASS will show LONGER @D|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think against this system i will need penalty double cards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my guess  East is the one who is thinking|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes, worried about getting all his clothes stolen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: going back to reference of Moscito   there are many similarities with Transfer Moscito   both systems developed around the same time|pg||
mb|3S|nt|kiwibridge: hi Kazuo @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: we will get names up shortly  just relax |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i believe E=vanProoijen and W=Verhees|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so    2@D denies 4@H else  Raptor 1N overcall|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and relay structures both mostly Symmetric|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D GF, natural|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@H natural, forcing. 3@S by East asks for spade stop|pg||
mb|4C|nt|kiwibridge: S playing 2@H OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: 1@s alert ??|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: looks like 4@h |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: this two team matched in RR|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@D to show the 6th @D|pg||
nt|petergill: 6NT makes, I think 6@C survives any ruffs|pg||
nt|petergill: Will West content himself with 3NT, or do more? |pg||
nt|petergill: More ...|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: EW carding will be  upside-down count & attitude   odd/even discard|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 2@s wanna TRF to 3@c but opener ???|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NEDUK is trying to defend the title they won in 2011|pg||
nt|ahollan1: China Geely Auto won the Qualifying Swiss  so got to choose both the opponent and semi-final bracket|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: but 6 is there, can they reach ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: after round 8 they were leading the Swiss Qualifying|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Down Under needed  22 VP win to get into final 8th spot|pg||
nt|petergill: Can they stop in time? Even 4@D fails!|pg||

nt|petergill: Welcome to Michael Courtney (dalzielpas)|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@H stopper ask|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@D intended as forcing, but will go down. It's a funny game, bridge|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sybarra: and starting with a slam |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: good decison again by Peter Newell he has had an excellent day|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sybarra: and arriving gracefully |pg||
nt|ahollan1: top 8 teams advance to Knockout Phase|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: ??|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: so high|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Operater, Right Name, pls !! |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 2@s is FG ??  maybe.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: team fairy tale is good team, but domestic member |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 2@c is @s supp ??|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Down under wins 21-9|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they've both excelled to reach this stage|pg||
nt|petergill: E will think that W has @HK for 3NT = good news for possible slam|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: other tables visible without login  http://bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php   [one window per room]|pg||
nt|petergill: This club lead looks better for the defence than a trump lead, maybe|pg||
nt|cc469: he had better make this since 4@S was going down on a @D lead|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: swiss team qualifies 8 teams to knockout phase|pg||
nt|ahollan1: swiss matches  14 boards in 2 hours|pg||
nt|andyv:  this is the 17th NEC Cup as the above site mentions|pg||
nt|petergill: The NS team is Klinger - Mullamphy - Jacobs - Thompson from Australia|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: humm, normal? game, but @h|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: @d10 or 9 ?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: no. West, @dQ ?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: y|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: but 5@hX in OR !?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|eamongall: I think the names are left over from previous match as Brown Stockdale are English Ladies |pg||
nt|ahollan1: NEDUK won the 2011 NEC Cup|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room 3N after 13-15 NT|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/home/English/nec/17th/results/tabid/659/Default.aspx  <= result, but not New.|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D 8+ points, 5+ @D|pg||
pc|c4|nt|pole_as_ch: auuu, pennarized !|pg||
pc|c8|nt|petergill: -2, -3 and -1 all look possible|pg||
nt|petergill: Hard for declarer to place East with the @D honours on this bidding|pg||
nt|petergill: 2NT was both minors|pg||
nt|petergill: The names shown on BBO are remnants from Round 11|pg||
nt|sybarra: think I might rather be in 2 nt here |pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: operater, Right names, Pls !!|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Operater, should show Players sir Name clearly, i think|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: esp for Japanese, home team are here !|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: very honorable|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: on the non @D lead this may make 12|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: @HJ ???|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the aussies have doubled in the OR alas|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: y |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 5 imps would add up|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mrdct: based on what's entered for the open room - we have Thompson-Jacobs EW here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: notice he could not afford to duck first club for lack of hand entry|pg||
pc|cT|nt|eamongall: however I am sure it will get fixed when operator gets a break in the play :) ...its very hard to be a vugraph operator |pg||
nt|ahollan1: can take marked @C finesse later|pg||
nt|ahollan1: "marked" by @C9 lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bulgarian All Stars were 3rd in the Qualifying Swiss   and last night they dispatched the defending champion NEDUK|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: EW convention card from their 2011 Bermuda Bowl win  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Netherlands/vanprooijen-verhees.pdf|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NEDUK is the defending champion from 2011 NEC|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: any chance to make ???|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: clear trump then @d |pg||
nt|cc469: dec has to play S for @DA which he probably won't do|pg||
nt|petergill: @CJ discard to deny the queen|pg||
nt|petergill: I cannot recall Australia or New Zealand players ever winning a major overseas bridge event like the NEC Cup. |pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: charrenging contruct |pg||
nt|petergill: I don't think there's any squeeze for the overtrick|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|nt|mrdct: Thompson-Jacobs use methods based on the Fantunes system|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Down Under had big last round match to grab the final [8th] slot in the KO|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mrdct: yes - it looks like the vugraph weren't given the hand data files until right on starting time|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|andyv:  all's well despite the bad @h break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tournament page  http://www.jcbl.or.jp/home/////tabid/657/Default.aspx    includes links to much useful info including Daily Bulletins that include Team Rosters and Conditions of ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Contest|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h9|pc|h2|nt|pole_as_ch: oh ? can make ??|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we won't have Voice Commentary until the Knockout Phase|pg||
nt|petergill: Ace and a small club might have worked better, with partner having such good @d's and West having poor @D pips|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  no seven|pg||
pc|c5|nt|eamongall: Usually there is one person who goes around the vugraph tables and loads the hands each match ...I have done it ... its a busy time |pg||
pc|s3|nt|kiwibridge: who loads the names :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other tables are visible without login via http://bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mrdct: trumps looks best here|pg||
nt|petergill: If declarer picks @DQ with E, then -1 is possible|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|hA|nt|cc469: good evening? all - I'm Carl Chadwick from Canada|pg||
pc|h5|nt|petergill: other table is slam-bound too|pg||
pc|hT|nt|pole_as_ch: Operater !!!  Players name!  Right players name !!!  pls !!!|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: cl !|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|cc469: my bad - well done :)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|andyv:  a @s lead would probably have been better as E wouldn't be able to pull all the trump before he knocked out the A of @c|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Do we have Jacobs - Thompson   N-S   Dave?|pg||
nt|eamongall: Every event has new operators and after a few rounds they become experienced and learn stuff |pg||
nt|mrdct: but as it happens a low trump was going to work better as east is forced to rise Q and then doesn't have the tempo to take his trick|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: y|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Walddk2: EW rather|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|petergill: but declarer has to allow for the fact that West might not overruff @D7 with @DQ|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
mc|12|nt|petergill: Hence this play which leads to 500 I think|pg||

nt|ahollan1: that will slow down Reid|pg||
nt|rick3son:  Roland are a Man U fan?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: voice commentary for both tables in the final quarter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Newell has absolute max of 13 hcp|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my guess is a [reluctant] 3N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but move @CQ to @DQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so maybe 3N isn't right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hans opened the North hand with 2@S|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: 3@H asks controls  [A=2 K=1]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this takes them past 3N|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: i think step 1 = 2|pg||

nt|rick3son:  we are haeding to a likely minus for east west now|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|d6|pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: total of 12 tricks in the deck  AAAA=8  KKKK=4|pg||

nt|ahollan1: other table  4@D East|pg||
nt|fabsayc: last time i checked there were 13 tricks :)|pg||
nt|rick3son:  5 or 6 rounds of bidding later the smoke has cleared|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm uncertain about 4N   i think it is part of denial cue bidding, but always get confused there without being able to peek at my toes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: last chance for plus|pg||
nt|xenya: most will bid slam with these cards|pg||
nt|rick3son:  spade lead yields 10th trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the good news   4@D went down|pg||
nt|xenya: i retract :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ok here's a guess   4N = top card in @D [longest suit]  NO top card in @S [2nd longest]|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: much better to go down in 6@D than down in 4@D  :)|pg||

nt|andyv:  that's where they were saturday:)|pg||
nt|mrdct: pages 3&4 for bill & ben|pg||
nt|mrdct: so in the EW methods all one-level openings are frocing for one round|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed,    N-S are    Stamatov - Karianov|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They play Precision|pg||
nt|mrdct: so about 14+hcp|pg||
nt|sybarra: how did we not make 6 @C?|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh I see,  the @D ruff :( unlucky |pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if Yeh partnerships are playing standard or some Precision pairs|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: good start for FT|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: and 1 imp to oz|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: oz/nz |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: ok|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Down Under is mix of pairs   Newell-Reid  [New Zealand]   Hans-Nunn  [Australia]|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  2 imps to anzacs|pg||
nt|petergill: 6NT has 2 advantages - no ruffs, and 2 imps extra if it makes|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: and NS   akama-maruyama  [not sure who's where]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=game force   a bunch of hand types  in this case  balanced  [no singleton or void]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my dream is that someday  BBO will work on software for operator and there will be functionality to just INSERT PASS  instead of having to do all of those UNDOs|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: EW in OR is team leader of FT.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: They use Blue club oriented system.|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry, 500 was only possible if West ducked @CK (he played ace) - even then it might be 300|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: fufufufu|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: comes some noise|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: some randon 2 suiter?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: P-1@C-P-  then  1@H=4+@S|pg||

nt|dalzielpas:  by ns after lead|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: 1@S RELAY  |pg||
nt|mrdct: btw - i'm going to predict bill jacobs is sitting east as ben thompson is a bit more agressive and would probably open 1@s with the east cards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, Bill is always E and N I noticed|pg||
nt|mrdct: believe it or not i've never noticed that|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Normal ? 2/1, i guess|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mrdct: i think the 1st two matches are up|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: well passed Martin|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: hewww|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 2@c ?  or X ?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh @c|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Yamada with 16 may have been surpised to hear pard bid after a strong @C on his right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=a) 0-5 HCP  b) 6-8 HCP, BAL  c) 6+ HCP, 0 controls|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it varies with seat, al?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=16-18   unless Newell upgrades to 1@H [any 19+]|pg||

pc|hA|nt|pole_as_ch: NS in this room are wife(N) & hus(S)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: operator won't be able to lead   so then auction should get fixed|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: 2@C balanced  8-11 or 15+ hcp|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/home////tabid/223/Default.aspx  for tournament website. No results yet I'm afraid. They only update the page once a day if memory serves|pg||
nt|mrdct: poor result for Oz in the open room|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: sry, i have no detail about Chaina Geely Auto members|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=ART, a) 9-12 HCP, 2+ controls, BAL [include 5@C/@D(332)  b) 6-9 HCP, 1-suit 5+@H [bad suit else opening bid]|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i meant the 1@C opening|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes 1/2 is 14+ 3/4 is 16+|pg||
nt|petergill: Qx and Jxx are minus factors, balancing out the plus factor in clubs, hence 1NT not 1@C by Tony Nunn|pg||
nt|ahollan2:   49  Newell-Reid  6@D East|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mrdct: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/home/English/nec/17th/results/7thFeb/tabid/665/Default.aspx|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: just shape, he knows|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes  1st/2nd seat = 14+ unbal, 16+ bal    3rd/4th=16+ unbal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  1st/2nd  15+ bal|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|sybarra: or a transfer bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N relay    2@C = a) (332)5@C/@D  b) 3334@H/@S  c) (32)44 same color|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 5 quick trick|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: @d switch will get down easily, humm|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nunn NOT playing a Big Club   opened 3rd seat 1@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that got defense off to @D lead|pg||
pc|h2|nt|petergill: The undertricks are only 50's|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: 2N broke out of relay so East guaranteed declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vP's 1@S [RHO's suit]  showing the 2 unbid suits|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D asks   and now Reid will show exact shape|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no ambition other than finding the correct game|pg||

pc|hK|nt|pole_as_ch: They (NS) prefer schenken|pg||
nt|sybarra: hopefully we will get the names of players sorted out shortly |pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  down two|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|eamongall: yes first two rounds are up ... and 3rd round was only finished ... |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: if someone teach me |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: S in 2@C OR|pg||
nt|ahollan2:   49 @C lead   bizarre game we play|pg||
nt|petergill: says south is 14.5, right on borderline of 1Nt or 1@C|pg||
nt|petergill: Kaplans Rubens |pg||
pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: 3@D = 4/5@D  not 4@H/@S|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: Andy was referring to the Dutch Premiere League final that was on BBO last weekend|pg||
nt|andyv:  declarer starts with 8 tricks and has 2 4-3 suits to find the 9th, or the @d suit.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no carryover from Swiss Qualifying   only 2 of the Quarter-Final matchups did battle in the Swiss   ours is not one of them|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: y|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: good result oz in OR|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mrdct: the problem in the open rooms is with only one @s stopper you need cashing tricks on top which just weren't there|pg||
nt|sybarra: 9, or 10 tricks |pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW team won by 1 imp after trailing by a bunch after 4 round|pg||
nt|sybarra: or 11 |pg||
pc|cA|nt|andyv:  yes, they certainly made a quick turnaround to get to this tourney|pg||
nt|kemperg: leader may play for 3@D at siide of 3!@Hs, that wont work|pg||
nt|kemperg: down now, cant finesse twice anymore|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: it's not unreasonable to play 1@S as natural even though RHO has shown 4+  since 1N by passed hand is available to show the 2 unbid|pg||
nt|vugraphzws: Sorry for wrong bits.|pg||
nt|sybarra: tese are left over from last match |pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 17  5@DX East|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: only 200 this may be worse|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 1 trick more for defence, where ?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: i cannot find|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh, 2 more !|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Strong Club 14+ 1/2 seat, 16+ 3/4 seat - from cc|pg||
nt|ahollan1: cute @SQ|pg||
nt|petergill: Will West get squeezed? Will he bare honours smoothly? Will South pick it?|pg||
nt|petergill: @S5 then @S4 by west suggests W has 5 spades not 4 spades|pg||
nt|petergill: could play for @HK onside|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mrdct: needs to make this to hold the damage to 5 imps - otherwise it's 8 imps out|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm pretty sure  W=Verhees  E=vProoijen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room also in 3N   this hand will be more successful than  1|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they did that last year too|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: looks like push ?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Walddk2: Operator, please insert names        North:  Stamatov     South: Danailov       East: Jacobs      West: Thompson|pg||
pc|d6|nt|petergill: @S4 by W might be suit pref for @DK - without @HK|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: and went on to win the NEC Cup|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|mrdct: in fact when i last played against them i was south and screenmates with bill, but that may have been because ben didn't want to be screenmates with me|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: curious that South didn't overcall this time|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s5|nt|petergill: For NS, 3@C is easy, 3Nt might make on some sort of squeeze on East (but NS have entry problems) and 4@S looks too high|pg||

nt|ahollan1: even on run of @C  [foregoing @H toward Q]   must read the end position|pg||
nt|rick3son:  the early @h discard was excellent play|pg||
nt|xenya: that's right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H to Ace and if @HK doesn't fall, try to pin @DJ in west???|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but perhaps diamond jack discard would have been better than low|pg||
nt|rick3son:  playing toward Q@d is a give up position|pg||
nt|rick3son:  only right in thinks KJ on his right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Reid did well to follow basic tenet   bare king early|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but maybe Kovachev will read THAT|pg||

nt|fabsayc: jack instead of 7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: double-reverse psychology|pg||
nt|rick3son:  much to think about|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: no 2|pg||
nt|petergill: other table is in 3NT on a @H lead - if you go to other table to watch that drama, please come back here afterwards :)|pg||
nt|petergill: NS play UDCA|pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer also could not afford to exit a spade at Trick 3, if he was going to play for @HK with E|pg||
nt|petergill: Once W has 5 spades, E is favourite to have @HK (more vacant places) so South went with the odds|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: DBL includes strong NT hands  since  1N overcalls are artificial|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: if so, south is phych ?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh ! alert comes|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh, bad place|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thought Newell would open 3rd seat favorable|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: not sure if lebensohl situation or 2N=2-places to play   either way  3@C is constructive|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: @cA|pg||
nt|sybarra: not the bid E wanted to hear |pg||
nt|ahollan1: East could have used Raptor 1N overcall to show 4@H/@S & 5+@C  but unfavorable vul and passed partner   =  yuk|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: and @c lead|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: or @s lead, and @c switch ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i know in Ron Klinger's version of transfers over 1@C   his 1@S=4+@D and has 4-card major ONLY IF game force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but not all pairs use 1@S to guarantee @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  this was 3rd seat opener   so  16+|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh, yes, "Color"|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: done !  good lead by newell|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes good night contract I knew you not|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 2 off maybe ?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: what 3@C?|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S is weakish, due to Reverse Drury|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: England ladiesgain big lead in first 2 BD. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: in other room  Precision 1@C - Sartaj Hans did NOT bid with East   so  1@D[neg]-1N end|pg||
nt|sybarra: 1 shouod be no problem |pg||
nt|sybarra: *1nt should not be a problem |pg||
nt|ahollan1: transportation a problem|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and nothing favorable in @S or @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so 7th trick may need help from defenders|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i bet  EW get 7 before NS|pg||
nt|sybarra: will be a mad scramble |pg||
nt|ahollan1: voice commentary talking about  run of @H maybe squeezing West in minors|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Peter takes the advance sac|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: same contract !|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT on Bd 34 is too hard for me to analyse|pg||
nt|petergill: Boring 420 here  |pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  \3nt would be trivial if he could cash 5 clubs and be in hand. with exact defence 3nt willl fail. |pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer has to think about safety plays in @s's (if bare honour offside) and possible @h ruffs|pg||
nt|petergill: I think EW play Standard leads with natural count and secondary suit pref, but I'm not 100% sure|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  he has a lot of possible lines|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: 1@C  14+ with clubs or 15+ balanced|pg||
nt|mrdct: fairly standard these days to play transfers after one-level intervention|pg||
nt|sybarra: not best lead for defense maybe |pg||
nt|sybarra: but I make these leads all the time :( |pg||
nt|sybarra: this is very prestigious event  sponsored by NEC |pg||
nt|petergill: West is M ILIEV|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: y say, good gambling ?|pg||
nt|ahollan2:  Newell's DBL=Game Force Relay (1NT=Min 1 suiter or 5332 or 3-suiter, 2C = Spades)|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: hi Al|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: in OR, only N(=Ino) mentioned |pg||

pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|mrdct: playing preciion in the open room EW never found their @h fit|pg||
nt|mrdct: losing 2@h and a @d here at least|pg||
nt|mrdct: and there's nowhere to put the deep @c loser|pg||
nt|mrdct: so i think this is going to slide one off|pg||
nt|sybarra: no reason to hop yet|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 1@d = 1s + another, some spec tell me.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sybarra: we are in the qualifying rounds  leading to semi's then finals over the weekend |pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room at least sniffed at slam, but vanProoijen 3@S left much less room for exploration|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all matches are 14 boards, but the venue always plays  1-14  and  17-30|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: but then, N's 2@d ???|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|nt|petergill: NS lead 3rd/low vs suit, 4th vs NT, UDCA|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: defense has to be careful not to setup declarer's 2nd @S|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i have no idea :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i have some old Convention Cards for Zejun -- but not with this partner|pg||

nt|petergill: 1@D Precision|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Other table: I have to admit that I prefer 4@S on Bd 19 to 3@S and think Australia fully deserved their 6 imps|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Dec is E, different from OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 4@D implies  "i know what to do when they bid 4@H/@S"|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Nunn opened 1@C [1st/2nd seat weak NT]  passed around to 3N|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they are playing 3n NS in open room on a very unusual auction|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|pole_as_ch: Y, N's 2@h is very natural.|pg||
nt|petergill: @HQ = unblock jack if you have it|pg||

pc|c8|nt|pole_as_ch: East might try @d. but 3, so she choiced pass.|pg||

nt|petergill: Rather than give onself a bidding problem by bidding 2NT, Martin overcalled 1@H, allowing the NS bidding to evolve without complication|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: WHO would bid 2NT anyway|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: sacre bleu|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  the 2@h bid may have caused EW to underestimate their values|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 1@s open because of Scenken system.|pg||
nt|mrdct: so west's actions have talked NS out of 3NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @C probably said @H's and S taking a chance on 3 nt |pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 19  2@CX was +580  and 13 imps to China Geely Auto|pg||
nt|mrdct: but i could be mistaken|pg||
nt|ahollan2:  2@H=@S, 8-14 HCP, usually BAL  a) 3@S  b) 4@S, min|pg||
nt|ahollan2:  2N = max, 5+@S, forcing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C stayman OR game force relay   [so the alert]|pg||
nt|petergill: East cannot get to dummy for his 10 tricks in @S contracts - thus 4@S goes down|pg||
mb|2C|nt|pole_as_ch: 3@h is safe ! or some snag ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other table  5@H South|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think with new ACBL rules that won't be an alert in north america|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: and put south on the spot to perhaps bid a failing slam|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think S is looking for tricks here |pg||
nt|ahollan1: probably not a hand with slam interest - that would start with 2@C [stayman OR game force relay]|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: luck he had 9 tops here|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Isporski had a chance to defend against 2@CX  but pulled and also 3N North|pg||
nt|petergill: Pass or Dbl?|pg||
nt|petergill: On the spade lead, there appear to be 9 tricks but there might be communication problems|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: i played many boards against this pair in the semi finals of our Nationals 2 weeks ago (they won), but I have never played their system|pg||
nt|ahollan2:  unfavorable vul    1N=13-15|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: welcome Al who is an expert on the Newell-Reid system|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: viora !|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and that lead lets it thru for sure |pg||
nt|mrdct: declarer will be a bit worried about getting tapped-off here|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Bill would regrett Not to go, maybe|pg||
nt|mrdct: only if he makes 12 tricks - which isn't guaranteed|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: ah the @D lead ty opps|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: just another flat push :)|pg||
nt|ahollan2:  all tables getting the @D lead|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: it is very PASSIVE|pg||

nt|petergill: @SK is badly located, so Pass 4@S|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mrdct: a hard-eartned 1-imp swing for Oz|pg||
nt|petergill: Non spade lead beats 4@S, @S lead is the only bad one|pg||
pc|c4|nt|dalzielpas:  north has done heaps already|pg||
nt|petergill: Things going unluckily for Dwon Under|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the question seems to be   does 5@H make with 4-0 trump slit  AND 4-2 @C|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: but @c8 is funny carding.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes Al|pg||
nt|petergill: Tough lead for South - unlucky this time|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pole_as_ch: y, now -2.|pg||
nt|petergill: Holding @DQx, East was in no hurry to give partner a ruff with West's 3rd (long) trump|pg||
nt|petergill: Also, if North had have played @S8 at Trrick 1, East could not tell if W had @S432 (playing UDCA)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: the good news -- that one board wasn't enough to change the result of the match|pg||

nt|ahollan1: the question that partnerships must answer    over DBL what is difference between RDBL and 2@D|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: 11 boards to go 45 imps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H must show @H & minor|pg||
nt|ahollan1: stopped both South and West from opening 1@H :)|pg||
nt|petergill: previous board: the 3424 hand gives South a very unlikely vul 2@D overcall, so perhaps "erred" is an OK word to use|pg||

mb|3D|mb|3H|nt|pole_as_ch: uh! 4@h can make, but can they reach to there ?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: there's always that|pg||

nt|sybarra: over 1 nt|pg||
nt|petergill: 5@D seems to be the middle ground of those, which often is the best choice|pg||
nt|petergill: Normal bidding to the good game. 5@HX costs 800 on best defence|pg||
nt|petergill: This should be 450|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: hummm |pg||
nt|petergill: 300 is OK|pg||
pc|dA|nt|petergill: Should South overcall 2@C? Fav vul = good - in Sabine Auken's book, she explains why 3@C overcall of 1@D can work well - EW have 2 unbid majors so might miss the 4-4 major fit. |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 1 off or good/bad ??|pg||

pc|h8|nt|rick3son:  this is why many players are disturbed by exotics|pg||
nt|super nova: I put it into deep finesse and it goes for 800 on low heart lead or AC lead or JC lead the 2h x on the earlier board|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rick3son:  not surprising Jamie, most often best to lead trumps against doubled part scores|pg||

pc|c2|pc|cT|nt|rick3son:  friendly defence is always a welcome sight|pg||

nt|ahollan1: now we find out if NS play weak NT|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: y, 6imp|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: South open ?  i may pass.|pg||
nt|frankaus: unlucky layout here|pg||
nt|frankaus: 4@H making - looks probable |pg||
nt|sybarra: have to keep S from falling in love with hand |pg||
nt|frankaus: bye all - pd here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems all choices there led to -1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C or 1@D for South?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i like systems where transfers over 1@C  include  1@D=unbal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: scores thru round 9 are posted at  http://www.jcbl.or.jp/home/English/nec/17th/results/tabid/659/Default.aspx|pg||
nt|xenya: normal result, although 4@H makes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what do you open Shirley?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: PASS, 2@S, 3@S, 4@s might all get some votes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or in this system   1@H  |pg||
nt|sybarra: hate hands like these |pg||
nt|sybarra: close to opening 1 @S here|pg||
nt|mrdct: dare i suggest a routine 4@s for EW here?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: kiwis will take that|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they are discussing fit jumps in open room on last board, i think not a good idea at that vuls|pg||
nt|dburn: not really, but he might against Grosvenor|pg||
nt|petergill: East got it right - possibly because no @H switch by West = South not 1354 shape|pg||
nt|petergill: other table: Bd 53 has started weak 1NT, 2@C by S (both majors) = danger?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|pole_as_ch: 5@hX is too risky ?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: bad play by E|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: so it goes|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S probably would have made, so chalk that little gain up to the marginal 2@C overcall|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C strong|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the Newell-Reid machine rolls on, taking all in it's wake|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: should try one more ??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C=10-12(13) HCP, 6+@C|pg||
nt|othered1: north has a petty perfect hand for 5@C, down to the @H10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might start with 3@D=RELAY, may stop in 4@C else FG|pg||
mb|3S|mb|3N|nt|pole_as_ch: oh, open! so they go to 4@s !|pg||
nt|ahollan1: don't know what 3@S does to the auction :(|pg||
nt|othered1: can he get enough information from the single relay to make the 4 v 51C judgment?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: probably Reid's bid will show short @S|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@C v. 5@C, rather|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the problem with 3@D is what has actually happened|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  West pass|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  Don Evans died - today i think|pg||
nt|petergill: other table: On Bd 37, Val Kovachev found !AH lead to 4@S, so it might go down 2 or more|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  its going to be very close|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: cu frank |pg||
nt|sybarra: thx for helping |pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D GF ... artificial = @H?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice hand partner!|pg||
nt|mrdct: and too expensive - 1100 probably|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: well 3 off is not payed|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: narrow slam !   6@c !!|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C Precision  most Chinese pairs play 6+@C OR 5@C & 4@H/@S|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 1@s ??|pg||
nt|othered1: EW don't really want to get too high|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  He would stilll bid with West hand|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 53 - Newell and Reid like to play for penalties|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: oh? 4 off !|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the relay finds shortness|pg||
pc|sT|nt|petergill: 2NT asks|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|petergill: 4@H = signoff, minimum |pg||
pc|s5|nt|mrdct: 6@d tricks is a good start for 3NT NS but EW can get to their 5 before NS establish their tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after 9    NEDUK leading with 173   China Geely 2nd with 170|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: @d4|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT = max with only 3 hearts|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  yes dble willl work well|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does 1N deny 4@S?     probably  otherwise North would probably use some form of checkback|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: no, North !  sry|pg||
nt|othered1: 800 here on @D ruff|pg||
nt|petergill: North not really confident about 3NT|pg||
nt|petergill: E thinking about Dbl or Pass|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: 2-way checkback  or  new minor force?    probably 2-way  so  2@D = artificial game force|pg||
nt|twcho: yes, rather standard precision which is suitable for irregular partnership|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: but died !  y, it is normal, but...|pg||
nt|petergill: For aussie specs: 2 days ago - no funeral notice in newspapers yet - perhaps in monday's newspaper |pg||
pc|c4|nt|sybarra: may now get pushed too high?    can they even beat 4 @S?|pg||
nt|sybarra: my pards rarely have hands like that one when I open 4  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: from old card  Zejun @C7  =  odd/even  where odd=like this suit|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: same contract|pg||
nt|mrdct: heading for a normal push|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: i dont know this seq|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: checkback was used in other room so Patrick Huang avoided @S lead -- but his choice of @HK wasn't a success either|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in North America the top big club pairs are playing 2@C always 6+@C|pg||
nt|twcho: and NS aren't regular partners|pg||
nt|ahollan1: mine would have 13 cards   but there the similarity would end|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: c |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 2@S shows minor ? or maybe @c directly|pg||
nt|othered1: Did south's pass show @S shortness?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's my guess|pg||
nt|dburn: would not think so - would be strange if South had to bid with spade length|pg||
nt|petergill: I think I heard a sigh of relief across the whole of New Zealand and Australia|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then again  playing 2-way checkback  South might bid @C|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: well cannot make. but 2 off ?|pg||
nt|petergill: South upgraded his 14 (weak 1NT) to 15 due to good long suit and good cards|pg||
nt|petergill: Even on this lead, surely 4@H has no chance|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sybarra: can N get in to lead club? |pg||
nt|sybarra: just take 4 aces   easier |pg||
nt|petergill: EW can make 4@C|pg||
pc|s4|nt|petergill: Best % play of @h suit in 6@H is ace - picks up bare king in either hand|pg||
pc|s9|nt|petergill: even if N picks everything from the "think about whether to dbl" and the lead?|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  diamond now looks best|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another possible squeeze -- but this one doesn't work|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mrdct: losing 2@c, 1@h and 1@s so need to get @d right to make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in their relays  not uncommon for  PASS=short in overcall  DBL=no shortness  other = short in bid suit|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  ddouble finesses trumpseclarer can make if he |pg||
pc|h5|nt|pole_as_ch: 2NT ?? negative ?|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  if you see what i mean|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  they've got two diamonds and one heart|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mrdct: predicated on a @c switch by west now which may not be so easy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlikely @D plays|pg||
nt|xenya: this should make despite the4-1 trump split -- but some care is needed|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: this will switch @c|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|sybarra: our pards have taken similar lessons it seems |pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  king piching spade then d|pg||
pc|s3|nt|xenya: still can't make it on a @S return|pg||
nt|mrdct: wd bro|pg||
nt|ahollan1: either @DJ still in dummy or @DQ still in hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same opening in other room|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh @h|pg||
nt|petergill: I think Tony has a plan to set up a trick in dummy on a 3-3 break |pg||
pc|d8|nt|petergill: but in 4@H, have to consider if safety play of low to @H queen (picks up KJx in either hand) - is safe or unsafe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's why they are called  CHO    cross-hand opponent|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 3@d may short, or just cue ?|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's better   thanks|pg||
nt|petergill: hence Tony's ducks in the pointed suits|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  im not sure it will be close|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|dalzielpas:  great plkan belittle4d by 4-0 trumps|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mrdct: hi peter|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: ugg|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: @sJ-@d7|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|xenya: but now perhaps...|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: Geely Auto always seems to provide us with a team for the NEC Cup|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  oh i see a low trump now and hes done it|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mrdct: i can't see any reason why he'd get the @dK right here|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: another option   PASS=min|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  i think doomed after ruffing club|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|othered1: How could a 3rd @D have hurt?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|petergill: Well played, still making|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  yes that was tidy|pg||
nt|petergill: Whichever pointed suit E exits, he can win, draw trumps and exit in that suit|pg||
nt|ahollan2:   38  Reid playing 4@SX West|pg||
nt|petergill: So we should have a new leader in the match soon|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks Al|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  likely make overtrick|pg||

pc|s2|nt|pole_as_ch: Hirata is losing sharpness of his own|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: Andy  are you a 2-way checkback  or NMF kinda guy?|pg||

pc|h3|pg||
pc|c8|pc|s8|nt|andyv:  2 way|pg||
nt|petergill: @H Safety play taken, in case there are 2 club losers|pg||

nt|dalzielpas:  yes according to table he could have slotted the heart ten and made|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|c7|pc|sK|nt|andyv:  I live in LA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: [or  2@C always the only checkback]|pg||

pc|d3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you call that living?|pg||

nt|rick3son:  even in the push boards there have been things to talk about|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS play Scanian structure over 1N   after the tournament, i'm going to find out what that means|pg||

mb|p|mb|3C|nt|fabsayc: 3@D?|pg||

nt|fabsayc: what line are we suggesting to make|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no double dummy lines please|pg||
nt|xenya: finesse spades through W? |pg||
nt|rick3son:  double finnesse in @s may be inspired to create entries to dummy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Peter teaching us the lesson that was first written about in 1950s   1N-2@C//2@D-PASS|pg||
nt|fabsayc: entries to do what|pg||
nt|xenya: if he reads the @D position (and he should), no other line makes sense |pg||
nt|super nova: Well this hand could see the lead change for the first time in a while|pg||
nt|super nova: likely.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at worst  5-2 @D fit|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: so 9 bd remains|pg||
nt|mrdct: probably a @h partscore for NS here|pg||
nt|mrdct: i assume EW play precision|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: wd play by K.Yamada.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 5@d is good scr !|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: but have so many defensive tricks, so tend to defence ?? |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: what is Newells gadget for this shape|pg||
nt|fabsayc: seems newell should have got the last hand right, i crashed, maybe somebody said that|pg||
nt|petergill: with the opponents having the boss suit, Sartaj did not Dbl 3@s on his moderate values because then he does not know what to do after 4@SX|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 2 @D looks like multi again|pg||
nt|petergill: in 6@H - running @HQ picks up only one case - bare jack in North - so if an expert does such play against you successfully, you should hold your cards further back|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: looks like|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=9-13 hcp, unbal, 4+@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: transfer opening  remember specs |pg||
nt|ahollan1: and as you see -- can have canape  longer @C/@D|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh !|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: up values to 14+|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=ART, PRE, 2-8 HCP, 4+@S & 4+@C/@D, aggressive style [often 4-4 nvul]|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D=relay  but doesn't promise any points|pg||
nt|sybarra: E will never believe suit is hts |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15, 0+@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=@S, 8-14 HCP, usually BAL  a) 3@S  b) 4@S, min|pg||
mb|2S|nt|andyv:  again because of canape style, W restricted in his choice of openings|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @C as to transfer into suit (I think) |pg||
nt|vugraphzws: Sorry for mistake.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in 3rd seat, they'll open some balanced hands that don't get opened in 1st/2nd|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice trump split    5-4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i predict   3@C = non-force  LONGER @C|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: P or 4@c ?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 5 either minor pitches on the other|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: one downside of the (strong) @C no suits shown'|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: y|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: limitted place ??|pg||
nt|mrdct: good that NS stayed out of game with 4 losers on top|pg||
nt|mrdct: now north needs to play trumps for zero losers|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: 2@S=5+@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: dutch playing a canape style, hence this unusual combination|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: hum, 6@c ?|pg||
nt|mrdct: Oz Players here are 2/3 of the runners-up in Australia National Open Teams from a couple of weeks ago|pg||
nt|sybarra: I suspect 5 @h is pass or correct... or the lack of @D was what W was going to bid |pg||
nt|sybarra: just not sure how they play this |pg||
nt|sybarra2: how to find out you have no wasted values in @H's |pg||
nt|mrdct: reasonable 3rd seat opening by north|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: need 2 entries|pg||
nt|mrdct: he has entries in @d and @s|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: y|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: should move blutally ? did !|pg||
nt|petergill: but by Passing, he finds out that (i) East is happy to go to 4@S and (ii) partner has spade shortage for his t/o dbl of 4@S, making the 5 level the place to be (EW have 10 or 11 ...|pg||
nt|petergill: trumps etc)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: EW in OR already go to there ! heww!|pg||
nt|sybarra: and just need to take aces again |pg||
nt|mrdct: but content to resign when p bids his singleton|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh !|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this only -1|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: y|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: 2N relay for distribution|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N=5@S 5@C 1@H|pg||
nt|mrdct: close to mirrored shapes here for NS which is often dangerous, but there's no ruff on for the defence so @SA and @DAK only to lose|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 3rd @c also ?|pg||
nt|mrdct: opportunity for jacobs now as 3@h failed in teh closed room|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 1 off in OR !?|pg||
nt|mrdct: however, i suspect he'll only finese against the @HK and go one down also but we'll see|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: West opend ! easily place @hK for him, but how many trumps ?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: now West will move ?  maybe NO !|pg||
nt|petergill: bd 55: perhaps playing @H10 was almost costfree, unless @C were 6-2|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: now east hunting for slam, and may well bid it|pg||
nt|xenya: if they get to slam, they will make it|pg||

nt|ahollan1: finding @H -- what fun is that?|pg||
nt|twcho: last bd, north misdefend by continuing his @d and squeezed south on the way|pg||
nt|xenya: and E miight be tempted|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think of any good reason why you woudl play west for @hK10x|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 4@D forces 4@H   |pg||
nt|sybarra2: do you really want to be in this slam?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: probably not but|pg||
nt|sybarra2: ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  you have all the controls ...only a question if you can set up @cs on ruffs|pg||
nt|andyv:  the poor @s spots may determine if they go on |pg||
nt|sybarra2: or smother 10 of @S? |pg||
nt|ahollan1: the auction strongly suggests  @S 4333 around the table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in that case -- 3@D looks more dangerous than normal|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: like Ninja ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  you can also try the @d suit |pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@s is 8-10 bal and 3@d asks for a major I'm told|pg||
pc|c9|nt|twcho: he should return a @s to break up the squeeze|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@S = light third seat non-vul openings are all the rage among genuine experts - the older experts like to open 2@S (or equivalent) in 3rd seat (takes away more bidding space) - ...|pg||
nt|petergill: the newer experts find 1@S more effective overall (less revealing to opponents in the card play)|pg||
nt|mrdct: had north passed initially i guess NS would get to 1NT makiing 7 or 8 tricks|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mrdct: and then 3@h is a transfer to get the strong hand to play it|pg||
nt|mrdct: thanks specs!|pg||
nt|twcho: Top eight teams will enter the KO stage|pg||
nt|xenya: well...|pg||
nt|kemperg: 5@H are your @Hs good?|pg||
nt|kemperg: and W tinks AHx is enough|pg||
nt|xenya: EW lack 2 keycards, but luckily for them, they have failed to to find that out|pg||
nt|kemperg: no fancy play, trying to catch 10x in N and its made|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if West had all of the inferences about the NS @S length  and  North's proably being 46|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with  4135 or 4315  i'm not sure if Newell would rebid 3@C or just a quiet 2@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder also |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Lixin played for squeeze on last hand  so a different down 1 in 4@S |pg||
nt|mrdct: 1 *can't|pg||
pc|c5|nt|pole_as_ch: 4@s maybe voidwood ?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 5NT ???|pg||

nt|sybarra2: happens to not be a success  |pg||
pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: (&) $)(*Y %|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no stopping now|pg||
nt|mrdct: if any of you good analyst out there want to join me feel free|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@D Precision|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: finishing in top 3 is helpful   1 chooses opponent from 5-8, then  2, then  3  [ 4 gets stuck with remaining team]|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: @d9 is good @d ?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: seems good for ONI|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kemperg: claim|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh Yes 10 is critical, thx|pg||
nt|petergill: still on the 4@SX board: Sartaj might have bid 4NT over the dbl, and 5@HX might escape for 300 instead of 500, but that's impossible to tell without seeing the unlikely @D stack|pg||
nt|petergill: same old board: Also, bidding to 5@H (not 5@D) might allow EW to tell it's a double fit and bid and make 5@SX|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@D set @S    4@H=avg+ or max  then RKC|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: ummm, they also go !  nice auction! |pg||
nt|fabsayc: reid has to guess whether spade shift from singleton or doubleton|pg||
pc|d2|nt|fabsayc: this mostly needs two diamonds to survice, then a straight cross ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if @D lead 3rd/5th then unlikely choice of crossruff|pg||
nt|andyv:  if leads are 3-5, W may already know what is going on|pg||
nt|mrdct: obviously with north having already bid @s the transfer benefits are not there - but often you need to stick to your generla structure|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|mrdct: jacobs would much rather have the @H10 than the @CQ|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: hehehehe  |pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C Aspro|pg||
nt|petergill: hearts plus another|pg||
nt|petergill: Nice play of the spades by North|pg||
nt|ahollan2:   39  Reid 5@CX West  [he didn't give partner chance to hit 4@H]|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes i dont think he will play that way, i was talking in abstract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: double dummy players will  pin north's @S10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and finesse in @C|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think before the lead, @d suit looks as promising as anything else|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: No snag. cold slam !|pg||
nt|mrdct: so beating this a couple of tricks will be close to a push|pg||
nt|mrdct: the overtake there suggest he'll at least keep his options open to hook the 10|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: come the moment of truth ??|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: push !|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: NEDUK lead the Bulgarians by 16 with 4 to go in the other match|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: heat up fight they doing|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|nt|andyv:  may not finesse @cs first|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||

pc|c4|nt|petergill: will soon be 400 or 430|pg||
pc|h8|pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i guess when 2nd @D ruffed, must take @C finesse|pg||
nt|andyv:  but he needed Kxx of @cs because lack of entries|pg||
nt|andyv:  he can play A@d now|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|cc469: duck was correct as N can affordn to lose 2 @Ds|pg||

nt|petergill: Bd 54 will be flat (other table in 4@S), and bd 56 only an imp at most ---> very close match|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: oh mumm comes|pg||
nt|mrdct: they have 25hcp and an 8-card fit and they are vul - want more do you want?|pg||

nt|mrdct: snap|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some big club pairs play that as less than opening bid, others as limited opener [ 10-15]|pg||
nt|twcho: really don't like such 54 opener and force partner to 3 level|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: we r vul and they r non !|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: i disgrade flat hand easily|pg||

mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: i think so too|pg||
mb|3H|nt|petergill: Thanks Dave|pg||

nt|mrdct: and so did he!|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: y|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: woww, good place !|pg||
nt|petergill: @CK ducked, @CQ to ace, low spade and guess spades---> declarer has some chances|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and how many nt do they end up in?  6 nt makes |pg||
nt|petergill: Dbl by E = to discourage West from going past 4@SX|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 3nt by W in OR|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3NT is the open room - so cold have a new leader again if it makes|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: well yes as 6@D makes but other room down in NT|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: hummm,|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: aft 4NT, 5@c, 5@d, 6@d ???|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 12 much needed  to oni|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS play Michaels shows   weak or strong |pg||
nt|fabsayc: anybody else nervous to overcall just 1@S|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  wow ew have easy 3nt|pg||
mb|4H|nt|pole_as_ch: West dbled 1@s, funny.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2NT very strong Martin raises|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so Reid hand fits in the middle ... hence 1@S|pg||
nt|petergill: EW will play trumps at some stage to beat 3@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: the mirrored position in @c is bad news fro NS here|pg||
nt|petergill: I think EW play upside down count|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: pitches dummy do little to help here |pg||
nt|sybarra: *pitches IN dummy |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh good lead !|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: @C4 discouraging  and hard to read regarding suit pref  [odd/even discards]|pg||
nt|fabsayc: verhees will continue diamonds and subseuently declarer is kind of squeezed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: agreed    probably liked favorable vul  [not-vul vs vul  aka "green"]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlucky   partner had best hand at the table|pg||
nt|cc469: evenin'|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Carl,  welcome |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Reid really doesn't have much hope of beating this|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with his @C shortness -- desperately hoping partner has 1@D and 2+@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but even then  need a 2nd trump trick|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: great decision|pg||
nt|petergill: Ew have 24 points|pg||
nt|petergill: North did very well to "steal" by opening light at the favourable vulnerability|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  seems east must act at ist turn|pg||
nt|petergill: with 2@C or Dbl?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: quite a parlay opposite an aggressive favorable vul 2@H opening|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hans opened east hand weak 1N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now in 2@DX East|pg||
pc|sA|nt|dalzielpas:  declarer needs a lot of help to gwet home|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ahollan1: in 6@S Miyakuni cashed @CA early and misguessed trump - but @D suit intact  does she still have a chance to make?   i doubt it|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think we are relaying a bunch here |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: with 7 more after this|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: it is as a water on the very hot stone|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: maybe|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: poof then it disappears?|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|sybarra: might we just plop into 6 nt? |pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  i like dble but you wont find many who do|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|nt|petergill: If 3rd club is played, it's down I think|pg||
nt|petergill: Can West tell if East has 4 clubs or 2 clubs?|pg||
nt|petergill: i.e do they play count or attitude at Trick 1? (both upside down)|pg||
nt|petergill: Attitude makes this easier than count|pg||
pc|h6|nt|petergill: 4@S = due to the fav vul - might cost a little bit too much|pg||
nt|mrdct: the 3 @c losers will hurt|pg||
nt|mrdct: on a good day dummy's minors will be the other way and it's all dandy|pg||
nt|petergill: South knew trumps were 3-1 only when @SK appeared - else West has no spade stop for his 3NT bid|pg||
nt|petergill: Hristov unable to tell, due to predominant count signals|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  but his move lokes vsafe|pg||
nt|ahollan2:   55  [4@H-1]   Bulgarians in 3N South|pg||
nt|petergill: Now declarer has to rise @DK, pick spades then ruff club high - to get home|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  yes i see, but another club declarer rufff hig dk and strip squeeze|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  also m\king. what about a trump lead|pg||
nt|petergill: I see - @DK - @h to ace, ruff club high, draw trumps and endplay the strip-squeezed East?|pg||
nt|petergill: Many choices. |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: The other room also 4@s !  so no swing !|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: in north america, i think Woolsey-Stewart are the only big club pair that doesn't use 2N opening as strong balanced hand|pg||
pc|s4|nt|fabsayc: timing all wrong for defense now|pg||
nt|mrdct: but i don;t disagree with north's action and it could easily be replicated in the open room|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h7|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sybarra: and they "we" are |pg||
nt|petergill: Might also ruff club low - if EW cannot tell that West can overruff clubs, then how can North tell?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|dalzielpas:  Yes, a trump lead declarer might not knock out minor villains in time|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sybarra: can actually make 7 given that @H's fall |pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: wow ?|pg||
nt|cc469: I suggest that it is not at all clear from N's hand that they should be playing in a minor suit and thus agree with Tommy that the 2NT opening is a bit unilateral|pg||
nt|cc469: S might have held W's @Hs for example|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and then EW hold the @S|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sybarra: and spade hook on |pg||
nt|xenya: the correct play was @SJ -- unless declarer was playing for a singleton @SK|pg||

nt|twcho: south did well to bring in the contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another hand where East won't open but most other Big Clubbers will|pg||
nt|mrdct: massive difference between -500 and -800|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room started with "multi" 2@D|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 7 bd remains|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 15imps+1|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think 3NT was makable - needed to play on @d rather than @c|pg||
nt|mrdct: a decision costing about 20 imps|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 37 now the diff|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: y|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 7 BD|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT is a bit (or very?) lucky on a heart lead - @C10 play - two @c honours onside, S has @SA|pg||
nt|petergill: East missed the key switch at Trick 2 of a trump|pg||
nt|petergill: I mean, 20/20|pg||
nt|petergill: Down Under has not scored any imps so far in this quarter|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: oh! weak NT maybe.|pg||
nt|sybarra2: e/w  just won dutch national championships last weekend as I recall |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Precision 1@D|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  yes but imps is silly that way. bid vulnerable games|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C strong|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 18+ bal|pg||
nt|twcho: you really know their style. :)|pg||
nt|xenya: i must say EW were a bit lucky on the last 2 hands|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: new bd|pg||
mb|d|nt|fabsayc: i dont understand, how could heart shift work|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=0-7|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Now difficult in counter-part.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: RDBL may trf to @c.|pg||
nt|mrdct: looks like a routine 4@s here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=4@H and 5+@C/@D   i think this is absolute maximum for the Raptor 1N overcall|pg||
nt|mrdct: with two balanced hands EW may choose 3NT here|pg||
nt|petergill: I think West should have played his top spades (not @CK) on which East could indicate @CA somehow - for 800|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C strong|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+   [i'm using Zejun convention card from 2009 world championship]|pg||
nt|sybarra: what 2 suited call do they have?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: but very difficult hand for 3NT, i think|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: where is they go in this bd ?|pg||
nt|mrdct: some number of @h - 2 or 3 i guess|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure, but i'd wager 1+@D|pg||
nt|petergill: One reason you have to bid a lot against experts at unfav vul is that otherwise they can steal from you|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  three to swcore and six to play|pg||
mb|3C!|an|!C & !D  WEAK|nt|ahollan1:  9  the Chinese pair took save in 5@HX|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: well deserved 7 too|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1:  24  Jianming in 4@SX West|pg||
nt|petergill: Dbl probably shows about 6 or 7 points, was not penalty|pg||
nt|mrdct: can ben find a reason to lead @h?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D = 2 suits same rank  [@C&@D or @H&@S]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not pure CRASH  they use  DBL, 1@D and 2@C instead of the usually DBL, 1@D, 1N|pg||
nt|sybarra: does Reid now try 1 @S? |pg||
nt|mrdct: west doesn't have very good suit quality in @h|pg||
nt|fabsayc: lots of strong club players would upgrade east hand to 1@C opening|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  a finesse through the opening bidder and a bit|pg||
nt|petergill: but small errors are creeping into EW's game - like - would West have returned @C9 from 9xxx on the last hand?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: by the huge margin of 1 imp     Dutch Premier League   i get the feeling it is analogous to the ACBL's Grand National Team|pg||
nt|sybarra2: I think a bit more than that |pg||
nt|sybarra2: I would put it more like the Reisinger |pg||
nt|ahollan1: more than the GNT?|pg||
nt|sybarra2: maybe you feel that GNT is more than I do |pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh  in importance   i made comparison because it runs over multiple months  starting at club level|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 3@h ! or 3@c |pg||
nt|petergill: I get it - even if 3NT goes minus 100, that's not bad - and the gain if it makes is so huge|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  pass is far more plausible at total-p[oints or match-points|pg||
mb|3S|nt|pole_as_ch: North calmly pass !|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C = pass/correct|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  its a frustrating hand i can recall many trying 2NT on such..|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@D makes, and 2@H by NS might fail on a trump misguess after the @d ruff|pg||
nt|petergill: 7 to play|pg||
mb|d|an|VALUES|nt|ahollan1: 1@S = 4+@S [possible canape with longer minor]|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@S four or five spades|pg||
nt|sybarra2: ok that is true |pg||
nt|sybarra2: re over many months|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh !!!!  2@c !!|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@c can make i believe|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 1NT by W in OR|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2NT puppet to 3C or nat|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thx operator|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: i think puppet to @c|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: this would be push, or 1,2 imp|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: 1@S forcing     2@C=5-7 HCP, 0-2@S, not 6+@C/@D  [3m], not 5+@H [2@D]|pg||
nt|sybarra2: van Prooijen-Verhees, playing in the closed room, won the Dutch Teams Championship (by 1 IMP!) less than 36 hours ago. They must be jet-lagged. Quite a journey from Amsterdam to ...|pg||
nt|sybarra2: ...|pg||
nt|sybarra2: to Japan|pg||
nt|sybarra2: playing here |pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmmmmm   i thought 2N showed 6+@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and game force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H confirms @C and shows extras  [i think]   maybe just extras|pg||
nt|petergill: Pass by West, converting East's Dbl for penalties, yields 800 or 1100 or more, I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lead director :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: I thought maybe he would try 1 @S to see if it was majors |pg||
nt|mrdct: lose 2@s and a trick in each of the other suits|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: strange 3N|pg||
nt|ahollan2:   55   3N-2|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@H = 5+ spades, 8+ pts, GF|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT = minimum, fast arrival in GF auction, minimum for strong club|pg||
mb|5D|nt|ahollan1: the others would wish they had interediate 2@D opener|pg||
nt|ahollan1: intermediate|pg||
nt|ahollan1: similar to the Precision 2@C opener|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually i think 1@D is fine|pg||
mb|5S|nt|fabsayc: how can it be game force after negative 1@D?|pg||
nt|vugraphzws: Alert with P is miss.sorry|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes next hand please :)|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 3@d is "help suit" like  maybe .|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: GT|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: stopped ??|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is more of a bluff to open 1@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: in OR, West's 1NT !  humm.|pg||
nt|mrdct: i guess there is chance for declarer to over think a potential bad trump break going for an endplay in @d|pg||
nt|mrdct: which could be indicated with the @H opening by west|pg||
nt|mrdct: btw 2@h is 10-13 5+@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: can be weaker in 3rd|pg||
nt|mrdct: the east-west system has no weak 2 available so with hands like west you need to improvise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if 3@C again pass/correct then 2@H was just showing max|pg||
nt|kemperg: dbl = support 3@Hs|pg||
nt|sybarra: becaise if pard bids a minor Reid has a good hand |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: could be a great result though|pg||
nt|othered1: 1N response looks Bluish, not Precision|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  on this deal is the club ace a perculiar safety play to make six clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  card says 1@s was a balanced relay so probably couldn|pg||
nt|andyv:  couldn't hold 6 spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: either my notes or vP's bid are wrong|pg||
nt|ahollan1: fun system to study     i first saw Ultimate Canape played by Russ Ekeblad   the Dutch have made some minor changes but the overall structure is intact|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: hu ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i wonder -- what is default meaning of RDBL for CRASH players|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  I wld double 1D as North, meaning both majors|pg||
pc|d3|nt|petergill: 4@S should make, but is not totally cold|pg||
nt|fabsayc: over 1@D what else ed?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: didn't mention earlier  carding  odd/even   so @H10 was discouraging  and i think Reverse Suit preference|pg||
nt|othered1: 1@H in Precision?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hence  the @C shift|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: no   1@S=relay over 1@H response|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was about to say  best contract 1N [which they can't reach]   when result from other room popped up|pg||
nt|petergill: the sort of contract an expert should make and an average player might not make|pg||
nt|petergill: On this lead, 4@S is even colder|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 8 tricks ?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sybarra2: do we hear the screaching of brakes?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: over 1@D   1@H/@S look like matchpoint precision / meckwell ...   4+suit, one-round force|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: heww|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: whew|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: and lead ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think response of 1N with 3433 is just old time bridge judgement|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the hand looks like NT so ...|pg||
nt|othered1: How often have you seen 5-card major, Precision players use that type of judgment?  .05 percent of the time?|pg||
nt|petergill: Tony had a lousy hand opposite a known weak hand, so 1NT by him over 1@D would have been a gross overbid|pg||
nt|petergill: NS play weak 1NT in 1/2 seat|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  South's Pass is forced, Norths is plausible|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|pole_as_ch: use @d for many tricks ?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: @C for an imps else flat|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D in context of (10)11-15 HCP  is great description of East hand|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  w3hat about 3NT shd we lay down the club ace|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT has at least 9 top tricks, even with bare @CK offside|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: to account for the artificial 1N overcall   EW DBL isn't pure takeout shape -- can include normal strong NT|pg||
nt|kemperg: 10 tricks, claim|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: or -1|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|pg||
nt|mrdct: @D10 is a good card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thru 8   China Women  2  leads  Oni-Taka  11-0|pg||
nt|cc469: in response to specs questions, I assume W bid this way to show that his suits were @Cs and @Hs not both minors and he seemed to feel he wanted to be in game|pg||
pc|sA|nt|pole_as_ch: britts comes|pg||
pc|d2|nt|cc469: curious @H duck|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe "minor changes" is an underbid|pg||
nt|petergill: Inconvenience of entries, rather than prescience, led to that play|pg||
nt|petergill: South hanging on to his @D in case declarer has a guess in @D|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sybarra: not likely to see dummy |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: was Hirata on a different wave length there?|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: did he want to save @C10 for later??|pg||
nt|mrdct: danger for declarer is ruffing stuff early and lsoing control when the bad trump break reveals itsel;f|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: look like flat|pg||
pc|sK|nt|petergill: Lead alteration continued on Bd 40 when Bulgaria's South mildly surprized me by not bidding (risking?) 2@H over 1NT. New leaders. |pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: my thinking    should have thought before playing @DA|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: surely|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: @c swich by south was bad. maybe 4 make.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mrdct: he'll cross to @DA and pitch a @h now|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: but this is safe|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: coffee hand|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: make that  didn't he want to save ...|pg||
pc|s7|nt|petergill: lead up to 8.5 imps as Down Under score their first 3 imps of the last quarter|pg||

pc|h8|pc|hA|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2 more on 9 its a 3 imp match now|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|mrdct: can make a beer card now|pg||

pc|s3|nt|andyv:  that didn't work out too well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: underlead of @DA probably wouldn't work  but seems only chance to beat the contract|pg||

nt|petergill: other table: bd 41 - 2@s will fail by a couple of tricks for about 6 imps to Down Under|pg||

nt|petergill: China Women 2, with Wang Wenfei, who was World  1 woman player briefly before her approx two years off, back from her break|pg||
nt|petergill: this Bulgaria All Stars is almost locked into the Final 8 too, as is Japan's top team Oni-taka, some of whom came 9th in the 2011n Bermuda Bowl|pg||
nt|mrdct: i don't think the overtrick on 26 makes any difference as 180 and 200 are both 5 imps|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: or 6@d ?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: y|pg||
nt|mrdct: 6@d is a great contract|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: 4 for me too|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2N relay for distribution|pg||
nt|andyv:  have to like the quality of the spot cards W|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 7+@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not 7222|pg||
nt|andyv:  but he makes it up in volume|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might be the one system in the world that has trouble with 5@S 5@H :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think 3@D asks total controls  [A=2 K=1]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: step 1 = 3   |pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  West is not a greedy man|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@S could be a close battle|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  This could be his "where I spent my spade grand slam - story"|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: What is her choice for OL?|pg||
nt|twcho: interesting system|pg||
nt|twcho: another strange bid by north|pg||
nt|ahollan1: strike that  their teammates in the winning Bermuda Bowl    Tarzan Precision opens 1@H with 5@H and 5+@S  [because of their relay structure]|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@S was 4 spades, longer clubs, 14+ points|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: sry, last BD, west ! Mullanphy !|pg||
nt|cc469: appears to be -300|pg||
nt|petergill: Cannot get to 5@C if you never bid clubs!|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  better than 3nt|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mrdct: hard for south to avoid game now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: RDBL would be  to play   not sure about PASS :(|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: now show 0/1@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: was just typing    @H ruff will be with natural trump trick - is there a way to avoid that defense|pg||
nt|mrdct: i guess with the EW major not revealed 4@h could be contrued as natural by north|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  If North hsad randomn rubbish and Hristov had passed with good spades..|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  I think West should bid 1NT|pg||
nt|petergill: If West rebids 1NT, he should scrape home - e.g. win spade lead - club to queen, duck @H if @CK is ducked.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: well sure -- lead @D  :)|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh !  sound !?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: i c|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: agree|pg||
nt|mrdct: in the open room west showed @h naturally so north was able to cue with 4@h so i think the slam will be reached in the open room|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: alas duplication|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: i like the auction in OR.|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@H interpreted as asking for @h stop for 3NT|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  doomed unless the defences cross|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: 4@H slam try in @C|pg||
nt|mrdct: a nice 5-5 and partner showing some values|pg||
nt|mrdct: Oz Players are 2/3 of the team which narrowly lost the Australian National Open Team 2 weeks ago|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: they go to 6@d in OR|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@D double surely contributes nothing to defense chances|pg||
nt|othered1: perhaps a lead, as it's not clear where south is considering playing, is it?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: only works if partner ends up on lead against 6@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@DX  or  XX would have been fun to watch|pg||
nt|othered1: or 6@H?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|pole_as_ch: 4 made in OR !  England Ladies will gain 1 imp.  |pg||
nt|petergill: so momentum in an untidy auction has carried EW to 4@S |pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra2: can not imagine W is truly interested |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S = min|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good lord, are they slamming again|pg||
nt|sybarra2: teetering on it |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i doubt verhees shows  disinterest with @CAK-7th|pg||
nt|sybarra2: maybe the 4 @S=min slows them down?|pg||
nt|petergill: Nil vul is a good vul to compete a lot at partscore level - if wrong, minus 50 plus minus 50 is only 3 imps|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think so -- but don't quote me|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1:  10  Tony Nunn in West made 3@C where Banxiang made 1N|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: yep|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i still think doubles of relays help opponents more than your side|pg||
pc|c4|nt|pole_as_ch: East could easily lost 6@d|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|kemperg: for me S had no quanti, 11pts, 4333|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sybarra2: again the sounds of brakes are deafening |pg||
nt|xenya: maybe N could have a bit more|pg||
nt|xenya: 22?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: normally playing Queen on lead of King says  I either have singleton or QJ|pg||
pc|c9|nt|pole_as_ch: BD 10 ?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no this one|pg||
pc|s3|pc|cK|pg||
nt|andyv:  air brakes|pg||
nt|mrdct: good unblock of the @CJ by bill jacobs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N very intersting ploy    prevents any chance of EW finding @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so good save against 3@S :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: loses 2 anyway|pg||
nt|petergill: @DA switch upon winning @SA looks likely|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mrdct: makes things nice and easy for ben thompson to continue @c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: should that change at trick 2??|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: y|pg||
pc|s4|pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  now the defence need to find both club ruffs|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|nt|petergill: and it's more fun to declare than defend, isn't it Michael?|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  yes but, here you risk trowing away 7NT for nothing if n has psyched|pg||
nt|petergill: Isee = Sartaj was not vul opposite a passed hand - so a 1@S overcall on xx, xxx, xx, QJ10xxx might have been golden?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: with non-min  Verhees would have responded keycards   that keeps them out of slam too [on this hand]|pg||
nt|mrdct: declaer in a bind here as he does have his tricks and knows that when west gets in he's off|pg||
pc|d2|nt|dalzielpas:  1s is making now i think|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mrdct: *doesn't have his tricks|pg||
nt|petergill: The psyche is more likely in Mollo books or if Michael Courtney (or Dalziel or Pascoe) is North, but I get it - Pass of 1@S is the riskiest thing for West to do. |pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|petergill: other table: EW missing the making 3NT on Bd 25 means Oz Players must avoid more major adverse swings, else their Finals place will be in jeopardy|pg||
nt|cc469: W had played the Q before so now E might believe S has J|pg||
nt|petergill: Easier to declare than defend|pg||
nt|ahollan2:  other table   42  after funny 2@D opener from East [weak (5+4+) @S & minor]  south ends in 2N|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  he has reduced his trumps. this rather promotes dummys ten|pg||
nt|petergill: On paper, this match is the pairs who topped the datums for Aus (11th) and NZ (10th) in the 2011 Bermuda Bowl, against pairs who missed this year's Bulgaria Bermuda Bowl team which ...|pg||
nt|petergill: ran 12th|pg||

nt|ahollan1:  11 in other room after 1@C and interference|pg||
nt|andyv:  13 also a disaster for NS as 4@s was set in OR|pg||
nt|mrdct: poor result for Oz in the open room|pg||
nt|timb: David, that is an understatemet (too say the least) of a very British kind|pg||
nt|mrdct: in fairness to matt muulamphy - what else do you suggest he does when a green vs red 3@h preempt come around to him|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H =   see previous note|pg||
nt|vugraphzws: No, 20|pg||
nt|ahollan1: had a chance to defend  2@HX|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 11imps should add|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: hummm, 1 imp|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: holds it to 1 Newell lost interest|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: hehehehe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: especially since South would declare everything other than @S|pg||
nt|dburn: well, they may hinder the opponents if the opponents don't know what they are doing|pg||
nt|petergill: on the other hand, the Bulgarians did knock out some of the Bermuda Bowl winners in their semi final, whereas Down Under kncoked out some of the 9th placed team from last year's ...|pg||
nt|petergill: Bermuda Bowl|pg||
nt|petergill: After 5 or 6 days' bridge, funny things happen to teams of four who have played bridge all day every day|pg||
nt|petergill: if @S were 3-3, that would have been amazing|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: yes if i can bring a cheat sheet to all events|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this time with canape [2nd suit longer] |pg||
nt|kemperg: we open stronger than 2NT with a good 22|pg||
nt|mrdct: another slam hand!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think these boys know|pg||
nt|othered1: or @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Precision 2@C   6+@C or 5@C & 4@H/@S|pg||
nt|cc469: 3 imp gain for the Aussies as 4@H made at other table|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  How old is Hristov|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  He plays cards most exactrly|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: i think Down Under have picked up imp(s) on 19 boards to Bulgaria's 11 pick-up boards so far in the match|pg||
nt|remo: ciao|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  sorry, 10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3rd 2@C opener|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: now difficult 4 @s|pg||
nt|sybarra2: this is the "I have an opening bid" 1 @D |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15 HCP, 0+@D, maybe longer @C/@S, but NOT @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as here  often weak NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=4+ fit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=(13)14+ unbal or 16+ bal   [unfav  1N=13-15]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this 3-suiter shows why the Precision 2@D bid was modified to include (43)15 hands|pg||
nt|dburn: what would a 2@d opening mean?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: their 2M = M + minor  so my guess 2@D=weak @H or @S|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@C = clubs and spades, at least 5-5|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  you still prefeer 1S on North Peter|pg||
nt|petergill: I think I prefer 1@s when playable in 3 suits|pg||
nt|petergill: and you?|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  After 1S EW will be promptly pushed to 5D|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@C has the advantage of bidding your whole hand in one go, avoiding last guesses and all that |pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S 5+ @s, 5+ minor|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  hi|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@D Leaping Michaels|pg||
nt|remo: srry|pg||
mb|1D|nt|petergill: 12-14 in 4th seat|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: y |pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  he will bid 5d|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: and 3rd 2@D response|pg||
nt|ahollan1: RDBL=4+@H|pg||
nt|xenya: if 20 is the limit, 4N looks purposeless|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: and full of controls |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: this BD also no storm, maybe |pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the early days of Precision where 2@D was 4414 or 4405   we would open South hand 1@D rather than 2@C|pg||
nt|petergill: prev board: I see - with A96 in spades, South cannot play @S9 in case N has J10 doubleton|pg||
mb|1S|nt|pole_as_ch: trouble hand again ??|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  must be nice to have so many hands fit into your system:)|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 1@h = @s showing, and 2@s = 4 card @s  maybe !|pg||
nt|Walddk4: yes, and a minimum|pg||
nt|mrdct: usually voids opposite AK/AQ aren't so great but no problems here in 6@d EW|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  Rebid 4S if partner raises|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  S had a pretty easy dbl |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: thx Roland.|pg||
nt|mrdct: typically aggressive fav vul preempt by ben|pg||
nt|cc469: has to just guess the @H in 4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  25  [the weird 2N opener]   South playing 3@S|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: someone goes to 7 ?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh !|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: yep  define the system then make arrangements with The Great Shuffler|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: how do y think 4@c /|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: *?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not nice|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  keep your clubs - you could miss a heart fit with 3c|pg||
pc|d7|nt|pole_as_ch: hum|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the west hand|pg||
pc|d4|nt|andyv:  NS are rapidly becoming spectators in these auctions|pg||
nt|petergill: other table Bd 26: Ron Klinger is in 4@S, should make it|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am surprised Reid wasnt in there with spades  (except he is red) |pg||
nt|petergill: 5@D seems to be an advance save taken against a game that NS were not about to bid|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  these flippers play anything. rememder that diamond seven|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Walddk4: Declarer mistimed this in the open room|pg||
nt|mrdct: they probably a convention that will help them avoid that|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@D is a lucky make|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 3NT would be better contruct, but West choiced 4@s.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H holding 4  means  either weak NT or  4414/4405|pg||
nt|cc469: that should help the @H guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzws: 2NT maybe 20-21|pg||
nt|xenya: well a good 21 could be enough for slam|pg||
nt|xenya: 21 plus a 5-carder for example|pg||
nt|kemperg: we might upgrade that|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pole_as_ch: 11imp comes, so 21 imps wide spreaded|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: @h2 ?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: @s3 ?|pg||
nt|othered1: In any case, minimum openings with @C aren't handled optimally by forcing @C systems.  Costly to have to spend two bids (2@C and 2@D) in many systems to handle them|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D south in other room|pg||
pc|d2|nt|andyv:  you aren't dealt NT hands in order to be passing |pg||
nt|ahollan1: vP described 7+@C again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would you overcall 2N or DBL Andy?|pg||
nt|mrdct: not a challenging lead fro declarer - this should make easiluy'|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh !|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: ?|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@D showed 5+ @d and 5+ @H, good hand|pg||
pc|dK|nt|pole_as_ch: 3 in @s, 3 in @h, 1 in @d, 1 in @C, so 8 tricks.|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not available    everything other than PASS = game force|pg||
nt|sybarra: lucky him |pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: ihave no experience of precision|pg||
pc|h9|nt|pole_as_ch: only play against them a few times|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: and swich @CQ ?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: i wonder if west bid 4@H   does south bid 4@S|pg||
nt|twcho: south won't bid for sure|pg||
nt|twcho: north may consider|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 2NT and 3@h is ASKing ? |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: it looks easily reach 6@d|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: anyways|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a hand of little interest, 4 to go|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: maybe|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: but entry problem |pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  yes, does double show the two aces or uutterly deny them in such cases|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  if it shows N might bid 6D to make, if it says stop then it denies|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  draw trumps now so north doesnt get o|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kemperg: so it depends on their style|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the meantime  EW did well to find 4@H|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I was just thinking trump|pg||
nt|petergill: Trump switch is best |pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Both table is the same point and thinking |pg||
pc|cA|nt|andyv:  dbl|pg||
nt|ahollan1: remember  2@C could be 4@C and 5+@S|pg||
pc|c2|nt|petergill: I would have played a heart, not a 2nd spade. |pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer might have to guess @h's now|pg||
nt|mrdct: yeah he's a bit tangled up now|pg||
nt|petergill: and duly found|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: agree|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 2 ruff in each hand is not enought, because South would ruff 3rd @h.|pg||
nt|cc469: he seemed to thinkl a long time over 2@H|pg||
nt|xenya: true, but S was a passed hand, so no risk really |pg||
nt|petergill: My co-commentator is Michael Courtney|pg||

pc|cK|nt|fabsayc: they are accurate enough that north might have considered 3@H over west's pass|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't like Kx as stopper when opps say they have 6 of them...can't even hold up once|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and for those who pay attention to trivia   this is 2nd 8-card @S suit of the set|pg||
nt|kemperg: 25-5|pg||

pc|h4|nt|cc469: thinking about doubleton@SQ?|pg||
nt|cc469: after unblocking the J?|pg||
nt|cc469: high school teachers always said if you decide on a plan of action and then rethink and change your mind ...|pg||
nt|cc469: you were probably right the first time|pg||
nt|cc469: yes good point, spec suggests maybe we're stuck|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: well, 1 up.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|petergill: when you're playing with Tony Nunn, offering to be dummy by bidding 3@C might right-side the hand - true or false?|pg||
