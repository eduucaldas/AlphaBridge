nt|jcwla: N would have done best to send a trump through, W is scoring a lot of tricks on cross-ruff.|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|nt|jcwla: 4@S on the EW cards.|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|jcwla: Some might choose to rebid 2@S with the E hand, treating the AKQ as equivalent to four-card support,|pg||
nt|jcwla: but it's reasonable to show the basic nature of the hand first and can get back to @S later.|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcwla: These 5-5 hands with an intermediate   of HCP are difficult to evaluate.|pg||
nt|jcwla: It's a common theme.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Also, W knows E does not have four @S's.|pg||
nt|jcwla: However, I do think passing on a dime is a bit too unilateral.|pg||
nt|jcwla: I think W should at least show invitational values by bidding 2@S over 2@D and here, any such move will get them to the game.|pg||
nt|vugraphzzp: 2@c was two way check back, transfer to 2@d|pg||

nt|jcwla: to preempt and only one partner, so I like the idea of a fairly wide range.|pg||
