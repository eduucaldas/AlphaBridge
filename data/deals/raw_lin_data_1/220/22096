nt|ahollan1: much of the relay structure is Symmetric|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm here to cover the obscure and the obnoxious|pg||
nt|rick3son:  Good point David, bidding the suit shown can = 3 suit take out|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Welcome to Leon Fisher and Vladimir Ivanov|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they've wrong sided @D contract|pg||

nt|fabsayc: and NT|pg||
nt|xenya: it's astounding how they can manage this system|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that will slow down Reid|pg||
nt|rick3son:  Roland are a Man U fan?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: voice commentary for both tables in the final quarter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Newell has absolute max of 13 hcp|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my guess is a [reluctant] 3N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but move @CQ to @DQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so maybe 3N isn't right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hans opened the North hand with 2@S|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: 3@H asks controls  [A=2 K=1]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this takes them past 3N|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think step 1 = 2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@D = 5 controls  |pg||
nt|rick3son:  we are haeding to a likely minus for east west now|pg||
pc|sA|pc|h3|pc|sT|pc|sK|pg||

nt|ahollan1: other table  4@D East|pg||
nt|fabsayc: last time i checked there were 13 tricks :)|pg||
nt|rick3son:  5 or 6 rounds of bidding later the smoke has cleared|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm uncertain about 4N   i think it is part of denial cue bidding, but always get confused there without being able to peek at my toes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: last chance for plus|pg||
nt|xenya: most will bid slam with these cards|pg||
nt|rick3son:  spade lead yields 10th trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the good news   4@D went down|pg||
nt|xenya: i retract :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ok here's a guess   4N = top card in @D [longest suit]  NO top card in @S [2nd longest]|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d4|pc|h6|pc|d3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: much better to go down in 6@D than down in 4@D  :)|pg||

nt|rick3son:  the early @h discard was excellent play|pg||
nt|xenya: that's right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H to Ace and if @HK doesn't fall, try to pin @DJ in west???|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but perhaps diamond jack discard would have been better than low|pg||
nt|rick3son:  playing toward Q@d is a give up position|pg||
nt|rick3son:  only right in thinks KJ on his right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Reid did well to follow basic tenet   bare king early|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but maybe Kovachev will read THAT|pg||
