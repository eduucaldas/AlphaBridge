nt|paulg:  but this is always clearer to the player making the call|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Actually this pair are well established - have been playing together since they were about 12 - but they do not get together very often, and they are prone to the occasional ...|pg||
nt|cuttysark: misunderstanding|pg||

nt|paulg:  Corry can only be wondering whether to bid 5@d or 6@d?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  giant defense misunderstanding at other table..  |pg||
nt|cuttysark: I much prefer the direct approach of Alex Wilkinson - calling his 8-card suit trump|pg||
mb|4S|mb|d|nt|cuttysark: though yes, the defence to 5@D was not best|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Well, we Edinburghers have surely taught jake the optimisitic approach|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Not sure I ahve either :)  West will know what to do to 7@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: 2Nt some form of Jacoby, a game-forcing raise; 3C some minimum|pg||
