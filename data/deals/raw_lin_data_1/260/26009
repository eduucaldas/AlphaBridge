nt|BroLucius: @HA...|pg||

nt|danilo1: Hi Karen, David|pg||

nt|BroLucius: North is favourite to hold @CK because he started with fewer diamonds.|pg||
nt|VUGRAPHZEX: At least now the other table can catch up...|pg||
nt|BroLucius: EW attempted 4@H on the deal where West opened 3@C here, so 6 IMPs back.|pg||

nt|VUGRAPHZEX: Teixeira asking difference between 1@H and 2@H|pg||
nt|VUGRAPHZEX: 2@H weak|pg||
nt|danilo1: he should know who has longer @C ... South did not support @S ... and he also does not have 7 or more @H ... so North has long @S and @H support|pg||
