mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N!|nt|panja: if missing @HK, he has to hold @CK.....|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|runnerup:  east can see AKJ AJ ..so perhaps K is neede for 2 @c|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|ady: with diamonds at least held Townsend might have considered a passive defence of a trump back if not a diamond    though a diamond stops any sort of squeeze chances|pg||
nt|panja: 4@H bid guessed right!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|nt|runnerup:  you have 7 of @h in table -for 1 entry in 2. trick -so east endplayed now|pg||
pc|dA|pc|h2|nt|panja: y, @D ruff and trump back...when Declarer knows all with the @HA play, he can pull @SQ...that will have to be ducked.....and then on play of trumps....E will be squeezed|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|runnerup:  interesting hand but it looked to be down in other table after @c switch but east did not take 2. @c and was endplayed |pg||
nt|ady: not sure about the squuze   but an end play available    Q@S ducked   2nd spade  heart to the 7  and 3rd spade   thend trumps  and club to the 10|pg||
nt|panja: David, squeeze in the sense that E will have to keep 3 Clubs..|pg||
nt|vugraphzhe: East has the 8?|pg||
nt|panja: so..after @SQ ducked..and 5 trumps..we come down to 5 card...E has to keep 3 Clubs and 2 Spades...then @SA and a @C nails him|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hQ|pg||

pc|h6|pc|s6|nt|roswolf: yes he will endplay east|pg||
nt|vugraphzhf: think he's just checking what east's remaining shape is in his mind...knows west has one spade left now....so surely gonna make|pg||
nt|roswolf: very nice - it just goes to prove that the players at the table "see" much more clearly than us poor specs|pg||
nt|vugraphzhf: @S6 not a great discard...east knows hes about to get endplayed but cant even come down to stiff K...|pg||
pc|d2|pc|c5|pg||
nt|vugraphzhf: and no choice to endplay west know....he had a guess of who to endplay|pg||

nt|roswolf: good point ed|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d6|nt|iain sime: But if West pitched another diamond, he could be thrown in and Wast would be suicide squeezed.|pg||
