nt|woozle:  Hinden goes with a fairly bold WJO at the vulnerability|pg||
nt|woozle:  Justin can bid 3NT or play for penalties...if he attempts the latter, Jason won't let him|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|steshome:  The risk here is of 6@C off one on the diamond ruff, I reckon|pg||
nt|woozle:  South had three options at his second turn - 3NT (hoping dummy has a spade stop), 3S (hoping for 3NT but risking overstating the hand) or 3C (the low road)|pg||
nt|woozle:  Justin has the hoped-for spade stopper but will find it hard to overlook all of these extra values|pg||
nt|steshome:  North cannot just sign off in 3NT now - slam looking pretty likely |pg||
nt|Paulhac:  Tough decision|pg||
nt|woozle:  A natural 4NT would probably fit the bill, but is that what it means?|pg||
nt|woozle:  6NT is a chance from South, but no chance at all from north with East holding an easy heart lead|pg||
nt|Paulhac:  Possible choices look like 4NT 4@S and the underbid of 3NT|pg||
