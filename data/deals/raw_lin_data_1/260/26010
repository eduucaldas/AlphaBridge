nt|runnerup:  a tuh tuh 66 and a pipe -dont you think|pg||
mb|d|mb|1H|nt|steshome:  The risk is that e/w end in 6@d|pg||
nt|roswolf:  only might get to 6 if some spade barrage by n/s|pg||
nt|Henryb:  that is not safe Martin. In fact it leads to defeat. |pg||
mb|d!|an|pens|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|roswolf:  hmm not sure i would find a double as south|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Henryb:  no imagination, Geoffrey|pg||
mb|2S|nt|steshome:  I think 4@s now from West|pg||
nt|roswolf:  e/w taking the slow road|pg||
nt|Henryb:  4@c would be my choice|pg||
nt|roswolf:  41s is possible from west|pg||
nt|roswolf:  4@s|pg||
nt|Henryb:  do none of you ever find partner with three two small in both minors|pg||
nt|roswolf:  would show the power and potential of the hand but unlikely then for n/s to double 5@d|pg||
mb|4C|nt|steshome:  Yes, but you would still want to be in game|pg||
nt|Henryb:  No, Martin|pg||
nt|roswolf:  agree sarah|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|roswolf:  e/w taking the dog for a walk|pg||
nt|steshome:  Roland is being mischievous (again)|pg||
nt|Henryb:  ty. you are barred because of using a forbidden word|pg||
nt|Henryb:  He invited - and East should have bid 5@d, imho|pg||
nt|roswolf:  west has shown 6/6 but indeed east may have shown his damp side|pg||
nt|Henryb:  I would pass|pg||
nt|Henryb:  yes|pg||
nt|steshome:  I think 4@s opposite a sign off is too much but surely 5@d is automatic|pg||
nt|roswolf:  yes so might west in cloud cuckooland|pg||
nt|Henryb:  IMO, partner has shown a useless hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|Henryb:  what about 2-2?|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|nt|Henryb:  It has play, just not on this lie of the cards|pg||
nt|roswolf:  well 3@c at both tables shows how much we english have to learn about the game|pg||
mb|6C|nt|warrens:  6@C is on 3-3 @H's or KQ doubleton, so not that terrible.  we've all been in worse.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Henryb:  blue blooded? red blooded? idiotic?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|steshome:  There's something about being first in at favourable that sends englishmen demented|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|roswolf:  why do we have to follow the lemmings|pg||
nt|roswolf:  i have no sympathy with this auction|pg||
nt|Henryb:  I would think that South was under 21 for that bid. Perhaps under 15|pg||
nt|warrens:  and also QJ doubleton of @S's.  getting better all the time|pg||
nt|runnerup:  or QJ alone so up to some 30+% |pg||
nt|roswolf:  true|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|nt|sybarra: not often you see that kind of hand!|pg||
nt|sybarra: and so what to bid?|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 nt, 5 @C or 6 @C |pg||
nt|KemperG: to high I suppose|pg||
mb|6C|nt|sybarra: 3 nt not making |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: and 6 @C off one |pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I could hold myself back from bidding 6 @C either |pg||
nt|KemperG: was 3@C in their system?|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like a preempt to me |pg||
nt|sybarra: and a weak on at that |pg||
nt|sybarra: but vulnerability is right  |pg||
nt|KemperG: but was it allowed on a 6crd with 0 pts?|pg||
nt|sybarra: a bit weaker than I would use  but I am old fashioned |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sybarra: this is "event"  so any thing goes imo |pg||

And it wouldn't necessarily be easy to 5@c opposite 25/26 balanced.  You'd perhaps just try for the spade fit and subside in 3NT (with crossed fingers)|pg||
nt|roswolf:  hmm macabre|pg||
nt|runnerup:  these ladues they bid so boldly :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|Henryb:  So overall, you'd make this about a third of the time. In the old days, before his New Year's resolution, Roland would have been proud to reach a slam this good :)|pg||

nt|Henryb:  Better method is to play transfers, e.g. 1N to clubs, then 2@s and 3@s|pg||
nt|roswolf:  passing 4@H is (words fail me in a family programme)|pg||
nt|steshome:  It's a difference in general treatment - most people over this side of the pond play redouble as balanced w/out fit, bids (both at the 1 and 2 level) as forcing and jump bids as fit|pg||
nt|runnerup:  this is against some law (-you have less trumps -) but not illigal|pg||
nt|steshome:  But I agree that transfer responses have merit|pg||
nt|steshome:  It's a violation of Burn's law is this contract|pg||
nt|runnerup:  illegal|pg||
nt|steshome:  Burn's law being that you should always have more trumps when declaring than the opposition|pg||
nt|Henryb:  The most infamous example of that is the "Mississippi Heart" hand|pg||
