mb|p|mb|p|nt|BroLucius: Easier if South rebids 1NT and North then bids simple 4@S. But no excuse for stopping in a part-score.|pg||
nt|danilo1: since he already bid 5-card @S ... and South bid @H stpo by 2NT ... 3@H (4th suit) should show 6 @S (in case that 3@S not forcing aS IT LOOKS LIKE) |pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|BroLucius: As I have said more than once. There are already 501 easy ways to lose IMPs. There is no point at all in adding to the number.|pg||
nt|danilo1: 3@S was GF for North, but not for South ... thk we have all judged that :)|pg||
nt|VUGRAPHZEX: right:)|pg||
nt|BroLucius: But there should be no debate about it. North was right and South wrong.|pg||
nt|Onno:  North is the 'system' guy in this partnership, South is the 'card-player'|pg||
nt|danilo1: as I play .. 3@S would be to play as well ... therefore - new suit (3@H) forces|pg||
nt|Onno:  No, danilo, by going through 2@D first, you create a force|pg||
nt|Onno:  Otherwise you can easily rebid 2@S or 3@S at once |pg||
nt|danilo1: if agreed so (looks like it was not) ... this allways depends on partnership agreements|pg||
nt|Onno:  true|pg||
nt|BroLucius: Not very helpful to play '3@H force' because that does not show extra spade length. You need descriptive forcing bids.|pg||
nt|Onno:  ok, what happens here?|pg||
nt|VUGRAPHZEX: Metselaar thinking, Ronnie Jorstad having a bathroom break|pg||
nt|Onno:  Bidding 3NT now looks ok... but playing it will not be comfortable...|pg||
nt|danilo1: since I am too strickt (longer suit allways first excepz when Hcp missing) and too old fashioned ... as North I would open 1@D, asnd as South (passed pd) I would answer 2@C ... but ...|pg||
nt|danilo1: I know I am in minority today |pg||
mb|4H|nt|BroLucius: Game unlikely, really, from North's point of view. South cannot hold 3 hearts.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Onno:  Probably South could not bid 2@C right away because of Drury|pg||
nt|VUGRAPHZEX: 3@D explained as gametry|pg||
nt|BroLucius: There is at least one other person in the world who agrees with you. (Name begins with 'M').|pg||

nt|Onno:  but then declarer loses one heart and two diamonds|pg||
nt|danilo1: why @H and not @S ... he can overruf @D ... and if declarer needed discards on @C ... would be already done|pg||
nt|Onno:  it is three red tricks for EW either way... I guess the only way to beat this was a spade lead in trick 1|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
