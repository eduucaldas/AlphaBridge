mb|1S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|danilo1: what West is thinking about?|pg||
nt|BroLucius: Michael Rosenberg tells me that he 'never' passes a one-bid from partner. He would certainly respond on those South cards.|pg||
nt|danilo1: well. J10. J10 .. I thk I would bid too :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|BroLucius: North could not really open anything else, with losers in every suit.|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|danilo1: but if she bids 1NT .. would she pass 3@C or bid .. and if what ? - 3NT?|pg||
nt|BroLucius: Unless you play 2@C and 2@D as bot strong and artificial, with 2@C showing a weaker hand and rebids then NF.|pg||

pc|h4|nt|BroLucius: 3@C would be forcing, surely?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|BroLucius: South could bid either 3NT or 3@S (having denied 3-card support already).|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|c9|pc|c6|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|danilo1: that's why I like to play 2@D multi and 2@H/@S nat semi-forcing (old dashioned) ... not extremelly frequent but allways good scores|pg||

nt|Rodal F: 1NT then a round force|pg||

mb|p|nt|Rodal F: 2@S?|pg||
nt|VUGRAPHZEX: She did|pg||
nt|BroLucius: 2@S natural. I don't know why North has taken another bid.|pg||
nt|BroLucius: If South had 10+ he would have bid something stronger.|pg||
nt|BroLucius: I would bid game now on the South cards.|pg||
nt|danilo1: well .. North highly overbid ... problem for Bea now ... probably 3NT only|pg||
nt|danilo1: she bid only 2@S after Dble|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Rodal F: My pard at N have told me 18 -20|pg||
nt|VUGRAPHZEX: North explaines 2@S as strong bid and alerted it|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|danilo1: after I vid only 2@S ... I would bid 3NT only prepared to excuse if slam is on :)|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|BroLucius: OK, North misunderstood the intended meaning of 2@S.|pg||

mb|1H|mb|d|nt|danilo1: of course not ... but for me "@S would just be natural bid ... @S and no preference for @C/@D.|pg||
nt|BroLucius: I will have to spend two days hearing how Carlos made +650 now.|pg||
mb|3H!|an|weak|mb|d|nt|danilo1: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|BroLucius: The responsive double by East usually denies four spades, otherwise he would bid the 'other major'.|pg||
nt|VUGRAPHZEX: Well, if he tells you in a nice restaurant:)|pg||
mb|3S|mb|d|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|danilo1: TD at the table?|pg||
nt|danilo1: which reason East has to go out?|pg||
nt|VUGRAPHZEX: No, 3 minutes ago, to tell they are 1 board behind scedual|pg||
mb|p|nt|BroLucius: Risky pass by South. Why is he not bidding more hearts?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Rodal F: Here u have a nice 4@H fore ure magazine David. Look what the @DQ ban make by timing.|pg||
nt|Rodal F: *can|pg||
nt|VUGRAPHZEX: dbl by Soares was points|pg||
nt|danilo1: I would Dble 4@C|pg||
nt|BroLucius: 3@H is a weak bid, of course, but South has a good hand. And partner would (should) not double 3@S without some defensive cards outside spades.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|hA|pg||

pc|c2|pc|s2|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|BroLucius: Zia says you should always bid game with a 6-4 major fit.|pg||
nt|BroLucius: Presumably NS bid 5@H over 5@C at the other table.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hQ|pc|h8|pc|c5|pg||
nt|danilo1: and I agree with him (with J.Vernes and M.Lawrence as well)|pg||

nt|Rodal F: And right he was this time as well if S take out the half nail by @DQ. @D9 still dangerous|pg||
mc|11|nt|danilo1: simple theory of total tricks|pg||
nt|BroLucius: Still, if NS bid 4@H, then EW might go to 5@C and make it.|pg||

nt|BroLucius: probably best on this deal). You pay a price leading from the king, and another price for leading from the jack.|pg||
