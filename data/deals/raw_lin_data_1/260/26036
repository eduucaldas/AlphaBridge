nt|djneill:  we aren't sure about the result in the other room, 3@d-E looks odd|pg||

nt|vugrapha3: passed out...now we will never catch up with the results from the closed :(|pg||
nt|djneill:  East will select the strong opening surely|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Krolikowski scored 10 on bidding 5c|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|djneill:  let's see if they go for 6@d|pg||

pc|c8|nt|djneill:  has entries to unblock @h, get over in @s, try a 3rd heart|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||

nt|ianmcc: OK back to @c|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|dQ|pc|s3|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|pc|h2|nt|djneill:  East plays the @c5, hiding the @c4, which may not make a difference, but sometimes does cause the opponents to forget or miscount|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: flat board|pg||
nt|ianmcc: didn't see this - looked unlikely?|pg||
nt|djneill:  the play or the auction?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: North in the tank|pg||

mb|p|nt|djneill:  North 1@s shows a solid hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S!|an|F|mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|djneill:  N-S opening/response like standard except you subtract 3 when opening, and add 3 when responding|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|djneill:  roughly|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|djneill:  so South has 7+ 3 = 10 , worth a 2/1|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 1s is forcing...NS play fantunes|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugrapha3: 3 loosers|pg||

mb|2D|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|djneill:  Krol responds lite, but N-S's game is not making|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|djneill:  2@s = doubleton since no support double originally|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|djneill:  North can try to ruff twice in hand, or just use the good spades and ruff once on dummy, which is easier|pg||

nt|djneill:  unlucky for Krolikowski, going for game on one hand in the other room, missing game on another - if it were reversed, Krol would have a big lead|pg||
mb|1H|an|F|mb|p|nt|djneill:  North's 1@h shows a solid opening, South has a near-GF|pg||
nt|ianmcc: unlucky?|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|djneill:  South can probably GF now that North is 15+|pg||
mb|2H|an|alerted late|mb|p|nt|djneill:  2@h = transfer?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: not alerted|pg||
nt|djneill:  1@s is 0-9, so would be suprised if 2@h was signoff|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|djneill:  eventually will descend into game|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|nt|ianmcc: 3NT not the place to be, even if makes|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ianmcc: this has merit, protects @cK, at least early|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok so @c lead seems likely given that is the unbid suit|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c7|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|djneill:  West goes for the only defense possible - North having a doubleton @s|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: North thinking|pg||
nt|djneill:  now also if East has the @cK and, say, @hA, a @c will set up|pg||
nt|ianmcc: he can ruff @c but what to pitch on 3 trumps (if needed)|pg||

nt|vugrapha3: Jacobs saying: interesting board|pg||
nt|ianmcc: another game with little hope|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|djneill:  yes only hope seems to be ruffing a 3rd spade and squeezing someone in the black suits|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|d|mb|3H|nt|djneill:  well, West|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  South goes for a preemptive 3@h, rather than a cue|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|djneill:  as a passed hand, 9 sometimes qualifies as a cue|pg||
