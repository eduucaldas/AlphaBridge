nt|danilo1: that he is very tecnical player .. very prmissing player in young austrian nat. team in 90-es .. long break ... and now he is back|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|BroLucius: East will not give up.|pg||
nt|BroLucius: He probably showed 5 spades with his response (neg double with 4 spades), so he knows partner iwll not have 3-card support.|pg||
nt|Rodal F: A 3@D?|pg||
nt|danilo1: Dble or 2NT .. I prefer Dble|pg||

nt|danilo1: that's why 2NT not good ... still - I would bid 3@S now as West|pg||
nt|BroLucius: On bidding panels (in the bridge magazines) you always get a good score by choosing double when it is an option.|pg||

nt|BroLucius: It looks like a good auction here. 6@H needs some work to make 12 tricks. You have to get rid of the diamond losers, perhaps taking a ruff or two or discarding on the established ...|pg||
nt|BroLucius: spades.|pg||
nt|Rodal F: Agree u Danilo. All over N's bids are hard to take|pg||
nt|danilo1: if 2NT shows minimum ... he already bid it ... he denied 3-card @H already as well ... pd din not ask aces ... so he should not worry he des not have one ... why not cue @D?|pg||

nt|Rodal F: Even at 2/1 mant pairs have a deal that by 5@S and 5@C u open 1@C. Bid 1@S and later 2@S. Not a reverce. The onliest reverce wich is not a reverce:) Just a normal opening. But a ...|pg||

pc|d9|nt|BroLucius: You can just make it if you win with @CA and play a spade. You can ruff one diamond and take a club finesse later. You ened to ruff a spade high, so require 3-3 trumps too. |pg||
nt|BroLucius: Make six, that is.|pg||
