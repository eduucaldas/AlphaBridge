mb|3N|an|4342 no minumum|mb|p|mb|4C|an|cue|nt|BroLucius: 3@S must be splinter, so @SAK wasted a bit (in hearts).|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|an|cue|mb|p|nt|BroLucius: South has done enough. His trumps are weak opposite 3-card support.|pg||
mb|4S|an|maybe he doesn't want to ask aces|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|an|1 Ace|mb|p|nt|danilo1: not sure 3NT was rite choice ... North should show bad @H and too many wasted Hcp in @S by bidding 4@H|pg||
mb|5D|an|Queen?|mb|p|mb|6H|an|Queen, no sideking|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Rodal F: For info: Lindquist have been ill for a while and was the pard to Boye Brogeland after he and SÃ¦lensminde quitted. Ellestad a new 1. div player. |pg||
pc|sT|nt|BroLucius: Not a good slam but rather difficult to bid. All depended on trump quality and nothing in the auction seemed to refer to that.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Onno:  Yes, it is no shame not to avoid this one|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h2|pg||
nt|danilo1: after 4@S (evident void) ... already late .. but North had to bid 5@H (looks like he thught 4NT is sign-off)|pg||

mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Onno:  Wow, indeed|pg||
mb|p|pc|s2|nt|Onno:  The German NS in the other room will not be happy with two slams down in their first two boards|pg||
nt|BroLucius: McKenney lead for a club ruff.|pg||
nt|BroLucius: Cannot be 4th best from a pre-empt.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|BroLucius: He hopes partner has @SA.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|danilo1: honestly ... thk I would not bid only 5@H as North ... for Dbling second possition, South should have solid hand|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|h3|pc|sT|pg||
nt|BroLucius: It's not that solid, is it? I think 5@H is plenty.|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h9|pc|h4|nt|Onno:  I agree with the double... the one with the short spades might be dbl aggressive|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|BroLucius: South has only 12 oiunts a three cards in the other major, so cannot be described as 'must be solid'.|pg||

nt|Onno:  I think this was a very reasonable auction|pg||
nt|danilo1: :) evidently not according to ther style ... but in this position, I prefer sound Dbles|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pc|s6|pg||
pc|hK|mc|12|nt|BroLucius: If you play all such bids as 'sound', you have to pass too often, as I see it. and give opponents an easy ride. |pg||

nt|danilo1: and I like all my partners when they do it as well |pg||
nt|BroLucius: Same with playing sound pre-empts. You have to pass with QJxxxxx? Not me! |pg||
mb|1C|an|2+|nt|BroLucius: Diamond lead could beat even 5@H.|pg||
mb|2C|an|both majors at least 5/4|nt|danilo1: 6@D has shown how important is to have confidence in partner's bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|BroLucius: Why? He only had to bid 4NT to check if K or A of trumps there. No bonus for just guessing.|pg||
mb|2H|mb|d|an|takeout, normally short !H|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|3H|mb|4C|nt|danilo1: but he knew pd would never open without it ... and if they play 1-4 3-0 ... 5@C answer is only giving the possibility to opponents to Dble fort the lead (one he did not want)|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|nt|BroLucius: Would the doubler not be on lead?|pg||

mb|6D|nt|Onno:  Declarer can take a big view in clubs to escape for 500... but he would not dare|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|BroLucius: As I see it, a ridiculous pot. Why not bid 4NT? West might have QJ high diamonds!|pg||
