mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|BroLucius: 3@S usually forcing now, with game tries going via 2@C (or the other way round).|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|BroLucius: 5@C, looking for a heart control.|pg||
nt|danilo1: 5@C now |pg||
nt|BroLucius: 4NT useless, of course, with a void.|pg||
nt|VUGRAPHZEX: results: http://www.bridge-madeira.com/index.php/tournament-prizes/2012-results/2012-teams-menu|pg||

nt|danilo1: *6!"S|pg||
nt|danilo1: +6@S|pg||
nt|BroLucius: I think North might have cue-bid on previous round. He can expect good spades from partner.|pg||
nt|BroLucius: He had already limited his hand with 1NT and held three good cards AKK.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|danilo1: I also thought ... true, 4@H was gratis bid ... but he is absolute minimum|pg||

nt|BroLucius: It is hardly a question of 12 or 14? So, minimum irrelevant compared with controls.|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|3H|nt|BroLucius: South is a bit frisky, vulnerable against not. Perhaps he has the previous board in mind. |pg||
nt|VUGRAPHZEX: She|pg||
nt|BroLucius: 2NT is a big rebid, so I really think 3@H is too much.|pg||
nt|BroLucius: Oh, she. Thanks. I will try to remember. Easier for you, when you can see the players!|pg||

nt|danilo1: but when East bid 2NT, he did not know @H bad placed|pg||
