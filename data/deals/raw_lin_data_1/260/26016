nt|steshome:  Interesting hand to play - declarer should still get home though|pg||
nt|rmb1: should she use minor A to take @H finesses?|pg||
nt|steshome:  I think so - she only needs one heart trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzhf: although if the @H loses to the queen, they might fire a heart back...South knows the @C position|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|xenya: no guarantee -- the @H play would mean 1 down with the @H honours reversed|pg||

nt|panja: Darren, our Vu graph operator....was quick to do that...|pg||
nt|panja: it was 14-16 Nt in CR, 12-14 here|pg||
nt|panja: so...here, on 3@H...S showed top of range by bidding 3@S first...|pg||
nt|panja: in the CR, S passed...and waited N to show 6 Spades...|pg||
nt|panja: before a raise to 4@S..good bidding in both rooms..|pg||
nt|runnerup:  some 220 ave in pairs normally -in teams ,,still some 300 so 420 in both rooms is high standard|pg||

nt|xenya: fireworks on this one?|pg||
mb|2H|mb|5D|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|rmb1: I guess East is thinking (not North) - screens|pg||
nt|vugraphzhf: presumably east will double and they'll probably get in a ruff for -3|pg||
nt|vugraphzhf: i assume so :) - i'm the wrong side of the screen|pg||
nt|vugraphzhf: i could put in jason's pass already :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|xenya: well. it was quick...|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: or was it? -- i don't think W should bid now|pg||
mb|6D|nt|steshome:  It's not clear to pass - I agree that pass is the right bid but for me it's close|pg||
nt|vugraphzhf: some kerfuffle over calling the director without the other table hearing, so jason has gone to get the director|pg||
nt|vugraphzhf: as it was over the other side of the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzhf: a director has only just been found|pg||
nt|rmb1: we say that the bidding was slow on NE side of screen - followed by 6@D - it is for the other side SW to call the TD to "reserve rights"|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rmb1: we saw ...|pg||
mb|6H|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzhf: surely that isnt the right thing to do after calling the director? now you get 5@HX or 6@HX so not much upside to bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzhf: i dont know, anyway the @CT is making this a bad decision|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d9|pc|dQ|pg||

pc|c7|pc|c8|pc|cK|pc|cT|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|h9|nt|rmb1: 6@H is still insurance against 6@D making, if 6@D is disallowed then you still get 5@HX|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
mc|8|nt|xenya: 6@D is a good contract, but i still have misgivings about W's bidding |pg||
nt|vugraphzhf: yes, quite...that's why i dont think jason should necessarily bid as his upside isn't huge, i mean is 6@H really going to be *that* cheap|pg||
nt|steshome:  Goodness me - 5@d shows a massive hand - he had @dKJx plus the club holding plus a singleton heart.  Very very tempting to bid on|pg||
nt|vugraphzhf: maybe he did if west has long @C or something like that|pg||
nt|vugraphzhf: anyway the director is looking at it - will probably get changed to 5@HX -3|pg||

nt|vugraphzhf: not a fan of 2@H, if partner has a @H fit you're probably beating 1NT nicely, maybe he thought they would bid @S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|xenya: yes, Sarah. but why didn't he bid 6@D over 5@H directly?|pg||
