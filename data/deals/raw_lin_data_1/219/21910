pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|d6|pg||
nt|othered1: GIB's lead would be @H10 or 9|pg||
nt|othered1: But GIB plays with open cards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the auction said nothing about West hand other than  want to play 3N opposite  9-13 hcp, 4441@C|pg||
nt|henryb:  If I understood the auction I might lead the @h10 also|pg||
nt|othered1: An advantage to relay systems, when you can keep the relayer's hand closed.  If it comes down in dummy, defenders are given a real edge.|pg||
nt|henryb:  In the Bulgaria match E-W played 1@s making 2|pg||

nt|henryb:  If allowed I would play odd-even|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course last hand we knew NOTHING about declarer's shape   but everything about dummy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Reid-Newell actually do play odd-even in most situations    i don't think ACBL allows that carding except 1st discard|pg||
mb|d|nt|othered1: You're right about ACBL, and I'd prefer to use them in  more situations than just first discards.|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  true; but the ACBL also would not require me to play against these methods|pg||
mb|4S|nt|henryb:  I would allow both|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||

nt|ahollan1:  1 a push  but Ben Thompson was in position to make if he'd guessed @H correctly|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|othered1: Typically, east's carding is suit preference here.  Do they play reverse preference?|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW play Reverse Suit Preference|pg||
nt|henryb:  should the @d3 be attitude or SP? I think sp, since partner knows about the @dA after tr 1|pg||

nt|petergill: Because their other openings are mostly 9-13, NS regard 14+ as "strong"|pg||
nt|petergill: North feeling uncomfortable, as 3@D might be a 4-2 fit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL was takeout|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: certainly he had better chance than in other room|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if this is not good enough they need to revise system, considering east also had 2nt for minors|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: 1NT will make 3NT a make because east won't lead a diamond|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: same as OR. and plsy ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems rich with minimum 1@C opener and weak suits|pg||
nt|petergill: Best for N to pass, as 3@S would be doubled by W|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Newell PASS just denies ability to game force|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: 3rd hand should open on good suit, i dare say. |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: so i may open 1@h.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 14 board matches, but we started with  17    so don't leave after  28|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thinking about whether to play @D before @H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: By the way, we already have "rag" among bridge slang. Unimportant card. "My spade holding was the king and four rags"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he has to play a diamond eventually, so this does not justify thinking very long|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but how many  UMJOODOs?    Rod tells where that name came from  but i'd like to thank whoever decided to popularize Reverse Flannery|pg||
pc|h4|nt|petergill: Peter Newell being a very ethical player, like most New Zealanders|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Reid's problem is that Newell could be 1444 with no @CQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but does that hand rebid 5@C over 4@S?|pg||
nt|petergill: It's not so obvious to NS that the match has turned out badly so far - e.g. their 2@H making five (Bd 23?) might be a pickup from their point of view|pg||
nt|fabsayc: even then he has diamond hook, also 7 not impossible|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: UG. ducking ?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: 2@H by South|pg||
pc|h7|nt|cc469: a dearth of entries to dummy|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: so  my guess of 3N-all pass was just a little off|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe that hand would bid 4NT, Al, choice of games|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very well done Martin Reid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right  so Newell 5@C does sound like 5+ suit|pg||

nt|Walddk4: if he gets 5@D now he is in slam|pg||

pc|cA|nt|pole_as_ch: 2@s ???  sry, bad comment|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: and another 6 imp.  29imp is 22-8 vp.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|petergill: Unlucky hand for weak 1NT, this one|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think it was david gold that said weak no trump is a losing proposition at the top level|pg||
pc|c6|nt|eamongall: Hanlon is normally extremely strong as a declarer but 4-1 breaks kill most of us |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: good auction to best contruct!|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|eamongall: anyway tightens up the match |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes Lui played very nicely OR|pg||
pc|c7|nt|pole_as_ch: comes Chen's Ocaltic call.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Dec can catch 8 tricks easily, but 9th ?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|pole_as_ch: why so jumping ???|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Maybe, East Opening is not 2@c, so 6 was enough, Ch3n was thought.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: *Chen|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Now Furuta safely settled 6, or not ????|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: this is 17 imp if he make this|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: and new leader !! or not ??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't think it will convince them to change the system|pg||
nt|petergill: 12 X 14 board matches, this is Round 8 of ther Swiss|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: great auction from EW|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but for sure you should keep track|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or convince Fantunes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or Hans-Nunn|pg||
nt|petergill: this will be quite a big swing, with NS vul and tough discards to be made|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well fantunes weak no trump is not normal, can be any 5422|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and 6322 and 4441|pg||
nt|petergill: Scores after 7 rounds at http://www.jcbl.or.jp/home/English/nec/17th/results/tabid/659/Default.aspx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a couple of the Japanese Seniors also weak notrumpers|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not any 5422, Martin, not 5-4 in the majors|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk4: Nice auction, McGann making up for his rather tame 1@S (4@S and 5@D)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h6|pg||
nt|eamongall: He sure did ..well done H Liu |pg||
pc|d9|nt|pole_as_ch: 10 ticks is sure.|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: plus 2 tricks come from dummy reversal ??|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: He knows bad break of trump.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 17imp has it reality.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 2 bd include this only remains|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: @d7 shows @dA ?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Defence also have not tricks|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: so the move of Dec and North deside the fate.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d7|pg||
nt|petergill: North hoping @SQ is doubleton |pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|nt|pole_as_ch: 9th will be a little fade.|pg||
nt|petergill: will be disappointed|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the dutch card play and defense is very precise, no tricks given away carelessly|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: do you think he was worth 2@S over 1@H?    is there a default about the difference between 1@S and 2@S there???|pg||

mb|d|nt|kiwibridge: Lin gets that imp back, and so to the last|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@S=FG, 10+ HCP, 3+ CNTRL [A=2, K=1], a) BAL [5@C/@D(332) ok]  b) 1-suit, 5+@H|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: sry, 19-11 vp|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N relay|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: right  that's why i asked if there's a default   [if so  i don't know which applies]|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but in this case 4 spades almost guaranteed by double so less need to distinguish length|pg||
nt|eamongall: Yeh .. how come my E and A keep getting mixed up |pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: 4@s can make ??|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 3@d = 4 supp & limit raise |pg||
nt|petergill: Before this match, Downunder had 7 VP gap to 9th so they will possibly drop out of the top 8 overnight|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=(32)44 same rank  [@S&@H or @D&@C]|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: RDBL = 10+ hcp   very traditional|pg||

pc|dT|nt|eamongall: Now lets see how McGann declares |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: why now by South ?|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: *next|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: can he make  ?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: more difficult than looking dummy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S another forcing noise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D exact shape|pg||
nt|petergill: Relays are not as important on game hands like this one, but are very good for slam hands|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is there as size ask available now al?|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Next round will be 90 minites later |pg||
pc|d4|nt|kiwibridge: his team mates did him proud OR|pg||
pc|d8|nt|eamongall: I think he will go one down |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: @dQ shows seq under that.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 2 @h, 1 @s and can make|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: i think 3@H asks controls  [A=2 K=1]|pg||
nt|petergill: Both 4@S and 3NT are safe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and 3N = 4  [1@S promised at least 3]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Newell knows an Ace  or 2 kings missing    does that help him bid over 3N?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Come ! and be fun about new team, new heat !|pg||
pc|h3|nt|pole_as_ch: Tajima would be lead after this BD, but how |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 6!  Chen !???|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: if he behave @d no loser, this can make !! |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: The call of 3@c is very good hint for Dec. so Chen might ....|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: -10 or -11 imp is not hevy lost for Tajima, but Chen should make this for his stand !!|pg||
pc|h6|nt|pole_as_ch: but dummy entry remains ?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Walddk4: flat board, 11 IMPs = 18-12 VPs, but we are not quite sure that it's scored correctly throughout|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and so a modest victory to the Hackett team|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: scores from other matches show up under  http://www.jcbl.or.jp/home/English/nec/17th/results/7thFeb/tabid/665/Default.aspx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: must choose results, NEC and then "details"|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: 4@D forces 4@H to signoff   [EndSignal]|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he needs heart queen for slam (ie 12 points)|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and AKK rather than AA|pg||
pc|h5|nt|petergill: so S knew N had either Axxx, xxxx, xx, Axxx or Kxxx, xxxx, Kx, Axx or AKxx, xxxx, Kx, xxx with Q's and J's unknown|pg||
pc|h4|nt|pole_as_ch: and 26imp will be 21-9 vp for Senior Champion !!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes, i think you need to separate those cases|pg||

nt|eamongall: I still think one down |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: but doomed ????|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: Looks flat, so 22-8 it is. 1 IMP more for 23-7|pg||
