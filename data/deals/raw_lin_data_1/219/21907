nt|andyv:  that's where they were saturday:)|pg||
nt|mrdct: pages 3&4 for bill & ben|pg||
nt|mrdct: so in the EW methods all one-level openings are frocing for one round|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed,    N-S are    Stamatov - Karianov|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They play Precision|pg||
nt|mrdct: so about 14+hcp|pg||
nt|sybarra: how did we not make 6 @C?|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh I see,  the @D ruff :( unlucky |pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if Yeh partnerships are playing standard or some Precision pairs|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: good start for FT|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: all Bulgarian top pairs do|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: and NS   akama-maruyama  [not sure who's where]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=game force   a bunch of hand types  in this case  balanced  [no singleton or void]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my dream is that someday  BBO will work on software for operator and there will be functionality to just INSERT PASS  instead of having to do all of those UNDOs|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: EW in OR is team leader of FT.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: They use Blue club oriented system.|pg||
mb|d|nt|mrdct: 2@s is 10-13 5+ @s|pg||
nt|mrdct: so east is clear a big max for his bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not 1@C from east|pg||
nt|ahollan1: P-1@C-P-  then  1@H=4+@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: *clearly|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: NS of this room i know each of them, but pd-ship i don't know|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@S RELAY  |pg||
nt|mrdct: btw - i'm going to predict bill jacobs is sitting east as ben thompson is a bit more agressive and would probably open 1@s with the east cards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, Bill is always E and N I noticed|pg||
nt|mrdct: believe it or not i've never noticed that|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Normal ? 2/1, i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: i think the 1st two matches are up|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|dQ|nt|pole_as_ch: NS in this room are wife(N) & hus(S)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: operator won't be able to lead   so then auction should get fixed|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C balanced  8-11 or 15+ hcp|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/home////tabid/223/Default.aspx  for tournament website. No results yet I'm afraid. They only update the page once a day if memory serves|pg||
nt|mrdct: poor result for Oz in the open room|pg||

nt|Walddk2: thx|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s2|pc|d4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N broke out of relay so East guaranteed declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vP's 1@S [RHO's suit]  showing the 2 unbid suits|pg||
pc|h5|nt|pole_as_ch: They (NS) prefer schenken|pg||
pc|hA|nt|eamongall: yes first two rounds are up ... and 3rd round was only finished ... |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: if someone teach me |pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: 3@D = 4/5@D  not 4@H/@S|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Andy was referring to the Dutch Premiere League final that was on BBO last weekend|pg||
nt|andyv:  declarer starts with 8 tricks and has 2 4-3 suits to find the 9th, or the @d suit.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mrdct: the problem in the open rooms is with only one @s stopper you need cashing tricks on top which just weren't there|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: EW team won by 1 imp after trailing by a bunch after 4 round|pg||
pc|cA|nt|andyv:  yes, they certainly made a quick turnaround to get to this tourney|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it's not unreasonable to play 1@S as natural even though RHO has shown 4+  since 1N by passed hand is available to show the 2 unbid|pg||
nt|vugraphzws: Sorry for wrong bits.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mrdct: needs to make this to hold the damage to 5 imps - otherwise it's 8 imps out|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: they did that last year too|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk2: Operator, please insert names        North:  Stamatov     South: Danailov       East: Jacobs      West: Thompson|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: and went on to win the NEC Cup|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mrdct: in fact when i last played against them i was south and screenmates with bill, but that may have been because ben didn't want to be screenmates with me|pg||

nt|mrdct: but it might mean something else|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would Shih also open 1N if distribution was 4225|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  the 2@h bid may have caused EW to underestimate their values|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 1@s open because of Scenken system.|pg||

pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: does 1N deny 4@S?     probably  otherwise North would probably use some form of checkback|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: 2-way checkback  or  new minor force?    probably 2-way  so  2@D = artificial game force|pg||
pc|s9|nt|sybarra: may now get pushed too high?    can they even beat 4 @S?|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: checkback was used in other room so Patrick Huang avoided @S lead -- but his choice of @HK wasn't a success either|pg||

nt|andyv:  EW can't get away from @c suit last few hands|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  11  [the long auction to 5@C]  Miyakuni 3N West|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, South could have defeated it (ruffing @DK)|pg||
mb|1C|nt|sybarra2: bd 11 3 nt +2 in the other room |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: that picked up 2 overtrick imps   but  5@C much better at imps|pg||
nt|sybarra2: dealing machine having fun with club suit|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: how many @C has vanProoijen held this set?|pg||
nt|sybarra2: the Yeh Bros team is:  Chen Yeh, JuiYiu Shih, ChiMou Lin, Herstein Liu, Patrick Huang, Grace Lin |pg||
nt|sybarra2: and they Yeh Bros sponsor a great tourney also shown on bbo |pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: 2 bd is remains. 40imp is 25-5 ! |pg||
nt|Walddk4: But it looked natural to him to get rid of his last heart|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|andyv:  a lot|pg||
nt|andyv:  6@d is the lucky spot on this hand|pg||
nt|mrdct: Oz might win those imps back here|pg||
nt|mrdct: 7@h seems kind of extreme on these EW cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra2: another invitation tourney |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Patrick Huang bid only 2N  but still got to game|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra2: Patrick is a frequent commentator with us (when not playing) |pg||
nt|sybarra2: he also lived in Netherlands for many years and probably "brought these dutchies up" |pg||
nt|ahollan1: which black suit to attack??    that answer affects play to trick 1|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sybarra: and a quiet part score |pg||

nt|sybarra2: not sure I really want to be there however |pg||
nt|fabsayc: i would not even cue with norths non=opener|pg||
nt|ahollan1: may not be an option in the partnership|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he could bid bid 4@S over the double surely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i.e.  common agreement  MUST return cuebid if available below game|pg||
nt|mrdct: 1NT is 10+ bal GF|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|mrdct: 1@c is 14+|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|fabsayc: is prooijen pretending to lead a singleton|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mrdct: 2@h and 3@h look natural|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3@s i guess is a cue and 3NT is a slam try|pg||
nt|mrdct: beyond that i'm guessing|pg||
pc|h3|nt|pole_as_ch: good contruct !  it looks cold.  so 5 imps buck.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one of the first to play Precision  [helped CC Wei with some system clarification  or maybe just in introducing the system in Taiwan]|pg||
