nt|rv: Venky can bid 6@d to show @CQ+@Dk or jump to 7|pg||
mb|5N|an|!CQ + extras?|mb|p|nt|rv: Venky possibly doesn't want to cross 6@c level to show side king, if he had source of tricks he would have GS himself, now he is showing @CQ and some extras (at-least 1 king)|pg||
nt|psyck: @sq3rd in is hardly 18%, and @dKxx is 46.5 %|pg||

nt|arunbapat: this board appears to create first bing swing of the match|pg||
mb|d|nt|arunbapat: big|pg||
nt|vugraphzwg: W in the tank|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@h opening may prevent them from finding the @c sac|pg||
nt|rv: I doubt if Sridhar would have pre-empted 2@h with his reg pd in second seat, normally he plays sound pre-empts in second seat|pg||
mb|2N|an|xfer to !Cs|nt|arunbapat: and this will is more likley to disclose S Q position|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|rv: the idea to play sound second seat pre-empts is that it will preempt partner more often than opps since he is likely to have good pd after 1 opp has passed|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck: there are advantages to opening 2@h too at this vul...a matter of style i guess|pg||
nt|rv: Swarnendu's 2n is puppet to 3@c and willingness to compete in a diff suit at 3 level|pg||
nt|rv: Arun is right, first big swing of the match in Formidables' favor|pg||
nt|surkal: having|pg||
pc|cA|nt|arunbapat: how S went down in 5 after CA lead?|pg||

pc|c8|pc|c5|pc|c6|pg||
nt|psyck: misguessed @s|pg||
