nt|nilsland:  a lot to do in 3 NT - this will be a raise between decl 9 and def 5 tricks|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|nilsland:  the defense being favorites in my op|pg||
pc|hT|nt|oosmanb:  2@D was multi. 4@C was : Bid one UNDER your major, and then South can declare it|pg||
nt|oosmanb:  Playing 4@C this way, (and 4@D = bid your major) allows responder to protect his holdings|pg||
pc|h5|nt|eamongall: Good evening folks |pg||
pc|hJ|pc|d3|pg||

pc|h9|nt|eamongall: and Peter Goodman a regular visitor to Dublin (maybe he lives here) ...but afraid I don't know Pownall in person |pg||
pc|d7|nt|vugraphzvu: could have been 3 apparently|pg||

nt|yo_yo: Great bid there by Hrolfur|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Point counters might only bid 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|barbyh: hi all|pg||
nt|gsper:  Welcome|pg||
mb|1C|an|16+ unbal/17+ bal|nt|eamongall: of course we can all see @S finesses and endplays with @C but this is teams and over a 32 board match an imp here or there is less crucial then going down in a game |pg||
nt|barbyh: hi gsper|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: Part-score hand now; EW make 3@s; NS 4@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: 2D is either 6+ D no 4cM and 10-13 or 5-9 with 4+D and a 5cM|pg||
mb|2S|an|6+ !Cs, 8+ HCPs, no side 4 card suit|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|vugraphzvu: robson wondering what to do|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: i thought it was making :(|pg||
mb|3D|an|singleton/void|mb|p|nt|nilsland:  looks lite 7 tricks|pg||
mb|3N|nt|eamongall: In the other room they start with board 15-16 to allow some comparisions in at least one room |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzvu: Robson..head in hands now...what to lead|pg||
nt|clinch: so 4@s is actually a good save against 4@d|pg||
nt|clinch: Thanks Basil|pg||
nt|nilsland:  The majors behave surprisingly welll after the vul 3 @C|pg||
mb|4C|an|rkc in !Cs|nt|VUGRAPHZVH: fazla söylediler biraz :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: I am still looking for mcDonaghs hand on this board :) |pg||
mb|4S|an|2 KCs|nt|nilsland:  maybe on a spade guess|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|eamongall: 3rd hand light they say :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzwf: It was making, but S revoked..|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Now is 3NT a slam try?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: IF so, Wrang is interested|pg||
nt|gsper:  On 3 rounds of @C W can discard a @H and onother on @D|pg||
nt|nilsland:  3 rounds of clubs will give the defense an extra trump trick but the heart loser will go away|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  :)|pg||
nt|barbyh: if he tries a tr promotion the heart loser goes away|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|eamongall: but with @Ds as NS resting place they probably have saved Wales from a tonk|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|clinch: Must resist the temptation to play K@d here|pg||
nt|clinch: Patterson's 2of @h probably encouraging, but length still ambiguous|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: yes, he might have to guess which red suit card to try and cash|pg||
nt|clinch: He certainly does|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Hello everyone|pg||
pc|s3|nt|eamongall: automatic 1@H I am told by Mikes next trials partner |pg||
nt|yo_yo: well done|pg||

mb|d|nt|nilsland:  Most players open 1 NT with 54 minors. Even with xx in a major.|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  their system is http://www.bridgewebs.com/bgb/PattersonCrouch.pdf|pg||
nt|ady: needs a club lead to beat spade or diamond slam|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all |pg||
nt|frankaus: it summer here in sydney|pg||
nt|aramesh_:  Welcome to Frank Budai|pg||
nt|nilsland:  I would not open1 NT with that spade suit and two small diamonds|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|eamongall: Goodman will give a good invite I think |pg||
mb|p|nt|emre kaya: ooo kontur geldi NS ekip için kötü skor olacak|pg||
nt|ady: they may well reach 6@S|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  strong 1@c nebulous 1@d - not dissimilar to the EW system|pg||
nt|dkkello:  I think it is only me , but dont like open 1 NT with 5 good spades |pg||
pc|s6|nt|eamongall: suppose I could go get a convention card |pg||
nt|eamongall: well as 2@Hs is forcing he will be in game |pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: Allfrey now wondering what to lead|pg||
nt|dkkello:  ok 2 of us :)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  agreed|pg||
pc|s2|nt|nilsland:  3 @D will go down with this lead|pg||
nt|nilsland:  perhaps also with other leads :P|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s7|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  presumably North's 2@c showed @d|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  no - both minors|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  you have to hover your mouse in just the right place to see the explanation :)|pg||
nt|gsper:  Mats, do you remember the days when you were not supposed to open NT with a small doubleton?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|nilsland:  I still dont if I have 54 or a 5-card major!!|pg||
nt|nilsland:  with good club guess declarer may take 12 tricks - but it isnt pairs...|pg||
nt|gsper:  I would be content to make this|pg||
pc|sT|nt|yorkbeach:  Hello David|pg||
nt|ady: club lead   stiil a chance  as East will have to play the 10|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s3|nt|clinch: 3NT is easy here with diamonds breaking|pg||
nt|frankaus: a mere 28C today - we thinks thats cool 4 our summer|pg||
nt|dkkello:  1 @S - 1 NT all pas |pg||
pc|c9|pc|cK|nt|ady: later a club towards the J9X may enable declarer to establish a 2nd club trick|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  EW for Wales are Paul Denning-Patrick Shields|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  their system is http://www.bridgewebs.com/bgb/DenningShields.pdf|pg||
nt|gsper:  With @HA wrong it would be in jeopardy|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West knows that dummy is short in @h|pg||
nt|ady: now will make    not clear for Denning to make an attacking lead|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  though this has not been the weekend for trump leads|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if Forrester is West in the other room, there will not be a trump lead there even if the contract is the smae|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer can ruff a @h in dummy |pg||

nt|nilsland:  Wrang has learned the hard way - one IMP can decide the match or even the tournament|pg||
pc|cA|nt|nilsland:  now 2 down|pg||
nt|nilsland:  You have to take that up with West, Kjeld|pg||
nt|nilsland:  He may want some action|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|nt|eamongall: afraid several Irish kibitzers totally disagree with me thinking 4@Hs is plausible |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|clinch: This won't take long; will duck a couple of spades then bang down the AK of diamonds|pg||
pc|cT|nt|yorkbeach:  he can cater for 4@d with West by cashing a top honour and l;ater leading the ten, ducking if West covers|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  :(|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Bridge is not about playing well - but to win some points in some way :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: Welcome to Rory Timlin |pg||
nt|gsper:  Good slam but nasty distribution|pg||
nt|nilsland:  A slam looks good - at least if you only see EW hands|pg||

mb|3N|nt|emre kaya: sansatu hariç:)|pg||
nt|clinch: Not sure of EW system...|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: strong club based|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|eamongall: this looks like a Tartan or Lucas 2@H bid by West |pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: South asking questions.....|pg||
nt|ady: good morning all|pg||
mb|p|nt|gsper:  6 can still make with a good guess|pg||
nt|gsper:  Any idea what 3@C meant? Natural??|pg||
nt|gsper:  But then W would not bid 3@D|pg||
nt|barbyh: looks like a squeeze|pg||
nt|nilsland:  The 3 N bid indicates that 3 @C was a natural bid - inviting something slammish|pg||
nt|nilsland:  West 3 @D is more difficult to explain - parhaps a cuebid|pg||
mb|p|nt|emre kaya: 4 körde zor 4-3 e uzundan kýsalýnca|pg||
nt|clinch: Thanks; I think both pairs play 1@c as strong, is that right?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: e/w convention card says strong club precision style|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: and n/s says that they play delberto club|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: which is a system designed principally by Crouch i believe|pg||
nt|clinch: Delbert is Derek Patterson's nickname|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if NS reach 3NT, they will do well to play it from the South seat|pg||
mb|p|nt|barbyh: maybe relay|pg||
nt|nilsland:  yes|pg||
pc|s2|nt|aramesh_:  Hello David-Welcome|pg||
nt|ady: Patterson decided to make the 2@C overcall   so 3NT easy to reach|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  this will put the opening bidder, who is likley to have the sxK on lead|pg||
nt|frankaus: NS strong @C bu the look of it|pg||
pc|s9|nt|VUGRAPHZVH: partaj sorun yok|pg||
nt|ady: not well judged by South   4@H  well down  4@S should fail by one|pg||
nt|ady: thx Aramesh|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: think W will end up endplayed at trick 5|pg||
nt|ady: however   the wrong way up|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  as it is, wrong sided|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @sK|pg||
nt|gsper:  Kind of sudden. And mysterious in view of the earlier bids|pg||
pc|s6|nt|nilsland:  A good bidding and a sensible contract|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|dkkello:  :)  yes , and I leave you now Mats , preperations for the game! Go Denmark and good luck here!|pg||
nt|dkkello:  see you .. |pg||
nt|nilsland:  good lukc denmark|pg||
pc|h2|nt|eamongall: unfortunately for heneghan this 5 level is a phantom |pg||
nt|clinch: So strong club or not, NS end up playing in 1NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: unless he can find the 8 of diamonds now?|pg||
nt|frankaus: using strong @C u can open with that collection|pg||
nt|sverjohn: 3 spades probably shows normal opening values with 4s as a raise to 2s often will show 3|pg||
nt|nilsland:  I am not sure I agree with Easts pass here and if Upmark has not showed his support for clubs I dont like 4 @S|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d3|nt|clinch: Best continuation|pg||
nt|clinch: Not room for much more in East's hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: hes still going to get enplayed repeatedly though isnt he, Crouch can just exit diamonds |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|timb: Interesting 4@S bid|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer holds up one round in the faint hope of a 7-2 spade split|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|timb: I would defend 4@H|pg||
pc|h7|nt|emre kaya: ben 3 pik demeyi tercih ederdim koray abinin eliyle|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Upmark probably worries over lack of Aces|pg||
nt|gsper:  Will this even make now?|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h5|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ady: Allfrey 2@S normally shows a liking for hearts but not for spades   when in fact his spades were better than his hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: South offering a prayer for his miracle spade lie|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3NT might fail even from the South seat|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|nt|nilsland:  2 NT as invitational is strong with 13 pts but openings nowadays is 11+ and S has 4333 and poor spades|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: however   shoud Denning find the bright lead of K  or J of spades  the defence would prevail|pg||
nt|nilsland:  no|pg||
pc|c3|nt|yorkbeach:  yes a low spade would block the suit|pg||
nt|gsper:  He would have been in better shape if he had ducked the first trick|pg||
nt|gsper:  But I don't think I would have|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
mc|9|nt|eamongall: ah now it becomes clear ... a kib mentioned 6@Ds on board 1 .... making in Open Room off the 2 cashing @HS |pg||

mb|3D|nt|eamongall: sorry I was looking at the wrong hand when talking of 6@Ds ... am corrected ..it just needed several finesses :) |pg||
nt|ady: Robson did not want to go quietly|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  when two strong club pairs play each other, much can depend upon which pair has the good cards|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  1@h = 4+@s|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S   around the limit or 5@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|eamongall: probably not the best board to hunt down 2@Hs on ..and South has moved on |pg||
nt|eamongall: should be able to make plenty of tricks in 4@S or 3N|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: he has now...without too much thought|pg||
nt|clinch: Yes, maybe misled somewhat by heart discards...South could always make by playing on hearts if he reads the club length correctly|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: true, he said after the hand that he should have played A and another club when E played one through|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: a bit messy all round i think|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  (1@s would have shown 4+@h)|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  and nothing else|pg||
nt|marlowepi: very good hand for a strong NT, so there is a case for 1C. but there is also a strong case against that call|pg||
nt|nilsland:  If Souths spades were K10x the contract would only make from Souths hand|pg||

nt|vugraphzvu: yes some flat boards. a relief for the players im sure after a hectic morning. 227 imps changed hands in the scotland match over 32 boards, and it was swingy when eng played as ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: well|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  at the other table South led a trump and bang went the ruffs|pg||
nt|ady: croush opening?|pg||
nt|ady: crouch|pg||
nt|nilsland:  We all can symphatize with Upmark I think. You think you have missed a slam and you go down in 4 by  misplaying it....|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 5@C   fpr e/w    more if no heart lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  sorry to keep going on about it - but you have to beat right when you lead a trump - otherwise it is a mistake|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ady: 2@C forcing  alerted|pg||
nt|clinch: That one also looks quite normal, although most of us would have started with 2NT, followed by a bit of something Staymanic|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  be right|pg||
mb|p|nt|emre kaya: 4 pike gelecekler|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Some danger for EW here|pg||
mb|2D|an|!Hs|mb|p|nt|ady: tht Allfrey might have shown diamonds at this point|pg||
nt|clinch: This 2@h bid was seen also last hand|pg||
nt|clinch: This time finds a major suit fit|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: its exciting to see something other than stayman and transfers|pg||
nt|ady: may reach 4@S     though an easy 11 tricks in hearts|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  play for 6@s|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if you avoid a @h loser, just the @cA to lose|pg||
nt|frankaus: looks like the italian intermediate 2@S|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ady: bidding is pointing towards a heart lead   so better stop in game|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: I think 1C was conventional|pg||
nt|ady: ok   so 1@C had not promised clubs|pg||
nt|timb: The splinter should slow things down!|pg||
nt|timb: 1@C usually balanced or clubs|pg||
nt|timb: I think|pg||
mb|2N|an|minors|nt|eamongall: good choice by Peter Goodman to remain quiet as Heneghan surely would have got noisy over @Hs |pg||
nt|eamongall: 4@S EW seems possible |pg||
nt|nilsland:  trump lead is ordered|pg||
mb|p|nt|emre kaya: çok az konuþtular bence:)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  2 Nt is natural - problably invitational|pg||
nt|nilsland:  will go down on a heart guess - i presume|pg||
mb|3C|nt|emre kaya: ikiside|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  does 2Nt ask what the suits are?|pg||
nt|ady: need spades 3-2 |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  no - shows @d|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe down on a D shift instead|pg||
mb|3H|nt|timb: I'm told it can be a singleton too - as in two obsolete systems I can think of, Vienna and NSW |pg||
nt|ady: danger here|pg||
nt|timb: I agree|pg||
nt|ady: unless 4NT not rkc?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: dont think delberto will take too long with this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzvu: with the K@S lead|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North is about to find out that South's second suit is spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  and this sequence has protected the @dAQ|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North is sure to look for a slam once he finds out South's second suit is spades rather than clubs|pg||
nt|frankaus: friendly layout here 4 declarer|pg||
mb|4C|nt|clinch: :)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  On the other hand - Upmark wants revenge|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  maybe I should have said 'if' rather than 'once' :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: not clear if 3@s is systemically 3+@s or exactly 3...|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if North uses RKCB with @h inferentially agreed, the response will reveal 2 key cards missing|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: I *think* 3@s has shown exactly 3@s as N bid 2N, not 2@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: must assume 4NT in this sequence not rkc|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: 4N was asking something...impossible to read the Robson scrawl|pg||
nt|nilsland:  You should save your aces to play over the kings|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  South may be trying to work out whether 4@s is a cue with @h agreed or an attempt to play there|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|yorkbeach:  it seems 4@s was a keycard ask, so 4NT = 1 or 4|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: Crouch did write he *thought* 4@s is RKCB, so we may be in the unknown here|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ady: not suprising with Robson having 2 small of a suit not bid or cu bid|pg||
nt|nilsland:  two down now |pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|h6|pc|cJ|nt|yorkbeach:  using the bid at the 4 level one denomination above the trump suit is kickback|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: though he has confirmed N should not have 4@s on the bidding|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  so 4@s is the ask with @h agreed, 4@h with @d agreed etc|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  play will be quick here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  on 2 England gained 2 IMPs|pg||
pc|h2|nt|timb: This should be quick - a DT&C deal (Draw Trumps and Claim)|pg||
nt|timb: maybe not - I am a bit tired|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Forrester-Gold bought the contract in 2@s and went one down for 50 to Wales|pg||
nt|gsper:  Now he may see S as the safe hand and guess right|pg||

pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|nt|yorkbeach:  declarer is vaguely worried about a 4-1 spade break and losing a ruff but not much he can do about it|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c2|pg||
pc|d3|nt|nilsland:  I dont like Wests 2 S |pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|nt|nilsland:  discarding a @S gives declarer a hint about spades - but will it help - mayby if he goes for an endplay againt South|pg||
nt|gsper:  Which works, right?|pg||
nt|nilsland:  I still think he will go wrong (which is right with the odds)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if he places D ace with S he could play 3 rounds of hearts|pg||
nt|nilsland:  at the other table East was declarer and a @D lead leads to a faster one down|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ady: should enable them to get to 6@D|pg||
nt|ady: 6NT   would also make    an easy squeeze|pg||
nt|timb: It looks like 6@D is best 3 @Ss, 2 @Hs, @H ruff, 4 @Ds & 2 Cs|pg||
nt|frankaus: some may bid  2NT|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|frankaus: over 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|timb: Yes, 6NT makes on a black suit squeeze|pg||
nt|frankaus: not sure that helps really|pg||
nt|nilsland:  the 9s and 10s will make this possible if declarer goes for spades first|pg||
mb|p|nt|timb: or finessing @S10|pg||
nt|nilsland:  The spade suit is the trouble here|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|clinch: Meanwhile the system has gone overboard a bit here|pg||
pc|s4|nt|frankaus: again cards sit well 4 declarer|pg||
nt|sverjohn: 1o tricks should be no problem despite the 4-0 break here|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c7|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: have asked the operater|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphzvu: good save isnt it?|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|nilsland:  there is a chance of beating it if East can keep his entrys to the long heart|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes but surely N will attack spades first|pg||
pc|c5|nt|timb: I was asked whether I wound want to be in 6NT when 6@D is easier |pg||
nt|timb: WS Gilbert's "no never ... well hardly ever" applies|pg||
nt|ady: 6@D must be better    there may often be a lay when 6NT fails|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|c4|nt|eamongall: but 5@Hs made less tricks in other room so 12 imps back ... personally I think that board should have been played in 4@S unmolested in both rooms ... an old bridge player used to ...|pg||

mb|2H|an|!Ss + m|nt|emre kaya: :)evet ew konuþursa çok batýyor|pg||
nt|ady: 6NT played by North |pg||
nt|ady: might get there|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  probably just as well - Forrester found the @c lead against 4@s|pg||
nt|sverjohn: So the score is 0-0 still|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  declarer still made 12 tricks - the club spots were good enough to set up a @c trick|pg||
nt|ady: everyone itching to get in after strong club opening|pg||
mb|3S|nt|eamongall: some shapely hands around |pg||

mb|6S|nt|ady: yes|pg||

mb|p|nt|timb: A good, practical bid by South|pg||

nt|vugraphzvu: I can sort it after this board though|pg||
nt|ady: or diamond major 2 suiter|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  any alert for 4@h?|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  or stronger?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  OK|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: I think 4@d was @d and a M|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: sorry, its 12-15 with short diamonds|pg||
pc|sK|nt|eamongall: this hand is not much diffrent then the 4@Hs Wales bid earlier with all the noise |pg||
nt|eamongall: no noise when Heneghan bids it |pg||
nt|ady: and 4@H   pass or correct?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  so 4@h was pass or correct|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: so 4@h pass or correct?|pg||
nt|frankaus: can  4 be right in OR? - PI with souts 15HCP?|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|sT|nt|ady: not plain sailing|pg||
nt|ady: still a trump to lose|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Board 4 was in fact passed out in the open room it seems. Strange with a 15-count in souths hand|pg||

nt|VUGRAPHZVH: %55-58 arasý gidiyorlar|pg||
nt|clinch: Yes, 5@c unlikely to be bid really, but might have made|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: 4@d was @d and a major|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: 4@h was pass or correct|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  board 4 was flat Wales also played 3NT from the North seat - and Gold found the spade lead|pg||
mb|p!|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  board 5 was flat too|pg||
nt|nilsland:  NS has to find the sacrifice and EW has to find to double - should be interresting|pg||
mb|1N|nt|yorkbeach:  South's opening will keep EW out of their @s fit|pg||
nt|ady: the Crough 3rd in hand opening  will stop any chance e/w playing in spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: also, 4@d on the last board showed at least 5-5|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|emre kaya: beyaza kýrmýzý poazisyonda 1 kör açabilir bu el sadece|pg||
nt|ady: dangderous red against green|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: Here 4@s is surely the place to be, though EW not yet bid|pg||
nt|sverjohn: The Icelandic pair in the other room found a strange fit|pg||
mb|2N|an|5!Hs|nt|emre kaya: diðer durumlarda 2 kör açarým ben|pg||
nt|VUGRAPHZVH: koray bey seviyor zayýf açmayý þehmus'a da aç dedi :)|pg||
nt|ady: south 3rd and 4th heart small pips   otherwise would surely pass|pg||
nt|timb: South's trump pips argue against a pass.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  as a passed hand, I would have been doing something on the North cards over 2@h|pg||
nt|ady: very unevenfull with such shape about|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Most players will bid again as N I think|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|emre kaya: zaten pozisyon çok uygun demese bile açardý bu zon durumunda:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: should be 11 tricks |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer sees straight away why North has not led his partner's suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|VUGRAPHZVH: koray bey uyuyan devi uyandýrdý |pg||
nt|emre kaya: 1 kör pas pas geldiðinde 1 nt demek 11-15|pg||
nt|ady: as it is  only 6 tricks in hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: seems strange that E passed with Qxxx spades and 10 million points|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: but i guess he was wondering why wilkinson didnt bid on the first round|pg||
nt|nilsland:  The scottish-norwegian team will gain more imps on boards 5-7|pg||
mb|p|nt|sverjohn: 1D showed hearts and 1H 3-card supp.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|emre kaya: 2 nt 18-19|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT a bit pushy|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: director telling them  they are 10 mins behind...|pg||
nt|timb: I think he would make it for sure if it was a double dummy problem; however...|pg||
nt|ady: 16 opposite 7 with no good fit|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|nilsland:  At the other table 5 @S could have been made with C!Q lead |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|timb: West will be reduced to black cards and be endplayed in clubs|pg||
nt|ady: A@C   and that may be the lot|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ady: Allfrey has 2 stops  in diamonds so this looks doomed|pg||
pc|c9|nt|clinch: 10 tricks in spades is all about avoiding 2 trump losers, and there is a standard safety play;|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|emre kaya: güzel oynadý rua trefi|pg||

pc|h2|nt|ady: south entries are bad|pg||
pc|h5|nt|timb: he can play another diamond if he likes or play on clubs as he has now|pg||
nt|ady: he needs to make 2 clubs 3 spades 2 hearts and 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|timb: Most likey (eventually) West will endplay dummy with a club and declarer will endplay East with a diamond for a heart return|pg||
nt|timb: Then declarer runs @SJ; he makes 3 spades, 2 hearts, 2 diamonds and 2 clubs|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||
pc|h9|nt|emre kaya: kör asý çizildi galiba:)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|nt|timb: Now the defence can prevail|pg||
nt|timb: declarer needed to play diamonds first.|pg||
nt|ady: this may well be a swing if made   and as often happens the 2@H bid by Allfrey carries risk and helps opponents if they play|pg||
nt|timb: a heart now is fatal|pg||
nt|nilsland:  then you can discard a heart loser in time|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: is it small to the Q on the first round?|pg||

nt|VUGRAPHZVH: yessss|pg||
nt|VUGRAPHZVH: %10 gibi aldýlar|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: claim on who had the @cA|pg||
nt|ady: may be a decent score for wales  as 5@C  only down 1 for n/s last hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: so either +1 or +2|pg||
nt|sverjohn: So the score on board 4 was wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  so the match is even - even if not mÂ´without mistakes :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|timb: After @CK held, declarer needed to concede a @D; then he's in on @HQ he plays a @C to the Q and concedes a club. West then has to lead a spade.!|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ady: monster 25 hcp with east    may well play in 3NT going down|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the way the cards lie, I cannot see a making game anywhere|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|clinch: Useful bid to have, that 2NT!|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: yes, the n/s system file has had plenty of work. you can regualarly find this n/s pair practising partnership bidding on bbo|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East will insist on reaching game of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: Looks as though 4@h will be reached here; 4@s a good save|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  and be hoping for a slam if West has a fit|pg||
nt|ady: 2 spades 2nd negative?|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: Wales in 3@S on board 8 ... might be a make but will not be -300|pg||
nt|nilsland:  4 @H may make iwithout club lead|pg||
nt|nilsland:  svendsen found the lead at other table|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  we think 2@h is either @h or a balanced hand|pg||
nt|nilsland:  4 @S will go down but.-....|pg||

nt|ady: 3 hearts preference    4H?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|emre kaya: 2@S deseydi 5 li pik 4 lü kör olacaktý|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Good result for the icelanders here|pg||

pc|h4|pg||

pc|hT|nt|nilsland:  West was put under pressure here|pg||
pc|hK|nt|emre kaya: hehe|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: again a nice easy 4@H for derek|pg||
nt|nilsland:  But difficult to take 10 trick anyway|pg||
nt|nilsland:  impossible really :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ady: difficult to see how this can make on this lay   only 7 tricks |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|clinch: It looks as though just playing small from either hand would be ok as safety play on prior hand - key is not to bang down the ace!|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Interesting contract|pg||
pc|s3|nt|yorkbeach:  when East bid 3@d, he said 2@h was hearts, with @d a second suit|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North does not know that East's spades are AK10|pg||
nt|ady: maybe an 8th now?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|nt|emre kaya: ama bu el davete sokmamalýydý bence köre transfer edip býrakmasý lazýmdý|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  a switch to the @sQ looks reasonable|pg||
nt|ady: best a club back   put east to a discard now|pg||
nt|nilsland:  But only we see that diamonds are 33'|pg||

nt|emre kaya: belki öðrenmek isteyenler vardýr çaðrý hocam seyircilerimiz arasýnda:)|pg||
nt|timb: That was painless for South|pg||
nt|clinch: Yes, 4@s will be 1 or 2 off, depending on whether NS can establish a club trick quickly enough|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: yes, but your way best, as then you dont needless lose a trick when the suit is nice|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: stiff king with S or something|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphzvu: found the bad news...|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|nt|ady: now east can likely get the 8th in the end game|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  NS defensive signals are usually reverse attitude but can be standard, so the 7 would be discouraging or an even number|pg||
