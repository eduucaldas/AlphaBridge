nt|ahollan1: rumor mill [web page not updated yet]   thru 7 of 12 rounds    china W2 134, Bulg A stars 131, ontaka 130, china Geely auto NEDUK down under 129 , Hackett 126 Stmatov 123|pg||
nt|petergill: Because their other openings are mostly 9-13, NS regard 14+ as "strong"|pg||
nt|petergill: North feeling uncomfortable, as 3@D might be a 4-2 fit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL was takeout|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: certainly he had better chance than in other room|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if this is not good enough they need to revise system, considering east also had 2nt for minors|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: 1NT will make 3NT a make because east won't lead a diamond|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: same as OR. and plsy ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems rich with minimum 1@C opener and weak suits|pg||
nt|petergill: Best for N to pass, as 3@S would be doubled by W|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Newell PASS just denies ability to game force|pg||
mb|4H|nt|pole_as_ch: 3rd hand should open on good suit, i dare say. |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: so i may open 1@h.|pg||
nt|kemperg: why not 3@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  20  the ladies are in 2N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D implies desire to play in suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: here South has @C stop  and they tend not to lead @S after showing 4+|pg||
mb|p|nt|beauch:  looks like 2 down?|pg||
nt|cc469: I think if you bid 2@C you have to be prepared to bid your 4 card @S suit if the opportunity arises ( which it did here)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so invite for most likely game   with 2N|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kemperg: but only invite?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pole_as_ch: difficult contruct. to make and to defend|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: East can easily slow-in and end-played, nightmare|pg||
nt|xenya: one can sympathise with S. who wanted to show good cards in @C with the 2N bid -- still her hand is more suit=oriented|pg||
pc|dT|nt|pole_as_ch: humm. |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|fluffy: the hand will make 11 tricks comfortable, but if you look in isolation the hand you would rather play 6@c than 3NT before the lead since clubs 2-2 mean 6@c makes and @c3-1 put 3NT ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: in danger|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|kemperg: right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course easier to bid South hand when you have tools like Gazilli or Cole |pg||
nt|ahollan1: if I was North   i would have rebid 2@S instead of 2@D|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|pole_as_ch: c.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 8 or 9 trick.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: EW play GhN)estem  but that still uses  1M-(2N) as 2 lowest unbid|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: this bd now is 17imp swing. +10 or -7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and that is actually what Gold did|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: he not yet knows bad break of trump|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: if my method, @c is good. so 6@c would be in scope.|pg||
nt|fluffy: lead directing openings in third are fine but they are most useful when you open light on the 10-12 range, with 16 there is not as much lead directing need IMO|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: well.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: !Q ?|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: no, @d ruff i lost. sry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course   sometimes the opponents bid 6 over 5 :)|pg||
nt|petergill: I don't like 6@h much. The assumption that partner has very short spades can be faulty, as on the actual hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and the Kings are defensive, not offensive|pg||

nt|Walddk4: By the way, we already have "rag" among bridge slang. Unimportant card. "My spade holding was the king and four rags"|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Reid's problem is that Newell could be 1444 with no @CQ|pg||

nt|petergill: It's not so obvious to NS that the match has turned out badly so far - e.g. their 2@H making five (Bd 23?) might be a pickup from their point of view|pg||

nt|ahollan1: very well done Martin Reid|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 3@C=Romex Stayman|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: sry, 19-11 vp|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N relay|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think that is form of 5-card ask   but don't quote me|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|ahollan1: right  that's why i asked if there's a default   [if so  i don't know which applies]|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but in this case 4 spades almost guaranteed by double so less need to distinguish length|pg||
nt|eamongall: Yeh .. how come my E and A keep getting mixed up |pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: 4@s can make ??|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 3@d = 4 supp & limit raise |pg||
nt|petergill: Before this match, Downunder had 7 VP gap to 9th so they will possibly drop out of the top 8 overnight|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=(32)44 same rank  [@S&@H or @D&@C]|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: *next|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: can he make  ?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: more difficult than looking dummy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S another forcing noise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D exact shape|pg||
nt|petergill: Relays are not as important on game hands like this one, but are very good for slam hands|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is there as size ask available now al?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks for the explanation of 3N :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: on 29 ladies in 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: you're welcome|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: Next round will be 90 minites later |pg||
mb|3S|nt|kiwibridge: his team mates did him proud OR|pg||
nt|xenya: this is makeable double-dummy, but hardly with the cards concealed|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: I think he will go one down |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: @dQ shows seq under that.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 2 @h, 1 @s and can make|pg||
nt|xenya: you need to play for @DK doubleton|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: i think 3@H asks controls  [A=2 K=1]|pg||
nt|petergill: Both 4@S and 3NT are safe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and 3N = 4  [1@S promised at least 3]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Newell knows an Ace  or 2 kings missing    does that help him bid over 3N?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: Come ! and be fun about new team, new heat !|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: Tajima would be lead after this BD, but how |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 6!  Chen !???|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: if he behave @d no loser, this can make !! |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: The call of 3@c is very good hint for Dec. so Chen might ....|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: -10 or -11 imp is not hevy lost for Tajima, but Chen should make this for his stand !!|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: but dummy entry remains ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  29  4@S+1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so pickup for Weak NT|pg||
nt|xenya: right|pg||
nt|kemperg: 11-19 now|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk4: flat board, 11 IMPs = 18-12 VPs, but we are not quite sure that it's scored correctly throughout|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's current Victory Point result|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|kiwibridge: and so a modest victory to the Hackett team|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: scores from other matches show up under  http://www.jcbl.or.jp/home/English/nec/17th/results/7thFeb/tabid/665/Default.aspx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: must choose results, NEC and then "details"|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: 4@D forces 4@H to signoff   [EndSignal]|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he needs heart queen for slam (ie 12 points)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: and AKK rather than AA|pg||
pc|h2|nt|petergill: so S knew N had either Axxx, xxxx, xx, Axxx or Kxxx, xxxx, Kx, Axx or AKxx, xxxx, Kx, xxx with Q's and J's unknown|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: and 26imp will be 21-9 vp for Senior Champion !!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes, i think you need to separate those cases|pg||
nt|xenya: still makeable|pg||
nt|xenya: cash the hearts, @DA and small @D|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: @h2 ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bulgaria v oz very close   so i think Bulgaria [3rd] and the 2 teams tied for 1st are lock with Neduk to get into KO|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|d2|pc|sK|pg||
nt|twcho: the cue bid has taken them to a rather dangerous level|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too much uncertainty about Indonesia Ladies|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|nt|twcho: still makeble|pg||
pc|h6|nt|eamongall: The defenders don't like to get some @D ruffs |pg||
nt|eamongall: I still think one down |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: but doomed ????|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Looks flat, so 22-8 it is. 1 IMP more for 23-7|pg||
