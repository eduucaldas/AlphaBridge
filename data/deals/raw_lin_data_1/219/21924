nt|vugraphzwr: 13-15 in NS's CC.|pg||
nt|athene: @C9 is a nice card, but still very hard for declarer|pg||
nt|athene: i think the defence should be able to come to @DAK, @HAQ, @CA|pg||
nt|othered1: EW's style is pretty natural, with weak NT 1 & 2 positions.  NS are believed to be playing a Precision-type style.  We'll try to find it or will work it out as we go along.|pg||

nt|eamongall: Every event has new operators and after a few rounds they become experienced and learn stuff |pg||
nt|mrdct: but as it happens a low trump was going to work better as east is forced to rise Q and then doesn't have the tempo to take his trick|pg||

nt|andyv:  that's where they were saturday:)|pg||
nt|mrdct: pages 3&4 for bill & ben|pg||
nt|mrdct: so in the EW methods all one-level openings are frocing for one round|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed,    N-S are    Stamatov - Karianov|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They play Precision|pg||
nt|mrdct: so about 14+hcp|pg||
nt|sybarra: how did we not make 6 @C?|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh I see,  the @D ruff :( unlucky |pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if Yeh partnerships are playing standard or some Precision pairs|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: good start for FT|pg||
nt|sybarra: well not if I had a pard who played it this way,....down in the other room |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: all Bulgarian top pairs do|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: and NS   akama-maruyama  [not sure who's where]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=game force   a bunch of hand types  in this case  balanced  [no singleton or void]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my dream is that someday  BBO will work on software for operator and there will be functionality to just INSERT PASS  instead of having to do all of those UNDOs|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: EW in OR is team leader of FT.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: They use Blue club oriented system.|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry, 500 was only possible if West ducked @CK (he played ace) - even then it might be 300|pg||
mb|1C!|an|16+|nt|mrdct: 2@s is 10-13 5+ @s|pg||
nt|mrdct: so east is clear a big max for his bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not 1@C from east|pg||
nt|ahollan1: P-1@C-P-  then  1@H=4+@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ew do NOT play Namyats, so 4@S is wide range|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: *clearly|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: NS of this room i know each of them, but pd-ship i don't know|pg||
nt|cc469: 12 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ hcp  [14+ in 1st/2nd]|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: 1@S RELAY  |pg||
nt|mrdct: btw - i'm going to predict bill jacobs is sitting east as ben thompson is a bit more agressive and would probably open 1@s with the east cards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, Bill is always E and N I noticed|pg||
nt|mrdct: believe it or not i've never noticed that|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Normal ? 2/1, i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: i think the 1st two matches are up|pg||

mb|2C|nt|pole_as_ch: NS in this room are wife(N) & hus(S)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: operator won't be able to lead   so then auction should get fixed|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C balanced  8-11 or 15+ hcp|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/home////tabid/223/Default.aspx  for tournament website. No results yet I'm afraid. They only update the page once a day if memory serves|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@D asks   and now Reid will show exact shape|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no ambition other than finding the correct game|pg||
mb|3N|nt|pole_as_ch: They (NS) prefer schenken|pg||
nt|sybarra: hopefully we will get the names of players sorted out shortly |pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: yes first two rounds are up ... and 3rd round was only finished ... |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: if someone teach me |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@D = 4/5@D  not 4@H/@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Andy was referring to the Dutch Premiere League final that was on BBO last weekend|pg||
nt|andyv:  declarer starts with 8 tricks and has 2 4-3 suits to find the 9th, or the @d suit.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no carryover from Swiss Qualifying   only 2 of the Quarter-Final matchups did battle in the Swiss   ours is not one of them|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mrdct: the problem in the open rooms is with only one @s stopper you need cashing tricks on top which just weren't there|pg||
nt|sybarra: 9, or 10 tricks |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: EW team won by 1 imp after trailing by a bunch after 4 round|pg||
nt|sybarra: or 11 |pg||
pc|cA|nt|andyv:  yes, they certainly made a quick turnaround to get to this tourney|pg||
nt|kemperg: leader may play for 3@D at siide of 3!@Hs, that wont work|pg||
nt|kemperg: down now, cant finesse twice anymore|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it's not unreasonable to play 1@S as natural even though RHO has shown 4+  since 1N by passed hand is available to show the 2 unbid|pg||
nt|vugraphzws: Sorry for wrong bits.|pg||
nt|sybarra: tese are left over from last match |pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 17  5@DX East|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mrdct: needs to make this to hold the damage to 5 imps - otherwise it's 8 imps out|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm pretty sure  W=Verhees  E=vProoijen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room also in 3N   this hand will be more successful than  1|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: they did that last year too|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Walddk2: Operator, please insert names        North:  Stamatov     South: Danailov       East: Jacobs      West: Thompson|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: and went on to win the NEC Cup|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mrdct: in fact when i last played against them i was south and screenmates with bill, but that may have been because ben didn't want to be screenmates with me|pg||

pc|h8|pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can set up one club and a second spade for seven tricks |pg||

pc|h9|pc|c7|pc|c6|pc|h5|pg||
nt|othered1: does south have a chnace to squeeze west?|pg||
nt|athene: if east cashes the heart now, that does rectify the count for a minor-suit squeeze on his partner, yes|pg||
nt|athene: hard defence to find; he has to exit with a minor and just wait for declarer to run out of steam and give him @SK and @h3|pg||
nt|othered1: East, obviously, is considering the effect of cashing last @H.  Average players would likely not see that until the result was obvious.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: terence reese said apropros of this situation, you should be wary of cashing 4 tricks against 3nt unless you have a good reason where the fifth is coming from|pg||
nt|athene: and the same applies to 1nt|pg||
nt|athene: sorry unless you have a good idea where the fifth is coming from|pg||
nt|othered1: If I recall, one of the criteria BBO suggests for an expert self-rating is that you can effectively defend against squeezes.|pg||
nt|othered1: But east is World Class and has seen this position befoe|pg||
nt|athene: well, hans can count the points, and knows his partner can't have any really big card, so no point cashing the heart|pg||
nt|athene: still good co-operation though, especially with the mildly bent 1nt rebid|pg||
nt|vugraphzwr: Hans asked the meaning of 1@c-1@d-1@h/1@s.|pg||

nt|petergill: 14+ points, natural, forcing|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@S natural, 0+ points|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@C=ART, STR, F1, (good 13)14+ HCP unbal, 15+ HCP BAL    [weaker in 1st/2nd]|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: not sure if lebensohl situation or 2N=2-places to play   either way  3@C is constructive|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: @cA|pg||
nt|sybarra: not the bid E wanted to hear |pg||
nt|ahollan1: East could have used Raptor 1N overcall to show 4@H/@S & 5+@C  but unfavorable vul and passed partner   =  yuk|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i know in Ron Klinger's version of transfers over 1@C   his 1@S=4+@D and has 4-card major ONLY IF game force|pg||

nt|ahollan1: DBL=6-9 HCP|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: BD  3 is push !|pg||

nt|cc469: a frisky 2@S bid got the result it deserved|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i have no idea :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i have some old Convention Cards for Zejun -- but not with this partner|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D accomplishes nothing    South gets to describe his non-game force strength  and  NS have all the room for Relays|pg||
mb|2H|nt|petergill: Other table: I have to admit that I prefer 4@S on Bd 19 to 3@S and think Australia fully deserved their 6 imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 4@D implies  "i know what to do when they bid 4@H/@S"|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N was bid and made in OR on  3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I wouldn't know that, so i vote for 5@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or both majors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in 4 boards we've already seen  an 8-card suit   and now 75 hand   were these shuffled??|pg||
nt|petergill: on Bd 18 I mean, not 19|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but  North not good enough to use Game Force Realy|pg||
mb|4H|nt|andyv:  5@d makes|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  19  East playing 2@CX|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H natural, non-force   [1@H would be Relay]|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: immediately   let EW make the last guess|pg||
nt|andyv:  so, not so sure EW action was the best for them|pg||

mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: Y, N's 2@h is very natural.|pg||
nt|petergill: @HQ = unblock jack if you have it|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Texas Transfer|pg||
nt|cc469: I'm told NS are from women China team 1|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: i wonder why Shin didn't open?   if 2@S promises a 2nd suit, then assume 2@D multi|pg||
nt|ahollan1: China Geely Auto roster is   Gui Shengyue, Zhang Banxiang, Yang Lixin, Dai Jianming, Zhuang Zejun|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the big club auction in the other room didn't get any closer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but not a great slam for people who guess queens like me|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pole_as_ch: East might try @d. but 3, so she choiced pass.|pg||

mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: Last BD is -1 in OR, so 3 imp.|pg||
nt|kemperg: no good start fot Yeh Bros, 29 imps in 4 boards:(|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=less than game force|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@C  natural game-forcing|pg||
nt|mrdct: ben now showing @d as his second (and probably longer) suit|pg||
nt|mrdct: again - the theory is nothing can go wrong when you are green vs red|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, if you take the 'save' over 6@C a lot can go wrong|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3@d looks like a splinter which is usually il-advised with a stiff ace|pg||
nt|mrdct: but it might mean something else|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would Shih also open 1N if distribution was 4225|pg||
nt|twcho: whoever south is, they are not regular partner|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=a) 4441@D, any  b) 4@S, BAL, 12-14  c) 5+@S 4+@D, min  or 55 MAX|pg||
nt|ahollan1: North did have option to super-accept|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S  natural, 1-round force|pg||
mb|4H|nt|petergill: I think 2@S was forcing with less than 5 spades, and that with 5+ spades Sth would respond 2NT, but I do not guarantee that|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  the 2@h bid may have caused EW to underestimate their values|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 1@s open because of Scenken system.|pg||
nt|mrdct: so west's actions have talked NS out of 3NT|pg||

nt|ahollan1: on 19  2@CX was +580  and 13 imps to China Geely Auto|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: 3@h is safe ! or some snag ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other table  5@H South|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: and put south on the spot to perhaps bid a failing slam|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think S is looking for tricks here |pg||
nt|ahollan1: probably not a hand with slam interest - that would start with 2@C [stayman OR game force relay]|pg||
pc|d6|nt|petergill: i played many boards against this pair in the semi finals of our Nationals 2 weeks ago (they won), but I have never played their system|pg||

pc|h2|nt|pole_as_ch: y, now -2.|pg||
nt|petergill: Holding @DQx, East was in no hurry to give partner a ruff with West's 3rd (long) trump|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=10-15 HCP, 4+@H   if 2nd suit, it is LONGER  [or 5@H 5@S]|pg||
nt|sybarra2: yes thank you all |pg||
nt|andyv:  important to remember that EW do not have any weak 2 bids|pg||
mb|2C!|an|1 suiter|nt|ahollan1: 1@S=10-15 HCP, 4+@S   if 2-suits  the other is LONGER|pg||
nt|twcho: east didn't open|pg||
mb|2H|nt|andyv:  except for 2@s...all the other bids are reserved because of the canape bids|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C  10-13  5+ clubs, unbalanced|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They right-sided hearts now so to speak|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not easy for Dido to lead a club|pg||
nt|mrdct: roland's analysis better than mine - the looming @c ruff and promotion of the @hJ the ket here to beat 6@h|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@d in an inv+ relay|pg||
nt|sybarra: suspecting precision here |pg||
nt|xenya: hello Germ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ??  i thought 2@C=1-suiter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and 2@S=@S & minor|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe he is treating it as such|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: *is|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra2: canape |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D guarantees LONGER @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and minimum|pg||
nt|sybarra2: I never have been able to figure out the advantage here |pg||
mb|2S|mb|3H|nt|pole_as_ch: uh! 4@h can make, but can they reach to there ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: sure -- but why?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@S is a treatment i haven't seen before|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe part of transfer advances???|pg||
nt|mrdct: @d lead by south may also beat 6@h as declarer will try to pitch the losing @d on the @CAK|pg||
nt|xenya: tricky hand, this|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  got me on that one|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: No! NS in OR go there !  10 imp would swing.|pg||
nt|sybarra: so alerted before I could type it |pg||
nt|sybarra: just felt like it?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|xenya: NS have full game values but...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there's always that|pg||
nt|sybarra: and was the lead he wanted |pg||
nt|sybarra: over 1 nt|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|nt|petergill: Should South overcall 2@C? Fav vul = good - in Sabine Auken's book, she explains why 3@C overcall of 1@D can work well - EW have 2 unbid majors so might miss the 4-4 major fit. |pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably typical contract |pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW require decent 12 hcp to open balanced hands so  vProoijen PASS|pg||
nt|kemperg: Yeh Bros on 6th place, ONI-TAKA 4/5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: leads 3rd/4th   carding  usually  odd/even|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sybarra: Frank,  we commented earlier about the names of teams,  women vs ladies   |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N = 15-17|pg||
nt|kemperg: first 6 to quarter final|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sybarra: not sure if that reflects age or what |pg||
pc|d7|nt|kemperg: 8|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|sybarra: where is 9th trick ? |pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|nt|mrdct: indeed it looks like anything other than @SA will beat it|pg||
nt|mrdct: sorry everyone - i have a no-GIB policy when commentating so expect serious misanalysis!|pg||
nt|mrdct: looks like only a LOW @s will let it make|pg||
nt|mrdct: trumps might be the likely lead here|pg||
nt|mrdct: but i'm not exactly sure what info south has about the east-west hands|pg||
pc|dA|nt|andyv:  whatever it is, it will be 2 tricks short|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room  2@SX North|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: other table 3@S East|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mrdct: so normal play here is to win A and try to pitch @c loser on the @CAK|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|xenya: @HA|pg||
pc|d4|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C overcall of 1@D I mean|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|hT|pg||
pc|h4|nt|pole_as_ch: oh, 8 imp !|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: no, 7 imp|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|athene: never easy to attack dummy's potential trick source|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|athene: from west's point of view, declarer might be intending to throw hearts or clubs on diamonds|pg||
nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|athene: rather than diamonds on the @CA|pg||
nt|athene: hi good evening|pg||
nt|othered1: Better cash out, however|pg||
nt|othered1: HI, Kit!|pg||
nt|athene: i really think this is a very hard cashout problem|pg||
nt|rick3son:  Leading the Ace, to have a look gives him chance to cash out|pg||
nt|athene: looks natural to try to set up a heart or club|pg||
nt|athene: of course when someone opens 4@S missing all those important cards you know he has wild-ish shape, so you have to consider a void|pg||
nt|kit: He might continue to look by cashing the king of spades -- doesn't seem like that can cost|pg||
nt|othered1: can south handle athe 4th @H?|pg||
nt|athene: yes but even if he cashes the @SK, will east know what to signal?|pg||
nt|rick3son:  and get signal from partner|pg||
nt|athene: east might think he wants a club shift|pg||
nt|rick3son:  4th @h goes on @d maybe|pg||
nt|kit: I think cashing the king of spades is good enough -- declarer has only 5 spades, 3 hearts, 1 club that I can see|pg||
nt|rick3son:  east is likely to siganl for @c|pg||
nt|athene: yes, they would have to slip up again to let it make, as the fourth heart is a loser too|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|c5|pc|s4|pg||
nt|athene: there are ways that might happen though - maybe if west plays his @DA too soon and east gets exposed to a red-suit squeeze|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kit: West knows East has king of diamonds as otherwise East would have pitched discouraging diamond probably, but that doesn't tell West what to shift to|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|d8|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|nt|kit: With the club void exposed, there should be no problem -- in fact, I think declarer will simply take a heart finesse which loses|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c2|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|nt|othered1: now, unless west wins the first @D and doesn't play @H, still down, I think.  |pg||
pc|d4|nt|othered1: on red suit squeeze on east|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|kit: Now diamond back, and the defense will be easy|pg||
nt|othered1: I'll guess south will try @H finesse|pg||
nt|athene: now declarer has to decide between the heart finesse and the squeeze, but the squeeze would be assuming that the defence have erred|pg||
pc|cK|pc|s9|pc|c8|nt|othered1: no, east coul dhave both high @D.|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|athene: yes i was just wondering about that|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer pretty much has to take heart finesse now|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|rick3son:  also may consider j98 holding in @h either |pg||

pc|hQ|pc|cQ|pc|cT|mc|9|nt|vugraphzwr: bathroom break.|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think east could have both top diamonds as he would have doubled 4@S?|pg||
nt|athene: maybe not|pg||
nt|rick3son:  Hi Ed|pg||
nt|kit: I'm surprised at the line of play.  Why couldn't West have held the jack of hearts?  Seems like declarer was playing for something very unlikely.|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: y, 6imp|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: South open ?  i may pass.|pg||
nt|frankaus: unlucky layout here|pg||
nt|frankaus: 4@H making - looks probable |pg||
nt|sybarra: have to keep S from falling in love with hand |pg||
nt|frankaus: bye all - pd here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems all choices there led to -1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C or 1@D for South?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i like systems where transfers over 1@C  include  1@D=unbal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: scores thru round 9 are posted at  http://www.jcbl.or.jp/home/English/nec/17th/results/tabid/659/Default.aspx|pg||
nt|xenya: normal result, although 4@H makes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what do you open Shirley?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: PASS, 2@S, 3@S, 4@s might all get some votes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or in this system   1@H  |pg||
nt|sybarra: hate hands like these |pg||
nt|sybarra: close to opening 1 @S here|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: so it goes|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S probably would have made, so chalk that little gain up to the marginal 2@C overcall|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C strong|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: oh, open! so they go to 4@s !|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: cu frank |pg||
nt|sybarra: thx for helping |pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D GF ... artificial = @H?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice hand partner!|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: 2@C Precision  most Chinese pairs play 6+@C OR 5@C & 4@H/@S|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sA|nt|petergill: 4@H = signoff, minimum |pg||
pc|s3|nt|mrdct: 6@d tricks is a good start for 3NT NS but EW can get to their 5 before NS establish their tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after 9    NEDUK leading with 173   China Geely 2nd with 170|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: does 1N deny 4@S?     probably  otherwise North would probably use some form of checkback|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2-way checkback  or  new minor force?    probably 2-way  so  2@D = artificial game force|pg||
nt|twcho: yes, rather standard precision which is suitable for irregular partnership|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra: may now get pushed too high?    can they even beat 4 @S?|pg||
nt|sybarra: my pards rarely have hands like that one when I open 4  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: from old card  Zejun @C7  =  odd/even  where odd=like this suit|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: checkback was used in other room so Patrick Huang avoided @S lead -- but his choice of @HK wasn't a success either|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in North America the top big club pairs are playing 2@C always 6+@C|pg||
nt|twcho: and NS aren't regular partners|pg||
nt|ahollan1: mine would have 13 cards   but there the similarity would end|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: then again  playing 2-way checkback  South might bid @C|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: well cannot make. but 2 off ?|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|sybarra: can N get in to lead club? |pg||
nt|sybarra: just take 4 aces   easier |pg||
pc|c4|nt|petergill: Best % play of @h suit in 6@H is ace - picks up bare king in either hand|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s8|nt|ahollan1: another possible squeeze -- but this one doesn't work|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|mrdct: losing 2@c, 1@h and 1@s so need to get @d right to make|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|nt|mrdct: predicated on a @c switch by west now which may not be so easy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlikely @D plays|pg||
nt|xenya: this should make despite the4-1 trump split -- but some care is needed|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sybarra: our pards have taken similar lessons it seems |pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|xenya: still can't make it on a @S return|pg||
nt|mrdct: wd bro|pg||
nt|ahollan1: either @DJ still in dummy or @DQ still in hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same opening in other room|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|petergill: but in 4@H, have to consider if safety play of low to @H queen (picks up KJx in either hand) - is safe or unsafe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's why they are called  CHO    cross-hand opponent|pg||
pc|d2|pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: that's better   thanks|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|nt|mrdct: hi peter|pg||
pc|hT|nt|xenya: but now perhaps...|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Geely Auto always seems to provide us with a team for the NEC Cup|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|an|precision|mb|p|mb|2D|an|asking|mb|p|nt|athene: awkward hand for south playing traditional precision 2@C opener|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: if partner has a max with hearts you might have game on, but if you investigate, you can easily get too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Why awkward -- club partial is very likely where N-S belong from South's point of view|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rick3son:  and without surety of 6th @c no guarranty beter there|pg||
nt|kit: Unless North can have only 5 clubs for the 2@C opener -- then South does have serious problems|pg||
nt|athene: well, ok, you know you have a 3@c in a 6-2 club fit or 2@S in a 4-3 spade fit at worst, but that is still not ideal|pg||
nt|athene: yes, NS play traditional precision 2@C, so it might be only five clubs|pg||
nt|othered1: I prefer @C systems that rarely bid 2@C on fewer than 6 decent @C.|pg||
nt|vugraphzwr: 2@c = 5+|pg||

nt|cc469: a fine result|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought he'd play @D before the @H finesse, but really that was his only chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=10-15 HCP    a) 6+@C 1-suiter   b) 4+@C and 5+@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: lots of @H's between e/w |pg||
mb|1H!|nt|sybarra: 2 @D looks like multi again|pg||
nt|petergill: in 6@H - running @HQ picks up only one case - bare jack in North - so if an expert does such play against you successfully, you should hold your cards further back|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=9-13 hcp, unbal, 4+@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: transfer opening  remember specs |pg||
nt|ahollan1: and as you see -- can have canape  longer @C/@D|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@H=@S, 8-14 HCP, usually BAL  a) 3@S  b) 4@S, min|pg||

mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@S=5+@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: dutch playing a canape style, hence this unusual combination|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: hum, 6@c ?|pg||
nt|mrdct: Oz Players here are 2/3 of the runners-up in Australia National Open Teams from a couple of weeks ago|pg||
nt|sybarra: I suspect 5 @h is pass or correct... or the lack of @D was what W was going to bid |pg||
nt|sybarra: just not sure how they play this |pg||
nt|sybarra2: how to find out you have no wasted values in @H's |pg||
nt|mrdct: reasonable 3rd seat opening by north|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: EW in OR already go to there ! heww!|pg||
nt|sybarra: and just need to take aces again |pg||
nt|mrdct: but content to resign when p bids his singleton|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: 2N relay for distribution|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N=5@S 5@C 1@H|pg||
nt|mrdct: close to mirrored shapes here for NS which is often dangerous, but there's no ruff on for the defence so @SA and @DAK only to lose|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: now east hunting for slam, and may well bid it|pg||
nt|xenya: if they get to slam, they will make it|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra2: (and the k of clubs on side) |pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: beyond the 1@c strong club opening - i have no idea what the rest menas|pg||
nt|ahollan1: especially if you have my short neck|pg||
nt|ahollan1: finding @H -- what fun is that?|pg||
nt|twcho: last bd, north misdefend by continuing his @d and squeezed south on the way|pg||
nt|xenya: and E miight be tempted|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: 4@D forces 4@H   |pg||
nt|sybarra2: do you really want to be in this slam?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: probably not but|pg||
nt|sybarra2: ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  you have all the controls ...only a question if you can set up @cs on ruffs|pg||
nt|andyv:  the poor @s spots may determine if they go on |pg||
nt|sybarra2: or smother 10 of @S? |pg||
nt|ahollan1: the auction strongly suggests  @S 4333 around the table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in that case -- 3@D looks more dangerous than normal|pg||
pc|cK|nt|andyv:  you can also try the @d suit |pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@s is 8-10 bal and 3@d asks for a major I'm told|pg||
pc|cA|nt|twcho: he should return a @s to break up the squeeze|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@S = light third seat non-vul openings are all the rage among genuine experts - the older experts like to open 2@S (or equivalent) in 3rd seat (takes away more bidding space) - ...|pg||
nt|petergill: the newer experts find 1@S more effective overall (less revealing to opponents in the card play)|pg||
nt|mrdct: had north passed initially i guess NS would get to 1NT makiing 7 or 8 tricks|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|mrdct: and then 3@h is a transfer to get the strong hand to play it|pg||
nt|mrdct: thanks specs!|pg||
nt|twcho: Top eight teams will enter the KO stage|pg||
nt|xenya: well...|pg||
nt|kemperg: 5@H are your @Hs good?|pg||
nt|kemperg: and W tinks AHx is enough|pg||
nt|xenya: EW lack 2 keycards, but luckily for them, they have failed to to find that out|pg||
nt|kemperg: no fancy play, trying to catch 10x in N and its made|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if West had all of the inferences about the NS @S length  and  North's proably being 46|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with  4135 or 4315  i'm not sure if Newell would rebid 3@C or just a quiet 2@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder also |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Lixin played for squeeze on last hand  so a different down 1 in 4@S |pg||
pc|s9|nt|pole_as_ch: 4@s maybe voidwood ?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 5NT ???|pg||

nt|mrdct: if any of you good analyst out there want to join me feel free|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: finishing in top 3 is helpful   1 chooses opponent from 5-8, then  2, then  3  [ 4 gets stuck with remaining team]|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kemperg: claim|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: 4@D set @S    4@H=avg+ or max  then RKC|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: ummm, they also go !  nice auction! |pg||
pc|d5|nt|fabsayc: this mostly needs two diamonds to survice, then a straight cross ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if @D lead 3rd/5th then unlikely choice of crossruff|pg||
nt|andyv:  if leads are 3-5, W may already know what is going on|pg||
nt|mrdct: obviously with north having already bid @s the transfer benefits are not there - but often you need to stick to your generla structure|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|fabsayc: yes i dont think he will play that way, i was talking in abstract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: double dummy players will  pin north's @S10|pg||

nt|mrdct: with two balanced hands EW may choose 3NT here|pg||
nt|petergill: I think West should have played his top spades (not @CK) on which East could indicate @CA somehow - for 800|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@D = 2 suits same rank  [@C&@D or @H&@S]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not pure CRASH  they use  DBL, 1@D and 2@C instead of the usually DBL, 1@D, 1N|pg||
nt|sybarra: does Reid now try 1 @S? |pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: by the huge margin of 1 imp     Dutch Premier League   i get the feeling it is analogous to the ACBL's Grand National Team|pg||

nt|sybarra2: I would put it more like the Reisinger |pg||
nt|ahollan1: more than the GNT?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: oh  in importance   i made comparison because it runs over multiple months  starting at club level|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: North calmly pass !|pg||

nt|sybarra2: van Prooijen-Verhees, playing in the closed room, won the Dutch Teams Championship (by 1 IMP!) less than 36 hours ago. They must be jet-lagged. Quite a journey from Amsterdam to ...|pg||

nt|ahollan1: hmmmmm   i thought 2N showed 6+@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and game force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H confirms @C and shows extras  [i think]   maybe just extras|pg||
nt|petergill: Pass by West, converting East's Dbl for penalties, yields 800 or 1100 or more, I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lead director :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: I thought maybe he would try 1 @S to see if it was majors |pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|fabsayc: how can it be game force after negative 1@D?|pg||
nt|vugraphzws: Alert with P is miss.sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: in OR, West's 1NT !  humm.|pg||
nt|mrdct: i guess there is chance for declarer to over think a potential bad trump break going for an endplay in @d|pg||
nt|mrdct: which could be indicated with the @H opening by west|pg||
nt|mrdct: btw 2@h is 10-13 5+@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: can be weaker in 3rd|pg||
nt|mrdct: the east-west system has no weak 2 available so with hands like west you need to improvise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if 3@C again pass/correct then 2@H was just showing max|pg||
nt|kemperg: dbl = support 3@Hs|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i wonder -- what is default meaning of RDBL for CRASH players|pg||
pc|s2|nt|petergill: 4@S should make, but is not totally cold|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i was about to say  best contract 1N [which they can't reach]   when result from other room popped up|pg||
nt|petergill: the sort of contract an expert should make and an average player might not make|pg||
nt|petergill: On this lead, 4@S is even colder|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra2: do we hear the screaching of brakes?|pg||

mb|2C|an|6!c or 5!c4M|mb|2H|mb|d|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: i am not a huge fan of 2NT; can't you just bid 3@C, and then if partner bids 3@H you can grudgingly own up to something in hearts|pg||
nt|kit: 2NT call perhaps a bit optimistic.  If South bid 3@C and North passes, likely there is no game.|pg||
nt|kit: if West leads high diamond, declarer will know the hearts are blocked from the bidding and no heart lead|pg||
nt|athene: what will he lead? the "surprise suit" of @DQ, or lay down a top heart to see what is going on?|pg||
nt|othered1: wonder what north's minimum is for the double?  If it's as good as he holds here, passing over 2@H worth consideration.|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|h6|pg||
nt|othered1: But that' s a *real* shot without much information|pg||
nt|athene: do we have to unblock the @C10 and hook the 8?|pg||
nt|kit: this lead is a real surprise -- now the hand is makable if declarer unblocks 10 of clubs and then believes the jack and finesses|pg||
nt|athene: there are many layouts where that lead will be right, of course|pg||
nt|athene: give partner two small hearts and a club entry, say|pg||
nt|kit: I don't see what East can do but return a spade and see what happens|pg||
nt|othered1: believing is the key.  this isn't really a restricted choice situation, eapeciall if an inspired west could find J from J9x|pg||
nt|athene: yes, @CJ under the ace could be from @CJ9 or @CJ9x|pg||
nt|kit: And why shouldn't he play J from J9x -- he will have seen the 10|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  or J9|pg||
nt|othered1: not if it's led by south|pg||
nt|kit: how does it get led from South?|pg||
nt|othered1: good question|pg||
nt|athene: only if east returns a club now, which is not likely i suppose :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@H = 1-suiter, not solid suit|pg||
nt|cc469: I see|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: is north not happy with his @s stopper?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe it *shows*|pg||
nt|mrdct: maybe 2@s is showing the @s stopper(s)|pg||
nt|petergill: Oz Players is 6th so needs to avoid a serious loss in order to qualify|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=one round force   2@C natural   don't know which suit is longer|pg||
mb|3C|nt|kemperg: @S well placed, will make 6|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, can't help it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C confirms canape hand   4@H  LONGER @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and lack of @S bid we have pretty good picture of South hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2N relay for distribution|pg||
nt|andyv:  have to like the quality of the spot cards W|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 7+@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not 7222|pg||
nt|andyv:  but he makes it up in volume|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might be the one system in the world that has trouble with 5@S 5@H :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: What is her choice for OL?|pg||
nt|twcho: interesting system|pg||
nt|twcho: another strange bid by north|pg||
nt|ahollan1: strike that  their teammates in the winning Bermuda Bowl    Tarzan Precision opens 1@H with 5@H and 5+@S  [because of their relay structure]|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@S was 4 spades, longer clubs, 14+ points|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: hard for south to avoid game now|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: now show 0/1@H|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@H slam try in @C|pg||

nt|sybarra2: teetering on it |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i doubt verhees shows  disinterest with @CAK-7th|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: i think so -- but don't quote me|pg||

nt|sybarra2: again the sounds of brakes are deafening |pg||
nt|xenya: maybe N could have a bit more|pg||

pc|cT|pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|andyv:  air brakes|pg||
nt|mrdct: good unblock of the @CJ by bill jacobs|pg||

nt|othered1: I like penalty doubles, but not on this hand for Kit's reason.|pg||
nt|kit: Effective heart play by declarer -- now East is sort of end-played.|pg||
nt|kit: Difficult problem for East -- he might fall from grace and shift to a club.  Although the defense can still recover by getting a diamond ruff.|pg||
nt|othered1: West, with two trump winners, will have a chance to get partner to give him @D ruff.|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|pc|c8|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|kit: There it is -- now defense will have to be very careful|pg||
nt|athene: another heart is best for declarer now?|pg||
nt|athene: then east has to underlead the @DA to maintain communications?|pg||
nt|kit: East can just continue clubs I think|pg||
nt|athene: maybe north will find it hard to keep trump control|pg||
nt|athene: even assuming he finds the @DJ|pg||
nt|athene: if he wants to set up diamonds and draw trumps to cash them he has to knock out @DA, @SK, @SJ - that's a whole lotta forcing he is going to endure|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer probably has a pretty good idea of what the hand looks like, except for the location of the jack of diamonds|pg||
pc|sT|pc|h2|pc|s3|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d2|nt|kit: West has worked out what to do -- should be easy for East to get this right I think.|pg||

pc|d7|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|pc|c3|pc|h6|pg||
nt|athene: if you have to bring in an 8-card fit missing AJ, and you know where the ace is, the odds play is lead through the ace isn't it? don't finesse for the jack|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: so with this diamond suit, if you just know east has the ace, you leaed to the queen then one back|pg||

nt|ahollan1: as here  often weak NT|pg||

pc|cA|nt|pole_as_ch: 3NT would be better contruct, but West choiced 4@s.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H holding 4  means  either weak NT or  4414/4405|pg||
nt|cc469: that should help the @H guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzws: 2NT maybe 20-21|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: agree|pg||

nt|petergill: West did not expect it to be GF|pg||
nt|petergill: I think 2@S the first time is best - 3@S - 4@S |pg||
nt|petergill: but perhaps 4@S is hard to bid after the weak 1NT|pg||
nt|mrdct: yes, but the GF option affect the meanings of double of 2@d|pg||

nt|petergill: With good shape, it's a bidder's game. Shape rules.|pg||
nt|mrdct: if 2@h is dbled, can NS escape to 3@d?|pg||
nt|petergill: I think 2@S the previous time is best, as the delayed 2@S sounds "balancing" or weaker |pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra2: Patrick is a frequent commentator with us (when not playing) |pg||

nt|ahollan1: i think 3@H is one round force|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: what does that mean after 1@D which is 0+ suit?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i would think other 2 suits|pg||
nt|twcho: I will assume it to be natural|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so must DBL or bid 2N with the other 2?|pg||
nt|twcho: yes, looks natural for me|pg||
nt|xenya: i predict S will bid 6 :)|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@D transfer to @H ---> but with equal or longer spades S replies 3@S|pg||
nt|petergill: so South has shown longer @h than @S|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: interesting Tommy  if 2@D is natural   does 2N show @D & @C or  @H & @C|pg||

mb|p|nt|petergill: both teams look 100% safe for qualifying, barring accidents at the other table|pg||
nt|petergill: Bulg 3rd, Oz 6th before this match, 8 qualify after this match|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@H by South is a pleasant enough contract, NS sill be happy|pg||

pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: for the spectators -- there is no single right answer  bidding over a nebulous 1@D   you must have partnership agreement|pg||
