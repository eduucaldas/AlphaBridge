mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|2C|nt|wkc:  so in other room, EW reaches 3NT after S makes a 1@H overcall|pg||
nt|wkc:  N therefore lead @HA|pg||
nt|wkc:  and S think his 6 discourage the suit, but for sure N didn't get the information|pg||
nt|wkc:  and hence they didn't find the @S shift|pg||
nt|wkc:  so one way to solve the miscommunication is using the 8 or even the J|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|3D|nt|wkc:  since S knows that N won't have 3@H(he didn't raise @H)|pg||
nt|wkc:  so pn is Ax|pg||
