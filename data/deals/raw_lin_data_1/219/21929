mb|d|mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: oh ! south trys!|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 3NT ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they can be the typical  preempt OR  an opening bid with no slam interest [typically 3-fit]|pg||

nt|ahollan1: rumor mill [web page not updated yet]   thru 7 of 12 rounds    china W2 134, Bulg A stars 131, ontaka 130, china Geely auto NEDUK down under 129 , Hackett 126 Stmatov 123|pg||
nt|petergill: Because their other openings are mostly 9-13, NS regard 14+ as "strong"|pg||
nt|petergill: North feeling uncomfortable, as 3@D might be a 4-2 fit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL was takeout|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: certainly he had better chance than in other room|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if this is not good enough they need to revise system, considering east also had 2nt for minors|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: 1NT will make 3NT a make because east won't lead a diamond|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: same as OR. and plsy ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems rich with minimum 1@C opener and weak suits|pg||
nt|petergill: Best for N to pass, as 3@S would be doubled by W|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Newell PASS just denies ability to game force|pg||
pc|c9|nt|pole_as_ch: 3rd hand should open on good suit, i dare say. |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: so i may open 1@h.|pg||
nt|kemperg: why not 3@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  20  the ladies are in 2N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D implies desire to play in suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: here South has @C stop  and they tend not to lead @S after showing 4+|pg||
pc|c3|nt|beauch:  looks like 2 down?|pg||
nt|cc469: I think if you bid 2@C you have to be prepared to bid your 4 card @S suit if the opportunity arises ( which it did here)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so invite for most likely game   with 2N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can't jump with south hand when playing standard because the 1@H opener could have up to  20 hcp|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cT|pg||
nt|kemperg: but only invite?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|pole_as_ch: difficult contruct. to make and to defend|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: East can easily slow-in and end-played, nightmare|pg||
nt|xenya: one can sympathise with S. who wanted to show good cards in @C with the 2N bid -- still her hand is more suit=oriented|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|pole_as_ch: humm. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: for both of our pairs non 1@C openers have maximum of 15 hcp|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thru  21   Oz Players over Bulgarian All Stars by 5 imps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Stamatov is also a team of Bulgarians|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|fluffy: the hand will make 11 tricks comfortable, but if you look in isolation the hand you would rather play 6@c than 3NT before the lead since clubs 2-2 mean 6@c makes and @c3-1 put 3NT ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: in danger|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|kemperg: right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course easier to bid South hand when you have tools like Gazilli or Cole |pg||
nt|ahollan1: if I was North   i would have rebid 2@S instead of 2@D|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|nt|pole_as_ch: c.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 8 or 9 trick.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: EW play GhN)estem  but that still uses  1M-(2N) as 2 lowest unbid|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: this bd now is 17imp swing. +10 or -7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and that is actually what Gold did|pg||

pc|d9|pc|dK|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: if my method, @c is good. so 6@c would be in scope.|pg||
nt|fluffy: lead directing openings in third are fine but they are most useful when you open light on the 10-12 range, with 16 there is not as much lead directing need IMO|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: well.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: !Q ?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|petergill: Not sure - 4@C? 3@C? 2@C?  |pg||

nt|petergill: A slightly lucky 3 imps to NZ/Aus|pg||

nt|petergill: NS survived the risky Dbl of 4@H - only just|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: North's 2@h is not as usual|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they seem to have changed bids over DBL |pg||
nt|kemperg: this can be expensive|pg||
mb|p|nt|beauch:  double was very speculative- not much upside|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@SART, 0-4 HCP, maybe BAL 5 HCP|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so now Newell becomes declarer |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=a) @H weak/FG  b) 6@H, INV c) (54/55)@C & @D  weak/FG  d) 4@H & 6@C/@D, FG|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so doesn't guarantee @H|pg||

mb|p|nt|eamongall: at a first glance I only count 9 possible tricks |pg||
nt|eamongall: but I don't press any Gib button|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: one more effort by North ?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|cc469: N would like to know what his partner's @Ds look like|pg||
nt|kemperg: lucky they dont like dbl on a 2 major:)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|pole_as_ch: well calmly pass.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: at least 10 tricks|pg||
nt|petergill: Hans led @HQ at other table - needed to be a minor suit lead|pg||
nt|cc469: alas not so good :(|pg||
pc|c8|nt|pole_as_ch: just make and -1 imp ?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: ugg, 1 or 2 off. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=19-21  BAL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i didn't think they adjusted based on meaning of DBL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but if DBL  specifically @H   [that's how Danailov plays with Karakolev]  ...|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: BD 22, 3@h by NS in OR !|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm surprised  thought Verhees would bid 2@S to show 4/5@H|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: Reid trying to declare :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|pole_as_ch: so 7 or 12 imps.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: we use 2@h as 0-5, not 6 or more HCP|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N was choice of game  confirming 5@H in east|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm looking at the Dailov-Karakolev convention card from 2009 Bermuda Bowl|pg||

nt|eamongall: Hanlon McGann qualifyed  to play in European Championships to be held in Ireland in June last Sunday  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow|pg||
nt|petergill: I think "South" will play 4@S = unlucky as @DKQ happens to be on lead |pg||
nt|kemperg: indeed as spec says they have a 3NT with @CK onside|pg||
pc|s2|nt|beauch:  perhaps North should rebid 2@S?|pg||
nt|beauch:  not 1NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @C from East is no treat against 4@S|pg||
nt|kemperg: 2@S would be minors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe with 5@H  Verhees thought partner had the hand without @H|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|pole_as_ch: wow, 1 up and push !|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: that call influenced south to defend, not to dec's side.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: maybe.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|eamongall: about 36 hours ago .. I left them at the airport near my home |pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: well, 1 off now.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: that can make. so 3 imp for OZ, maybe.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: yes   slam actually can be made by leading @HQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: who's 2@S would be minors??|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: Danailov  -- sorry about typo|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|eamongall: 4@S seems a normal contract but unfortunately only 9 tricks starting off |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought he'd rebid 3@S  [non-force but find an excuse to raise]|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|h9|pc|h8|pg||
nt|petergill: W is on lead to 4@S, so NS reduced the loss from 12 to 10 imps by avoiding the doomed (if played by South) game|pg||
nt|beauch:  not likely to be many flat boards with new zealand unusual system|pg||

nt|ahollan1: and then 3@C=max|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @C length is coincidental|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ahollan1: now maybe 2@S = PURE size ask|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: oh  i'm an idiot    West DBL changes meaning of 3@C|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: half ways and 17imps, humm|pg||
nt|petergill: so in theory 2@H was a good spot, but in practice imps go to the team that bids the dodgy game|pg||
nt|cc469: a gain with 3NT making at the other table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW are coming off a nail biter from the 2012 Dutch Premier League   where the won by ONE imp |pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: North in OR used 2@c ???|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: East would thinking, not North|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 5@h X would be 1 off, and 4@s can make.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: they are many times mem of Japan Open team.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15, 0+@D often weak NT,  if 2-suits  LONGER @C/@S  but never @H|pg||

nt|fabsayc: i dont know anybody that plays that|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not sure i would want to tell opponents my shape anyway|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i found a convention card for South from 2009 Bermuda Bowl -- but different partner|pg||
nt|eamongall: EW play Carrot Club which is similar to Polish Club .. with 1@C opening being 10-12 balanced or 17+ anything |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: then 5@s ?  get down ??  looks like to make, but...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=game force relay|pg||
nt|cc469: appears 3@C showed @Hs as well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: make to gain 1 imp, down to lose the lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but no pressure|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sJ|nt|pole_as_ch: 5@c is defensive call|pg||
nt|beauch:  yes so keep bidding the dogy vulnerable games |pg||
nt|marlowepi: N obviously double normal despite the dull shape. given more room to maneuver NS might find 5m, but in the present claustrophobic environment S made a practical choice|pg||
nt|gizzydrop: already played this board?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: 2N=weak nt, some 4333|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duck to keep declarer out of dummy|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that pair had a way to show 2 suits after Strong 1@C - P - 1@D   but should that apply when this 1@C often 11-13 bal???|pg||
nt|eamongall: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/home/English/nec/17th/results/7thFeb/tabid/665/Default.aspx    some results of earlier matches are here |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Nakamura also !|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: and same contruct !?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh quick jump !|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW need decent 12 to open 1@D with balanced hand|pg||
nt|kemperg: 2nd @S will ruin it|pg||
nt|gizzydrop: giving the english pair another chance to reach 5@D?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|xenya: 3@S? really?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: 2@S is the ONLY weak 2 played by EW    I actually thought that would be vanProoijen's opening bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but @S duck too tough|pg||
pc|sK|pc|h7|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: funny, little short for 2@c i think !|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: Now switch to @d is 1 imp.|pg||
nt|kemperg: wont make this time either|pg||
pc|c9|nt|pole_as_ch: but @c is also good choice, he could see .|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: other room auction started same way  but Stefanov often plays Precision where his 1|pg||
nt|fabsayc: despite the result in open room, this could be down, for sure after trump lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C is always strong|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL of 5@H     when was last time you saw that bid GAIN|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1974|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too often  either keeps opp out of unmakeable slam or gives them extra room to get where they weren't able to go on their own|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in middle of hand  leads are 2nd/4th|pg||
pc|c6|nt|beauch:  cu later|pg||
nt|petergill: Despite Mike Cornell's success with many partners, I think Newell and Reid have been New Zealand's premier pair for about 15 to 20 years. Before then, Newell and Blackstock had ...|pg||
nt|petergill: great success for a few years.  |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|cc469: concerned @HA was a stiff?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the first spade ruined it too:)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: 2@S rebid shows 6+@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and since no 2@S opener ....|pg||
nt|xenya: the only consolation for EW is that 2@S rates to go down as well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just a guess   vP hoped for a different response from Verhees :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes and they still got to 4H. some people never learn:)|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: systemically  1N is forcing unless opener 5M332|pg||

nt|ahollan1: very nice defense|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: push! hewww!|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: so to speak, 5@d is superior contruct !!|pg||
nt|petergill: an easy routine 3NT which will make|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: in the other room North was first to bid @S :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Murniati did not open 3rd seat|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s8|nt|pole_as_ch: try to discard by @s|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: over ruff, @c finness, and another @s ?|pg||

pc|h5|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: declarer played trump  [wrong]    danailov didn't play trump  [wrong]|pg||

nt|ahollan1: final contract  2@D East|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|hA|nt|xenya: not a picnic either -- but perhaps can be made|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: 2@D will be interesting race to watch after trump lead|pg||
pc|d9|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d7|pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: nice recovery   to lose only 1 imp|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  push|pg||
nt|fabsayc: plus danialov would have left declarer no good line if he ducked|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so this was the worst defense|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh ! @c finess for all, but good it is, and...|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|petergill: Newell and Reid were the top NZ pair in the datums when NZ nearly made the top 8 in last year's Bermuda Bowl. Ditto Hans - Nunn for Australia in last year's BB|pg||

nt|ahollan1: NS do NOT play Namyats, so 4@H wide range|pg||
nt|petergill: The defence to beat 4@S is fairly easy to find|pg||
nt|petergill: but it seems normal for S to bid 5@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=10-15 hcp, 5+@H & 4+@D|pg||
nt|kemperg: ty|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 5C by S is best but 3N obviously maes as cards lie|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: Verhees still has a chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: yes six was a total mystery in open room also|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so we're skeptical about overtricks on 22 & 24|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H = max of 15 HCP|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S wishing he had more room, is coming straight off a hand where lack of space kept his side out of 5m as only making games|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Danailov might be playing Precision here|pg||
nt|petergill: The suitable vulnerability, position (dealer) and suit texture are the reasons for Martin Reid's expert 4@H opening|pg||
nt|petergill: which has vaulted the World Champions overboard|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=relay   game force or INV in @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL includes strong NT   so not necessarily traditional shape|pg||
mb|5C|nt|ahollan1: 3N = 55 with 1@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but what a singleton|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that is result of playing artificial 1N Overcalls  [Raptor]|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: 4@h can make for EW ???|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems contradictory to use @SK to have points to open then show singleton @S|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Eddie Manfield wouldn't approve    "thinking of bidding 5 over 5?  DON'T   the 5 level belongs to the opponents"   was a BOLS Bridge Tip from Ed|pg||
nt|xenya: very true|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 24  2@D made  5 imps to Indonesia|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Gold opened the North hand|pg||
nt|kemperg: and more to come on this hand:(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS has found a @S fit - just a question of how high the bidding goes|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: i'm told both Bulgarian Pairs are playing Precision|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the threatening defense was a heart lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's consistent with what i found for 2009 Bermuda Bowl|pg||
nt|fabsayc: should put in the 10 for extra dummy entry|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: no, @d ruff i lost. sry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course   sometimes the opponents bid 6 over 5 :)|pg||
nt|petergill: I don't like 6@h much. The assumption that partner has very short spades can be faulty, as on the actual hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and the Kings are defensive, not offensive|pg||
nt|petergill: Also, the partner of a fav vul prempter has to take into account that the fav vul prempt might make bidding a lot later very risky|pg||
nt|petergill: @DQ lead would be good for NS|pg||
pc|h2|nt|eamongall: but now declarer can manage 11 tricks |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Dawei's hummar would strick the 7 ??|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 6@H snatching defeat from the jaws of victory|pg||
nt|kemperg: who is to blame:(|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: Verhees could not overcall 1N   that would show  4@S and 5+@C/@D|pg||

nt|Walddk4: By the way, we already have "rag" among bridge slang. Unimportant card. "My spade holding was the king and four rags"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he has to play a diamond eventually, so this does not justify thinking very long|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but how many  UMJOODOs?    Rod tells where that name came from  but i'd like to thank whoever decided to popularize Reverse Flannery|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: we've had it all this match esp boards 1 & 2|pg||

nt|brgpro: 7@dXX...hmmm|pg||
nt|marlowepi: NS were on their way to +100 there. double dummy S can pass of course for 200, but the danger in that course was not lost on S. still, partner is extremely unlikely not to have 3 ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: defensive tricks and the hearts are woeful, so there is certainly a case for pass. at MPs it would be clear to do so|pg||
nt|kemperg: On 9 also in 6@C|pg||
nt|kemperg: in OR|pg||
nt|gizzydrop: i think pass in down the middle of the fairway|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: 11-13 bal or any 17+|pg||

nt|marlowepi: side fairly small. meanwhile they might not make game for a variety of reasons.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|pole_as_ch: No game for NS|pg||
nt|petergill: these two teams were =4th, though obviously that is no longer the case|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the closed room, Gold showed 25+ balanced with his 2NT rebid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this bidding should help them get to slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: why?   3N - all pass very possible|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW have done great job taking away bidding space|pg||
nt|petergill: EW have pinpointed likely short spades in South, from North's point of view|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=INV, 6+@S|pg||

mb|d|nt|pole_as_ch: what side gain + score ?|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@C by South, and I think North, either slowly or quickly, will go all the way to 6@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lucky not to get 4@DI would say|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=good 11-14|pg||
nt|xenya: i might pass as S -- but Tueje has no fear|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'd expect pretty much this distribution of hcp  so PASS figures to lose a couple of imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=4518  Tom Hanlon, also a world class poker player|pg||

nt|ahollan1: ahhh  a picture of Hanlon|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@S is about as ugly a bid as imaginable, i treat 2@C as a cue bid on that auction|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: it looks like push.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh buyed 3@D, and....|pg||
nt|petergill: cf Bd 19 where at fav vul sometimes they break 4-4|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Great point by Martin, assuming EW spades 5-4 not 4-4|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: Lead of @s2 is showing 3 card, maybe. |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Ito should call this, he surely|pg||
nt|brgpro: E will pull this|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: i wager 2@H would get some votes in Master Solvers' Club|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: board upside-down|pg||
nt|gizzydrop: this looks like final contract, nowhere for north to go and some defence to 4@S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: these are very instructive hands for us, because all these ill-starred decisions could easily be triumphs on a different day|pg||
nt|gizzydrop: looks like a trump lead would have been best|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk2: He'll raise|pg||
nt|petergill: I expect and hope for 6@C now|pg||
nt|kemperg: not the first 26  pts hand in this tournament:|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Reid's problem is that Newell could be 1444 with no @CQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but does that hand rebid 5@C over 4@S?|pg||
nt|petergill: It's not so obvious to NS that the match has turned out badly so far - e.g. their 2@H making five (Bd 23?) might be a pickup from their point of view|pg||
nt|fabsayc: even then he has diamond hook, also 7 not impossible|pg||
pc|dA|nt|pole_as_ch: UG. ducking ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N should be delighted to pass. not simply endplayed into it|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H by South|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlucky choice of leads|pg||
pc|c2|nt|cc469: a dearth of entries to dummy|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: so  my guess of 3N-all pass was just a little off|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe that hand would bid 4NT, Al, choice of games|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very well done Martin Reid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right  so Newell 5@C does sound like 5+ suit|pg||
nt|petergill: also well done to Sartaj Hans not to bid 2@S at other table which might lead NS to 6@C|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks to everyone in Yokohama in Japan for today's broadcast. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: tomorrow  final 4 rounds of 14-board matches in the Qualifying Swiss.|pg||

nt|brgpro: that is a good call...4NT...he will get 2 KC answer...what would the KC be?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|nt|marlowepi: trump lead comes best from S hand, i think|pg||
pc|sK|nt|brgpro: what about 5@c on 3NT Al?|pg||
nt|brgpro: after he has shown 6+@s and preference for @d, that must be exclusion for @d|pg||
nt|ahollan1: have to confess   this is first time i've seen the auction where 2@H bidder had game force hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so i'm not sure about the rest of the bids|pg||
nt|brgpro: he will get the right answer but, then if pd has 2+@h and no @h control, he will also be in trouble|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but  Exclusion Keycard  .... very dangerous when partner has shown the suit|pg||
nt|brgpro: so 4@d was OK as long as he gets a @h cue and , he wasn't looking for a perfection 7 anyway, after all, his pd opened a limited 1@d|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: don't run away our last board is  30   [started with  17]|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 4 to play|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes in the open room on the 6C hand S had cuebid 4H, so N probably expected  abetter hand. still, there was no spade cuebid there either....maybe some hidden meaning, though, ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: because N tried for a grand in that room|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: that claim is wrong too :(|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: 1@c ???|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 1@d shows @h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW always strong NT|pg||

mb|2S|nt|petergill: weak 1NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=(11)12-14|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh that's right Peter  thanks|pg||
nt|petergill: sorry, top 8 qualify - I forgot which event this is|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why Mr Yeh? Thought that only applied to the Yeh Bros Cup|pg||
nt|petergill: My mistake|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hehe  you convinced me too |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: HCP?   we don't need no stinking HCP|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 2H! or 3@h, but not 4@h|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: only 2 remains|pg||
nt|brgpro: so 2@d will be NAT|pg||
nt|brgpro: but, that michaels cue bid has to be limited as pd might pass on that|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: point being that Bakhshi didn't pass it out either|pg||
nt|xenya: since you can pass any response by pard|pg||
nt|ahollan1: similarly  (1@C)-2@C natural  (1@C)-2@D michaels     |pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: hanlon got any more bids?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 2@d ???|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: well, X P P 2@s X ?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kiwibridge: 4th double figure swing in 12 boards|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh, No!|pg||
nt|brgpro: N might have, say 3 @h and 8-9 count, he won't know what to do|pg||
nt|ahollan1: meckwell use  (1@D)-2@H as weak michaels  and  (1@D)-3@C as stronger version|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Sure|pg||
nt|Walddk4: if he gets 5@D now he is in slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder how auction progresses if Stamatov just jumps in @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure how EW play DBL over the 2@D transfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: 2@s ???  sry, bad comment|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: and another 6 imp.  29imp is 22-8 vp.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: because 2@H is passable|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Unlucky hand for weak 1NT, this one|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think it was david gold that said weak no trump is a losing proposition at the top level|pg||
nt|ahollan1: common to play DBL of Weak NT - Stayman as Cards [rather than @C]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but is that also done over transfer?    i confess i don't know|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this should be interesting to watch. N might get home |pg||
pc|h3|nt|eamongall: Hanlon is normally extremely strong as a declarer but 4-1 breaks kill most of us |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: good auction to best contruct!|pg||
nt|kemperg: DD or real?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Ok start for defense, good choice despite pass by W over 2H. still, statistically unlikely W would double that across the full range of hands where hearts is the best attack|pg||
nt|kemperg: opps are placed in every trick|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, W spade tricks may never get in to the game|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: just wait a minute...players taking a short rest|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and N may be endplayed by the entry situation into picking up Ds|pg||
nt|marlowepi: though the heart lead will give him an entry there, so he will probably return a heart and then take the diamond finesse into E|pg||
nt|marlowepi: then he will have 8 tricks set up and will just need to guess clubs|pg||
pc|h4|nt|eamongall: anyway tightens up the match |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes Lui played very nicely OR|pg||
nt|brgpro: i play it myself as 8(good 7) to 12|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i should qualify   i think that is their treatment|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|pole_as_ch: comes Chen's Ocaltic call.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Dec can catch 8 tricks easily, but 9th ?|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: why so jumping ???|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Maybe, East Opening is not 2@c, so 6 was enough, Ch3n was thought.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: *Chen|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Now Furuta safely settled 6, or not ????|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: this is 17 imp if he make this|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: and new leader !! or not ??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't think it will convince them to change the system|pg||
nt|petergill: 12 X 14 board matches, this is Round 8 of ther Swiss|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and endplay|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: great auction from EW|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but for sure you should keep track|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or convince Fantunes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or Hans-Nunn|pg||
nt|petergill: this will be quite a big swing, with NS vul and tough discards to be made|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well fantunes weak no trump is not normal, can be any 5422|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and 6322 and 4441|pg||
nt|petergill: Scores after 7 rounds at http://www.jcbl.or.jp/home/English/nec/17th/results/tabid/659/Default.aspx|pg||

pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: right  that's why i asked if there's a default   [if so  i don't know which applies]|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: @dQ shows seq under that.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 2 @h, 1 @s and can make|pg||
nt|xenya: you need to play for @DK doubleton|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: i think 3@H asks controls  [A=2 K=1]|pg||
nt|petergill: Both 4@S and 3NT are safe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and 3N = 4  [1@S promised at least 3]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Newell knows an Ace  or 2 kings missing    does that help him bid over 3N?|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: The call of 3@c is very good hint for Dec. so Chen might ....|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: -10 or -11 imp is not hevy lost for Tajima, but Chen should make this for his stand !!|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: but dummy entry remains ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  29  4@S+1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so pickup for Weak NT|pg||
nt|xenya: right|pg||
nt|kemperg: 11-19 now|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Walddk4: flat board, 11 IMPs = 18-12 VPs, but we are not quite sure that it's scored correctly throughout|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's current Victory Point result|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kiwibridge: and so a modest victory to the Hackett team|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ahollan1: scores from other matches show up under  http://www.jcbl.or.jp/home/English/nec/17th/results/7thFeb/tabid/665/Default.aspx|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: 4@D forces 4@H to signoff   [EndSignal]|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he needs heart queen for slam (ie 12 points)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: and AKK rather than AA|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|petergill: so S knew N had either Axxx, xxxx, xx, Axxx or Kxxx, xxxx, Kx, Axx or AKxx, xxxx, Kx, xxx with Q's and J's unknown|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: and 26imp will be 21-9 vp for Senior Champion !!|pg||
