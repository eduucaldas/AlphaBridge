nt|lorderic: especially white vs red|pg||
nt|lorderic: at the other table, NS had a wierd auction started from strong 2@C opening|pg||
mb|3S|an|7+ solid suit, w/o side A/K|mb|d|nt|lorderic: I think 3@S here shows any solid 7 card suit |pg||
nt|bypeng:  Do you think the 5@H bid by south is good in the close, lord?|pg||
nt|lorderic: NS use a modified precision|pg||
nt|lorderic: definitely not|pg||
nt|qking: 3@s art?|pg||
nt|lorderic: that is as terrible as 2@C opening IMO|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|nt|lorderic: 3@S is artificial, showing any solid 7 card suit|pg||

pc|d5|nt|bypeng:  Hello shirley|pg||
nt|lorderic: I would open 4@S, or 4@S with Namyats|pg||

pc|dT|pc|d3|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||

nt|lorderic: this is a collegiate event hold in Taiwan|pg||

nt|lorderic: the finals are three 12-board matches|pg||
mb|4S|mb|d|nt|lorderic: BTU-Jecization, which is the first seed in round robin, has 7.5 IMPs carryover|pg||
nt|wkc:  I don't like the 2@C opening|pg||
nt|lorderic: hello Jason|pg||
nt|wkc:  hi Eric|pg||
nt|lorderic: if this 2@C shows a "strong hand" then it's not my choice|pg||
nt|lorderic: I prefer 4@S, or 4@D if you play Namyats|pg||
nt|vugraphzyk: south think a lot of time|pg||
nt|vugraphzyk: it's hard for her to imagine that 4S was doubled|pg||
nt|wkc:  we all now she need some time :)|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|wkc:  the declarer will a @C loser and one @D loser, so looks like a 4@S over 1|pg||
nt|lorderic: it's hard to imagine that 4@S was doubled since S has a tons of high card|pg||
nt|lorderic: 5@H is not my choice anyway. it's obvious that N have long @S|pg||
nt|wkc:  now things getting more confused, how could somebody double our 20+13 = 33 contract?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|wkc:  now the score of two team is actually 39.5 against 34|pg||
nt|wkc:  so 96 needs 6 or more IMPs to win this match|pg||
mb|5S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|wkc:  easy 4 top tricks|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
nt|wkc:  the @CK means the declarer is searching for cross ruff like play, that's why W return the trump right away|pg||
nt|wkc:  but still, nothing could stop him|pg||
nt|wkc:  so 5@SX-2|pg||

nt|lorderic: Jecization takes the first blood and is now 19.5 IMPs ahead|pg||

nt|wkc:  3@H from W?|pg||
mb|p|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||

nt|wkc:  sometimes bridge is like this, you give the opps pressure and hope they'll do something wrong|pg||
nt|lorderic: i agree with you Jason|pg||
nt|lorderic: 3@H should be stone cold here|pg||

nt|lorderic: W tries to maximize her chance by playing @H 2-2 first|pg||
nt|wkc:  and now she's trying for dropping N's @CAQ or AJ|pg||
nt|wkc:  however, if she knows that N has 5-5 in both @S and @D|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|wkc:  S will be marked with the @CA(otherwise, why N didn't use michaels)|pg||

nt|vugraphzyk: that SQ may worth 10 imps, make or -3|pg||
mb|p|nt|wkc:  we'll have a two-half, 12 boards per half match in the quarterfinal|pg||
nt|vugraphzyk: 2-way|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|nt|wkc:  3NT is too agressive for me...|pg||

mb|4H|nt|lorderic: thanks Stanley|pg||
nt|wkc:  I don't know what's the meaning of 3@S|pg||
nt|wkc:  so it's a common difficulty when play green card: the jump in other suit use to many spaces|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzyk: south is thinking|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzyk: i think bidding 2H is bold|pg||

nt|vugraphzyk: north choose to pass|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
nt|wkc:  3NT is not even a chance if W is clear enough to duck two round of @D|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lorderic: the only hope for declarer is probably W holds @DAx|pg||
nt|lorderic: even that only 8 tricks for declarer|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|wkc:  a normal 3@S|pg||
nt|shuan: not an easy contract for EW|pg||

pc|h4|nt|lorderic: sorry, I mean W cannot make 1NT at the other table on board  14|pg||
nt|lorderic: here NS make another aggressive bidding to 3NT|pg||
nt|wkc:  6@H+1@S+1@C, so the declarer doesn't have his 9th tricks before the defender sets up their @C|pg||
nt|lorderic: I suspect what 2@D shows here?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyk: 2D is 16+ or long H|pg||
nt|lorderic: for E the most likely lead is a @D|pg||

pc|h5|nt|wkc:  nicely done!|pg||

nt|wkc:  so what I would do is cash the top @S in hand instead of @SA|pg||
nt|wkc:  the EW reaches an unplayable 3NT on board 3 in the other room, so another 3 IMPs to Jecization|pg||
mb|5H|nt|wkc:  2NT is short in @S|pg||
nt|wkc:  if not 22, then draw the third round, cash @HJ, throw away the @D, and try the @C finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|wkc:  and still down one|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|wkc:  3@C is control in @C|pg||
nt|vugraphzyk: Sun may think about shooting|pg||
nt|vugraphzyk: for only 6 hand left |pg||
mb|p|nt|wkc:  the double suggest penalty rather than t/o, so S is better to pass|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|wkc:  3@S shows min|pg||
nt|wkc:  this will be another gain for the Jecization|pg||
pc|sA|nt|wkc:  NS wins 11 from their 3NT in board 17|pg||

pc|d2|pg||

nt|vugraphzyk: west ask 3c and think a while|pg||

nt|wkc:  some people would lead a @H, and I'm one of them|pg||
pc|h2|nt|wkc:  the reason is that you know the @S split is not friendly for the declarer, so you want to shorten his trump length|pg||

pc|h9|nt|wkc:  2@H and 1@C and most 2@S loser, so the contract looks safe to me|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d9|nt|wkc:  4@C control in @C|pg||
nt|wkc:  and I would bid 4NT(control in @S) if they play kickback (using 4@S for Key card asking)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|wkc:  and 4@H is interesting when you know somebody would like to give you a red card|pg||

pc|dK|nt|vugraphzyk: 3D is a solid deal, if north play diamond right, it will over one|pg||
pc|c2|nt|wkc:  but looks they don't play kickback, so 4NT RKCB, 5@S shows 2 w/ @HQ|pg||
pc|cT|nt|wkc:  thinking about 7?|pg||
nt|wkc:  but maybe only one off?|pg||
nt|lorderic: not surprisingly, 9 IMPs to BTU-96 on board 20 and they are 15.5 ahead|pg||

nt|wkc:  then you'll probably see that table has Qxx instead of Jxx|pg||
pc|h7|nt|wkc:  6@H: great, so let's play 6@H....|pg||
nt|wkc:  I think he want to see 6@C|pg||
nt|wkc:  ,which shows @CK|pg||
nt|wkc:  and then he could bid 6@D to ask if pn has @DK|pg||
nt|wkc:  i.e. he is trying to figure out if S have xx Qxxx AKxx  AKx|pg||
nt|wkc:  but even so, S could have 3 card @S, and then it won't be a good Grand Slam|pg||
nt|wkc:  so I would probably bid 6@H after 5@S|pg||
pc|h6|nt|wkc:  and pn is looking at you, saying"what r u doing" in his mind|pg||

nt|wkc:  wow|pg||
mb|1S|nt|wkc:  looks like the three days event exhausts the player|pg||
mb|2C|nt|wkc:  maybe it's right for their current situation :P|pg||
mb|2S|nt|wkc:  in other table, S open 1@D and EW reaches 2@S for one off |pg||
mb|d|nt|lorderic: here comes an unpredictable one. NS is open room reached 5@Dx and made|pg||
nt|lorderic: should be a good score to Cold Light|pg||
nt|wkc:  the second double shows "pn, I have hearts"|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzyk: that 3C shows 5-5 minor suit|pg||
nt|lorderic: i suppose in their agreement 3@C is not a game-forcing jump shift|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lorderic: thanks Stanley|pg||
mb|p|nt|wkc:  X is negative, shows 44 in Majors, and 3@H is an invitation|pg||
mb|4C|nt|wkc:  5@C?|pg||
mb|p|nt|wkc:  we'll probably see 5@DX again|pg||
nt|lorderic: indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|wkc:  and N goes to game even he has @CQJ and short in his pn's suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|wkc:  I would be more happy to bid 4@H if I have QJ in @D and short in @C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2d by north was a better bid|pg||
nt|wkc:  and maybe 5@DX= again|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lorderic: if E pass "forcing", EW might get to 5@S|pg||
nt|wkc:  double shows a good @C support (I suppose)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|wkc:  last two boards here|pg||
nt|lorderic: 5@S only -1 is a great safe|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphzyk: south suggests his partner not to bid 4h with this kind of hand next time|pg||
nt|wkc:  a safe with 24 points|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|wkc:  and I expect a quick claim here|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|nt|lorderic: actually -2 on a @H lead, but still a good save|pg||
pc|c2|nt|wkc:  nice suggestion!|pg||
nt|wkc:  W is surely not satisfied with the only one off in the last board|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|wkc:  and so with W hands, I probably would bid 2NT to show my @S stopper|pg||

mb|d|nt|lorderic: what do you think about it by?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lorderic: NS can make 6C/S on this board|pg||
nt|lorderic: but it's hard to get there after such preempt bids|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lorderic: and they decide to settle in 4@S|pg||
nt|bypeng:  4 teams in BTU grab the semi-finals...... I think it's a political problem in Taiwan education. No need to discuss here though|pg||
mb|5H|nt|bypeng:  NS have a choice again.|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lorderic: and they stop again|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lorderic: it's always better to preempt to the highest level you can afford|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h8|pc|hA|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||
mc|12|nt|lorderic: for E hand I would bid 5@H in my first call|pg||
pg||
qx|c12|st||md|2SKQJT6HA4DKJT2C73,S74HKQT953D76CQ94,SA985HDQ98CAKJ862,S32HJ8762DA543CT5|sv|n|nt|wkc:  I think @SA is a no-lose play|pg||
nt|wkc:  but looks like E don't think so|pg||
nt|lorderic: Last board for the semi-final|pg||
nt|lorderic: Cold Light took 6 on board  22 and they need 10 in this board|pg||
nt|lorderic: which seems quite impossible to me|pg||
nt|wkc:  Here comes the last board for the first segment|pg||
nt|wkc:  and Jecization is still perfect now|pg||
mb|2H|mb|d|nt|wkc:  anyway, we're in the last board of first half|pg||
mb|5H|nt|wkc:  yep|pg||
nt|wkc:  however, this hand may stop their perfect record while NS have a cold @S slam and the other room miss it|pg||
nt|wkc:  5@H is a good bid, if you always want to bid 5@H when S comes with 4@S, why not bid now|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|wkc:  but it would help NS to reach the slam: I would bid 5@S even 6@S with S hand|pg||
nt|wkc:  double looks weird to me when you know you have 9@S and opps have more than 10@H|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|wkc:  here comes the aggressive bidding by E|pg||
nt|lorderic: the final schedules at 10:30 CST, which should be 8 minutes later|pg||
nt|lorderic: It might start late due to the delay|pg||
nt|lorderic: we hope to see you guys back in about 15 minutes|pg||
mb|p|nt|wkc:  another aggressive preempt|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: final will be three 12-board matches|pg||
nt|wkc:  I mean, double would only collect few hundred when you might have a cold 5@S even 6@S|pg||
pc|dA|nt|fabsayc: presumbaly 2@H invite because of range of jump response of 2@H over 1@D|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|wkc:  that's it, the declarer could afford 5 off :P|pg||
nt|lorderic: NS reaches 4@S here, either they make it or not BTU-96 is advanced for sure|pg||
nt|wkc:  now the contract depends on not only the @C split but also @CQ|pg||
pc|d5|nt|eieio: It's a well-played set by both teams|pg||
nt|eieio: They are all college students|pg||
nt|lorderic: I agree. NS play solid (and aggressively) on this table|pg||
pc|dT|nt|wkc:  N knows S don't have much point because he didn't overcall after 1N|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|cK|nt|wkc:  and W is in trouble now|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|eieio: They probably have solid partnership|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|pc|c7|pc|c9|pg||
nt|lorderic: games in bd 17 and  20 decides this match|pg||
nt|eieio: @CQ is falling onside, so the contract should be probably makeing 5|pg||
nt|eieio: South can sure simply draw trump and claim 4|pg||
nt|eieio:  17 East failed to complete his M-U-D carding|pg||
mc|11|nt|wkc:  another 13 to jecization; 96 would be glad there is still 24 boards to go|pg||
nt|wkc:  anyway thank you all for join the party, I'll see you after one-hour break :)|pg||
