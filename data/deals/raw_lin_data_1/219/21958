mb|p|nt|oosmanb:  Hi everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: Douglas Piper and Alex Wilkinson for Scotland; Peter Crouch and Derek Patterson for England|pg||
nt|nilsland:  welcome to the second last match|pg||
nt|nilsland:  a lot to do in 3 NT - this will be a raise between decl 9 and def 5 tricks|pg||
pc|c6|nt|nilsland:  the defense being favorites in my op|pg||
pc|cK|nt|oosmanb:  2@D was multi. 4@C was : Bid one UNDER your major, and then South can declare it|pg||
nt|oosmanb:  Playing 4@C this way, (and 4@D = bid your major) allows responder to protect his holdings|pg||

nt|VUGRAPHZVH: 3 nt oluyor|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vugraphzvu: yes, 4@c would show a stronger hand with @h|pg||
pc|c2|nt|eamongall: and Peter Goodman a regular visitor to Dublin (maybe he lives here) ...but afraid I don't know Pownall in person |pg||
pc|c8|nt|vugraphzvu: could have been 3 apparently|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: according to the system file 3+ @H or 5+H if GF|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c7|nt|eamongall: McDonagh  has represented Ireland in the recent past at Senior level with Pat McDevitt ... I think Heneghan is making his debut here for Ireland |pg||
nt|gsper:  I am a bit surprised about the opening. I thought EW played strong @C|pg||
pc|cA|nt|clinch: Some guesses in the red suits here - first was wrong|pg||

pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|s4|nt|clinch: A club from Wilkison would have been interesting, but didn't happen|pg||
nt|clinch: n|pg||
nt|clinch: Patterson now can't afford to lose two heart tricks; he will probably exit with a diamond and Piper will be somewhat stuck for an exit card|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|eamongall: he will make this contract but he may not see 9 tricks just yet |pg||
pc|c9|pc|h6|pc|h3|pg||

mb|p|nt|barbyh: hi all|pg||
nt|gsper:  Welcome|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: of course we can all see @S finesses and endplays with @C but this is teams and over a 32 board match an imp here or there is less crucial then going down in a game |pg||
nt|barbyh: hi gsper|pg||
mb|1D|nt|clinch: Part-score hand now; EW make 3@s; NS 4@d|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzvu: Robson..head in hands now...what to lead|pg||
nt|clinch: so 4@s is actually a good save against 4@d|pg||

nt|yo_yo: Now is 3NT a slam try?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|yo_yo: IF so, Wrang is interested|pg||
nt|gsper:  On 3 rounds of @C W can discard a @H and onother on @D|pg||
nt|nilsland:  3 rounds of clubs will give the defense an extra trump trick but the heart loser will go away|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|nilsland:  :)|pg||
nt|barbyh: if he tries a tr promotion the heart loser goes away|pg||
pc|c9|nt|eamongall: but with @Ds as NS resting place they probably have saved Wales from a tonk|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|nt|clinch: Must resist the temptation to play K@d here|pg||
nt|clinch: Patterson's 2of @h probably encouraging, but length still ambiguous|pg||

nt|ady: not well judged by South   4@H  well down  4@S should fail by one|pg||
nt|ady: thx Aramesh|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: think W will end up endplayed at trick 5|pg||
nt|ady: however   the wrong way up|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  as it is, wrong sided|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @sK|pg||
nt|gsper:  Kind of sudden. And mysterious in view of the earlier bids|pg||
pc|s3|nt|nilsland:  A good bidding and a sensible contract|pg||
pc|s2|nt|dkkello:  :)  yes , and I leave you now Mats , preperations for the game! Go Denmark and good luck here!|pg||
nt|dkkello:  see you .. |pg||
nt|nilsland:  good lukc denmark|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|eamongall: unfortunately for heneghan this 5 level is a phantom |pg||
nt|clinch: So strong club or not, NS end up playing in 1NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: unless he can find the 8 of diamonds now?|pg||
nt|frankaus: using strong @C u can open with that collection|pg||
nt|sverjohn: 3 spades probably shows normal opening values with 4s as a raise to 2s often will show 3|pg||
nt|nilsland:  I am not sure I agree with Easts pass here and if Upmark has not showed his support for clubs I dont like 4 @S|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|pc|sK|pc|s8|pg||
pc|s5|nt|clinch: Best continuation|pg||
nt|clinch: Not room for much more in East's hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: hes still going to get enplayed repeatedly though isnt he, Crouch can just exit diamonds |pg||
pc|sT|nt|timb: Interesting 4@S bid|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer holds up one round in the faint hope of a 7-2 spade split|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s9|pg||
nt|timb: I would defend 4@H|pg||
pc|h2|nt|emre kaya: ben 3 pik demeyi tercih ederdim koray abinin eliyle|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Upmark probably worries over lack of Aces|pg||
nt|gsper:  Will this even make now?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hJ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|ady: Allfrey 2@S normally shows a liking for hearts but not for spades   when in fact his spades were better than his hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: South offering a prayer for his miracle spade lie|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3NT might fail even from the South seat|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|nt|nilsland:  2 NT as invitational is strong with 13 pts but openings nowadays is 11+ and S has 4333 and poor spades|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|pg||
nt|ady: however   shoud Denning find the bright lead of K  or J of spades  the defence would prevail|pg||
nt|nilsland:  no|pg||
pc|c6|nt|yorkbeach:  yes a low spade would block the suit|pg||
nt|gsper:  He would have been in better shape if he had ducked the first trick|pg||
nt|gsper:  But I don't think I would have|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
nt|eamongall: ah now it becomes clear ... a kib mentioned 6@Ds on board 1 .... making in Open Room off the 2 cashing @HS |pg||
nt|clinch: Seems strange that hearts were discarded|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi all:)|pg||
nt|gsper:  Wlc Marshall|pg||
nt|nilsland:  He made the mistake of thinking that they have missed a slam and didnt worry abaout his contract|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h8|pc|d2|pc|c7|pg||
pc|hA|nt|marlowepi: well, if spades are coming in there is no need to score the heart queen. tough to duck at MPs but at IMPs maybe not  despite the temptation|pg||
nt|gsper:  If you are playing on 4 in this gruelling event you have to save your strength|pg||
nt|gsper:  But this was the wrong moment|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d3|pc|h3|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Easy 10 tricks when the spade J shows up|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|vugraphzvu: think ive got all the cards right so far, but might have missed something|pg||

mb|2S|nt|eamongall: sorry I was looking at the wrong hand when talking of 6@Ds ... am corrected ..it just needed several finesses :) |pg||
nt|ady: Robson did not want to go quietly|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  when two strong club pairs play each other, much can depend upon which pair has the good cards|pg||
mb|3H|mb|3S|nt|yorkbeach:  1@h = 4+@s|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S   around the limit or 5@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|eamongall: probably not the best board to hunt down 2@Hs on ..and South has moved on |pg||
nt|eamongall: should be able to make plenty of tricks in 4@S or 3N|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: he has now...without too much thought|pg||
nt|clinch: Yes, maybe misled somewhat by heart discards...South could always make by playing on hearts if he reads the club length correctly|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: true, he said after the hand that he should have played A and another club when E played one through|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: a bit messy all round i think|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  (1@s would have shown 4+@h)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Personally I prefer 2 @H to 1 NT with xx in spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|emre kaya: bakalým 4 kör veya 3 nt oynucaklar|pg||

pc|h3|nt|vugraphzvu: should be a flat board|pg||

pc|h7|pg||
nt|ady: 1 spade would not have gone well    but only fifty's|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: lose 3 trump tricks|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  and nothing else|pg||
nt|marlowepi: very good hand for a strong NT, so there is a case for 1C. but there is also a strong case against that call|pg||
nt|nilsland:  If Souths spades were K10x the contract would only make from Souths hand|pg||
nt|nilsland:  perhaps...|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|nt|ady: yes   120|pg||
nt|clinch: Aggressive raise by Patterson if Crouch showed 18-20|pg||

nt|vugraphzvu: well|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  at the other table South led a trump and bang went the ruffs|pg||
nt|ady: croush opening?|pg||
nt|ady: crouch|pg||
nt|nilsland:  We all can symphatize with Upmark I think. You think you have missed a slam and you go down in 4 by  misplaying it....|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|ady: 5@C   fpr e/w    more if no heart lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  sorry to keep going on about it - but you have to beat right when you lead a trump - otherwise it is a mistake|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|ady: 2@C forcing  alerted|pg||
nt|clinch: That one also looks quite normal, although most of us would have started with 2NT, followed by a bit of something Staymanic|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  be right|pg||
mb|p|nt|emre kaya: 4 pike gelecekler|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Some danger for EW here|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|ady: tht Allfrey might have shown diamonds at this point|pg||
nt|clinch: This 2@h bid was seen also last hand|pg||
nt|clinch: This time finds a major suit fit|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: its exciting to see something other than stayman and transfers|pg||
nt|ady: may reach 4@S     though an easy 11 tricks in hearts|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  play for 6@s|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if you avoid a @h loser, just the @cA to lose|pg||
nt|frankaus: looks like the italian intermediate 2@S|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|ady: bidding is pointing towards a heart lead   so better stop in game|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: I think 1C was conventional|pg||
nt|ady: ok   so 1@C had not promised clubs|pg||
nt|timb: The splinter should slow things down!|pg||
nt|timb: 1@C usually balanced or clubs|pg||
nt|timb: I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: good choice by Peter Goodman to remain quiet as Heneghan surely would have got noisy over @Hs |pg||
nt|eamongall: 4@S EW seems possible |pg||
nt|nilsland:  trump lead is ordered|pg||
mb|4S|nt|emre kaya: çok az konuþtular bence:)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  2 Nt is natural - problably invitational|pg||
nt|nilsland:  will go down on a heart guess - i presume|pg||
mb|p|nt|emre kaya: ikiside|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  does 2Nt ask what the suits are?|pg||
nt|ady: need spades 3-2 |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  no - shows @d|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe down on a D shift instead|pg||
mb|p|nt|timb: I'm told it can be a singleton too - as in two obsolete systems I can think of, Vienna and NSW |pg||
nt|ady: danger here|pg||
nt|timb: I agree|pg||
nt|ady: unless 4NT not rkc?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: dont think delberto will take too long with this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzvu: with the K@S lead|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North is about to find out that South's second suit is spades|pg||
pc|d6|nt|yorkbeach:  and this sequence has protected the @dAQ|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North is sure to look for a slam once he finds out South's second suit is spades rather than clubs|pg||
nt|frankaus: friendly layout here 4 declarer|pg||
pc|dA|nt|clinch: :)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  On the other hand - Upmark wants revenge|pg||
pc|d5|nt|yorkbeach:  maybe I should have said 'if' rather than 'once' :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: not clear if 3@s is systemically 3+@s or exactly 3...|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if North uses RKCB with @h inferentially agreed, the response will reveal 2 key cards missing|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: I *think* 3@s has shown exactly 3@s as N bid 2N, not 2@s|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|ady: must assume 4NT in this sequence not rkc|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: 4N was asking something...impossible to read the Robson scrawl|pg||
nt|nilsland:  You should save your aces to play over the kings|pg||
pc|s4|nt|yorkbeach:  South may be trying to work out whether 4@s is a cue with @h agreed or an attempt to play there|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sA|nt|yorkbeach:  it seems 4@s was a keycard ask, so 4NT = 1 or 4|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: Crouch did write he *thought* 4@s is RKCB, so we may be in the unknown here|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ady: not suprising with Robson having 2 small of a suit not bid or cu bid|pg||
nt|nilsland:  two down now |pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s6|nt|yorkbeach:  using the bid at the 4 level one denomination above the trump suit is kickback|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: though he has confirmed N should not have 4@s on the bidding|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  so 4@s is the ask with @h agreed, 4@h with @d agreed etc|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  play will be quick here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  on 2 England gained 2 IMPs|pg||

pc|h6|pc|h8|pg||

pc|hT|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|nt|nilsland:  I dont like Wests 2 S |pg||
pc|c8|pc|d7|pg||
nt|nilsland:  discarding a @S gives declarer a hint about spades - but will it help - mayby if he goes for an endplay againt South|pg||
nt|gsper:  Which works, right?|pg||
nt|nilsland:  I still think he will go wrong (which is right with the odds)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if he places D ace with S he could play 3 rounds of hearts|pg||
nt|nilsland:  at the other table East was declarer and a @D lead leads to a faster one down|pg||

mb|p|pc|c2|nt|frankaus: over 2@S|pg||
pc|cA|nt|timb: Yes, 6NT makes on a black suit squeeze|pg||

nt|ady: he needs to make 2 clubs 3 spades 2 hearts and 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|timb: Most likey (eventually) West will endplay dummy with a club and declarer will endplay East with a diamond for a heart return|pg||
nt|timb: Then declarer runs @SJ; he makes 3 spades, 2 hearts, 2 diamonds and 2 clubs|pg||

mb|1N|nt|nilsland:  so the match is even - even if not mÂ´without mistakes :)|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|timb: After @CK held, declarer needed to concede a @D; then he's in on @HQ he plays a @C to the Q and concedes a club. West then has to lead a spade.!|pg||

nt|vugraphzvu: yes, the n/s system file has had plenty of work. you can regualarly find this n/s pair practising partnership bidding on bbo|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East will insist on reaching game of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: Looks as though 4@h will be reached here; 4@s a good save|pg||

pc|dK|pg||
nt|clinch: It looks as though just playing small from either hand would be ok as safety play on prior hand - key is not to bang down the ace!|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Interesting contract|pg||
pc|hK|nt|yorkbeach:  when East bid 3@d, he said 2@h was hearts, with @d a second suit|pg||

nt|vugraphzvu: stiff king with S or something|pg||
pc|c8|nt|vugraphzvu: found the bad news...|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|ady: now east can likely get the 8th in the end game|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  NS defensive signals are usually reverse attitude but can be standard, so the 7 would be discouraging or an even number|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dQ|nt|nurkumkale: þu anda defansta olmak istemezdim atak kötü olmuþ yerde bu kadar çýktý|pg||

nt|vugraphzwf: This was the last board of this round.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|nt|yorkbeach:  Pownall-Goodman did not bid a slam but they did have the mechanism to find their solid 4-4 @s fit :)|pg||
nt|ady: all seems to lead to down 1|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Should be routine for a player of Uppmarks standard, or rather ruffing out the heart ace|pg||

mb|p|nt|emre kaya: dbl uzun bir minör 4 lü major oynuyorlar sanýrým|pg||

mb|p|nt|emre kaya: cavit abi dayanamadý:)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ady: n/s have 4-4 spade fit   with north diamond void   but are short of high cards to make anything much  especially on trump leads|pg||
