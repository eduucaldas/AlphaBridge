pc|c8|pc|c9|pc|cA|pg||

pc|h2|nt|fluffy: the hand will make 11 tricks comfortable, but if you look in isolation the hand you would rather play 6@c than 3NT before the lead since clubs 2-2 mean 6@c makes and @c3-1 put 3NT ...|pg||

pc|d3|pc|dJ|nt|pole_as_ch: if my method, @c is good. so 6@c would be in scope.|pg||

nt|eamongall: McGann stays one level lower and gains 2 imps |pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@D=ART INV  a) 3/4@S  b) NT  c) 3@H/@S & 6@C/@D|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|nt|eamongall: 4@S seems possible sacrifice but vulnerability wrong to attempt it ...|pg||

mb|2S|nt|fabsayc: it would still be percentage, diamond queen at least 2-1 with north after opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: 14-16 NT EW|pg||
nt|fluffy: 4@c I think it's a splinter bid, showing slam invitational values with club shortness|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh ? 1 off in OR !?|pg||
nt|fluffy: Furuta doesn't like to hold a "useless" @cAK|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: No not high, 5@d can make !|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: this bd has some trouble, maybe.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 1 off ?  why ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: didn't NZ lose qualification to KO in last few boards of last RR match??|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: ah, but bad vul for Chen. humm.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: c |pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS do NOT play Namyats, so 4@H wide range|pg||
nt|petergill: The defence to beat 4@S is fairly easy to find|pg||
nt|petergill: but it seems normal for S to bid 5@H|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: Verhees still has a chance|pg||
mb|1S|nt|fabsayc: yes six was a total mystery in open room also|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so we're skeptical about overtricks on 22 & 24|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: Danailov might be playing Precision here|pg||
nt|petergill: The suitable vulnerability, position (dealer) and suit texture are the reasons for Martin Reid's expert 4@H opening|pg||
nt|petergill: which has vaulted the World Champions overboard|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: 4@h can make for EW ???|pg||
mb|p|pc|h9|nt|eamongall: 2@Hs and 1 @C was originally to be lost ..|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: why ?  13 tricks are there !?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|fabsayc: i bet on polish but in this case auctions the same|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: EW stealed the contruct, but can make ??|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: this can reach there.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Eddie Manfield wouldn't approve    "thinking of bidding 5 over 5?  DON'T   the 5 level belongs to the opponents"   was a BOLS Bridge Tip from Ed|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told both Bulgarian Pairs are playing Precision|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the threatening defense was a heart lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's consistent with what i found for 2009 Bermuda Bowl|pg||
nt|fabsayc: should put in the 10 for extra dummy entry|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: no, @d ruff i lost. sry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course   sometimes the opponents bid 6 over 5 :)|pg||
nt|petergill: I don't like 6@h much. The assumption that partner has very short spades can be faulty, as on the actual hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and the Kings are defensive, not offensive|pg||
nt|petergill: Also, the partner of a fav vul prempter has to take into account that the fav vul prempt might make bidding a lot later very risky|pg||
nt|petergill: @DQ lead would be good for NS|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|eamongall: but now declarer can manage 11 tricks |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Dawei's hummar would strick the 7 ??|pg||
nt|petergill: Trump lead looks dangerous - opponents might have hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@H snatching defeat from the jaws of victory|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|petergill: E thus finds the best lead|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d3|nt|pole_as_ch: no! same contruct! reasonable one !|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: humm. 5 tricks. but what is return entry ??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2nd/4th leads in middle of hand|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|c4|pg||
pc|s3|nt|eamongall: 1 imp back to yah Bros |pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|nt|fabsayc: mcgann had to win first diamond, or hanlon duck|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in other room  East overcalled @H  so lead was @HJ|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|d8|nt|petergill: I think North should play @S9 at Trick 1 to make W's card look less like suit pref for clubs|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|nt|Walddk4: Maybe they can still beat it if they stay away from hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in 2nd seat  Hanlon DBL = @H    i wonder if that still applied in 4th seat|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: @c2 ?|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: in OR, West opend 2@h.|pg||
nt|twcho: this weak 2 when red is very weak|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N=16-17|pg||

mb|p|nt|eamongall: ah the 1@C opening is 10-13 ...or 17+|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 3@h ?|pg||
nt|petergill: 1NT can be offshape|pg||
mb|p|pc|cT|nt|fabsayc: probably the fastest growing convention in sense of people switching to it from older meanings|pg||
nt|ahollan1: often credited to Eric Rodwell, but in recent Bridge World Interview he gave credit to someone else|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: close to make or down.|pg||

pc|sK|nt|cc469: I know bridge is changing, but I think you should always have 4 of the other major to make a negative double - that's what E certainly was expecting|pg||
pc|s6|nt|eamongall: wrong again Eamon |pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: i think 2@S = EITHER minor|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Peter  after 3N-DBL  do you play 4@D to mean same thing as without DBL??|pg||
nt|petergill: A trump lead might net 300 off 4@DX |pg||
nt|petergill: Yes I do - but that doesn't mean it's the best way to play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it comes up sooooooo often|pg||
nt|petergill: more likely is only 100 off 4@DX|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 4@C longer minor for the majors perhaps|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Reid's problem is that Newell could be 1444 with no @CQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but does that hand rebid 5@C over 4@S?|pg||
nt|petergill: It's not so obvious to NS that the match has turned out badly so far - e.g. their 2@H making five (Bd 23?) might be a pickup from their point of view|pg||
nt|fabsayc: even then he has diamond hook, also 7 not impossible|pg||

nt|ahollan1: oh that's right Peter  thanks|pg||
nt|petergill: sorry, top 8 qualify - I forgot which event this is|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why Mr Yeh? Thought that only applied to the Yeh Bros Cup|pg||
nt|petergill: My mistake|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hehe  you convinced me too |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: HCP?   we don't need no stinking HCP|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 2H! or 3@h, but not 4@h|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: only 2 remains|pg||

mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: 2@s ???  sry, bad comment|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: and another 6 imp.  29imp is 22-8 vp.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|petergill: Unlucky hand for weak 1NT, this one|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think it was david gold that said weak no trump is a losing proposition at the top level|pg||
pc|s7|nt|eamongall: Hanlon is normally extremely strong as a declarer but 4-1 breaks kill most of us |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: good auction to best contruct!|pg||
pc|s9|nt|eamongall: anyway tightens up the match |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes Lui played very nicely OR|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: comes Chen's Ocaltic call.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Dec can catch 8 tricks easily, but 9th ?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|pole_as_ch: why so jumping ???|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Maybe, East Opening is not 2@c, so 6 was enough, Ch3n was thought.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: *Chen|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Now Furuta safely settled 6, or not ????|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: this is 17 imp if he make this|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: and new leader !! or not ??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't think it will convince them to change the system|pg||
nt|petergill: 12 X 14 board matches, this is Round 8 of ther Swiss|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: great auction from EW|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but for sure you should keep track|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or convince Fantunes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or Hans-Nunn|pg||
nt|petergill: this will be quite a big swing, with NS vul and tough discards to be made|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well fantunes weak no trump is not normal, can be any 5422|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and 6322 and 4441|pg||
nt|petergill: Scores after 7 rounds at http://www.jcbl.or.jp/home/English/nec/17th/results/tabid/659/Default.aspx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a couple of the Japanese Seniors also weak notrumpers|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not any 5422, Martin, not 5-4 in the majors|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Nice auction, McGann making up for his rather tame 1@S (4@S and 5@D)|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d7|pc|d4|nt|eamongall: He sure did ..well done H Liu |pg||
pc|dQ|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: 2 bd include this only remains|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: @d7 shows @dA ?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Defence also have not tricks|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: so the move of Dec and North deside the fate.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|pc|cT|nt|petergill: North hoping @SQ is doubleton |pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|s2|nt|pole_as_ch: 9th will be a little fade.|pg||
nt|petergill: will be disappointed|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the dutch card play and defense is very precise, no tricks given away carelessly|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: do you think he was worth 2@S over 1@H?    is there a default about the difference between 1@S and 2@S there???|pg||

mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: 1@S=FG, 10+ HCP, 3+ CNTRL [A=2, K=1], a) BAL [5@C/@D(332) ok]  b) 1-suit, 5+@H|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: sry, 19-11 vp|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N relay|pg||
mb|4D|an| |nt|ahollan1: right  that's why i asked if there's a default   [if so  i don't know which applies]|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but in this case 4 spades almost guaranteed by double so less need to distinguish length|pg||
nt|eamongall: Yeh .. how come my E and A keep getting mixed up |pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: 4@s can make ??|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 3@d = 4 supp & limit raise |pg||
nt|petergill: Before this match, Downunder had 7 VP gap to 9th so they will possibly drop out of the top 8 overnight|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=(32)44 same rank  [@S&@H or @D&@C]|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: *next|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: can he make  ?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: more difficult than looking dummy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S another forcing noise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D exact shape|pg||
nt|petergill: Relays are not as important on game hands like this one, but are very good for slam hands|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is there as size ask available now al?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: Next round will be 90 minites later |pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: his team mates did him proud OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: I think he will go one down |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: @dQ shows seq under that.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 2 @h, 1 @s and can make|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: i think 3@H asks controls  [A=2 K=1]|pg||
nt|petergill: Both 4@S and 3NT are safe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and 3N = 4  [1@S promised at least 3]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Newell knows an Ace  or 2 kings missing    does that help him bid over 3N?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|pole_as_ch: Come ! and be fun about new team, new heat !|pg||
pc|dK|nt|pole_as_ch: Tajima would be lead after this BD, but how |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 6!  Chen !???|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: if he behave @d no loser, this can make !! |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: The call of 3@c is very good hint for Dec. so Chen might ....|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: -10 or -11 imp is not hevy lost for Tajima, but Chen should make this for his stand !!|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: but dummy entry remains ?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk4: flat board, 11 IMPs = 18-12 VPs, but we are not quite sure that it's scored correctly throughout|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kiwibridge: and so a modest victory to the Hackett team|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: scores from other matches show up under  http://www.jcbl.or.jp/home/English/nec/17th/results/7thFeb/tabid/665/Default.aspx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: must choose results, NEC and then "details"|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: 4@D forces 4@H to signoff   [EndSignal]|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he needs heart queen for slam (ie 12 points)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: and AKK rather than AA|pg||
pc|s9|nt|petergill: so S knew N had either Axxx, xxxx, xx, Axxx or Kxxx, xxxx, Kx, Axx or AKxx, xxxx, Kx, xxx with Q's and J's unknown|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: and 26imp will be 21-9 vp for Senior Champion !!|pg||
