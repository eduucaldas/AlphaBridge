mb|2C|mb|2H|nt|tienchie: A little slow in close room, but not so surprised for Wang and Kuo|pg||
nt|wkc:  however, if I were S in the other room, I would bid 3NT for sure|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|wkc:  3@S by N suggest a GF hand with some @S, so 3NT is a good choice imo|pg||
mb|p|pc|h2|nt|wkc:  N is thinging about bid 3@H, but the doubleton @C and the red vul would stop him|pg||

nt|wkc:  the @SQ from S gives W some options: does she have Qx, QJx, or QJ9, or something special|pg||
mc|8|nt|wkc:  but I was supprised that W rise the K so fast: if S have QJx or QJ9 the best way is duck the K and try to established the @D|pg||

nt|vugraphzyj: Last board for the Quaterfinals.|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|nt|wkc:  with three board to compare, it's still a 34 IMPs difference|pg||
mb|p|nt|wkc:  3NT by S would end the bidding|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|tienchie: A @D inv first|pg||
mb|2S|nt|wkc:  but I think 2@H shows @S...|pg||
nt|vugraphzyj: N thought there's transfer...|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|wkc:  so maybe we'll see a 3-3 4@S in the end|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|wkc:  with S hands, I'll bid 3NT after 2@D|pg||
mb|p|pc|cA|nt|wkc:  but maybe one of his pn often makes aggressive overcall in the balanced seat, so she is afraid of bidding 3NT facing a balanced 2m|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|wkc:  sorry I mean her pn|pg||
nt|tienchie: A little aggressive; if 2@H is @D invite then 2@H is good, but should bid 2N to show the @H stopper|pg||
nt|tienchie: after 2@S|pg||
nt|wkc:  yep, I would bid 2NT as well, but after 2@D|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|wkc:  a slam for NS?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|wkc:  3@S+2@D+1@C and 6 trumps so 6@H is cold|pg||
nt|wkc:  lets see if they could get there|pg||
nt|wkc:  2@C stayman, 2@H shows 4 card|pg||
nt|wkc:  and 3@S shows @H fit ST|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2S|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|wkc:  4@C control in @C|pg||
nt|wkc:  and I would bid 4NT(control in @S) if they play kickback (using 4@S for Key card asking)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s9|nt|vugraphzyk: 3D is a solid deal, if north play diamond right, it will over one|pg||
pc|sK|nt|wkc:  but looks they don't play kickback, so 4NT RKCB, 5@S shows 2 w/ @HQ|pg||
pc|s3|nt|wkc:  thinking about 7?|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|wkc:  5NT: we got all the keycards, any other power|pg||

pc|c8|nt|wkc:  6@H: great, so let's play 6@H....|pg||
nt|wkc:  I think he want to see 6@C|pg||
nt|wkc:  ,which shows @CK|pg||
nt|wkc:  and then he could bid 6@D to ask if pn has @DK|pg||
nt|wkc:  i.e. he is trying to figure out if S have xx Qxxx AKxx  AKx|pg||
nt|wkc:  but even so, S could have 3 card @S, and then it won't be a good Grand Slam|pg||
nt|wkc:  so I would probably bid 6@H after 5@S|pg||
