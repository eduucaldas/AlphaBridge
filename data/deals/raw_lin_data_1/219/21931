nt|ahollan1: NEDUK is trying to defend the title they won in 2011|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|petergill: -2, -3 and -1 all look possible|pg||
nt|petergill: Hard for declarer to place East with the @D honours on this bidding|pg||
nt|petergill: 2NT was both minors|pg||
nt|petergill: The names shown on BBO are remnants from Round 11|pg||
nt|sybarra: think I might rather be in 2 nt here |pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: operater, Right names, Pls !!|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Operater, should show Players sir Name clearly, i think|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: esp for Japanese, home team are here !|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: very honorable|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: on the non @D lead this may make 12|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mrdct: based on what's entered for the open room - we have Thompson-Jacobs EW here|pg||
pc|c2|nt|eamongall: however I am sure it will get fixed when operator gets a break in the play :) ...its very hard to be a vugraph operator |pg||

nt|ahollan1: NEDUK is the defending champion from 2011 NEC|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: any chance to make ???|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: clear trump then @d |pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: charrenging contruct |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|nt|mrdct: Thompson-Jacobs use methods based on the Fantunes system|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mrdct: yes - it looks like the vugraph weren't given the hand data files until right on starting time|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|andyv:  all's well despite the bad @h break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tournament page  http://www.jcbl.or.jp/home/////tabid/657/Default.aspx    includes links to much useful info including Daily Bulletins that include Team Rosters and Conditions of ...|pg||

pc|hK|pc|hJ|pc|h3|nt|pole_as_ch: oh ? can make ??|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we won't have Voice Commentary until the Knockout Phase|pg||
nt|petergill: Ace and a small club might have worked better, with partner having such good @d's and West having poor @D pips|pg||
pc|h4|nt|eamongall: Usually there is one person who goes around the vugraph tables and loads the hands each match ...I have done it ... its a busy time |pg||
pc|s3|nt|kiwibridge: who loads the names :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other tables are visible without login via http://bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mrdct: trumps looks best here|pg||
nt|petergill: If declarer picks @DQ with E, then -1 is possible|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|cT|nt|cc469: good evening? all - I'm Carl Chadwick from Canada|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|pole_as_ch: Operater !!!  Players name!  Right players name !!!  pls !!!|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
mc|12|nt|andyv:  a @s lead would probably have been better as E wouldn't be able to pull all the trump before he knocked out the A of @c|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Do we have Jacobs - Thompson   N-S   Dave?|pg||
nt|eamongall: Every event has new operators and after a few rounds they become experienced and learn stuff |pg||
nt|mrdct: but as it happens a low trump was going to work better as east is forced to rise Q and then doesn't have the tempo to take his trick|pg||

nt|andyv:  that's where they were saturday:)|pg||
nt|mrdct: pages 3&4 for bill & ben|pg||
nt|mrdct: so in the EW methods all one-level openings are frocing for one round|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed,    N-S are    Stamatov - Karianov|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They play Precision|pg||
nt|mrdct: so about 14+hcp|pg||
nt|sybarra: how did we not make 6 @C?|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh I see,  the @D ruff :( unlucky |pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if Yeh partnerships are playing standard or some Precision pairs|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: good start for FT|pg||
nt|sybarra: well not if I had a pard who played it this way,....down in the other room |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: and 1 imp to oz|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: oz/nz |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: all Bulgarian top pairs do|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: funny, why 5?  6 !|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|pole_as_ch: what contract do u think ?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the lower the better|pg||
mb|1N!|an|SD 2 suiter or CH 2 suiter|nt|ahollan1: and NS   akama-maruyama  [not sure who's where]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=game force   a bunch of hand types  in this case  balanced  [no singleton or void]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my dream is that someday  BBO will work on software for operator and there will be functionality to just INSERT PASS  instead of having to do all of those UNDOs|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: EW in OR is team leader of FT.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: They use Blue club oriented system.|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry, 500 was only possible if West ducked @CK (he played ace) - even then it might be 300|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: fufufufu|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: comes some noise|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: some randon 2 suiter?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mrdct: 2@s is 10-13 5+ @s|pg||
nt|mrdct: so east is clear a big max for his bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not 1@C from east|pg||
nt|ahollan1: P-1@C-P-  then  1@H=4+@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ew do NOT play Namyats, so 4@S is wide range|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: specific lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: *clearly|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: NS of this room i know each of them, but pd-ship i don't know|pg||
nt|cc469: 12 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ hcp  [14+ in 1st/2nd]|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: not so random|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: could be in trouble|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@S RELAY  |pg||
nt|mrdct: btw - i'm going to predict bill jacobs is sitting east as ben thompson is a bit more agressive and would probably open 1@s with the east cards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, Bill is always E and N I noticed|pg||
nt|mrdct: believe it or not i've never noticed that|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Normal ? 2/1, i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: i think the 1st two matches are up|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: well passed Martin|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: hewww|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|nt|sybarra: 1 sp means 1 nt |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 1@s is No Majs, maybe.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|pole_as_ch: NS in this room are wife(N) & hus(S)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: operator won't be able to lead   so then auction should get fixed|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C balanced  8-11 or 15+ hcp|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/home////tabid/223/Default.aspx  for tournament website. No results yet I'm afraid. They only update the page once a day if memory serves|pg||
nt|mrdct: poor result for Oz in the open room|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: sry, i have no detail about Chaina Geely Auto members|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=ART, a) 9-12 HCP, 2+ controls, BAL [include 5@C/@D(332)  b) 6-9 HCP, 1-suit 5+@H [bad suit else opening bid]|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mrdct: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/home/English/nec/17th/results/7thFeb/tabid/665/Default.aspx|pg||
nt|Walddk2: thx|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sybarra: or a transfer bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N relay    2@C = a) (332)5@C/@D  b) 3334@H/@S  c) (32)44 same color|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 5 quick trick|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: @d switch will get down easily, humm|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N broke out of relay so East guaranteed declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vP's 1@S [RHO's suit]  showing the 2 unbid suits|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D asks   and now Reid will show exact shape|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no ambition other than finding the correct game|pg||
pc|s4|nt|pole_as_ch: They (NS) prefer schenken|pg||
nt|sybarra: hopefully we will get the names of players sorted out shortly |pg||
pc|s9|nt|eamongall: yes first two rounds are up ... and 3rd round was only finished ... |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: if someone teach me |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: S in 2@C OR|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: 3@D = 4/5@D  not 4@H/@S|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Andy was referring to the Dutch Premiere League final that was on BBO last weekend|pg||
nt|andyv:  declarer starts with 8 tricks and has 2 4-3 suits to find the 9th, or the @d suit.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no carryover from Swiss Qualifying   only 2 of the Quarter-Final matchups did battle in the Swiss   ours is not one of them|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: y|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mrdct: the problem in the open rooms is with only one @s stopper you need cashing tricks on top which just weren't there|pg||
nt|sybarra: 9, or 10 tricks |pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: EW team won by 1 imp after trailing by a bunch after 4 round|pg||
nt|sybarra: or 11 |pg||
pc|s5|nt|andyv:  yes, they certainly made a quick turnaround to get to this tourney|pg||
nt|kemperg: leader may play for 3@D at siide of 3!@Hs, that wont work|pg||
nt|kemperg: down now, cant finesse twice anymore|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it's not unreasonable to play 1@S as natural even though RHO has shown 4+  since 1N by passed hand is available to show the 2 unbid|pg||
nt|vugraphzws: Sorry for wrong bits.|pg||
nt|sybarra: tese are left over from last match |pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 17  5@DX East|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: only 200 this may be worse|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mrdct: needs to make this to hold the damage to 5 imps - otherwise it's 8 imps out|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm pretty sure  W=Verhees  E=vProoijen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room also in 3N   this hand will be more successful than  1|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: they did that last year too|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: looks like push ?|pg||

nt|petergill: 14+ points, natural, forcing|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@S natural, 0+ points|pg||
nt|petergill: 1NT now is about 15-17, he might call 2@D or 1NT|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: @cA|pg||
nt|sybarra: not the bid E wanted to hear |pg||
nt|ahollan1: East could have used Raptor 1N overcall to show 4@H/@S & 5+@C  but unfavorable vul and passed partner   =  yuk|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i know in Ron Klinger's version of transfers over 1@C   his 1@S=4+@D and has 4-card major ONLY IF game force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but not all pairs use 1@S to guarantee @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  this was 3rd seat opener   so  16+|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh, yes, "Color"|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: England ladiesgain big lead in first 2 BD. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: in other room  Precision 1@C - Sartaj Hans did NOT bid with East   so  1@D[neg]-1N end|pg||
nt|sybarra: 1 shouod be no problem |pg||
nt|sybarra: *1nt should not be a problem |pg||
nt|ahollan1: transportation a problem|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: same contract !|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Walddk2: 1@C  14+ with clubs or 15+ balanced|pg||

nt|mrdct: losing 2@h and a @d here at least|pg||
nt|mrdct: and there's nowhere to put the deep @c loser|pg||
nt|mrdct: so i think this is going to slide one off|pg||
nt|sybarra: no reason to hop yet|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 1@d = 1s + another, some spec tell me.|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sybarra: we are in the qualifying rounds  leading to semi's then finals over the weekend |pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room at least sniffed at slam, but vanProoijen 3@S left much less room for exploration|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all matches are 14 boards, but the venue always plays  1-14  and  17-30|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|c4|nt|sybarra2: wlcm back Al |pg||
nt|andyv:  that board a possible pick up for EW in OR|pg||

nt|ahollan1: another forcing 1@C  |pg||

nt|ahollan1: does East show minors immediately?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: if 1@s then they go too high, maybe|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  now all we need is to know the operator's name:)|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 1@c alerted ??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL=6-9 HCP|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: y|pg||
mb|1H|nt|pole_as_ch: BD  3 is push !|pg||

nt|mrdct: or perhaps any single suiter|pg||
nt|cc469: a frisky 2@S bid got the result it deserved|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i have no idea :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i have some old Convention Cards for Zejun -- but not with this partner|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D accomplishes nothing    South gets to describe his non-game force strength  and  NS have all the room for Relays|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Other table: I have to admit that I prefer 4@S on Bd 19 to 3@S and think Australia fully deserved their 6 imps|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Dec is E, different from OR|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: 4@D implies  "i know what to do when they bid 4@H/@S"|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N was bid and made in OR on  3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I wouldn't know that, so i vote for 5@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or both majors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in 4 boards we've already seen  an 8-card suit   and now 75 hand   were these shuffled??|pg||
nt|petergill: on Bd 18 I mean, not 19|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but  North not good enough to use Game Force Realy|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: passive lead !?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  5@d makes|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  19  East playing 2@CX|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H natural, non-force   [1@H would be Relay]|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: immediately   let EW make the last guess|pg||
nt|andyv:  so, not so sure EW action was the best for them|pg||

nt|ahollan1: doesn't this lose @S and 2@C ?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|pole_as_ch: Y, N's 2@h is very natural.|pg||
nt|petergill: @HQ = unblock jack if you have it|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: East's @C spots prevail |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Texas Transfer|pg||
nt|cc469: I'm told NS are from women China team 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i wonder why Shin didn't open?   if 2@S promises a 2nd suit, then assume 2@D multi|pg||
nt|ahollan1: China Geely Auto roster is   Gui Shengyue, Zhang Banxiang, Yang Lixin, Dai Jianming, Zhuang Zejun|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the big club auction in the other room didn't get any closer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but not a great slam for people who guess queens like me|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: East might try @d. but 3, so she choiced pass.|pg||

nt|sybarra: 1st US$12,000, 2nd US$6,000, 3rd/4th tie US$3,000 per team  nice prize money |pg||

nt|andyv:  their card shows 8+ for overcalls, so a bit light|pg||
nt|twcho: but even they find it, they may not buy the contract|pg||
mb|5D|nt|petergill: My thoughts on 1@S: Many experts do so, aggressive at one level, bid boss suit as often as possible, most timid non-experts don't bid like the experts do .... etc|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N much harder to find now|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d7|nt|andyv:  this helps because transportation is tricky|pg||

nt|andyv:  down 2 or 3 depending on guessing the @s...playing low to K seems to be indicated|pg||

nt|sybarra: 3 @C probably said @H's and S taking a chance on 3 nt |pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 19  2@CX was +580  and 13 imps to China Geely Auto|pg||
nt|mrdct: but i could be mistaken|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|pole_as_ch: 3@h is safe ! or some snag ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other table  5@H South|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mrdct: and put south on the spot to perhaps bid a failing slam|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think S is looking for tricks here |pg||
nt|ahollan1: probably not a hand with slam interest - that would start with 2@C [stayman OR game force relay]|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: luck he had 9 tops here|pg||
pc|hA|nt|petergill: i played many boards against this pair in the semi finals of our Nationals 2 weeks ago (they won), but I have never played their system|pg||
nt|ahollan2:  unfavorable vul    1N=13-15|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|sybarra: and that lead lets it thru for sure |pg||
nt|mrdct: declarer will be a bit worried about getting tapped-off here|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Bill would regrett Not to go, maybe|pg||
nt|mrdct: only if he makes 12 tricks - which isn't guaranteed|pg||
pc|c3|nt|pole_as_ch: sry, -1 or more.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hans led @C|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 9 !|pg||

pc|c6|nt|mrdct: a hard-eartned 1-imp swing for Oz|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the question seems to be   does 5@H make with 4-0 trump slit  AND 4-2 @C|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: but @c8 is funny carding.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pole_as_ch: y, now -2.|pg||
nt|petergill: Holding @DQx, East was in no hurry to give partner a ruff with West's 3rd (long) trump|pg||
nt|petergill: Also, if North had have played @S8 at Trrick 1, East could not tell if W had @S432 (playing UDCA)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|pole_as_ch: well|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: club lead and this hand likely to go down |pg||

mb|1D|nt|petergill: Tony Nunn is picking up fairly poor hands|pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3H|an|!s|nt|twcho: 2NT in bal position is not unusual|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|andyv:  3N works out better but 4@s will also make|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: I think N will select to play 3NT, due to presence of @DJ|pg||
nt|twcho: both will make as west has no entry at all|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|twcho: hi Leon|pg||

nt|petergill: This is Semi Final, first set. |pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Leon|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|pc|dA|pg||
nt|twcho: rusinow lead by EW?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|petergill: Japanese NS came 9th in 2011 Bermuda Bowl, Aussie EW came 11th in 2011 BB, other table NZ NS came 10th in 2011 BB|pg||
pc|s9|nt|rick3son:  fairly common to lead Q form KQT9 |pg||
nt|twcho: vs NT maybe|pg||
nt|twcho: but not so vs suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  easy for us to see playing the J is right...does he have a different choice?|pg||
nt|petergill: EW lead: King for count vs suit, queen for upside down attitude|pg||
nt|twcho: tks Peter for clarification|pg||
nt|vugraphzwr: North asks the range of 1NT opening.|pg||
nt|twcho: what can he gain if he plays K now?|pg||
nt|petergill: Semi final is 2 X 16 boards|pg||
nt|twcho: dropping singleton @sQ?|pg||
nt|rick3son:  obscure|pg||
nt|rick3son:  also east would not play 9 |pg||
nt|petergill: If queen is offside e.g. Qxx, stopping West obtaining the lead to put @D through - due to endplay possibilities on East later|pg||
nt|petergill: N's thought: playing weak 1NT, either East has a singleton somewhere or East is 15+ HCP|pg||
nt|petergill: so either E holds all the missing pts or is unbal|pg||
nt|twcho: EW playing weak NT throughout?|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s8|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|petergill: so East cannot have Axx Qxx KQ10x Qxx (weak 1NT) in which case king play would be best |pg||

nt|petergill: therefore play jack|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: 8 imps come ! |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fair slam that will fail if played by West|pg||
nt|mrdct: slam on the @d hook (more-or-less) here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: North will lead his singleton|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi Vladimir|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlucky choice of lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: so i think funny why bd 17 was -1 imp ???|pg||
nt|mrdct: in the event of a tie - the bulgarian all stars have 0.5 imps of carryover|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: and 4@hX ?|pg||
nt|mrdct: difficult hand for west as 3NT or 4@s could be the best spot|pg||
nt|mrdct: probably start with a dbl is best|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=10-15 HCP, 4+@H   if 2nd suit, it is LONGER  [or 5@H 5@S]|pg||
nt|sybarra2: yes thank you all |pg||
nt|andyv:  important to remember that EW do not have any weak 2 bids|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: 1@S=10-15 HCP, 4+@S   if 2-suits  the other is LONGER|pg||
nt|twcho: east didn't open|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  except for 2@s...all the other bids are reserved because of the canape bids|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C  10-13  5+ clubs, unbalanced|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They right-sided hearts now so to speak|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not easy for Dido to lead a club|pg||
nt|mrdct: roland's analysis better than mine - the looming @c ruff and promotion of the @hJ the ket here to beat 6@h|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@d in an inv+ relay|pg||
nt|sybarra: suspecting precision here |pg||
nt|xenya: hello Germ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ??  i thought 2@C=1-suiter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and 2@S=@S & minor|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe he is treating it as such|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: dbl dummy, 6@c by East|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: *is|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|sybarra2: canape |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D guarantees LONGER @D|pg||

nt|sybarra2: I never have been able to figure out the advantage here |pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|an| |nt|pole_as_ch: uh! 4@h can make, but can they reach to there ?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: they find best suit|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: and S ?|pg||
mb|d!|nt|ahollan1: sure -- but why?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: woww !|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@S is a treatment i haven't seen before|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe part of transfer advances???|pg||
nt|mrdct: @d lead by south may also beat 6@h as declarer will try to pitch the losing @d on the @CAK|pg||
nt|xenya: tricky hand, this|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Operater ?  last BD 2 up really ??|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  got me on that one|pg||

nt|sybarra: and was the lead he wanted |pg||
nt|sybarra: over 1 nt|pg||
pc|c3|nt|pole_as_ch: hummm |pg||
pc|cT|nt|petergill: Should South overcall 2@C? Fav vul = good - in Sabine Auken's book, she explains why 3@C overcall of 1@D can work well - EW have 2 unbid majors so might miss the 4-4 major fit. |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 1 off or good/bad ??|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: probably typical contract |pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW require decent 12 hcp to open balanced hands so  vProoijen PASS|pg||
nt|kemperg: Yeh Bros on 6th place, ONI-TAKA 4/5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: leads 3rd/4th   carding  usually  odd/even|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|sybarra: Frank,  we commented earlier about the names of teams,  women vs ladies   |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N = 15-17|pg||
nt|kemperg: first 6 to quarter final|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sybarra: not sure if that reflects age or what |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kemperg: 8|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: where is 9th trick ? |pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mrdct: indeed it looks like anything other than @SA will beat it|pg||
nt|mrdct: sorry everyone - i have a no-GIB policy when commentating so expect serious misanalysis!|pg||
nt|mrdct: looks like only a LOW @s will let it make|pg||
nt|mrdct: trumps might be the likely lead here|pg||
nt|mrdct: but i'm not exactly sure what info south has about the east-west hands|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 4@s in OR !|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: wow|pg||
pc|h6|nt|andyv:  whatever it is, it will be 2 tricks short|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: @d4|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: does 1N deny 4@S?     probably  otherwise North would probably use some form of checkback|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: no, North !  sry|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: 2-way checkback  or  new minor force?    probably 2-way  so  2@D = artificial game force|pg||
nt|twcho: yes, rather standard precision which is suitable for irregular partnership|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sybarra: may now get pushed too high?    can they even beat 4 @S?|pg||
nt|sybarra: my pards rarely have hands like that one when I open 4  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: from old card  Zejun @C7  =  odd/even  where odd=like this suit|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: same contract|pg||
nt|mrdct: heading for a normal push|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: checkback was used in other room so Patrick Huang avoided @S lead -- but his choice of @HK wasn't a success either|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in North America the top big club pairs are playing 2@C always 6+@C|pg||
nt|twcho: and NS aren't regular partners|pg||
nt|ahollan1: mine would have 13 cards   but there the similarity would end|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: c |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: then again  playing 2-way checkback  South might bid @C|pg||

pc|dK|nt|sybarra: can N get in to lead club? |pg||
nt|sybarra: just take 4 aces   easier |pg||
pc|d5|nt|petergill: Best % play of @h suit in 6@H is ace - picks up bare king in either hand|pg||

pc|s9|nt|ahollan1: another possible squeeze -- but this one doesn't work|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mrdct: losing 2@c, 1@h and 1@s so need to get @d right to make|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||

nt|ahollan1: unlikely @D plays|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: this will switch @c|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sybarra: our pards have taken similar lessons it seems |pg||

nt|sybarra2: ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  you have all the controls ...only a question if you can set up @cs on ruffs|pg||
nt|andyv:  the poor @s spots may determine if they go on |pg||
nt|sybarra2: or smother 10 of @S? |pg||
nt|ahollan1: the auction strongly suggests  @S 4333 around the table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in that case -- 3@D looks more dangerous than normal|pg||
pc|s6|nt|andyv:  you can also try the @d suit |pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@s is 8-10 bal and 3@d asks for a major I'm told|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|twcho: he should return a @s to break up the squeeze|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@S = light third seat non-vul openings are all the rage among genuine experts - the older experts like to open 2@S (or equivalent) in 3rd seat (takes away more bidding space) - ...|pg||
nt|petergill: the newer experts find 1@S more effective overall (less revealing to opponents in the card play)|pg||
nt|mrdct: had north passed initially i guess NS would get to 1NT makiing 7 or 8 tricks|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mrdct: and then 3@h is a transfer to get the strong hand to play it|pg||

nt|kemperg: no fancy play, trying to catch 10x in N and its made|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if West had all of the inferences about the NS @S length  and  North's proably being 46|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with  4135 or 4315  i'm not sure if Newell would rebid 3@C or just a quiet 2@S|pg||

nt|mrdct: a decision costing about 20 imps|pg||
mb|1N|nt|pole_as_ch: oh! weak NT maybe.|pg||
nt|sybarra2: e/w  just won dutch national championships last weekend as I recall |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: well|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 18+ bal|pg||
nt|twcho: you really know their style. :)|pg||
nt|xenya: i must say EW were a bit lucky on the last 2 hands|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: new bd|pg||
mb|2N|an|nat|nt|fabsayc: i dont understand, how could heart shift work|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=0-7|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Now difficult in counter-part.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: RDBL may trf to @c.|pg||
nt|mrdct: looks like a routine 4@s here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=4@H and 5+@C/@D   i think this is absolute maximum for the Raptor 1N overcall|pg||
nt|mrdct: with two balanced hands EW may choose 3NT here|pg||
nt|petergill: I think West should have played his top spades (not @CK) on which East could indicate @CA somehow - for 800|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C strong|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+   [i'm using Zejun convention card from 2009 world championship]|pg||
nt|sybarra: what 2 suited call do they have?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: but very difficult hand for 3NT, i think|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: where is they go in this bd ?|pg||
nt|mrdct: some number of @h - 2 or 3 i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1:  9  the Chinese pair took save in 5@HX|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: well deserved 7 too|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1:  24  Jianming in 4@SX West|pg||
nt|petergill: Dbl probably shows about 6 or 7 points, was not penalty|pg||
nt|mrdct: can ben find a reason to lead @h?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D = 2 suits same rank  [@C&@D or @H&@S]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not pure CRASH  they use  DBL, 1@D and 2@C instead of the usually DBL, 1@D, 1N|pg||
nt|sybarra: does Reid now try 1 @S? |pg||
nt|mrdct: west doesn't have very good suit quality in @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: by the huge margin of 1 imp     Dutch Premier League   i get the feeling it is analogous to the ACBL's Grand National Team|pg||
nt|sybarra2: I think a bit more than that |pg||
nt|sybarra2: I would put it more like the Reisinger |pg||
nt|ahollan1: more than the GNT?|pg||
nt|sybarra2: maybe you feel that GNT is more than I do |pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh  in importance   i made comparison because it runs over multiple months  starting at club level|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 3@h ! or 3@c |pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: North calmly pass !|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C = pass/correct|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@S = 4+@S [possible canape with longer minor]|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@S four or five spades|pg||
nt|sybarra2: ok that is true |pg||
nt|sybarra2: re over many months|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh !!!!  2@c !!|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@c can make i believe|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 1NT by W in OR|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2NT puppet to 3C or nat|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thx operator|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: i think puppet to @c|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: 1@S forcing     2@C=5-7 HCP, 0-2@S, not 6+@C/@D  [3m], not 5+@H [2@D]|pg||
nt|sybarra2: van Prooijen-Verhees, playing in the closed room, won the Dutch Teams Championship (by 1 IMP!) less than 36 hours ago. They must be jet-lagged. Quite a journey from Amsterdam to ...|pg||
nt|sybarra2: ...|pg||
nt|sybarra2: to Japan|pg||
nt|sybarra2: playing here |pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmmmmm   i thought 2N showed 6+@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and game force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H confirms @C and shows extras  [i think]   maybe just extras|pg||
nt|petergill: Pass by West, converting East's Dbl for penalties, yields 800 or 1100 or more, I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lead director :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: I thought maybe he would try 1 @S to see if it was majors |pg||
nt|mrdct: lose 2@s and a trick in each of the other suits|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: strange 3N|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|nt|fabsayc: how can it be game force after negative 1@D?|pg||
nt|vugraphzws: Alert with P is miss.sorry|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: in OR, West's 1NT !  humm.|pg||
nt|mrdct: i guess there is chance for declarer to over think a potential bad trump break going for an endplay in @d|pg||
nt|mrdct: which could be indicated with the @H opening by west|pg||
nt|mrdct: btw 2@h is 10-13 5+@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: can be weaker in 3rd|pg||
nt|mrdct: the east-west system has no weak 2 available so with hands like west you need to improvise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if 3@C again pass/correct then 2@H was just showing max|pg||
nt|kemperg: dbl = support 3@Hs|pg||
nt|sybarra: becaise if pard bids a minor Reid has a good hand |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: could be a great result though|pg||
pc|h4|nt|andyv:  card says 1@s was a balanced relay so probably couldn|pg||
nt|andyv:  couldn't hold 6 spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: either my notes or vP's bid are wrong|pg||
nt|ahollan1: fun system to study     i first saw Ultimate Canape played by Russ Ekeblad   the Dutch have made some minor changes but the overall structure is intact|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: i wonder -- what is default meaning of RDBL for CRASH players|pg||
pc|h2|nt|petergill: 4@S should make, but is not totally cold|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no   1@S=relay over 1@H response|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was about to say  best contract 1N [which they can't reach]   when result from other room popped up|pg||
nt|petergill: the sort of contract an expert should make and an average player might not make|pg||
nt|petergill: On this lead, 4@S is even colder|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 8 tricks ?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra2: do we hear the screaching of brakes?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: over 1@D   1@H/@S look like matchpoint precision / meckwell ...   4+suit, one-round force|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|pole_as_ch: use @d for many tricks ?|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: to account for the artificial 1N overcall   EW DBL isn't pure takeout shape -- can include normal strong NT|pg||
nt|kemperg: 10 tricks, claim|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|nt|mrdct: @D10 is a good card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thru 8   China Women  2  leads  Oni-Taka  11-0|pg||
pc|cK|nt|pole_as_ch: britts comes|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|cc469: curious @H duck|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe "minor changes" is an underbid|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: not likely to see dummy |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: was Hirata on a different wave length there?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: did he want to save @C10 for later??|pg||
nt|mrdct: danger for declarer is ruffing stuff early and lsoing control when the bad trump break reveals itsel;f|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my thinking    should have thought before playing @DA|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: surely|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|nt|pole_as_ch: @c swich by south was bad. maybe 4 make.|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C  this time  the 6+@C 1-suiter|pg||
nt|mrdct: 1@d is @s and anotehr suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: N-S may get to 3NT |pg||
nt|sybarra2: I can see how one could end up in 4 @H here |pg||
nt|ahollan1: swiss matches are 14 boards but 28 is NOT the final board of the match  ---  we started with  17|pg||
nt|twcho: how to show both M after thsi 1@d opening?|pg||
nt|sybarra: rather unpleasant splits everywhere here |pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@d looks like a multi of some description|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Klinger also did it !|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: 1@c is nat and forcing|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: last time we saw the equal or longer @S variety|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: precious 5 imps|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: gosh a natural bid |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=10-15 hcp, 4+@H    maybe LONGER 2nd suit or 5@H 5@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzws: Sorry|pg||
nt|twcho: how to bring the @s into picture?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: mirrors?|pg||
nt|cc469: yes, why open 1@H?|pg||
nt|kemperg: I would find p with 4 @Hs and xx in @S then:)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: 2@D relay  again, not promising ANY strength|pg||
nt|kemperg: quanti|pg||
nt|petergill: China Women 2, with Wang Wenfei, who was World  1 woman player briefly before her approx two years off, back from her break|pg||
nt|petergill: this Bulgaria All Stars is almost locked into the Final 8 too, as is Japan's top team Oni-taka, some of whom came 9th in the 2011n Bermuda Bowl|pg||
nt|mrdct: i don't think the overtrick on 26 makes any difference as 180 and 200 are both 5 imps|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: or 6@d ?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: y|pg||
nt|mrdct: 6@d is a great contract|pg||
nt|mrdct: maybe 4@h by north now|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: and 5@c by south ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@H = 1-suiter, not solid suit|pg||
nt|cc469: I see|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: is north not happy with his @s stopper?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe it *shows*|pg||
nt|mrdct: maybe 2@s is showing the @s stopper(s)|pg||
nt|petergill: Oz Players is 6th so needs to avoid a serious loss in order to qualify|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=one round force   2@C natural   don't know which suit is longer|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: @S well placed, will make 6|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, can't help it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C confirms canape hand   4@H  LONGER @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and lack of @S bid we have pretty good picture of South hand|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 3 or 4 ??|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: well, 4 !|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 4 for me too|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: 2N relay for distribution|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 7+@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not 7222|pg||
nt|andyv:  but he makes it up in volume|pg||

pc|h5|nt|pole_as_ch: What is her choice for OL?|pg||
nt|twcho: interesting system|pg||
nt|twcho: another strange bid by north|pg||
nt|ahollan1: strike that  their teammates in the winning Bermuda Bowl    Tarzan Precision opens 1@H with 5@H and 5+@S  [because of their relay structure]|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@S was 4 spades, longer clubs, 14+ points|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: sry, last BD, west ! Mullanphy !|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mrdct: hard for south to avoid game now|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now show 0/1@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: was just typing    @H ruff will be with natural trump trick - is there a way to avoid that defense|pg||
nt|mrdct: i guess with the EW major not revealed 4@h could be contrued as natural by north|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: well sure -- lead @D  :)|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh !  sound !?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: i c|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: agree|pg||
nt|mrdct: in the open room west showed @h naturally so north was able to cue with 4@h so i think the slam will be reached in the open room|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: alas duplication|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: 4@H slam try in @C|pg||
nt|mrdct: a nice 5-5 and partner showing some values|pg||
nt|mrdct: Oz Players are 2/3 of the team which narrowly lost the Australian National Open Team 2 weeks ago|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: they go to 6@d in OR|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: 4 made in OR !  England Ladies will gain 1 imp.  |pg||

nt|fabsayc: good lord, are they slamming again|pg||
nt|sybarra2: teetering on it |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i doubt verhees shows  disinterest with @CAK-7th|pg||
nt|sybarra2: maybe the 4 @S=min slows them down?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: i think so -- but don't quote me|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1:  10  Tony Nunn in West made 3@C where Banxiang made 1N|pg||

pc|dA|pc|c2|nt|rick3son:  South suit quality lacking|pg||

mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: and 3rd 2@D response|pg||
nt|ahollan1: RDBL=4+@H|pg||
nt|xenya: if 20 is the limit, 4N looks purposeless|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: and full of controls |pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: trouble hand again ??|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  must be nice to have so many hands fit into your system:)|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 1@h = @s showing, and 2@s = 4 card @s  maybe !|pg||
nt|Walddk4: yes, and a minimum|pg||
nt|mrdct: usually voids opposite AK/AQ aren't so great but no problems here in 6@d EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  S had a pretty easy dbl |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: thx Roland.|pg||
nt|mrdct: typically aggressive fav vul preempt by ben|pg||
nt|cc469: has to just guess the @H in 4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  25  [the weird 2N opener]   South playing 3@S|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: someone goes to 7 ?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh !|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: yep  define the system then make arrangements with The Great Shuffler|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: how do y think 4@c /|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: *?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not nice|pg||
pc|dK|nt|pole_as_ch: hum|pg||
pc|d4|nt|andyv:  NS are rapidly becoming spectators in these auctions|pg||
nt|petergill: other table Bd 26: Ron Klinger is in 4@S, should make it|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am surprised Reid wasnt in there with spades  (except he is red) |pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Declarer mistimed this in the open room|pg||
nt|mrdct: they probably a convention that will help them avoid that|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pole_as_ch: 3NT would be better contruct, but West choiced 4@s.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H holding 4  means  either weak NT or  4414/4405|pg||
nt|cc469: that should help the @H guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzws: 2NT maybe 20-21|pg||
nt|xenya: well a good 21 could be enough for slam|pg||
nt|xenya: 21 plus a 5-carder for example|pg||
nt|kemperg: we might upgrade that|pg||
pc|c3|nt|pole_as_ch: 11imp comes, so 21 imps wide spreaded|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|andyv:  you aren't dealt NT hands in order to be passing |pg||
nt|ahollan1: vP described 7+@C again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would you overcall 2N or DBL Andy?|pg||
nt|mrdct: not a challenging lead fro declarer - this should make easiluy'|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 3 in @s, 3 in @h, 1 in @d, 1 in @C, so 8 tricks.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: not available    everything other than PASS = game force|pg||
nt|sybarra: lucky him |pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: ihave no experience of precision|pg||
pc|s5|nt|pole_as_ch: only play against them a few times|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: i wonder if west bid 4@H   does south bid 4@S|pg||
nt|twcho: south won't bid for sure|pg||
nt|twcho: north may consider|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 2NT and 3@h is ASKing ? |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: it looks easily reach 6@d|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: anyways|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|kemperg: so it depends on their style|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the meantime  EW did well to find 4@H|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I was just thinking trump|pg||
pc|s2|nt|pole_as_ch: Both table is the same point and thinking |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|andyv:  dbl|pg||
nt|ahollan1: remember  2@C could be 4@C and 5+@S|pg||
pc|d7|nt|petergill: I would have played a heart, not a 2nd spade. |pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer might have to guess @h's now|pg||
nt|mrdct: yeah he's a bit tangled up now|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: agree|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 2 ruff in each hand is not enought, because South would ruff 3rd @h.|pg||
nt|cc469: he seemed to thinkl a long time over 2@H|pg||
nt|xenya: true, but S was a passed hand, so no risk really |pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|nt|kemperg: 44 imps is 25 I hear from Roland|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: ah, @s est plan is easy i think. y, after wind up thier trump|pg||
pc|hK|nt|fabsayc: they are accurate enough that north might have considered 3@H over west's pass|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't like Kx as stopper when opps say they have 6 of them...can't even hold up once|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and for those who pay attention to trivia   this is 2nd 8-card @S suit of the set|pg||
nt|kemperg: 25-5|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Defender shoud attack @c |pg||

nt|kiwibridge: operator?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kemperg: out of first 8 temporarely|pg||
pc|hT|nt|petergill: Defence is sharp - count signals (not Smith Signal) made continuation of @S's findable |pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|pg||
nt|mrdct: EW might pencil this in as a good result|pg||
nt|xenya: how many more rounds to play?|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1 up now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hard to believe he ran 8@C as a winner|pg||
pc|d8|pc|c9|pc|d6|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|andyv:  on this hand anyway, letting opps play 3@c is not winning bridge.|pg||

pc|h4|nt|sybarra: bit ambitious here |pg||

nt|petergill: which is presumably what Ino expected|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|rick3son:  for 4@c bid to bid right he is dreaming of finding cards in partners hand|pg||

pc|dK|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|petergill: North and South are two of the nicest, most pleasant guys I have ever met, by the way. |pg||
nt|rick3son:  knowing that they gave 800 when they could have passe dout part score can affect them psycholigically|pg||
nt|petergill: but their partnership is new so N could not judge easily that Teramoto might push to bid 4@C there - long-term partnerships can tell such things|pg||

nt|ahollan1:  11  [the long auction to 5@C]  Miyakuni 3N West|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, South could have defeated it (ruffing @DK)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: should North bid game?    red vs white 'preempt' in sandwich position??|pg||
nt|twcho: I think north should respect his partner bidding|pg||
nt|twcho: likely providing 7+ tricks (likely more) for his red vs white bid|pg||
nt|twcho: and bid the game|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: hummm. 2@h by NS ?|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|sybarra2: bd 11 3 nt +2 in the other room |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: that picked up 2 overtrick imps   but  5@C much better at imps|pg||
nt|sybarra2: dealing machine having fun with club suit|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: 14+|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|ahollan1: how many @C has vanProoijen held this set?|pg||
nt|sybarra2: the Yeh Bros team is:  Chen Yeh, JuiYiu Shih, ChiMou Lin, Herstein Liu, Patrick Huang, Grace Lin |pg||
nt|sybarra2: and they Yeh Bros sponsor a great tourney also shown on bbo |pg||
nt|ahollan1: agree|pg||
nt|cc469: yes, but 8 card suit?|pg||
nt|petergill: transfer to @H|pg||
nt|mrdct: going with the odds and transfering to his 5cM|pg||
nt|petergill: tfr to 1H or other gf, 2@D did not promise @H|pg||
nt|petergill: if GF|pg||
nt|mrdct: may have considered waiting for the balancing dbl and then run to @d if necessary|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D = tfr to @H or game Force|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: no tange|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: 2 bd is remains. 40imp is 25-5 ! |pg||
nt|Walddk4: But it looked natural to him to get rid of his last heart|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Banxiang hoping for a lot from vulnerable weak jump overcall|pg||
nt|mrdct: yeah i guess south will show his M 2-suiter and north will just bid 2@h|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 3@d by E ?|pg||
nt|mrdct: but south choosing a different route here|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ hcp|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=game force, 5+@S|pg||
nt|xenya: 1@S? -- is that @Ds?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: try to @h, nex times i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  a lot|pg||
nt|andyv:  6@d is the lucky spot on this hand|pg||
nt|mrdct: Oz might win those imps back here|pg||
nt|mrdct: 7@h seems kind of extreme on these EW cards|pg||
nt|sybarra: saved by Newell |pg||
nt|ahollan1: and gets help from Newell|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry Shirl|pg||
nt|sybarra: just an echo |pg||
nt|ahollan1: my guess   Banxiang is thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzws: yes.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Reid expects LONGER @C  and partner has max of 13 HCP|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|sybarra2: another invitation tourney |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Patrick Huang bid only 2N  but still got to game|pg||
nt|xenya: or 1N?|pg||
nt|petergill: take the plus? |pg||
nt|petergill: or 2@S - 3@S - 4@S? |pg||
nt|petergill: dbl of 2@H is t/o|pg||
nt|mrdct: the GF option muddies the water here for W|pg||
nt|petergill: West did not expect it to be GF|pg||
nt|petergill: I think 2@S the first time is best - 3@S - 4@S |pg||
nt|petergill: but perhaps 4@S is hard to bid after the weak 1NT|pg||
nt|mrdct: yes, but the GF option affect the meanings of double of 2@d|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H if passed out will be about 300|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@S will be 620 or 650, 2@S will be 170 or 200|pg||
nt|petergill: With good shape, it's a bidder's game. Shape rules.|pg||
nt|mrdct: if 2@h is dbled, can NS escape to 3@d?|pg||
nt|petergill: I think 2@S the previous time is best, as the delayed 2@S sounds "balancing" or weaker |pg||
nt|petergill: so 2@S now might get passed by East|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: transfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra2: Patrick is a frequent commentator with us (when not playing) |pg||
nt|sybarra2: he also lived in Netherlands for many years and probably "brought these dutchies up" |pg||
nt|ahollan1: which black suit to attack??    that answer affects play to trick 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D lead director rather than showing 2 suiter missing the boss suit|pg||
nt|twcho: does 2@s here guarantee 4 cards support?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i doubt it|pg||
nt|mrdct: decided to take the plus|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: ah !|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sybarra: and a quiet part score |pg||
nt|ahollan1: for what it is worth   Conditions of Contest actually discuss handling of "screen hesitations"|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: there is one more hand after this hand |pg||
nt|twcho: yes, I doubt it too. :)|pg||

nt|kemperg: sorry dont know|pg||
nt|petergill: other table: On Bd 27, EW have found their way into the auction, so it might be a swing to Australia. |pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: only an 8-card fit, west is balanced, dodgey stiff @DK in east|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seeing @SK in dummy   West wants to go back and DBL|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: BD 10 oz/nz gains 3 imp|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: and 3NT ?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sybarra: we want to thank our operator for wonder presentation |pg||
nt|xenya: i think he can make it|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1:  12  after 1@C auction  Bakhsi had no trouble finding DBL  and they've found @H|pg||
nt|sybarra2: not sure I really want to be there however |pg||
nt|fabsayc: i would not even cue with norths non=opener|pg||
nt|ahollan1: may not be an option in the partnership|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he could bid bid 4@S over the double surely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i.e.  common agreement  MUST return cuebid if available below game|pg||
nt|mrdct: 1NT is 10+ bal GF|pg||
nt|ahollan1: trump shift?????|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: different situation when 1 hand shows 5+ AND forces to game   versus  competitive bidding war|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: 1@c is 14+|pg||
nt|xenya: possibly with an overtrick|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: will test Peter's declarer play for sure :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|fabsayc: is prooijen pretending to lead a singleton|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: fufufufu|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch:  11, 2@h by N in OR|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mrdct: 2@h and 3@h look natural|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3@s i guess is a cue and 3NT is a slam try|pg||
nt|mrdct: beyond that i'm guessing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: see  @D lead director|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|pole_as_ch: good contruct !  it looks cold.  so 5 imps buck.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one of the first to play Precision  [helped CC Wei with some system clarification  or maybe just in introducing the system in Taiwan]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from old Zejun convention card    carding is standard Count   odd/even discard   and presumably no attitude signals vs suit|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to NEC and the Japan Contract Bridge League for bringing this wonderful tourney once again to bbo |pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|nt|petergill: 3@S over 2@H is too risky for me - singleton heart in partner's hand seems wasted opposite KQJ10|pg||

nt|mrdct: *for|pg||
nt|mrdct: managing this 5-0 @h break will take some care|pg||

pc|cK|pg||

nt|sybarra2: and thx to NEC  the sponsor and to the Japan Contract Bridge Leage and Akito Omasa for bringing this wonderful tourney to BBO |pg||
nt|vugraphzws: sorry made|pg||
nt|twcho: and closing the gap to 12 imps now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S less than game force|pg||
nt|xenya: that won't be a success|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C 14+, either natural or bal|pg||
nt|mrdct: NS methods might work well here to stop low|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=forcing  (13)14+ unbal or 15+ bal|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk4: England 24-6 VPs before this|pg||
nt|mrdct: 6@d is a make here looking at all 4 hands|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1N = up to 17|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: BD 12, 5@CX by N ????|pg||
mb|p|nt|rick3son:  Thanks Shirley for organising|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=4/5-fit|pg||
nt|twcho: why 2@c by north, not 2@d?|pg||
nt|kemperg: no:)|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@H = 4+ @s's, 0-11 pts|pg||
nt|mrdct: 1@h is tfer to @s|pg||

nt|mrdct: 3@d showig @h i assume|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: looks like 3 off on the surface|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S was from Reid -- normal transfer|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 3@d = INV ??|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: but who would finesse @DQ over S after 3@S opening???|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: not me|pg||
nt|sybarra: everyone getting too high here |pg||
pc|s9|nt|kemperg: last board, thanks to my cocommentator Vladimir and our operator, see you next round in 45 min.|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks Germ, thanks everyone|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think 3@H is one round force|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: what does that mean after 1@D which is 0+ suit?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i would think other 2 suits|pg||
nt|twcho: I will assume it to be natural|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so must DBL or bid 2N with the other 2?|pg||
nt|twcho: yes, looks natural for me|pg||
nt|xenya: i predict S will bid 6 :)|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@D transfer to @H ---> but with equal or longer spades S replies 3@S|pg||
nt|petergill: so South has shown longer @h than @S|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: and calm 3NT !|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 3 bd remains include this|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: interesting Tommy  if 2@D is natural   does 2N show @D & @C or  @H & @C|pg||
nt|mrdct: last board of the match now|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: I don't really care for the NT bid|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: E should move u say ?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: pard has passed showing < 9|pg||
pc|sA|nt|pole_as_ch: now no entry for dummy ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: followers of Marty Bergen/Eric Rodwell profess    if you don't make immediate raise -- you don't have 4-card fit|pg||
pc|s4|nt|petergill: both teams look 100% safe for qualifying, barring accidents at the other table|pg||
nt|petergill: Bulg 3rd, Oz 6th before this match, 8 qualify after this match|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@H by South is a pleasant enough contract, NS sill be happy|pg||
nt|petergill: NT by South is mich harder to play, having to lead always from the South hand|pg||
nt|petergill: much|pg||

nt|kemperg: @S splinter by S would not bring slam|pg||
pc|s5|pg||

pc|d6|nt|pole_as_ch: oh, wow, papa helped Dec.|pg||
nt|sybarra2: my morning papers (by email) are arriving from London |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Looks like 25-2 VPs and Yeh Bros most likely out of contention for a quarter-final spot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you followed the Swiss Qualifying -- DON'T LEAVE   KO matches are 16 board sets rather than the Swiss 14|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: for the spectators -- there is no single right answer  bidding over a nebulous 1@D   you must have partnership agreement|pg||
nt|petergill: West's club back at Trick 2 was in the hope that partner had @CJ|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Last BD !|pg||
pc|hA|nt|andyv:  so 13 was costly to NS for their lack of action|pg||

nt|ahollan1: do we know which matches on vugraph next??|pg||
nt|vugraphzws: I dont know who next match yet.|pg||
nt|petergill: There is some case to have an agreement that when leading through a 19+ point dummy, opening leader leads low from "Honour - x", but few (non-Eastern European) pairs in the world ...|pg||
nt|petergill: have that agreement|pg||
pc|h4|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1H|mb|1S|an|5+ !s|nt|rick3son:  the up side of that scenario ( passing when pd has stiff in your suit) is that you bring the stoppers :)|pg||

nt|petergill: Seniors by Indonesia|pg||

nt|petergill: 5@C would have led to 6@D - let's see if 5@D does or not|pg||
