mb|p|nt|wkc:  We'll have a 12 board match in the second half|pg||
nt|eieio: Operator please throw me a message|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2D|nt|lorderic: hello everyone, welcome!|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: welcome back everyone!|pg||
nt|lorderic: this is a collegiate event hold in Taiwan|pg||
nt|lorderic: we're now in the finals|pg||
nt|lorderic: the finals are three 12-board matches|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|lorderic: BTU-Jecization, which is the first seed in round robin, has 7.5 IMPs carryover|pg||
nt|wkc:  I don't like the 2@C opening|pg||
nt|lorderic: hello Jason|pg||
nt|wkc:  hi Eric|pg||
nt|lorderic: if this 2@C shows a "strong hand" then it's not my choice|pg||
nt|lorderic: I prefer 4@S, or 4@D if you play Namyats|pg||
nt|vugraphzyk: south think a lot of time|pg||
nt|vugraphzyk: it's hard for her to imagine that 4S was doubled|pg||
nt|wkc:  we all now she need some time :)|pg||
nt|wkc:  hi Eric|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: it's the second set of NTU cup final|pg||
nt|lorderic: Hi Jason|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|eieio: I think 2@H is an underbid here|pg||
pc|dK|nt|wkc:  the declarer will a @C loser and one @D loser, so looks like a 4@S over 1|pg||
nt|lorderic: it's hard to imagine that 4@S was doubled since S has a tons of high card|pg||
nt|lorderic: 5@H is not my choice anyway. it's obvious that N have long @S|pg||
nt|wkc:  now things getting more confused, how could somebody double our 20+13 = 33 contract?|pg||
nt|eieio: Should make 4 easily with 6@H 2@S 1@D 1@C|pg||
nt|eieio: @CA is onside|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|wkc:  now the score of two team is actually 39.5 against 34|pg||
nt|wkc:  so 96 needs 6 or more IMPs to win this match|pg||
nt|lorderic: for everyone new to here, this is a collegiate event hold in Taipei, Taiwan|pg||
nt|lorderic: and here's the official website ... https://sites.google.com/site/ntucup2012/home|pg||
nt|wkc:  a quick 4@S and the declarer have some work to do with the 4-0@S split|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|c2|pc|h2|pg||
nt|wkc:  easy 4 top tricks|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|c6|pc|h4|pg||
nt|wkc:  the @CK means the declarer is searching for cross ruff like play, that's why W return the trump right away|pg||
nt|wkc:  but still, nothing could stop him|pg||
nt|wkc:  so 5@SX-2|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h9|pc|d4|nt|wkc:  but the lead realy help the declarer to handle this|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|d6|pc|c8|pc|hT|pg||
nt|eieio: Now a club|pg||
pc|c4|nt|wkc:  now things getting more dangerous|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|nt|wkc:  if the defender could find the @H ruff if would be one off|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|pc|c7|pc|d9|pg||
nt|lorderic: W takes a not-safety play on @S|pg||
mc|10|nt|lorderic: start with a good score to BTU-96|pg||

mb|p|nt|eieio: NS can make 5@C here|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: Good morning everyone!|pg||
nt|lorderic: Hi Jason!|pg||
nt|wkc:  double looks a little aggressive to me, but acceptable|pg||
nt|wkc:  Hi eric|pg||
nt|eieio: Or 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: welcome back guys|pg||
mb|1C|nt|wkc:  S open with this hand?|pg||
nt|lorderic: there should be some mis-operated|pg||
nt|wkc:  do you miss a pass stanley?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lorderic: here we go|pg||
nt|wkc:  ty!|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lorderic: For everyone who is new here, this is a collegiate event hold in Taiwan...|pg||
nt|lorderic: all four teams in semi-finals are come from National Taiwan University|pg||
nt|wkc:  a easy 1NT-3NT|pg||
nt|shuan: hi|pg||
nt|wkc:  hi shuan|pg||
nt|wkc:  welcome to our party|pg||
nt|vugraphzyk: sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|wkc:  what's your opinion for the double, eric|pg||
nt|lorderic: with 16 count and a 5-card major, it's typical to double first|pg||
nt|lorderic: the only problem in @H is, if the bidding goes 1@C-X-1@S-P; 2@S|pg||
nt|eieio: East has a easy 2@D opening|pg||
nt|eieio: Not sure why she didn't open|pg||
nt|eieio: NS can also make 4@H here|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|lorderic: you have to bid in 3 level, which is somehow scare with this hand|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|wkc:  pass by W looks better for me|pg||
nt|lorderic: we had the first 12-board half semi yesterday|pg||
nt|eieio: I think 2@H is an underbid|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|wkc:  so for those who just came, this is the first segment of the final of 19th NTU cup, which takes place in Taipei, Taiwan|pg||
mb|p|nt|wkc:  not a good 4@S|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lorderic: 4@S seems a reasonable spot|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|lorderic: here is the offical website for this event... https://sites.google.com/site/ntucup2012/home|pg||
nt|wkc:  we'll have three segments, 12 boards per segment match in the final|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|c3|nt|wkc:  with @D lead, declarer is like to take his 9 tricks and concede the others|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lorderic: with 8 card fit and a 5-5 in black suit, 4@S is sound. however it cannot be made since @C split 5-1|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzyk: I don't know what happened but south accept the west claim 4S make in last board, maybe i miss something|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lorderic: apologize we only have chinese version|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lorderic: thanks Stanley|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h7|pc|h2|pc|hK|pg||
nt|lorderic: hopefully we can have both english and chinese websites in the following year|pg||
pc|s6|nt|wkc:  now the contract is home|pg||
nt|lorderic: still need careful play|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|nt|lorderic: partscore here|pg||
mb|d|nt|wkc:  1NT is forcing|pg||
nt|lorderic: N has to face a decision after 1@S-1NT; 2@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzyk: last hand was claimed by west for 0 trick of last five|pg||
mb|p|nt|wkc:  double probably means power|pg||
nt|vugraphzyk: thx, i forget to alert|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|lorderic: seems like a partscore here. 4@H cannot be made by EW|pg||
nt|wkc:  N didn't use Michaels to show his 5-5, maybe he think the suit is not good enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|wkc:  usually a balanced hand, but you know sometimes you couldn't a way to describe your hand|pg||
nt|wkc:  2@D is sign off|pg||
nt|wkc:  I'll pass, singleton in pn's suit is not a good news|pg||
nt|wkc:  3@D?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzyk: west think a while|pg||
nt|vugraphzyk: finally bid 5D|pg||
nt|lorderic: N took an interesting action NOT using michaels|pg||
nt|wkc:  3@H from W?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzyk: sorry |pg||
nt|lorderic: I suggest pass also, although you might lose game if pd has around 17 HCP|pg||
nt|wkc:  okay|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|d9|pc|dK|pg||
nt|wkc:  well one way to make 4@H is rise the A now, and play @C|pg||
nt|wkc:  if S misdefend, I mean rise the A|pg||
nt|wkc:  then 4@H is home|pg||
nt|wkc:  sometimes bridge is like this, you give the opps pressure and hope they'll do something wrong|pg||
nt|lorderic: i agree with you Jason|pg||
nt|lorderic: 3@H should be stone cold here|pg||
nt|wkc:  anyway, we're in 3@H now so the declarer doesn't need to take the risk|pg||
nt|wkc:  ty Eric!|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|wkc:  West duck the @D try to get more information from his pn|pg||
nt|wkc:  and I think the declarer would duck another @D now|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dJ|pc|s4|pc|d5|pg||
nt|lorderic: when you play forcing 1NT, 3@D should be 5 cards since pd sometimes has only 3 (like this board)|pg||
nt|wkc:  another trumps would put the contract in danger|pg||
nt|lorderic: now the contract is in danger|pg||
nt|vugraphzyk: east asked a one minute stop for his running nose|pg||
nt|lorderic: E does not want to give up a trick on returning trump|pg||
pc|h2|nt|wkc:  EW need to find a @S shift, now or after winning the first @C|pg||
nt|lorderic: he can't tell that his partner has @D9|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|nt|wkc:  well done|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|eieio: Welcome to the last segment of NTU cup|pg||
nt|eieio: This segment is play-off for the 3rd place|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|wkc:  well...|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h7|pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||
pc|dT|pc|c7|pc|c2|nt|wkc:  ok maybe I miss some idea here =(|pg||
nt|lorderic: W tries to maximize her chance by playing @H 2-2 first|pg||
nt|wkc:  and now she's trying for dropping N's @CAQ or AJ|pg||
nt|wkc:  however, if she knows that N has 5-5 in both @S and @D|pg||
nt|eieio: In the other game for champion, one team is up for 80 IMPs with only 12 boards to go|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|d3|pc|cT|mc|9|nt|wkc:  S will be marked with the @CA(otherwise, why N didn't use michaels)|pg||
pg||

nt|bypeng:  Hello lord.|pg||
nt|lorderic: hi BY|pg||
nt|bypeng:  And hello everyone. :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: N's bidding still somehow influence her play|pg||
nt|wkc:  hello bypeng|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|wkc:  4M makes for NS: the declarer have 4@H+5@S+1m|pg||
nt|lorderic: NS can make 4@H but hard to get there|pg||
mb|2H|nt|wkc:  BTU got 6 from the first board: NS decided to defend 2@S instead of playing 3@C in other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|wkc:  if N join the auction now, they might have a chance|pg||
mb|2S|nt|wkc:  for those who just come in, this is the quarterfinal of the 19th NTU Cup, which take place in Taiwan|pg||
nt|vugraphzyk: that SQ may worth 10 imps, make or -3|pg||
mb|p|nt|wkc:  we'll have a two-half, 12 boards per half match in the quarterfinal|pg||
nt|vugraphzyk: 2-way|pg||
nt|wkc:  but it's not easy to get there and they probably would get to a much easier 3NT|pg||
nt|bypeng:  !!??|pg||
nt|eieio: NS have a decent 4@H here|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|wkc:  3NT is too agressive for me...|pg||
nt|lorderic: I'm not sure with the 2NT opening range here|pg||
nt|vugraphzyk: their 2NT is 22-23|pg||
nt|lorderic: they decide to play in a low contract|pg||
nt|eieio: 6@H is possible too|pg||
nt|eieio: They can make 6@H even on a heart lead, given 3-3 spade break|pg||
nt|eieio: North should try 3@H with Qx|pg||
nt|eieio: Better than rebidding his broken 6-card suit|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lorderic: thanks Stanley|pg||
nt|wkc:  I don't know what's the meaning of 3@S|pg||
nt|wkc:  so it's a common difficulty when play green card: the jump in other suit use to many spaces|pg||
nt|lorderic: for a passed hand I would bid unusual 1NT with N hand after 1C-P-1S|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzyk: south is thinking|pg||
nt|wkc:  and please make sure you have an agreement with your pn :)|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|vugraphzyk: i think bidding 2H is bold|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|wkc:  @S8 shows no high card, so N knows that it's better to duck his K|pg||
nt|vugraphzyk: north choose to pass|pg||
nt|eieio: 3NT can be made with pure strength|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lorderic: then S would definitely compete with @Hs|pg||
nt|bypeng:  I want to see they climb to 4@S originally. :P|pg||
nt|wkc:  we have some conservative player here, just like me :)|pg||
nt|lorderic: :)|pg||
nt|bypeng:  :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|wkc:  3NT is not even a chance if W is clear enough to duck two round of @D|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lorderic: the only hope for declarer is probably W holds @DAx|pg||
nt|lorderic: even that only 8 tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|lorderic: need a ninth on, perhaps @H finesse|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|wkc:  or club K onside|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h9|pg||
mc|12|nt|lorderic: on board  13, the other table cannot manage to make 4@S|pg||
pg||

nt|lorderic: a partscore here|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|vugraphzyk: south make that 2H with only 6 thump cards|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|lorderic: board  14 in open room W managed to make 1NT, 4 IMPs to BTU-96|pg||
nt|lorderic: after 1@H-P-2@H; E might take a risk to overcall 2@S|pg||
mb|2N|nt|vugraphzyk: 5S will make with 2 odd queen are all onside|pg||
nt|lorderic: ... and is ahead by 9.5IMP now|pg||
nt|wkc:  here it comes|pg||
mb|p|nt|wkc:  usually this bidding suggest that the declarer has some clubs(since he don't have major, and he couldn't support his pn's @D)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|wkc:  a normal 3@S|pg||
nt|shuan: not an easy contract for EW|pg||
nt|wkc:  so it's better not to touch @C for the first lead|pg||
nt|wkc:  and looks like it would buy the contract|pg||
nt|lorderic: it's risky since it might get double for a lot. but usually it has better outcome like this|pg||
nt|cc469: .|pg||
mb|p|nt|wkc:  and heading to one off or even more if the defender find @H ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|wkc:  yep, 2@D+1@S and few @H|pg||
mb|p|pc|s3|nt|lorderic: sorry, I mean W cannot make 1NT at the other table on board  14|pg||
nt|lorderic: here NS make another aggressive bidding to 3NT|pg||
nt|wkc:  6@H+1@S+1@C, so the declarer doesn't have his 9th tricks before the defender sets up their @C|pg||
nt|lorderic: I suspect what 2@D shows here?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyk: 2D is 16+ or long H|pg||
nt|lorderic: for E the most likely lead is a @D|pg||
nt|wkc:  however, the defender would have some pressure when the declarer cashes his long @H|pg||
nt|bypeng:  East must play in a strict way now.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|wkc:  nicely done!|pg||
nt|lorderic: however E knows S should have some length in @D|pg||
nt|lorderic: then A98xx is not a good 5-card suit to lead anymore|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphzyk: with 5 side card loser and trump A, this sacrifice would pay 800|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|vugraphzyk: the fourth round club can go on the table, so the deal can be make|pg||
pc|sT|nt|wkc:  so the declarer have something to do here|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lorderic: the 3@H bid is questionable. E didn't open 1@S or 2@S suggests he has a hand like this|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s5|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bypeng:  lacking of entries make problems.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|wkc:  they probably find the @C ruff instead, well done|pg||
nt|vugraphzyk: the spade seems not friendly for Kuo|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|wkc:  but she successed to higher her chance to get a plus score|pg||
nt|bypeng:  But fortunately (for east) N is with @H@CKx|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
nt|wkc:  looks like one off unless NS misdefend|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c7|pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
nt|wkc:  now comes the pressure|pg||
pc|cT|nt|wkc:  S leads a low @H in case that N don't have @HT and may have some misunderstanding|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|lorderic: declarer cashes all his top tricks and hope some miracle happenes|pg||
nt|wkc:  But W knows that if the declarer has @SK or @DA|pg||
nt|wkc:  3NT is always home|pg||
pc|c5|mc|9|nt|vugraphzyk: claim that if HK on, make|pg||

mb|p|nt|wkc:  even 5@H could make since @H is 2-2|pg||

mb|2N!|an|jacoby|nt|wkc:  2@S is Jacoby|pg||
nt|wkc:  shows 4+card @H, GF|pg||
nt|wkc:  so what I would do is cash the top @S in hand instead of @SA|pg||
nt|wkc:  the EW reaches an unplayable 3NT on board 3 in the other room, so another 3 IMPs to Jecization|pg||
mb|p|nt|wkc:  2NT is short in @S|pg||
nt|wkc:  if not 22, then draw the third round, cash @HJ, throw away the @D, and try the @C finesse|pg||
mb|3N|nt|wkc:  and still down one|pg||
mb|p|nt|bypeng:  The other table set 4@S for 2 tricks in board 14. 11 IMPs to 96.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|wkc:  3@C is control in @C|pg||
nt|vugraphzyk: Sun may think about shooting|pg||
nt|vugraphzyk: for only 6 hand left |pg||
nt|cc469: I think good intermediates in N hand warrants a 1NT bid rather than pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|wkc:  the double suggest penalty rather than t/o, so S is better to pass|pg||
nt|lorderic: while W did not overcall after 1@D, game is not in consideration from E|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|wkc:  3@S shows min|pg||
nt|wkc:  this will be another gain for the Jecization|pg||
pc|h7|nt|wkc:  NS wins 11 from their 3NT in board 17|pg||
nt|vugraphzyk: i think with about 30 imp behind for BTU-97, bid more aggresive is not a bad choice for this match|pg||
pc|h2|nt|wkc:  and now 96 is ahead by 4.5 IMPs!|pg||
nt|lorderic: 2@C is drury I suppose|pg||
nt|lorderic: and finally NS stays in partial|pg||
pc|hT|nt|wkc:  3NT shows @S control, usually with some EXTRA value(well I don't get it...)|pg||
nt|wkc:  dangerous 3NT|pg||
nt|lorderic: however W has some extras and decided to big game|pg||
nt|bypeng:  Clearly still a consideration from W.|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|wkc:  4@D means control in @D and 4@H says "okay, lets play"|pg||
nt|wkc:  I will bid 4@H after 3@S with N hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzyk: west ask 3c and think a while|pg||
nt|lorderic: they probably find out that they're ahead and don't need take aggressive moves|pg||
pc|sA|nt|wkc:  after S shows short in @S, he don't really have the power for the slam|pg||
nt|cc469: can make it with finessing N for Q and 10|pg||
pc|s8|pg||

pc|d7|nt|wkc:  and when they split 3-2 :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lorderic: actually never made, N can duck the first @C and cover on the second one|pg||
nt|cc469: right|pg||
nt|cc469: but if he covers the first one ...|pg||
nt|bypeng:  Then 3NT is home.|pg||
nt|lorderic: still W have to finesse the second round|pg||
nt|lorderic: instead of playing @C 3-2|pg||
nt|cc469: providing declarer guesses to play for 4-1 clubs with N and not 3-2|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|lorderic: W needs 6 tricks in @C to make 3NT|pg||
nt|cc469: a well earned result if he guesses the @Cs correctly here|pg||

nt|wkc:  some people would lead a @H, and I'm one of them|pg||
nt|lorderic: and they finally settle in the best trump|pg||
pc|s4|nt|wkc:  the reason is that you know the @S split is not friendly for the declarer, so you want to shorten his trump length|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lorderic: this should be another 10 IMPs to BTU-96|pg||
pc|s7|pg||

nt|wkc:  lets see if they could get there|pg||
nt|wkc:  2@C stayman, 2@H shows 4 card|pg||
nt|wkc:  and 3@S shows @H fit ST|pg||
nt|lorderic: 1NT- bad stopper, 2D- not a great suit, how about double?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cc469: double|pg||
pc|d9|nt|wkc:  4@C control in @C|pg||
nt|wkc:  and I would bid 4NT(control in @S) if they play kickback (using 4@S for Key card asking)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|wkc:  and 4@H is interesting when you know somebody would like to give you a red card|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|vugraphzyk: 3D is a solid deal, if north play diamond right, it will over one|pg||
nt|bypeng:  Seems the network problem is getting worse.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|wkc:  but looks they don't play kickback, so 4NT RKCB, 5@S shows 2 w/ @HQ|pg||
nt|lorderic: yes, double is slight better than 2@D in my opinion|pg||
pc|h8|nt|wkc:  thinking about 7?|pg||
nt|wkc:  but maybe only one off?|pg||
nt|lorderic: not surprisingly, 9 IMPs to BTU-96 on board 20 and they are 15.5 ahead|pg||
nt|lorderic: i think the only way to get -2 is to underlead a @S :P|pg||
nt|lorderic: ... on the first lead|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
pc|cK|nt|wkc:  5NT: we got all the keycards, any other power|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|pc|c2|pg||
nt|wkc:  6@D: yes @DK|pg||
nt|wkc:  then you'll probably see that table has Qxx instead of Jxx|pg||
pc|d2|nt|wkc:  6@H: great, so let's play 6@H....|pg||
nt|wkc:  I think he want to see 6@C|pg||
nt|wkc:  ,which shows @CK|pg||
nt|wkc:  and then he could bid 6@D to ask if pn has @DK|pg||
nt|wkc:  i.e. he is trying to figure out if S have xx Qxxx AKxx  AKx|pg||
nt|wkc:  but even so, S could have 3 card @S, and then it won't be a good Grand Slam|pg||
nt|wkc:  so I would probably bid 6@H after 5@S|pg||
pc|d8|nt|wkc:  and pn is looking at you, saying"what r u doing" in his mind|pg||
nt|bypeng:  West will not be so happy when he find the trump Ace is a singleton.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|fabsayc: very difficult to bid slam, near perfect fit|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|cQ|pc|hT|pg||
nt|wkc:  so one off, +100 is not a bad one for Cold Light compare board 17 and 20|pg||
pc|c4|nt|cc469: also sometimes if you double, S might bid 1NT|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||
nt|vugraphzyk: sorry misclick|pg||

nt|lorderic: NS can get 2 more @C and @S for down 1 ... before she shifts to @CQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzyj: guess @D 9 encouraged @C|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|pg||
nt|wkc:  that's right but still shift to @H cost nothing, in fact|pg||
nt|lorderic: well even she shift to @C9, E might misguess|pg||
nt|lorderic: but @CQ pays|pg||
pc|s5|mc|7|pg||

nt|wkc:  wow|pg||
nt|lorderic: more partscore coming|pg||
nt|vugraphzyk: yes, but north was squeeze by west |pg||
nt|vugraphzyk: so the deal is claim make|pg||
mb|p|nt|wkc:  looks like the three days event exhausts the player|pg||
nt|bypeng:  It's happy to see most of the results are reconstructed, though the bidding and the playing are gone.|pg||
mb|p|nt|wkc:  maybe it's right for their current situation :P|pg||
mb|p|nt|wkc:  in other table, S open 1@D and EW reaches 2@S for one off |pg||
mb|1S|nt|lorderic: here comes an unpredictable one. NS is open room reached 5@Dx and made|pg||
nt|lorderic: should be a good score to Cold Light|pg||
nt|wkc:  the second double shows "pn, I have hearts"|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzyk: that 3C shows 5-5 minor suit|pg||
nt|lorderic: i suppose in their agreement 3@C is not a game-forcing jump shift|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|lorderic: thanks Stanley|pg||
mb|p|nt|wkc:  X is negative, shows 44 in Majors, and 3@H is an invitation|pg||
mb|2C|nt|wkc:  5@C?|pg||
mb|p|nt|wkc:  we'll probably see 5@DX again|pg||
nt|lorderic: indeed|pg||
mb|2S|nt|wkc:  and N goes to game even he has @CQJ and short in his pn's suit|pg||
nt|bypeng:  Seems 2@S also|pg||
mb|p|nt|wkc:  I would be more happy to bid 4@H if I have QJ in @D and short in @C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2d by north was a better bid|pg||
nt|wkc:  and maybe 5@DX= again|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: if E pass "forcing", EW might get to 5@S|pg||
nt|wkc:  double shows a good @C support (I suppose)|pg||
nt|lorderic: W can try a double for blood|pg||
nt|wkc:  trying to come back?|pg||
mb|p|nt|wkc:  last two boards here|pg||
nt|lorderic: 5@S only -1 is a great safe|pg||
nt|lorderic: trying to wim more :)|pg||
nt|lorderic: *win|pg||
pc|h7|nt|vugraphzyk: south suggests his partner not to bid 4h with this kind of hand next time|pg||
nt|wkc:  a safe with 24 points|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|wkc:  and I expect a quick claim here|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lorderic: I would recommand a double for blood in matchpoints but not in IMPs|pg||
nt|wkc:  if the declarer could get a @H trick, then maybe 2@S is making|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|lorderic: actually -2 on a @H lead, but still a good save|pg||
pc|hA|nt|wkc:  nice suggestion!|pg||
nt|wkc:  W is surely not satisfied with the only one off in the last board|pg||
pc|h3|nt|wkc:  and so with W hands, I probably would bid 2NT to show my @S stopper|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h8|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|wkc:  @DA, @D ruff, @HK|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|wkc:  and @CQ|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lorderic: for everyone who is new here, this is a collegiate event hold in Taiwan|pg||
pc|s9|nt|bypeng:  @D discard for east will continue|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h2|pg||
nt|lorderic: the official website is here... https://sites.google.com/site/ntucup2012/home|pg||
nt|cc469: I think 3@H by W not unreasonable|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|s2|nt|wkc:  if E ruff it again, 4@H is home|pg||
nt|lorderic: actually it makes easily on this specific layout|pg||

nt|vugraphzyj: Declarer claimed to clear trumps, and that leads to 1 off|pg||
nt|lorderic: how about @CA and a @C? :P|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D!|an|0+!D 11-15|nt|vugraphzyj: NS here play modified precision|pg||
nt|vugraphzyj: EW I mean|pg||

mb|d|nt|lorderic: NS has a thin 4@S here|pg||

nt|wkc:  but looks like E don't think so|pg||
nt|lorderic: Last board for the semi-final|pg||
nt|lorderic: Cold Light took 6 on board  22 and they need 10 in this board|pg||
nt|lorderic: which seems quite impossible to me|pg||
nt|wkc:  Here comes the last board for the first segment|pg||
nt|wkc:  and Jecization is still perfect now|pg||
nt|bypeng:  It's the last board for this tournament now.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|wkc:  anyway, we're in the last board of first half|pg||
mb|p|nt|wkc:  yep|pg||
nt|wkc:  however, this hand may stop their perfect record while NS have a cold @S slam and the other room miss it|pg||
nt|wkc:  5@H is a good bid, if you always want to bid 5@H when S comes with 4@S, why not bid now|pg||
nt|lorderic: but I think it's not difficult to spot all high cards after W opened 1NT last hand|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|wkc:  but it would help NS to reach the slam: I would bid 5@S even 6@S with S hand|pg||
nt|wkc:  double looks weird to me when you know you have 9@S and opps have more than 10@H|pg||
nt|lorderic: ...and not leading either @HA or @HK|pg||
nt|lorderic: we hope to see you all back :)|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|wkc:  here comes the aggressive bidding by E|pg||
nt|lorderic: the final schedules at 10:30 CST, which should be 8 minutes later|pg||
nt|lorderic: It might start late due to the delay|pg||
nt|lorderic: we hope to see you guys back in about 15 minutes|pg||
nt|lorderic: last board for this segment!|pg||
mb|p|nt|wkc:  another aggressive preempt|pg||
mb|d|nt|lorderic: final will be three 12-board matches|pg||
nt|wkc:  I mean, double would only collect few hundred when you might have a cold 5@S even 6@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: presumbaly 2@H invite because of range of jump response of 2@H over 1@D|pg||
nt|lorderic: thanks a lot to Stanley - the wonderful operator!|pg||
mb|3H|nt|bypeng:  NS have 4@S because of two stiff queens. I you want IMPs, maybe it'sa choice for south to invite. But not necessary.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|wkc:  that's it, the declarer could afford 5 off :P|pg||
nt|lorderic: NS reaches 4@S here, either they make it or not BTU-96 is advanced for sure|pg||
nt|wkc:  now the contract depends on not only the @C split but also @CQ|pg||
nt|lorderic: thanks Jason and Carl|pg||
nt|cc469: too timid by N imo|pg||
nt|lorderic: the last segment will start at 14:50 local time. i.e. 15 minutes later|pg||
nt|wkc:  it's interesting to stop at 3@S while the other room compete to 5@S|pg||
nt|cc469: thanks for having me :)|pg||
nt|wkc:  much much reasonable right now|pg||
mb|p|nt|eieio: It's a well-played set by both teams|pg||
nt|eieio: They are all college students|pg||
nt|lorderic: I agree. NS play solid (and aggressively) on this table|pg||
pc|h5|nt|wkc:  N knows S don't have much point because he didn't overcall after 1N|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|nt|cc469: ok , not too timid it seems|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c3|nt|wkc:  and W is in trouble now|pg||
pc|c2|nt|eieio: They probably have solid partnership|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|bypeng:  See if East can estab. @C tricks and make right guess on @D|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|lorderic: games in bd 17 and  20 decides this match|pg||
nt|eieio: @CQ is falling onside, so the contract should be probably makeing 5|pg||
nt|eieio: South can sure simply draw trump and claim 4|pg||
nt|eieio:  17 East failed to complete his M-U-D carding|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|wkc:  another 13 to jecization; 96 would be glad there is still 24 boards to go|pg||
nt|wkc:  anyway thank you all for join the party, I'll see you after one-hour break :)|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|h7|pc|c9|pg||

nt|wkc:  thx all and see you after a short break|pg||
nt|lorderic: we hope to see you guys soon!|pg||

pc|c5|pc|cJ|pc|hJ|pc|cT|pg||
nt|wkc:  500 now|pg||
pc|s4|nt|wkc:  another two or three @C loser|pg||

pc|s2|pc|hQ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|cA|pg||
nt|wkc:  I think it would be three|pg||
pc|sT|pc|hK|nt|wkc:  so one off|pg||
nt|bypeng:  There are still 2 boards left in the open. So still welcome to go to the open room to see if Cold Light gets the 3rd place, or some surprise|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s6|pg||
pc|c8|nt|wkc:  @HJ|pg||
