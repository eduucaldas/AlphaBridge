nt|eamongall: anyway a good result for Ireland |pg||
nt|eamongall: but still to be played in Open Room |pg||
nt|ady: part score   spades or no-trump for England|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Wales are gaining on 9 as England are going down 1 in 4@s doubled|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1D|nt|yorkbeach:  gaining 9 on 9|pg||
mb|1N|nt|clinch: On the other hand they did bid the 4@s missed by Scotland earlier|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ady: part score in spades for e/w|pg||
nt|ady: may get too high|pg||
mb|3N|nt|yorkbeach:  1NT is 14-16. |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|timb: I'm getting old because I'm not a fan |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South might not make a try even facing 15-17 with his 4333 shape|pg||
nt|ady: the Crouch 1 spade bid in this room put paid to that|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: 1N may have 5cM or 6cm|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|nt|timb: of that negative double by North; Ugggggggggggggggggh|pg||
pc|d2|nt|clinch: 4@d is the limit here, and will quickly be made|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|ady: north a little busy there  with a hand that may not respond to an opening|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|c9|nt|ady: Robson a little unfortunate to find so much in hearts opposite   and diamond finesse wrong|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|ady: that apart  the spades are far from solis    might often lose 2 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: solid|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cQ|nt|eamongall: Wales won a @D/@C partscore battle on board 10 for 6 imps |pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|clinch: Crouch's semi-psychic opening may have kept EW low|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|nt|emre kaya: 150 yaparsa EW e iyi yapamazsa Ns a|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|timb: I think East would always make a strong raise in spades (2NT) and most would then bid 4@S with the West cards without bidding 3@D (following the great SJ Simon's advice of bashing ...|pg||
nt|timb: games)|pg||
nt|ady: yes    action was reasonable|pg||
nt|timb: Now Andrew R has to guess the trumps for down one|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: Robson asking S if they play 15-17 NT...and about lead styles|pg||
nt|ady: Q@S  instead of KQ@H   and 4 spades is on diamond finesse through the opening bid|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|emre kaya: 3 kör yapar çünkü Ew|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  for the final 3 boards we have a comparison|pg||
nt|ady: good result for England   4@H -1 in OR|pg||
mb|5D!|nt|yorkbeach:  4@s looks good for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|emre kaya: e biraz|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S appears to make|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: Looks as though 3@s might have made, so good judgment all round|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: so 1@d here is limited and denies a 4cM, may not necessarily have @d|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  NS did not get in the bidding in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: We have comparisons for the last three boards, and 4@h one down looks likely to be duplicated here|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ady: solid 6@H here    diamond finesse for 13 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: 2@d here confirming a @d suit|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|timb: I like to play that the double of 2-level artificial pre-empts promises 15+p|pg||
nt|clinch: Will need to avoid a @c lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: looks like 15/16 both strong results for eng though|pg||
pc|sA|nt|timb: It's not optimal for every situation but it seems reduces our sides guesses|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: nice bid by Derek there|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|hA|nt|nurkumkale: :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|VUGRAPHZVH: sry|pg||
nt|ady: I am a little lost here|pg||
nt|ady: was Robson's suit known|pg||
nt|timb: I'm told that the double was takeout of spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: that's a good question|pg||
nt|clinch: No peeking!|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: oh apologies, is that poor form|pg||
pc|h2|nt|nurkumkale: 1@h =4+ @s demek 2@s 4lü @s demek|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|s9|nt|emre kaya: haha operator kafadan sallýyomus deklerasyonu:)|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d4|nt|clinch: Having looked at it, It may be possible to make 4@h if the diamond position is judged|pg||
mc|10|nt|ady: oops    swing for England|pg||

nt|timb: I'm off to bed; thx all|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: indeed|pg||
mb|1H|nt|yorkbeach:  If Eddie describes something as 'nice' it means obvious|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: So here Scotland got optimistic|pg||
nt|clinch: Not unreasonably|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: it had some play. lets see how N/S bid it|pg||
nt|clinch: Will surely start with some kind of forcing spade raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: on a club lead do you need spades 1-1 (or an inspired hook) H 3-3 and the Q@H onside... not too much|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: double partscore there making up for some of it|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|ady: if diamond finesse right 11 imps the other way   25 imps swing|pg||
nt|ady: north might have entered in CR   even so on last hand|pg||
mb|2H|nt|clinch: Don't think hearts need to be 3-3 if trumps are picked up, but they do if not!|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: ah yes, sorry. so its not the worst slam then|pg||
mb|3H|nt|nurkumkale: e-w in sadece soyisimlerini görebiliyoruz|pg||
nt|nurkumkale: Tahmin etmeye çalýþýyorum çoðunda isimlerini:)|pg||
nt|emre kaya: Ew 450 yazarsa hanesine çok iyi olur|pg||
nt|emre kaya: 420 egale skor olur|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: 1@s natural as NS are vul|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: non-vul they play wonderbids|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: double?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|yorkbeach:  at this vulnerability tough for NS to bid 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: would lose 500|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: Patterson hasn't quite got his hand across yet!|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: i guess this will keep them out of slam though|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  we have seen a few successful sacrifices at adverse vulnerability|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  needs to get defenders to break (or return) a @h|pg||
nt|ady: this may cost as 3NT  with bad club split  going down|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  do not what Shields is thionking about at this vulnerability|pg||
mb|p|pc|hK|pc|h2|nt|yorkbeach:  well judged :)|pg||
nt|ady: A@S lead as good as any|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  do not know|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: S joked whether N was thinking of XX|pg||
pc|hT|nt|nurkumkale: Emre sen bilirsin ben Ýstanbul Briççilerine uzak kaldým çok|pg||
nt|emre kaya: batý ibrahim aksoy|pg||
nt|emre kaya: doðu jülide yardýmcý|pg||
nt|eamongall: We note the debutant Heneghan hogging the bidding with his 3 card suit |pg||
nt|eamongall: I played a match with Heneghan as Team mate one time and spent the week wondering how he blew a trick in 4@Hs ... they were 6@Hs-1 against me ... |pg||
nt|copeyj: game down on @C lead though and cant imagine wilkinson leading anything else|pg||
nt|clinch: Yes, and 5@s is a very unlucky contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: fingering a heart.....|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: now the Q@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: asking lots of questions and thinking still|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: crouch says he cant have a shortage, and with that he settles on K@C|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|nurkumkale: teþekkürler|pg||
nt|clinch: Nervy times for Scottish viewers - can open eyes now|pg||
nt|clinch: So will be 3 IMPs to England nonetheless|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|eamongall: including 4 trump tricks despite missing trump ace ... opponents were gone to bar on that hand |pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: oooh, 3@h E here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  north and East are on the same side of the screen|pg||
pc|h8|nt|eamongall: Turned out Heneghan had declared 4@S on a 3-1 fit making 10 |pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|yorkbeach:  so in theory it could have been North who was thinking|pg||
nt|ady: just keep away from hearts  and 500 in the bag|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if declarer can strip the minors before playing a @h to the 9, that will endplay East|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but if he ruffs 2@d in dummy, a ruff and discard will no longer be an option|pg||
nt|ady: may go go for 800  as no quick entry to play a diamond towards the king|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzvu: guess he will play A@H, AK diamond and exit a club?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: on a good day Q@C with E|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|eamongall: this hand will take a while ... wondr how long before McDonagh realises Heneghan Hogged his hand |pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|nt|emre kaya: ataða bakmadýk el normal olarak pik dam çýkýyor 450 hep oluyor|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pg||
nt|ady: next hand last I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: EW play reverse count|pg||
nt|ady: setting up the long heart will keep it toi 500|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|clinch: Especially after much fingering on lead|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  nice to be able to say thanks Rob - we have had a few anonymous operators|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|eamongall: I suppose Heneghan started out planning to ease the opps out of a @S contract |pg||
nt|ady: 5@H   a save against vul 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: south has bid it early|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: director pacing...time trouble|pg||
nt|ady: could be some problems in 4 spades  with heart leads  and a tap   and spades 4-1|pg||
nt|clinch: I think most clubs would see a lot of 510s on the traveller for this one|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: think crouch said 3 card raise but nothing written and i didnt hear properly|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: been put through my paces with the systems this match!|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  restart at 1730 GMT 1030 Eastern 0730 Pacific|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: I thought N/S play this as a FG raise, and 2N wld have been invitational only, but I may be wrong|pg||
nt|clinch: Will see if Patterson-Crouch have the tools|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: yes simon, you may well be right|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: 4@H from Crouch last train now perhaps|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  sorry 1230 Eastern 0930 Pacific|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: Thanks Simon|pg||
nt|clinch: Indeed|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: CopeyJ on fire|pg||
nt|copeyj: wonder if Patterson will try 5@H|pg||
nt|copeyj: he has done a lot of bidding - but limited and 6-5|pg||
nt|clinch: Well, he must be tempted to go on|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|nt|copeyj: I am also of the opinion they play 4@D as shortage|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  on 11 England bought the contract in 2@d|pg||
nt|ady: 140 a good score for Wales OR|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ady: 5 spades almost certain to go of|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|clinch: yes|pg||
nt|clinch: well done|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|ady: east taking the plus|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South had already shown his 3-card @h support with a support XX and so did not feel the need to compete with 2@h|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ady: in fact 4 spades down 2 in OR   so a good dwing around 11 for England|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: claiming 2 off early to save time|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c2|nt|dkkello:  Somebody fooled everybody  |pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|golfsquash: I believe 2@c is GF, even tho' the convention card doesn't say so|pg||
nt|golfsquash: 4@c was RKC 1430|pg||
nt|clinch: The first double game swing on 17 came to pass for Scotland - 17 and 18 won't go their way, though|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  NS judged well to avoid 3NT|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  contract is makeable but declarer will need to reject @d finesse|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  endplay might not work if diamonds were 2-2 but in that case taking the trump finesse does not help anyway|pg||
nt|copeyj: I think he can make this - He expects E to be 5-5-2-1 now after the auction and lead|pg||
nt|copeyj: so he wins this @C|pg||
nt|copeyj: A@S ruff a @S|pg||
nt|copeyj: Q@D to the A and ruff a @S|pg||
nt|copeyj: now exit with a diamond|pg||
pc|c4|nt|dburn: this suit may not do so badly - he can make at least nine tricks, maybe more|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c7|nt|r_prah: 5@C has a good shot, if declarer takes the diamond finesse|pg||
nt|nilsland:  This will not go ligthly|pg||
nt|nilsland:  looks like 3 down if spade lead|pg||
nt|dkkello:  the famous iclandic "geyser" convention , did it again  |pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|nilsland:  I think 3 @H was not nescessary - if you have 0 points you dont to be in a game unless partner invites|pg||

nt|vugraphzvt: was Forrester's X similarly penalty-seeking?|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  19 was flat with 3@s made by NS at both tables|pg||

mb|1D|nt|emre kaya: 6 karo bulmak ve yapmak zor|pg||
nt|golfsquash: 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: 1@D negative I guess|pg||
nt|clinch: Does any game make?|pg||
nt|copeyj: 1N = F1. 2@C = @D or balanced|pg||
nt|copeyj: (if and when it comes)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|vugraphzvu: must remember the passes!|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  1NT was forcing|pg||
nt|r_prah: Baldursson, Jonsson and Jorgensen are veterans of the game; Einarsson is an extremely talented young player|pg||
nt|nilsland:  2 @H shows 11-13 and 6 @H|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - East needs two ruffs in dummy, and on this layout he probably can't get them|pg||
nt|dburn: unless there is some sort of pressure in the minors on North|pg||
nt|dburn: which I suppose there might well be|pg||
nt|nilsland:  S may be tempted to start with a @H honour to - look at dummy |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: e/w   may get to 3NT     may come close on J@D lead   |pg||
nt|marlowepi: or ten of spades|pg||
mb|2D|nt|roswolf: should get to 4@S easily enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  2@c was presumably showing @d |pg||
nt|nilsland:  but perhaps EW will not find 4 @S|pg||
nt|dburn: or anything at all - Brekka might have backed in at his last turn|pg||
mb|p|nt|VUGRAPHZVH: 7 karo kabak|pg||
nt|emre kaya: tabi 4 el açýk kabak|pg||
nt|copeyj: Forrester has now shown roughly 5-1-4-3 with extras|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if so South has shown his pattern|pg||
nt|nilsland:  4 @S looks reasonable and will probably make|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 10@S    even better chance|pg||
nt|clinch: Yes, will be interesting|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|roswolf: with the heart finesse right declarer should be ok but is tested at T1|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Must confess I would bid 3H with the North hand so as to show the clubs later... what do I know?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|r_prah: 3@C should make; as should 3@H. North's reticience may cost him a few IMPs here|pg||
nt|nilsland:  West last pass took some time, maybe East was ethical|pg||
nt|dburn: but maybe West's second pass took a while, and East didn't feel he could move|pg||
pc|sK|nt|clinch: Diamond more likely now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: should come close on any lead, favorite to make on some:)|pg||
nt|clinch: Who knows what Robson's 1Nt was :)|pg||
nt|copeyj: I thk it might be "crash" defence to big @C|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: again, he waved at it, but no idea what it means|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|roswolf: HMM IN TROUBLE NOW|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North has enough in @h to play in 3NT facing the shortage|pg||
nt|copeyj: I would guess Forrester showed approx 16+ here|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|emre kaya: þimdi 4 pik tehlikede uzundan kýsaldý|pg||
nt|kemperg: 2NT forcing, but W might have pased|pg||
pc|h5|nt|golfsquash: 6@d was playable here|pg||
nt|dburn: and now in stereo :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|clinch: Yes, several suggests it shows  pointed or rounded 2-suiter|pg||
nt|copeyj: seems likely|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: robson says 1nt showed a major and a minor|pg||
nt|clinch: Thanks Basil|pg||
nt|ady: close to making if ace and king of clubs would stand up|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1N has the upside of making it a bit harder for EW to get together in spades, but with a strong club on one's left there is less likelihood foe will be seriously discomfited. ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: meanwhile it might well help the eventual declarer.  after all, if robson were to pass on this S hand at these colors, who would ever play him for this hand:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: wilkinson still thinking|pg||
nt|clinch: After opening his 1 count on 19, who can blame him for entering with this monster?|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|roswolf: on bd 20 the endglish n/s conceded -1100 in a very dubious auction - 15 big imps back|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: wilkinson states that they could be in a 3-0 fit and hes not sure on the auction|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer can see only 5 top tricks and a shortage of entries to hand|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|nt|marlowepi: the real upside of 1N with the S hand comes when W is strong and balanced while EW have a 44 spade fit, and N can do something dynamic over the pass (or NT bid) by W|pg||
pc|dA|nt|emre kaya: karoyu bulamazsa battý|pg||

nt|ady: respectable pr-empt|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  where is the Earl of Yarborough whe you need him? :)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|nilsland:  There is a rule to avoid preempts with 3-card major - here 2 @H preempted EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: 6@d is possibly 1 down, even on a nontrump lead, ducking the first spade creates problems.|pg||
nt|dburn: 4@c clubs and a major, I imagine|pg||
nt|dburn: good decision by Male for my money to pre-empt in diamonds, not bid 1@h (or pass)|pg||
nt|roswolf: non-leaping michaels|pg||
nt|clinch: Yes, he doesn't bid on any old rubbish, you know! :)|pg||

nt|dburn: but McGinley might wallop this in a sense of outrage|pg||

nt|nilsland:  Now EW missed another game, W could have bid more than 2 @S|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ady: defence will need to take care to get their diamond trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: he did roll his eyes somewhat when he picked it up|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  10 or 11 depending upon whether the @hQ scores|pg||
nt|dkkello:  so N-S are playing transfer  on the 1 level |pg||
pc|s9|pc|h3|nt|dburn: that @cQ was likely to be a defensive value, even if he couldn't cash any diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn: the test you should apply is: will this contract go two down more often than it will make?|pg||
nt|roswolf: in my club an 18 count with KQx of trumps behind the bidder is an automatic double|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: Crouch decides to open a packet of Boubon biscuits....not passing them round though|pg||
nt|dburn: if so, the IMP odds favour doubling it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E should play a low heart from hand ASAP to test S|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Return of the @HJ is suit preference for clubs|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Nick Smith coined the term Barbara for a hand with no card higher than a 5|pg||
nt|kemperg: @D not good|pg||
pc|sA|nt|yorkbeach:  anyone got a term for a hand with no card higher than an eight?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: what about only one card higher than a 4? :P|pg||
nt|r_prah: West needs to play clubs now to restrict declarer to 7 tricks. When East gets in with the @HA, he will have a long club to cash|pg||

nt|nilsland:  EW can make 3 NT but will they find it?|pg||
nt|dburn: 1@h probably spades - the French do not go in for psyching much|pg||
mb|2D|nt|nilsland:  I prefer bidding 2 @H with wests hand|pg||
nt|dburn: gives West a chance to show something without bidding at the two level - might bid 2@h anyway, but double seems OK|pg||
nt|dburn: now, East may be wondering whether he can ue 2@s or whether that ought to be natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: indeed a pass missed out perhaps?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|roswolf: depending on how high they get the 4-0 trump break may hurt them|pg||
nt|dburn: well, the trump break appears to be 5-4 at the moment, since East-West are bidding diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: last board might have been opened and e/w would make up to 10 tricks in spade partscore|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  they have played 7, so will need to play the reamining 9 a bit faster|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  players did not need to discuss terms for an 8-high hand :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  there are time penalties for finishing late|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: at any rate, this lead may assist declarer, but he still has plenty to do|pg||
nt|dburn: when North rebid diamonds, East felt it unlikely his opponents could run spades against notrump|pg||
mb|p|pc|s5|nt|marlowepi: came into the world that way|pg||
nt|ady: defence can take 3 hearts  1 club   and at least 1 sspade|pg||
