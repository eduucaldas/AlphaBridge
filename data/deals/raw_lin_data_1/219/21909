mb|p|nt|wkc:  and 4@H is interesting when you know somebody would like to give you a red card|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|vugraphzyk: 3D is a solid deal, if north play diamond right, it will over one|pg||

nt|lorderic: not surprisingly, 9 IMPs to BTU-96 on board 20 and they are 15.5 ahead|pg||

nt|wkc:  I think he want to see 6@C|pg||
nt|wkc:  ,which shows @CK|pg||
nt|wkc:  and then he could bid 6@D to ask if pn has @DK|pg||
nt|wkc:  i.e. he is trying to figure out if S have xx Qxxx AKxx  AKx|pg||
nt|wkc:  but even so, S could have 3 card @S, and then it won't be a good Grand Slam|pg||
nt|wkc:  so I would probably bid 6@H after 5@S|pg||
