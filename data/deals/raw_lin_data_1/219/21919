pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||
nt|andyv:  a @s lead would probably have been better as E wouldn't be able to pull all the trump before he knocked out the A of @c|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Do we have Jacobs - Thompson   N-S   Dave?|pg||
nt|eamongall: Every event has new operators and after a few rounds they become experienced and learn stuff |pg||
nt|mrdct: but as it happens a low trump was going to work better as east is forced to rise Q and then doesn't have the tempo to take his trick|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk2: EW rather|pg||

nt|andyv:  that's where they were saturday:)|pg||
nt|mrdct: pages 3&4 for bill & ben|pg||
nt|mrdct: so in the EW methods all one-level openings are frocing for one round|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed,    N-S are    Stamatov - Karianov|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They play Precision|pg||
nt|mrdct: so about 14+hcp|pg||
nt|sybarra: how did we not make 6 @C?|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh I see,  the @D ruff :( unlucky |pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if Yeh partnerships are playing standard or some Precision pairs|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: good start for FT|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Walddk2: all Bulgarian top pairs do|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|nt|ahollan1: and NS   akama-maruyama  [not sure who's where]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=game force   a bunch of hand types  in this case  balanced  [no singleton or void]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my dream is that someday  BBO will work on software for operator and there will be functionality to just INSERT PASS  instead of having to do all of those UNDOs|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: EW in OR is team leader of FT.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: They use Blue club oriented system.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: 2@s is 10-13 5+ @s|pg||
nt|mrdct: so east is clear a big max for his bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not 1@C from east|pg||
nt|ahollan1: P-1@C-P-  then  1@H=4+@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ew do NOT play Namyats, so 4@S is wide range|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|mrdct: *clearly|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: NS of this room i know each of them, but pd-ship i don't know|pg||
nt|cc469: 12 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@S RELAY  |pg||
nt|mrdct: btw - i'm going to predict bill jacobs is sitting east as ben thompson is a bit more agressive and would probably open 1@s with the east cards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, Bill is always E and N I noticed|pg||
nt|mrdct: believe it or not i've never noticed that|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Normal ? 2/1, i guess|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mrdct: i think the 1st two matches are up|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: NS in this room are wife(N) & hus(S)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: operator won't be able to lead   so then auction should get fixed|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: 2@C balanced  8-11 or 15+ hcp|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/home////tabid/223/Default.aspx  for tournament website. No results yet I'm afraid. They only update the page once a day if memory serves|pg||
nt|mrdct: poor result for Oz in the open room|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: sry, i have no detail about Chaina Geely Auto members|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mrdct: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/home/English/nec/17th/results/7thFeb/tabid/665/Default.aspx|pg||
nt|Walddk2: thx|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: 2N broke out of relay so East guaranteed declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vP's 1@S [RHO's suit]  showing the 2 unbid suits|pg||
pc|sA|nt|pole_as_ch: They (NS) prefer schenken|pg||
nt|sybarra: hopefully we will get the names of players sorted out shortly |pg||
pc|s4|nt|eamongall: yes first two rounds are up ... and 3rd round was only finished ... |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: if someone teach me |pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D = 4/5@D  not 4@H/@S|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: Andy was referring to the Dutch Premiere League final that was on BBO last weekend|pg||
nt|andyv:  declarer starts with 8 tricks and has 2 4-3 suits to find the 9th, or the @d suit.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mrdct: the problem in the open rooms is with only one @s stopper you need cashing tricks on top which just weren't there|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: EW team won by 1 imp after trailing by a bunch after 4 round|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, they certainly made a quick turnaround to get to this tourney|pg||
nt|kemperg: leader may play for 3@D at siide of 3!@Hs, that wont work|pg||
nt|kemperg: down now, cant finesse twice anymore|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: it's not unreasonable to play 1@S as natural even though RHO has shown 4+  since 1N by passed hand is available to show the 2 unbid|pg||
nt|vugraphzws: Sorry for wrong bits.|pg||
nt|sybarra: tese are left over from last match |pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 17  5@DX East|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mrdct: needs to make this to hold the damage to 5 imps - otherwise it's 8 imps out|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm pretty sure  W=Verhees  E=vProoijen|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: they did that last year too|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Operator, please insert names        North:  Stamatov     South: Danailov       East: Jacobs      West: Thompson|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: and went on to win the NEC Cup|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mrdct: in fact when i last played against them i was south and screenmates with bill, but that may have been because ben didn't want to be screenmates with me|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|andyv:  when you are good, you are good|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h8|pc|hT|nt|sybarra: Website for this event: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/home////tabid/223/Default.aspx|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: curious that South didn't overcall this time|pg||
nt|andyv:  the plus side for declarer is the opps can't really attack any suits themselves|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kemperg: and did:)|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|nt|andyv:  vul maybe?|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: @cA|pg||
nt|sybarra: not the bid E wanted to hear |pg||
nt|ahollan1: East could have used Raptor 1N overcall to show 4@H/@S & 5+@C  but unfavorable vul and passed partner   =  yuk|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i know in Ron Klinger's version of transfers over 1@C   his 1@S=4+@D and has 4-card major ONLY IF game force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but not all pairs use 1@S to guarantee @D|pg||

pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: 1@C  14+ with clubs or 15+ balanced|pg||
nt|mrdct: fairly standard these days to play transfers after one-level intervention|pg||
nt|sybarra: not best lead for defense maybe |pg||
nt|sybarra: but I make these leads all the time :( |pg||
nt|sybarra: this is very prestigious event  sponsored by NEC |pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mrdct: playing preciion in the open room EW never found their @h fit|pg||
nt|mrdct: losing 2@h and a @d here at least|pg||
nt|mrdct: and there's nowhere to put the deep @c loser|pg||
nt|mrdct: so i think this is going to slide one off|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sybarra: we are in the qualifying rounds  leading to semi's then finals over the weekend |pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room at least sniffed at slam, but vanProoijen 3@S left much less room for exploration|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|mrdct: 6@d tricks is a good start for 3NT NS but EW can get to their 5 before NS establish their tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after 9    NEDUK leading with 173   China Geely 2nd with 170|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: does 1N deny 4@S?     probably  otherwise North would probably use some form of checkback|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2-way checkback  or  new minor force?    probably 2-way  so  2@D = artificial game force|pg||
nt|twcho: yes, rather standard precision which is suitable for irregular partnership|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: may now get pushed too high?    can they even beat 4 @S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: checkback was used in other room so Patrick Huang avoided @S lead -- but his choice of @HK wasn't a success either|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in North America the top big club pairs are playing 2@C always 6+@C|pg||
nt|twcho: and NS aren't regular partners|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: then again  playing 2-way checkback  South might bid @C|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: well cannot make. but 2 off ?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sybarra: can N get in to lead club? |pg||
nt|sybarra: just take 4 aces   easier |pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: another possible squeeze -- but this one doesn't work|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mrdct: losing 2@c, 1@h and 1@s so need to get @d right to make|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||
nt|mrdct: predicated on a @c switch by west now which may not be so easy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlikely @D plays|pg||

pc|h6|pc|hA|nt|xenya: still can't make it on a @S return|pg||

mb|p|mb|3S!|nt|ahollan1: 2@S=5+@S|pg||

nt|mrdct: Oz Players here are 2/3 of the runners-up in Australia National Open Teams from a couple of weeks ago|pg||
nt|sybarra: I suspect 5 @h is pass or correct... or the lack of @D was what W was going to bid |pg||
nt|sybarra: just not sure how they play this |pg||
nt|sybarra2: how to find out you have no wasted values in @H's |pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: EW in OR already go to there ! heww!|pg||

mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: 2N relay for distribution|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N=5@S 5@C 1@H|pg||
nt|mrdct: close to mirrored shapes here for NS which is often dangerous, but there's no ruff on for the defence so @SA and @DAK only to lose|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: now east hunting for slam, and may well bid it|pg||
nt|xenya: if they get to slam, they will make it|pg||
mb|5H|nt|sybarra2: (and the k of clubs on side) |pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: beyond the 1@c strong club opening - i have no idea what the rest menas|pg||
nt|ahollan1: especially if you have my short neck|pg||
nt|ahollan1: finding @H -- what fun is that?|pg||
nt|twcho: last bd, north misdefend by continuing his @d and squeezed south on the way|pg||
nt|xenya: and E miight be tempted|pg||
mb|6H|nt|ahollan1: 4@D forces 4@H   |pg||
nt|sybarra2: do you really want to be in this slam?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: probably not but|pg||
nt|sybarra2: ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  you have all the controls ...only a question if you can set up @cs on ruffs|pg||
nt|andyv:  the poor @s spots may determine if they go on |pg||
nt|sybarra2: or smother 10 of @S? |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  you can also try the @d suit |pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@s is 8-10 bal and 3@d asks for a major I'm told|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: he should return a @s to break up the squeeze|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: and then 3@h is a transfer to get the strong hand to play it|pg||
nt|mrdct: thanks specs!|pg||
nt|twcho: Top eight teams will enter the KO stage|pg||
nt|xenya: well...|pg||

pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: 4@D set @S    4@H=avg+ or max  then RKC|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: ummm, they also go !  nice auction! |pg||
pc|h2|nt|fabsayc: this mostly needs two diamonds to survice, then a straight cross ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if @D lead 3rd/5th then unlikely choice of crossruff|pg||
nt|andyv:  if leads are 3-5, W may already know what is going on|pg||
nt|mrdct: obviously with north having already bid @s the transfer benefits are not there - but often you need to stick to your generla structure|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|nt|fabsayc: yes i dont think he will play that way, i was talking in abstract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: double dummy players will  pin north's @S10|pg||

nt|twcho: and closing the gap to 12 imps now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S less than game force|pg||
nt|xenya: that won't be a success|pg||
mb|1C|nt|Walddk4: England 24-6 VPs before this|pg||
nt|mrdct: 6@d is a make here looking at all 4 hands|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@S=4/5-fit|pg||
nt|twcho: why 2@c by north, not 2@d?|pg||
nt|kemperg: no:)|pg||
mb|4D!|mb|p|nt|xenya: looks like 3 off on the surface|pg||
mb|4N|nt|jaapfr: but who would finesse @DQ over S after 3@S opening???|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: not me|pg||
nt|sybarra: everyone getting too high here |pg||
mb|5H|nt|kemperg: last board, thanks to my cocommentator Vladimir and our operator, see you next round in 45 min.|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks Germ, thanks everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: what does that mean after 1@D which is 0+ suit?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i would think other 2 suits|pg||
nt|twcho: I will assume it to be natural|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so must DBL or bid 2N with the other 2?|pg||
nt|twcho: yes, looks natural for me|pg||
nt|xenya: i predict S will bid 6 :)|pg||
mb|6H|nt|ahollan1: interesting Tommy  if 2@D is natural   does 2N show @D & @C or  @H & @C|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: now no entry for dummy ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: followers of Marty Bergen/Eric Rodwell profess    if you don't make immediate raise -- you don't have 4-card fit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  strange way to end the set...a normal auction and EW don't have the @c suit|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jaapfr: even DD i would not dare:)|pg||
nt|xenya: too bad for Yeh Bros -- not their day|pg||
nt|kemperg: yes, the splinter was welcome|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: looks like push|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: then 7 imp is 16-14 vps|pg||
nt|kemperg: @S splinter by S would not bring slam|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mrdct: just in case someone acuses you of having seen the hand record?|pg||
nt|twcho: I will assume the remaining two suits|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kemperg: but that was not possible|pg||
pc|c9|nt|pole_as_ch: oh, wow, papa helped Dec.|pg||
nt|sybarra2: my morning papers (by email) are arriving from London |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Looks like 25-2 VPs and Yeh Bros most likely out of contention for a quarter-final spot|pg||
pc|c2|pg||

nt|sybarra2: hopefully on Rolands doorstep|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for the spectators -- there is no single right answer  bidding over a nebulous 1@D   you must have partnership agreement|pg||
pc|sK|nt|pole_as_ch: Last BD !|pg||
pc|sT|nt|andyv:  so 13 was costly to NS for their lack of action|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and a flat board|pg||
nt|jaapfr: or being an absolute fool|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: thx all specs|pg||
