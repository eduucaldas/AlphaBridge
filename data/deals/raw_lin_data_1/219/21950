mb|4D|an|TRF S|mb|d|nt|andyv:  http://www.jcbl.or.jp/home////tabid/223/Default.aspx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S consistent with Dutch system    when 1@H overcall artificial  1@S=game force balanced hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: we have the ladies agst the women,  not sure difference  age maybe?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: my guess  East is the one who is thinking|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes, worried about getting all his clothes stolen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: going back to reference of Moscito   there are many similarities with Transfer Moscito   both systems developed around the same time|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: y |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 5 imps would add up|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mrdct: based on what's entered for the open room - we have Thompson-Jacobs EW here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: notice he could not afford to duck first club for lack of hand entry|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|eamongall: however I am sure it will get fixed when operator gets a break in the play :) ...its very hard to be a vugraph operator |pg||
nt|ahollan1: can take marked @C finesse later|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: cl !|pg||
pc|c9|nt|cc469: my bad - well done :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|andyv:  a @s lead would probably have been better as E wouldn't be able to pull all the trump before he knocked out the A of @c|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Do we have Jacobs - Thompson   N-S   Dave?|pg||
nt|eamongall: Every event has new operators and after a few rounds they become experienced and learn stuff |pg||
nt|mrdct: but as it happens a low trump was going to work better as east is forced to rise Q and then doesn't have the tempo to take his trick|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: y|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Walddk2: EW rather|pg||
pc|c4|pg||

nt|andyv:  that's where they were saturday:)|pg||

nt|mrdct: so in the EW methods all one-level openings are frocing for one round|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed,    N-S are    Stamatov - Karianov|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They play Precision|pg||
nt|mrdct: so about 14+hcp|pg||
nt|sybarra: how did we not make 6 @C?|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh I see,  the @D ruff :( unlucky |pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if Yeh partnerships are playing standard or some Precision pairs|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: good start for FT|pg||
nt|sybarra: well not if I had a pard who played it this way,....down in the other room |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: and 1 imp to oz|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: oz/nz |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: ok|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so there's a free 5 for ONI|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Down Under is mix of pairs   Newell-Reid  [New Zealand]   Hans-Nunn  [Australia]|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: all Bulgarian top pairs do|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: funny, why 5?  6 !|pg||
mb|1S|nt|pole_as_ch: what contract do u think ?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the lower the better|pg||
mb|4D|nt|ahollan1: and NS   akama-maruyama  [not sure who's where]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=game force   a bunch of hand types  in this case  balanced  [no singleton or void]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my dream is that someday  BBO will work on software for operator and there will be functionality to just INSERT PASS  instead of having to do all of those UNDOs|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: EW in OR is team leader of FT.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: They use Blue club oriented system.|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry, 500 was only possible if West ducked @CK (he played ace) - even then it might be 300|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: fufufufu|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: comes some noise|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: some randon 2 suiter?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: P-1@C-P-  then  1@H=4+@S|pg||

nt|andyv:  declarer starts with 8 tricks and has 2 4-3 suits to find the 9th, or the @d suit.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no carryover from Swiss Qualifying   only 2 of the Quarter-Final matchups did battle in the Swiss   ours is not one of them|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: y|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: good result oz in OR|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mrdct: the problem in the open rooms is with only one @s stopper you need cashing tricks on top which just weren't there|pg||
nt|sybarra: 9, or 10 tricks |pg||
pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: EW team won by 1 imp after trailing by a bunch after 4 round|pg||
nt|sybarra: or 11 |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|andyv:  yes, they certainly made a quick turnaround to get to this tourney|pg||
nt|kemperg: leader may play for 3@D at siide of 3!@Hs, that wont work|pg||
nt|kemperg: down now, cant finesse twice anymore|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it's not unreasonable to play 1@S as natural even though RHO has shown 4+  since 1N by passed hand is available to show the 2 unbid|pg||
nt|vugraphzws: Sorry for wrong bits.|pg||
nt|sybarra: tese are left over from last match |pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 17  5@DX East|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: 1 trick more for defence, where ?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: i cannot find|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: Strong Club 14+ 1/2 seat, 16+ 3/4 seat - from cc|pg||
nt|ahollan1: cute @SQ|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mrdct: needs to make this to hold the damage to 5 imps - otherwise it's 8 imps out|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm pretty sure  W=Verhees  E=vProoijen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room also in 3N   this hand will be more successful than  1|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: they did that last year too|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: @cA|pg||
nt|sybarra: not the bid E wanted to hear |pg||
nt|ahollan1: East could have used Raptor 1N overcall to show 4@H/@S & 5+@C  but unfavorable vul and passed partner   =  yuk|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: and @c lead|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: or @s lead, and @c switch ?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: i know in Ron Klinger's version of transfers over 1@C   his 1@S=4+@D and has 4-card major ONLY IF game force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but not all pairs use 1@S to guarantee @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  this was 3rd seat opener   so  16+|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh, yes, "Color"|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: done !  good lead by newell|pg||

pc|h7|nt|pole_as_ch: England ladiesgain big lead in first 2 BD. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: in other room  Precision 1@C - Sartaj Hans did NOT bid with East   so  1@D[neg]-1N end|pg||
nt|sybarra: 1 shouod be no problem |pg||
nt|sybarra: *1nt should not be a problem |pg||
nt|ahollan1: transportation a problem|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and nothing favorable in @S or @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so 7th trick may need help from defenders|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i bet  EW get 7 before NS|pg||
nt|sybarra: will be a mad scramble |pg||
nt|ahollan1: voice commentary talking about  run of @H maybe squeezing West in minors|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Peter takes the advance sac|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: same contract !|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C  14+ with clubs or 15+ balanced|pg||

nt|sybarra: but I make these leads all the time :( |pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@H   maybe RM Lite response of any 8-11, not 5+@S|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|d2|nt|mrdct: playing preciion in the open room EW never found their @h fit|pg||
nt|mrdct: losing 2@h and a @d here at least|pg||
nt|mrdct: and there's nowhere to put the deep @c loser|pg||
nt|mrdct: so i think this is going to slide one off|pg||
nt|sybarra: no reason to hop yet|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 1@d = 1s + another, some spec tell me.|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|sybarra: we are in the qualifying rounds  leading to semi's then finals over the weekend |pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room at least sniffed at slam, but vanProoijen 3@S left much less room for exploration|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all matches are 14 boards, but the venue always plays  1-14  and  17-30|pg||

pc|dA|pc|dQ|pc|d3|pc|d5|pg||

pc|c7|nt|sybarra: it is invitational event |pg||

mb|p|nt|petergill: Other table: I have to admit that I prefer 4@S on Bd 19 to 3@S and think Australia fully deserved their 6 imps|pg||

nt|sybarra: 2 @D =multi |pg||
nt|sybarra: wk 2 in one major  |pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: From East !|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: don't expect a par result here|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: player hate to lead A, maybe |pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: EW play a system called  Ultimate Canape|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H denied 4 spades|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@D natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: Last BD is -1 in OR, so 3 imp.|pg||
nt|kemperg: no good start fot Yeh Bros, 29 imps in 4 boards:(|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 4 boards 9 imps tight stuff|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=less than game force|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Hirata not intervend !  hummm|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@C  natural game-forcing|pg||
nt|mrdct: ben now showing @d as his second (and probably longer) suit|pg||
nt|mrdct: again - the theory is nothing can go wrong when you are green vs red|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, if you take the 'save' over 6@C a lot can go wrong|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3@d looks like a splinter which is usually il-advised with a stiff ace|pg||
nt|mrdct: but it might mean something else|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would Shih also open 1N if distribution was 4225|pg||
nt|twcho: whoever south is, they are not regular partner|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=a) 4441@D, any  b) 4@S, BAL, 12-14  c) 5+@S 4+@D, min  or 55 MAX|pg||
nt|ahollan1: North did have option to super-accept|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S  natural, 1-round force|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4NTlooks like two places to play|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh ? another is @c he wann show ?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: *wanna|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: I think 2@S was forcing with less than 5 spades, and that with 5+ spades Sth would respond 2NT, but I do not guarantee that|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  the 2@h bid may have caused EW to underestimate their values|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 1@s open because of Scenken system.|pg||
nt|mrdct: so west's actions have talked NS out of 3NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @C probably said @H's and S taking a chance on 3 nt |pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 19  2@CX was +580  and 13 imps to China Geely Auto|pg||
nt|mrdct: but i could be mistaken|pg||
nt|ahollan2:  2@H=@S, 8-14 HCP, usually BAL  a) 3@S  b) 4@S, min|pg||
nt|ahollan2:  2N = max, 5+@S, forcing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C stayman OR game force relay   [so the alert]|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pole_as_ch: 3@h is safe ! or some snag ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other table  5@H South|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think with new ACBL rules that won't be an alert in north america|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mrdct: and put south on the spot to perhaps bid a failing slam|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think S is looking for tricks here |pg||
nt|ahollan1: probably not a hand with slam interest - that would start with 2@C [stayman OR game force relay]|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: luck he had 9 tops here|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Isporski had a chance to defend against 2@CX  but pulled and also 3N North|pg||
pc|c7|nt|petergill: i played many boards against this pair in the semi finals of our Nationals 2 weeks ago (they won), but I have never played their system|pg||
nt|ahollan2:  unfavorable vul    1N=13-15|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: welcome Al who is an expert on the Newell-Reid system|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: viora !|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|sybarra: and that lead lets it thru for sure |pg||
nt|mrdct: declarer will be a bit worried about getting tapped-off here|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Bill would regrett Not to go, maybe|pg||
nt|mrdct: only if he makes 12 tricks - which isn't guaranteed|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: ah the @D lead ty opps|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: just another flat push :)|pg||
nt|ahollan2:  all tables getting the @D lead|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: it is very PASSIVE|pg||

pc|c6|nt|mrdct: a hard-eartned 1-imp swing for Oz|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the question seems to be   does 5@H make with 4-0 trump slit  AND 4-2 @C|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: but @c8 is funny carding.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes Al|pg||
pc|h8|nt|pole_as_ch: y, now -2.|pg||
nt|petergill: Holding @DQx, East was in no hurry to give partner a ruff with West's 3rd (long) trump|pg||
nt|petergill: Also, if North had have played @S8 at Trrick 1, East could not tell if W had @S432 (playing UDCA)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|pole_as_ch: well|pg||
nt|fabsayc: any suggestions on best line|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: they find best suit|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: and S ?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: sure -- but why?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: woww !|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: 2@S is a treatment i haven't seen before|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe part of transfer advances???|pg||
nt|mrdct: @d lead by south may also beat 6@h as declarer will try to pitch the losing @d on the @CAK|pg||
nt|xenya: tricky hand, this|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Operater ?  last BD 2 up really ??|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|andyv:  got me on that one|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: No! NS in OR go there !  10 imp would swing.|pg||
nt|sybarra: so alerted before I could type it |pg||
nt|sybarra: just felt like it?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|xenya: NS have full game values but...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there's always that|pg||
nt|sybarra: and was the lead he wanted |pg||
nt|sybarra: over 1 nt|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pole_as_ch: hummm |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|petergill: Should South overcall 2@C? Fav vul = good - in Sabine Auken's book, she explains why 3@C overcall of 1@D can work well - EW have 2 unbid majors so might miss the 4-4 major fit. |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 1 off or good/bad ??|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably typical contract |pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW require decent 12 hcp to open balanced hands so  vProoijen PASS|pg||
nt|kemperg: Yeh Bros on 6th place, ONI-TAKA 4/5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: leads 3rd/4th   carding  usually  odd/even|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sybarra: Frank,  we commented earlier about the names of teams,  women vs ladies   |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N = 15-17|pg||
nt|kemperg: first 6 to quarter final|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra: not sure if that reflects age or what |pg||
pc|cA|nt|kemperg: 8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other table 4@S North|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|sybarra: where is 9th trick ? |pg||
pc|c7|pc|c9|nt|mrdct: indeed it looks like anything other than @SA will beat it|pg||
nt|mrdct: sorry everyone - i have a no-GIB policy when commentating so expect serious misanalysis!|pg||
nt|mrdct: looks like only a LOW @s will let it make|pg||
nt|mrdct: trumps might be the likely lead here|pg||
nt|mrdct: but i'm not exactly sure what info south has about the east-west hands|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 4@s in OR !|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: wow|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|andyv:  whatever it is, it will be 2 tricks short|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room  2@SX North|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: other table 3@S East|pg||

pc|s6|nt|mrdct: looking pretty good to make this|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sK|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mrdct: so normal play here is to win A and try to pitch @c loser on the @CAK|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: increase loser|pg||
pc|c4|nt|xenya: @HA|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h3|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Shih has enough info to get @C right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes  PLEASE|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is that 3 or 4 disconnects in 5 minutes??|pg||
mc|3|nt|andyv:  3N extremely optomistic....N needed to have a 2nd @h stopper in hand or bid 3@h to ask for stopper in partner's hand.|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: y, 6imp|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: South open ?  i may pass.|pg||
nt|frankaus: unlucky layout here|pg||
nt|frankaus: 4@H making - looks probable |pg||
nt|sybarra: have to keep S from falling in love with hand |pg||
nt|frankaus: bye all - pd here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems all choices there led to -1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C or 1@D for South?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i like systems where transfers over 1@C  include  1@D=unbal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: scores thru round 9 are posted at  http://www.jcbl.or.jp/home/English/nec/17th/results/tabid/659/Default.aspx|pg||
nt|xenya: normal result, although 4@H makes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what do you open Shirley?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: PASS, 2@S, 3@S, 4@s might all get some votes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or in this system   1@H  |pg||
nt|sybarra: hate hands like these |pg||
nt|sybarra: close to opening 1 @S here|pg||
nt|mrdct: dare i suggest a routine 4@s for EW here?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: kiwis will take that|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they are discussing fit jumps in open room on last board, i think not a good idea at that vuls|pg||
nt|dburn: not really, but he might against Grosvenor|pg||
mb|1C|nt|pole_as_ch: 5@hX is too risky ?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: bad play by E|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: so it goes|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S probably would have made, so chalk that little gain up to the marginal 2@C overcall|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C strong|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the Newell-Reid machine rolls on, taking all in it's wake|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: should try one more ??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C=10-12(13) HCP, 6+@C|pg||
nt|othered1: north has a petty perfect hand for 5@C, down to the @H10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might start with 3@D=RELAY, may stop in 4@C else FG|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D!|an|3+S 5+D|nt|pole_as_ch: oh, open! so they go to 4@s !|pg||
nt|ahollan1: don't know what 3@S does to the auction :(|pg||
nt|othered1: can he get enough information from the single relay to make the 4 v 51C judgment?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: probably Reid's bid will show short @S|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@C v. 5@C, rather|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the problem with 3@D is what has actually happened|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sybarra: cu frank |pg||
nt|sybarra: thx for helping |pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D GF ... artificial = @H?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice hand partner!|pg||
nt|mrdct: and too expensive - 1100 probably|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: well 3 off is not payed|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: narrow slam !   6@c !!|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: 2@C Precision  most Chinese pairs play 6+@C OR 5@C & 4@H/@S|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 1@s ??|pg||
nt|othered1: EW don't really want to get too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: oh? 4 off !|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the relay finds shortness|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: 4@H = signoff, minimum |pg||
pc|h3|nt|mrdct: 6@d tricks is a good start for 3NT NS but EW can get to their 5 before NS establish their tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after 9    NEDUK leading with 173   China Geely 2nd with 170|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: @d4|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: does 1N deny 4@S?     probably  otherwise North would probably use some form of checkback|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: no, North !  sry|pg||
nt|othered1: 800 here on @D ruff|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: 2-way checkback  or  new minor force?    probably 2-way  so  2@D = artificial game force|pg||
nt|twcho: yes, rather standard precision which is suitable for irregular partnership|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: but died !  y, it is normal, but...|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|sybarra: may now get pushed too high?    can they even beat 4 @S?|pg||
nt|sybarra: my pards rarely have hands like that one when I open 4  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: from old card  Zejun @C7  =  odd/even  where odd=like this suit|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: same contract|pg||
nt|mrdct: heading for a normal push|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: i dont know this seq|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: checkback was used in other room so Patrick Huang avoided @S lead -- but his choice of @HK wasn't a success either|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in North America the top big club pairs are playing 2@C always 6+@C|pg||
nt|twcho: and NS aren't regular partners|pg||
nt|ahollan1: mine would have 13 cards   but there the similarity would end|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: c |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 2@S shows minor ? or maybe @c directly|pg||
nt|othered1: Did south's pass show @S shortness?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's my guess|pg||
nt|dburn: would not think so - would be strange if South had to bid with spade length|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: then again  playing 2-way checkback  South might bid @C|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: well cannot make. but 2 off ?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sybarra: can N get in to lead club? |pg||
nt|sybarra: just take 4 aces   easier |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|petergill: Best % play of @h suit in 6@H is ace - picks up bare king in either hand|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: another possible squeeze -- but this one doesn't work|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mrdct: losing 2@c, 1@h and 1@s so need to get @d right to make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in their relays  not uncommon for  PASS=short in overcall  DBL=no shortness  other = short in bid suit|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 2NT ?? negative ?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mrdct: predicated on a @c switch by west now which may not be so easy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlikely @D plays|pg||
nt|xenya: this should make despite the4-1 trump split -- but some care is needed|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: this will switch @c|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sybarra: our pards have taken similar lessons it seems |pg||
pc|c8|nt|xenya: still can't make it on a @S return|pg||
nt|mrdct: wd bro|pg||
nt|ahollan1: either @DJ still in dummy or @DQ still in hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same opening in other room|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh @h|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|petergill: but in 4@H, have to consider if safety play of low to @H queen (picks up KJx in either hand) - is safe or unsafe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's why they are called  CHO    cross-hand opponent|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 3@d may short, or just cue ?|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: that's better   thanks|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mrdct: hi peter|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: so now 20-5 after those 2 8's|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: @sJ-@d7|pg||
pc|c7|nt|xenya: but now perhaps...|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: Geely Auto always seems to provide us with a team for the NEC Cup|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|mrdct: i can't see any reason why he'd get the @dK right here|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: another option   PASS=min|pg||
pc|s3|nt|othered1: How could a 3rd @D have hurt?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Hirata is losing sharpness of his own|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: Andy  are you a 2-way checkback  or NMF kinda guy?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|pc|s9|pg||
nt|andyv:  2 way|pg||
nt|petergill: @H Safety play taken, in case there are 2 club losers|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|c6|pg||
nt|andyv:  I live in LA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: [or  2@C always the only checkback]|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: better line of play    claim after @D switch|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: you call that living?|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: wd play by K.Yamada.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 5@d is good scr !|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: but have so many defensive tricks, so tend to defence ?? |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: what is Newells gadget for this shape|pg||
nt|fabsayc: seems newell should have got the last hand right, i crashed, maybe somebody said that|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: 2 @D looks like multi again|pg||
nt|petergill: in 6@H - running @HQ picks up only one case - bare jack in North - so if an expert does such play against you successfully, you should hold your cards further back|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: looks like|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=9-13 hcp, unbal, 4+@S|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@H=@S, 8-14 HCP, usually BAL  a) 3@S  b) 4@S, min|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  again because of canape style, W restricted in his choice of openings|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @C as to transfer into suit (I think) |pg||
nt|vugraphzws: Sorry for mistake.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in 3rd seat, they'll open some balanced hands that don't get opened in 1st/2nd|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice trump split    5-4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i predict   3@C = non-force  LONGER @C|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: P or 4@c ?|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: one downside of the (strong) @C no suits shown'|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: y|pg||
mb|5D|nt|pole_as_ch: limitted place ??|pg||
nt|mrdct: good that NS stayed out of game with 4 losers on top|pg||
nt|mrdct: now north needs to play trumps for zero losers|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@S=5+@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: dutch playing a canape style, hence this unusual combination|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: hum, 6@c ?|pg||
nt|mrdct: Oz Players here are 2/3 of the runners-up in Australia National Open Teams from a couple of weeks ago|pg||
nt|sybarra: I suspect 5 @h is pass or correct... or the lack of @D was what W was going to bid |pg||
nt|sybarra: just not sure how they play this |pg||
nt|sybarra2: how to find out you have no wasted values in @H's |pg||
nt|mrdct: reasonable 3rd seat opening by north|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: need 2 entries|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: this only -1|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: y|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2N relay for distribution|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N=5@S 5@C 1@H|pg||
nt|mrdct: close to mirrored shapes here for NS which is often dangerous, but there's no ruff on for the defence so @SA and @DAK only to lose|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 3rd @c also ?|pg||
nt|mrdct: opportunity for jacobs now as 3@h failed in teh closed room|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 1 off in OR !?|pg||
nt|mrdct: however, i suspect he'll only finese against the @HK and go one down also but we'll see|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: West opend ! easily place @hK for him, but how many trumps ?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: now West will move ?  maybe NO !|pg||
pc|hK|nt|fabsayc: now east hunting for slam, and may well bid it|pg||

nt|twcho: last bd, north misdefend by continuing his @d and squeezed south on the way|pg||
nt|xenya: and E miight be tempted|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think of any good reason why you woudl play west for @hK10x|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@D forces 4@H   |pg||
nt|sybarra2: do you really want to be in this slam?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: probably not but|pg||
nt|sybarra2: ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  you have all the controls ...only a question if you can set up @cs on ruffs|pg||
nt|andyv:  the poor @s spots may determine if they go on |pg||
nt|sybarra2: or smother 10 of @S? |pg||
nt|ahollan1: the auction strongly suggests  @S 4333 around the table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in that case -- 3@D looks more dangerous than normal|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: like Ninja ?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|andyv:  you can also try the @d suit |pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@s is 8-10 bal and 3@d asks for a major I'm told|pg||
pc|c2|nt|twcho: he should return a @s to break up the squeeze|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@S = light third seat non-vul openings are all the rage among genuine experts - the older experts like to open 2@S (or equivalent) in 3rd seat (takes away more bidding space) - ...|pg||
nt|petergill: the newer experts find 1@S more effective overall (less revealing to opponents in the card play)|pg||
nt|mrdct: had north passed initially i guess NS would get to 1NT makiing 7 or 8 tricks|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mrdct: and then 3@h is a transfer to get the strong hand to play it|pg||
nt|mrdct: thanks specs!|pg||
nt|twcho: Top eight teams will enter the KO stage|pg||
nt|xenya: well...|pg||
nt|kemperg: 5@H are your @Hs good?|pg||
nt|kemperg: and W tinks AHx is enough|pg||
nt|xenya: EW lack 2 keycards, but luckily for them, they have failed to to find that out|pg||
nt|kemperg: no fancy play, trying to catch 10x in N and its made|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if West had all of the inferences about the NS @S length  and  North's proably being 46|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with  4135 or 4315  i'm not sure if Newell would rebid 3@C or just a quiet 2@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder also |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Lixin played for squeeze on last hand  so a different down 1 in 4@S |pg||
nt|mrdct: 1 *can't|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 4@s maybe voidwood ?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 5NT ???|pg||
nt|kemperg: that wont be from Qxx|pg||

nt|fabsayc: no stopping now|pg||
nt|mrdct: if any of you good analyst out there want to join me feel free|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: finishing in top 3 is helpful   1 chooses opponent from 5-8, then  2, then  3  [ 4 gets stuck with remaining team]|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: @d9 is good @d ?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: seems good for ONI|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|kemperg: claim|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh Yes 10 is critical, thx|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: 4@D set @S    4@H=avg+ or max  then RKC|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: ummm, they also go !  nice auction! |pg||
nt|fabsayc: reid has to guess whether spade shift from singleton or doubleton|pg||
pc|c6|nt|fabsayc: this mostly needs two diamonds to survice, then a straight cross ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if @D lead 3rd/5th then unlikely choice of crossruff|pg||
nt|andyv:  if leads are 3-5, W may already know what is going on|pg||
nt|mrdct: obviously with north having already bid @s the transfer benefits are not there - but often you need to stick to your generla structure|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c3|pg||
nt|mrdct: jacobs would much rather have the @H10 than the @CQ|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: hehehehe  |pg||
pc|h5|nt|fabsayc: yes i dont think he will play that way, i was talking in abstract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: double dummy players will  pin north's @S10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and finesse in @C|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think before the lead, @d suit looks as promising as anything else|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: No snag. cold slam !|pg||
nt|mrdct: so beating this a couple of tricks will be close to a push|pg||
nt|mrdct: the overtake there suggest he'll at least keep his options open to hook the 10|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: come the moment of truth ??|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: push !|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: NEDUK lead the Bulgarians by 16 with 4 to go in the other match|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: heat up fight they doing|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d9|nt|andyv:  may not finesse @cs first|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: on positive note for declarer   if @D gets ruffed -- then can pull trump|pg||

nt|twcho: really don't like such 54 opener and force partner to 3 level|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: we r vul and they r non !|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: i disgrade flat hand easily|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: and how many nt do they end up in?  6 nt makes |pg||
nt|petergill: Dbl by E = to discourage West from going past 4@SX|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 3nt by W in OR|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3NT is the open room - so cold have a new leader again if it makes|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: well yes as 6@D makes but other room down in NT|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: hummm,|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: aft 4NT, 5@c, 5@d, 6@d ???|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 12 much needed  to oni|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS play Michaels shows   weak or strong |pg||
nt|fabsayc: anybody else nervous to overcall just 1@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: West dbled 1@s, funny.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2NT very strong Martin raises|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so Reid hand fits in the middle ... hence 1@S|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mrdct: the mirrored position in @c is bad news fro NS here|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sybarra: pitches dummy do little to help here |pg||
nt|sybarra: *pitches IN dummy |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh good lead !|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: @C4 discouraging  and hard to read regarding suit pref  [odd/even discards]|pg||
nt|fabsayc: verhees will continue diamonds and subseuently declarer is kind of squeezed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: agreed    probably liked favorable vul  [not-vul vs vul  aka "green"]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlucky   partner had best hand at the table|pg||
nt|cc469: evenin'|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Carl,  welcome |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Reid really doesn't have much hope of beating this|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with his @C shortness -- desperately hoping partner has 1@D and 2+@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but even then  need a 2nd trump trick|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: great decision|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: quite a parlay opposite an aggressive favorable vul 2@H opening|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hans opened east hand weak 1N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now in 2@DX East|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: in 6@S Miyakuni cashed @CA early and misguessed trump - but @D suit intact  does she still have a chance to make?   i doubt it|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think we are relaying a bunch here |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: with 7 more after this|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: it is as a water on the very hot stone|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: maybe|pg||

pc|c5|nt|sybarra: might we just plop into 6 nt? |pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c8|nt|petergill: 4@S = due to the fav vul - might cost a little bit too much|pg||
nt|mrdct: the 3 @c losers will hurt|pg||
nt|mrdct: on a good day dummy's minors will be the other way and it's all dandy|pg||
nt|petergill: South knew trumps were 3-1 only when @SK appeared - else West has no spade stop for his 3NT bid|pg||
pc|c4|nt|pole_as_ch: The other room also 4@s !  so no swing !|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in north america, i think Woolsey-Stewart are the only big club pair that doesn't use 2N opening as strong balanced hand|pg||
pc|hK|nt|fabsayc: timing all wrong for defense now|pg||
nt|mrdct: but i don;t disagree with north's action and it could easily be replicated in the open room|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|h5|pg||
nt|sybarra: and they "we" are |pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s5|nt|sybarra: can actually make 7 given that @H's fall |pg||
pc|h8|nt|pole_as_ch: wow ?|pg||
nt|cc469: I suggest that it is not at all clear from N's hand that they should be playing in a minor suit and thus agree with Tommy that the 2NT opening is a bit unilateral|pg||
nt|cc469: S might have held W's @Hs for example|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and then EW hold the @S|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|sybarra: and spade hook on |pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@C = pass/correct|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|ahollan1: 1@S = 4+@S [possible canape with longer minor]|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@S four or five spades|pg||
nt|sybarra2: ok that is true |pg||
nt|sybarra2: re over many months|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh !!!!  2@c !!|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@c can make i believe|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 1NT by W in OR|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2NT puppet to 3C or nat|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thx operator|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: i think puppet to @c|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: this would be push, or 1,2 imp|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@S forcing     2@C=5-7 HCP, 0-2@S, not 6+@C/@D  [3m], not 5+@H [2@D]|pg||
nt|sybarra2: van Prooijen-Verhees, playing in the closed room, won the Dutch Teams Championship (by 1 IMP!) less than 36 hours ago. They must be jet-lagged. Quite a journey from Amsterdam to ...|pg||
nt|sybarra2: ...|pg||
nt|sybarra2: to Japan|pg||
nt|sybarra2: playing here |pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmmmmm   i thought 2N showed 6+@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and game force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H confirms @C and shows extras  [i think]   maybe just extras|pg||
nt|petergill: Pass by West, converting East's Dbl for penalties, yields 800 or 1100 or more, I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lead director :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: I thought maybe he would try 1 @S to see if it was majors |pg||
nt|mrdct: lose 2@s and a trick in each of the other suits|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: strange 3N|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: the others would wish they had interediate 2@D opener|pg||
nt|ahollan1: intermediate|pg||
nt|ahollan1: similar to the Precision 2@C opener|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually i think 1@D is fine|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: how can it be game force after negative 1@D?|pg||
nt|vugraphzws: Alert with P is miss.sorry|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes next hand please :)|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 3@d is "help suit" like  maybe .|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: GT|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: stopped ??|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is more of a bluff to open 1@C|pg||
mb|4S|nt|pole_as_ch: in OR, West's 1NT !  humm.|pg||
nt|mrdct: i guess there is chance for declarer to over think a potential bad trump break going for an endplay in @d|pg||
nt|mrdct: which could be indicated with the @H opening by west|pg||
nt|mrdct: btw 2@h is 10-13 5+@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: can be weaker in 3rd|pg||
nt|mrdct: the east-west system has no weak 2 available so with hands like west you need to improvise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if 3@C again pass/correct then 2@H was just showing max|pg||
nt|kemperg: dbl = support 3@Hs|pg||
nt|sybarra: becaise if pard bids a minor Reid has a good hand |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: could be a great result though|pg||
nt|othered1: 1N response looks Bluish, not Precision|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  card says 1@s was a balanced relay so probably couldn|pg||
nt|andyv:  couldn't hold 6 spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: either my notes or vP's bid are wrong|pg||
nt|ahollan1: fun system to study     i first saw Ultimate Canape played by Russ Ekeblad   the Dutch have made some minor changes but the overall structure is intact|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: hu ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i wonder -- what is default meaning of RDBL for CRASH players|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 4@S should make, but is not totally cold|pg||
nt|fabsayc: over 1@D what else ed?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: didn't mention earlier  carding  odd/even   so @H10 was discouraging  and i think Reverse Suit preference|pg||
nt|othered1: 1@H in Precision?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hence  the @C shift|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: no   1@S=relay over 1@H response|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was about to say  best contract 1N [which they can't reach]   when result from other room popped up|pg||
nt|petergill: the sort of contract an expert should make and an average player might not make|pg||
nt|petergill: On this lead, 4@S is even colder|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 8 tricks ?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sybarra2: do we hear the screaching of brakes?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: over 1@D   1@H/@S look like matchpoint precision / meckwell ...   4+suit, one-round force|pg||
pc|s5|nt|pole_as_ch: heww|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: whew|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: and lead ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think response of 1N with 3433 is just old time bridge judgement|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the hand looks like NT so ...|pg||
nt|othered1: How often have you seen 5-card major, Precision players use that type of judgment?  .05 percent of the time?|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: use @d for many tricks ?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: @C for an imps else flat|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D in context of (10)11-15 HCP  is great description of East hand|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: to account for the artificial 1N overcall   EW DBL isn't pure takeout shape -- can include normal strong NT|pg||
nt|kemperg: 10 tricks, claim|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: or -1|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|nt|mrdct: @D10 is a good card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thru 8   China Women  2  leads  Oni-Taka  11-0|pg||
nt|cc469: in response to specs questions, I assume W bid this way to show that his suits were @Cs and @Hs not both minors and he seemed to feel he wanted to be in game|pg||

mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: 2@C  this time  the 6+@C 1-suiter|pg||

nt|twcho: how to show both M after thsi 1@d opening?|pg||
nt|sybarra: rather unpleasant splits everywhere here |pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: Klinger also did it !|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: too bitter ?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: very easy ?|pg||

mb|4S|nt|mrdct: 1@c is nat and forcing|pg||

nt|twcho: :)|pg||
nt|xenya: now a lucky 6N for NS|pg||

nt|mrdct: 1@d is 4+ @h|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: precious 5 imps|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: gosh a natural bid |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=FG, 10+ HCP, 3+ CNTRL [A=2, K=1], a) BAL [5@C/@D(332) ok]  b) 1-suit, 5+@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=10-15 hcp, 4+@H    maybe LONGER 2nd suit or 5@H 5@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzws: Sorry|pg||
nt|twcho: how to bring the @s into picture?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: mirrors?|pg||
nt|cc469: yes, why open 1@H?|pg||
nt|kemperg: I would find p with 4 @Hs and xx in @S then:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now Reid will make next bid to get complete distribution|pg||
nt|dburn: wonder why West did not overcall - maybe 1@d would be conventional|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D relay  again, not promising ANY strength|pg||
nt|kemperg: quanti|pg||
nt|petergill: China Women 2, with Wang Wenfei, who was World  1 woman player briefly before her approx two years off, back from her break|pg||
nt|petergill: this Bulgaria All Stars is almost locked into the Final 8 too, as is Japan's top team Oni-taka, some of whom came 9th in the 2011n Bermuda Bowl|pg||
nt|mrdct: i don't think the overtrick on 26 makes any difference as 180 and 200 are both 5 imps|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: or 6@d ?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: y|pg||
nt|mrdct: 6@d is a great contract|pg||
nt|mrdct: maybe 4@h by north now|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: and 5@c by south ?|pg||
nt|othered1: god question|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good point David|pg||
nt|othered1: good question|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@H = 1-suiter, not solid suit|pg||
nt|cc469: I see|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: another approch !  why not 3NT ?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: or almost, couple of imps away|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mrdct: is north not happy with his @s stopper?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe it *shows*|pg||
nt|mrdct: maybe 2@s is showing the @s stopper(s)|pg||
nt|petergill: Oz Players is 6th so needs to avoid a serious loss in order to qualify|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=one round force   2@C natural   don't know which suit is longer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C=exactly 4243|pg||
pc|d6|nt|kemperg: @S well placed, will make 6|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, can't help it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C confirms canape hand   4@H  LONGER @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and lack of @S bid we have pretty good picture of South hand|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 3 or 4 ??|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: well, 4 !|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 4 for me too|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: 2N relay for distribution|pg||
nt|andyv:  have to like the quality of the spot cards W|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 7+@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not 7222|pg||
nt|andyv:  but he makes it up in volume|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might be the one system in the world that has trouble with 5@S 5@H :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think 3@D asks total controls  [A=2 K=1]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: step 1 = 3   |pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: What is her choice for OL?|pg||
nt|twcho: interesting system|pg||
nt|twcho: another strange bid by north|pg||
nt|ahollan1: strike that  their teammates in the winning Bermuda Bowl    Tarzan Precision opens 1@H with 5@H and 5+@S  [because of their relay structure]|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@S was 4 spades, longer clubs, 14+ points|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: sry, last BD, west ! Mullanphy !|pg||
nt|cc469: appears to be -300|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mrdct: hard for south to avoid game now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: RDBL would be  to play   not sure about PASS :(|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: now show 0/1@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: was just typing    @H ruff will be with natural trump trick - is there a way to avoid that defense|pg||
nt|mrdct: i guess with the EW major not revealed 4@h could be contrued as natural by north|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: well sure -- lead @D  :)|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh !  sound !?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: i c|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: agree|pg||
nt|mrdct: in the open room west showed @h naturally so north was able to cue with 4@h so i think the slam will be reached in the open room|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: alas duplication|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: i like the auction in OR.|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: 4@H slam try in @C|pg||
nt|mrdct: a nice 5-5 and partner showing some values|pg||
nt|mrdct: Oz Players are 2/3 of the team which narrowly lost the Australian National Open Team 2 weeks ago|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: they go to 6@d in OR|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@D double surely contributes nothing to defense chances|pg||
nt|othered1: perhaps a lead, as it's not clear where south is considering playing, is it?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: only works if partner ends up on lead against 6@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@DX  or  XX would have been fun to watch|pg||
nt|othered1: or 6@H?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|pole_as_ch: 4 made in OR !  England Ladies will gain 1 imp.  |pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra2: can not imagine W is truly interested |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S = min|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good lord, are they slamming again|pg||
nt|sybarra2: teetering on it |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i doubt verhees shows  disinterest with @CAK-7th|pg||
nt|sybarra2: maybe the 4 @S=min slows them down?|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think so -- but don't quote me|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1:  10  Tony Nunn in West made 3@C where Banxiang made 1N|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: yep|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i still think doubles of relays help opponents more than your side|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|pole_as_ch: East could easily lost 6@d|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|kemperg: for me S had no quanti, 11pts, 4333|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra2: again the sounds of brakes are deafening |pg||
nt|xenya: maybe N could have a bit more|pg||
nt|xenya: 22?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: normally playing Queen on lead of King says  I either have singleton or QJ|pg||
pc|h9|nt|pole_as_ch: BD 10 ?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no this one|pg||
pc|h8|pc|s3|pg||
nt|andyv:  air brakes|pg||
nt|mrdct: good unblock of the @CJ by bill jacobs|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|mrdct: makes things nice and easy for ben thompson to continue @c|pg||

nt|dburn: well, they may hinder the opponents if the opponents don't know what they are doing|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: yes if i can bring a cheat sheet to all events|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this time with canape [2nd suit longer] |pg||
nt|kemperg: we open stronger than 2NT with a good 22|pg||
nt|mrdct: another slam hand!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think these boys know|pg||
nt|othered1: or @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Precision 2@C   6+@C or 5@C & 4@H/@S|pg||
nt|cc469: 3 imp gain for the Aussies as 4@H made at other table|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|andyv:  sorry, 10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3rd 2@C opener|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: now difficult 4 @s|pg||
nt|sybarra2: this is the "I have an opening bid" 1 @D |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15 HCP, 0+@D, maybe longer @C/@S, but NOT @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as here  often weak NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=4+ fit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=(13)14+ unbal or 16+ bal   [unfav  1N=13-15]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this 3-suiter shows why the Precision 2@D bid was modified to include (43)15 hands|pg||
nt|dburn: what would a 2@d opening mean?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: their 2M = M + minor  so my guess 2@D=weak @H or @S|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|petergill: 12-14 in 4th seat|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: y |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: and 3rd 2@D response|pg||
nt|ahollan1: RDBL=4+@H|pg||
nt|xenya: if 20 is the limit, 4N looks purposeless|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: and full of controls |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: this BD also no storm, maybe |pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the early days of Precision where 2@D was 4414 or 4405   we would open South hand 1@D rather than 2@C|pg||
mb|3N|nt|pole_as_ch: trouble hand again ??|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  must be nice to have so many hands fit into your system:)|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 1@h = @s showing, and 2@s = 4 card @s  maybe !|pg||
nt|Walddk4: yes, and a minimum|pg||
nt|mrdct: usually voids opposite AK/AQ aren't so great but no problems here in 6@d EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  S had a pretty easy dbl |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: thx Roland.|pg||
nt|mrdct: typically aggressive fav vul preempt by ben|pg||
nt|cc469: has to just guess the @H in 4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  25  [the weird 2N opener]   South playing 3@S|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: someone goes to 7 ?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh !|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: yep  define the system then make arrangements with The Great Shuffler|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: how do y think 4@c /|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: *?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not nice|pg||
pc|c6|nt|pole_as_ch: hum|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the west hand|pg||
pc|cK|nt|andyv:  NS are rapidly becoming spectators in these auctions|pg||
nt|petergill: other table Bd 26: Ron Klinger is in 4@S, should make it|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am surprised Reid wasnt in there with spades  (except he is red) |pg||
pc|cT|nt|Walddk4: Declarer mistimed this in the open room|pg||
nt|mrdct: they probably a convention that will help them avoid that|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 3NT would be better contruct, but West choiced 4@s.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H holding 4  means  either weak NT or  4414/4405|pg||
nt|cc469: that should help the @H guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzws: 2NT maybe 20-21|pg||
nt|xenya: well a good 21 could be enough for slam|pg||
nt|xenya: 21 plus a 5-carder for example|pg||
nt|kemperg: we might upgrade that|pg||
pc|hT|nt|pole_as_ch: 11imp comes, so 21 imps wide spreaded|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: @h2 ?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: @s3 ?|pg||
nt|othered1: In any case, minimum openings with @C aren't handled optimally by forcing @C systems.  Costly to have to spend two bids (2@C and 2@D) in many systems to handle them|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D south in other room|pg||
pc|h2|nt|andyv:  you aren't dealt NT hands in order to be passing |pg||
nt|ahollan1: vP described 7+@C again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would you overcall 2N or DBL Andy?|pg||
nt|mrdct: not a challenging lead fro declarer - this should make easiluy'|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh !|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: ?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|pole_as_ch: 3 in @s, 3 in @h, 1 in @d, 1 in @C, so 8 tricks.|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not available    everything other than PASS = game force|pg||
nt|sybarra: lucky him |pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: ihave no experience of precision|pg||
pc|h4|nt|pole_as_ch: only play against them a few times|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: and swich @CQ ?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: i wonder if west bid 4@H   does south bid 4@S|pg||
nt|twcho: south won't bid for sure|pg||
nt|twcho: north may consider|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 2NT and 3@h is ASKing ? |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: it looks easily reach 6@d|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: anyways|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a hand of little interest, 4 to go|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: maybe|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: but entry problem |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kemperg: so it depends on their style|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the meantime  EW did well to find 4@H|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I was just thinking trump|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Both table is the same point and thinking |pg||
pc|hA|nt|andyv:  dbl|pg||
nt|ahollan1: remember  2@C could be 4@C and 5+@S|pg||
pc|s2|nt|petergill: I would have played a heart, not a 2nd spade. |pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer might have to guess @h's now|pg||
nt|mrdct: yeah he's a bit tangled up now|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: agree|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 2 ruff in each hand is not enought, because South would ruff 3rd @h.|pg||
nt|cc469: he seemed to thinkl a long time over 2@H|pg||
nt|xenya: true, but S was a passed hand, so no risk really |pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|vugraphzws:  penalty card CQ|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kemperg: 44 imps is 25 I hear from Roland|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: ah, @s est plan is easy i think. y, after wind up thier trump|pg||
pc|c4|nt|fabsayc: they are accurate enough that north might have considered 3@H over west's pass|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't like Kx as stopper when opps say they have 6 of them...can't even hold up once|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and for those who pay attention to trivia   this is 2nd 8-card @S suit of the set|pg||
nt|kemperg: 25-5|pg||

pc|s5|nt|cc469: thinking about doubleton@SQ?|pg||
nt|cc469: after unblocking the J?|pg||
nt|cc469: high school teachers always said if you decide on a plan of action and then rethink and change your mind ...|pg||
nt|cc469: you were probably right the first time|pg||
nt|cc469: yes good point, spec suggests maybe we're stuck|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mrdct: EW might pencil this in as a good result|pg||
nt|xenya: how many more rounds to play?|pg||

pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: for the spectators -- there is no single right answer  bidding over a nebulous 1@D   you must have partnership agreement|pg||
