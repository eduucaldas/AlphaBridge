mb|p|mb|1N!|an|12 - 14 BAL|nt|andyv:  with this vul, N won't be too active and the @s suit rules|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D!|an|!S|nt|andyv:  no peeking allowed at other room results:)|pg||
nt|eieio: It's the first board in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
mb|4S|nt|eieio: They probably had some set-up issues|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|eieio: EW played South Africa Texas transfer|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@d appears to be South African transfer...allows for either side to play 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|eieio: So West can bid 4@S if he wants to play 4@S, or 4@D if he wants his partner to play 4@S|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
nt|eieio: That's good for weak no-trump|pg||
pc|d7|nt|andyv:  this hand, E really not sure who should play it...he doesn't have that much to protect except the Q@h|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|c2|pg||
nt|eieio: Right|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h6|pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|s7|nt|eieio: Now he has to pick up heart suit to make the contract|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|dT|nt|eieio: If South can avoid a heart or a club now|pg||
nt|andyv:  the @s play was interesting|pg||
nt|andyv:  playing the Ace of @s initially would have allowed declarer to pick up the whole suit|pg||
nt|eieio: If declarer is sure he has only one heart loser, then playing the @SK is the safety play|pg||
nt|eieio: He would have only one spade loser even if North had all 4 spades|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d4|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|andyv:  wonder if he could handle a 4-0 split and @c taps into the long hand|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|nt|eieio: I think he'll guess heart right|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h2|pc|dQ|pc|d2|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|eieio: If he has only one heart loser, he wins the race again 4 spades in north|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|pc|cA|pg||
nt|andyv:  play K@c and @c|pg||
nt|andyv:  now has to play 10@c back|pg||
nt|eieio: Right, declarer would still be one step ahead|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pc|s8|pg||
nt|eieio: The first lead was a diamond|pg||
nt|andyv:  little reason not to play the K first time|pg||
nt|andyv:  and if E had a tenace position in @c suit, it would have been imperitive to play the K of @c|pg||
pc|h3|nt|eieio: Now he doesn't see any weird distribution in either minors|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|d9|mc|9|nt|eieio: So he should know North has more heart|pg||

nt|lorderic: this is a collegiate event hold in Taiwan|pg||

nt|lorderic: the finals are three 12-board matches|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|lorderic: BTU-Jecization, which is the first seed in round robin, has 7.5 IMPs carryover|pg||
nt|wkc:  I don't like the 2@C opening|pg||
nt|lorderic: hello Jason|pg||
nt|wkc:  hi Eric|pg||
nt|lorderic: if this 2@C shows a "strong hand" then it's not my choice|pg||
nt|lorderic: I prefer 4@S, or 4@D if you play Namyats|pg||
nt|vugraphzyk: south think a lot of time|pg||
nt|vugraphzyk: it's hard for her to imagine that 4S was doubled|pg||
nt|wkc:  we all now she need some time :)|pg||
nt|wkc:  hi Eric|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: it's the second set of NTU cup final|pg||
nt|lorderic: Hi Jason|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|wkc:  the declarer will a @C loser and one @D loser, so looks like a 4@S over 1|pg||
nt|lorderic: it's hard to imagine that 4@S was doubled since S has a tons of high card|pg||
nt|lorderic: 5@H is not my choice anyway. it's obvious that N have long @S|pg||
nt|wkc:  now things getting more confused, how could somebody double our 20+13 = 33 contract?|pg||
mb|p|pc|h4|nt|wkc:  now the score of two team is actually 39.5 against 34|pg||
nt|wkc:  so 96 needs 6 or more IMPs to win this match|pg||
nt|lorderic: for everyone new to here, this is a collegiate event hold in Taipei, Taiwan|pg||
nt|lorderic: and here's the official website ... https://sites.google.com/site/ntucup2012/home|pg||
nt|wkc:  a quick 4@S and the declarer have some work to do with the 4-0@S split|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|nt|wkc:  easy 4 top tricks|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|pg||
pc|sK|pc|h6|nt|wkc:  the @CK means the declarer is searching for cross ruff like play, that's why W return the trump right away|pg||
nt|wkc:  but still, nothing could stop him|pg||
nt|wkc:  so 5@SX-2|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s5|nt|wkc:  but the lead realy help the declarer to handle this|pg||
pc|c2|pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||

nt|eieio: He needs to find the @HJ|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|nt|andyv:  not if he had played the A of @s:)|pg||
nt|eieio: :)|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|andyv:  in CR, W was declarer in 4@s and got a @h lead...so perhaps E should have xfered the bid back to W|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|eieio: In the closed room, North made a double the first round then drove to game|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|eieio: 4@S is not cold, needs some play and defense|pg||
pc|cK|nt|andyv:  anyone bid 1N with the E hand over 1@h?|pg||
nt|eieio: I won't|pg||
nt|vugraphzyj: N did think about it, but refused to cause @C A|pg||

nt|eieio: upside-down?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|vugraphzyj: yes|pg||
pc|d4|pc|c3|nt|andyv:  that may not be the best as N can pin the J@h if he guesses correctly|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|andyv:  N trying to ruff a @c with low @s|pg||
nt|eieio: Then E would probably overruff then return a heart|pg||
nt|eieio: Hearts are 5422 in his mind right now|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|c5|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|andyv:  putting things off for one round|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|lorderic: Good morning everyone!|pg||
nt|lorderic: Hi Jason!|pg||
nt|wkc:  double looks a little aggressive to me, but acceptable|pg||
nt|wkc:  Hi eric|pg||
mb|1C|nt|lorderic: welcome back guys|pg||
mb|d|nt|wkc:  S open with this hand?|pg||
nt|lorderic: there should be some mis-operated|pg||
nt|wkc:  do you miss a pass stanley?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lorderic: here we go|pg||
nt|wkc:  ty!|pg||
mb|2S|nt|lorderic: For everyone who is new here, this is a collegiate event hold in Taiwan...|pg||
nt|lorderic: all four teams in semi-finals are come from National Taiwan University|pg||
nt|wkc:  a easy 1NT-3NT|pg||
nt|shuan: hi|pg||
nt|wkc:  hi shuan|pg||
nt|wkc:  welcome to our party|pg||
nt|vugraphzyk: sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|wkc:  what's your opinion for the double, eric|pg||
nt|lorderic: with 16 count and a 5-card major, it's typical to double first|pg||
nt|lorderic: the only problem in @H is, if the bidding goes 1@C-X-1@S-P; 2@S|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|lorderic: you have to bid in 3 level, which is somehow scare with this hand|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|wkc:  pass by W looks better for me|pg||
nt|lorderic: we had the first 12-board half semi yesterday|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|wkc:  so for those who just came, this is the first segment of the final of 19th NTU cup, which takes place in Taipei, Taiwan|pg||
mb|p|nt|wkc:  not a good 4@S|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lorderic: 4@S seems a reasonable spot|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|nt|lorderic: here is the offical website for this event... https://sites.google.com/site/ntucup2012/home|pg||
nt|wkc:  we'll have three segments, 12 boards per segment match in the final|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c4|nt|wkc:  with @D lead, declarer is like to take his 9 tricks and concede the others|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lorderic: with 8 card fit and a 5-5 in black suit, 4@S is sound. however it cannot be made since @C split 5-1|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|pg||
nt|vugraphzyk: I don't know what happened but south accept the west claim 4S make in last board, maybe i miss something|pg||

nt|vugraphzyk: last hand was claimed by west for 0 trick of last five|pg||
mb|p|nt|wkc:  double probably means power|pg||
nt|vugraphzyk: thx, i forget to alert|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|lorderic: seems like a partscore here. 4@H cannot be made by EW|pg||
nt|wkc:  N didn't use Michaels to show his 5-5, maybe he think the suit is not good enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|wkc:  usually a balanced hand, but you know sometimes you couldn't a way to describe your hand|pg||
nt|wkc:  2@D is sign off|pg||
nt|wkc:  I'll pass, singleton in pn's suit is not a good news|pg||
nt|wkc:  3@D?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzyk: west think a while|pg||
nt|vugraphzyk: finally bid 5D|pg||
nt|lorderic: N took an interesting action NOT using michaels|pg||
nt|wkc:  3@H from W?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzyk: sorry |pg||
nt|lorderic: I suggest pass also, although you might lose game if pd has around 17 HCP|pg||
nt|wkc:  okay|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d2|pg||
nt|wkc:  well one way to make 4@H is rise the A now, and play @C|pg||
nt|wkc:  if S misdefend, I mean rise the A|pg||
nt|wkc:  then 4@H is home|pg||
nt|wkc:  sometimes bridge is like this, you give the opps pressure and hope they'll do something wrong|pg||
nt|lorderic: i agree with you Jason|pg||
nt|lorderic: 3@H should be stone cold here|pg||
nt|wkc:  anyway, we're in 3@H now so the declarer doesn't need to take the risk|pg||
nt|wkc:  ty Eric!|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|wkc:  West duck the @D try to get more information from his pn|pg||
nt|wkc:  and I think the declarer would duck another @D now|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|cT|pg||
nt|lorderic: when you play forcing 1NT, 3@D should be 5 cards since pd sometimes has only 3 (like this board)|pg||
nt|wkc:  another trumps would put the contract in danger|pg||
nt|lorderic: now the contract is in danger|pg||
nt|vugraphzyk: east asked a one minute stop for his running nose|pg||
nt|lorderic: E does not want to give up a trick on returning trump|pg||
pc|hA|nt|wkc:  EW need to find a @S shift, now or after winning the first @C|pg||
nt|lorderic: he can't tell that his partner has @D9|pg||

nt|lorderic: W tries to maximize her chance by playing @H 2-2 first|pg||
nt|wkc:  and now she's trying for dropping N's @CAQ or AJ|pg||
nt|wkc:  however, if she knows that N has 5-5 in both @S and @D|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|cK|pc|s3|pc|h3|nt|wkc:  S will be marked with the @CA(otherwise, why N didn't use michaels)|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Right, so the 8 had to be a singleton|pg||

mb|p|nt|wkc:  for those who just come in, this is the quarterfinal of the 19th NTU Cup, which take place in Taiwan|pg||
nt|vugraphzyk: that SQ may worth 10 imps, make or -3|pg||
mb|p|nt|wkc:  we'll have a two-half, 12 boards per half match in the quarterfinal|pg||
nt|vugraphzyk: 2-way|pg||
nt|wkc:  but it's not easy to get there and they probably would get to a much easier 3NT|pg||
nt|bypeng:  !!??|pg||
mb|p|pc|c8|nt|wkc:  3NT is too agressive for me...|pg||
nt|lorderic: I'm not sure with the 2NT opening range here|pg||
nt|vugraphzyk: their 2NT is 22-23|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|lorderic: thanks Stanley|pg||
nt|wkc:  I don't know what's the meaning of 3@S|pg||
nt|wkc:  so it's a common difficulty when play green card: the jump in other suit use to many spaces|pg||
nt|lorderic: for a passed hand I would bid unusual 1NT with N hand after 1C-P-1S|pg||

nt|lorderic: ... and is ahead by 9.5IMP now|pg||
nt|wkc:  here it comes|pg||
mb|p|nt|wkc:  usually this bidding suggest that the declarer has some clubs(since he don't have major, and he couldn't support his pn's @D)|pg||
mb|p|nt|wkc:  a normal 3@S|pg||
nt|shuan: not an easy contract for EW|pg||
nt|wkc:  so it's better not to touch @C for the first lead|pg||

mb|p|mb|3S|nt|lorderic: sorry, I mean W cannot make 1NT at the other table on board  14|pg||
nt|lorderic: here NS make another aggressive bidding to 3NT|pg||
nt|wkc:  6@H+1@S+1@C, so the declarer doesn't have his 9th tricks before the defender sets up their @C|pg||
nt|lorderic: I suspect what 2@D shows here?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyk: 2D is 16+ or long H|pg||
nt|lorderic: for E the most likely lead is a @D|pg||
nt|wkc:  however, the defender would have some pressure when the declarer cashes his long @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|wkc:  nicely done!|pg||
nt|lorderic: however E knows S should have some length in @D|pg||
nt|lorderic: then A98xx is not a good 5-card suit to lead anymore|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzyk: with 5 side card loser and trump A, this sacrifice would pay 800|pg||
mb|p|pc|hK|nt|wkc:  so the declarer have something to do here|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lorderic: the 3@H bid is questionable. E didn't open 1@S or 2@S suggests he has a hand like this|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|nt|wkc:  they probably find the @C ruff instead, well done|pg||

pc|s7|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h4|pc|h6|pc|h5|pg||

nt|wkc:  I agree with you|pg||
nt|wkc:  4@C is @C control, with a minimum hand|pg||
nt|wkc:  2@S is....well, not in my system|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzyk: i guess 4D will over one|pg||
nt|lorderic: 2@S suggest a 5 card suit with weak hand|pg||
pc|c9|nt|wkc:  Let's see what N would lead for this one|pg||
nt|wkc:  some people would lead a @H, and I'm one of them|pg||
nt|lorderic: and they finally settle in the best trump|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|wkc:  the reason is that you know the @S split is not friendly for the declarer, so you want to shorten his trump length|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lorderic: this should be another 10 IMPs to BTU-96|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|wkc:  2@H and 1@C and most 2@S loser, so the contract looks safe to me|pg||
nt|vugraphzyk: west told me if north bid 4s, he will bid 5D|pg||
nt|cc469: but E finds the best lead|pg||
nt|lorderic: another blow-up in board  16|pg||

nt|lorderic: if W opens 1@H in third seat, what would you guys bid with N hand?|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzyk: will or can EW go to 6D?|pg||
nt|wkc:  X is penalty base|pg||
nt|wkc:  because he only have two little card in one of the side suit, @D in this hand|pg||
mb|2S|nt|wkc:  3@S+2@D+1@C and 6 trumps so 6@H is cold|pg||
nt|wkc:  lets see if they could get there|pg||
nt|wkc:  2@C stayman, 2@H shows 4 card|pg||
nt|wkc:  and 3@S shows @H fit ST|pg||
nt|lorderic: 1NT- bad stopper, 2D- not a great suit, how about double?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cc469: double|pg||
pc|dK|nt|wkc:  4@C control in @C|pg||
nt|wkc:  and I would bid 4NT(control in @S) if they play kickback (using 4@S for Key card asking)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|wkc:  and 4@H is interesting when you know somebody would like to give you a red card|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d7|pg||
nt|vugraphzyk: 3D is a solid deal, if north play diamond right, it will over one|pg||
pc|sK|nt|wkc:  but looks they don't play kickback, so 4NT RKCB, 5@S shows 2 w/ @HQ|pg||
nt|lorderic: yes, double is slight better than 2@D in my opinion|pg||
pc|sA|nt|wkc:  thinking about 7?|pg||
nt|wkc:  but maybe only one off?|pg||
nt|lorderic: not surprisingly, 9 IMPs to BTU-96 on board 20 and they are 15.5 ahead|pg||
nt|lorderic: i think the only way to get -2 is to underlead a @S :P|pg||
nt|lorderic: ... on the first lead|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|pg||
pc|s4|nt|wkc:  5NT: we got all the keycards, any other power|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|wkc:  6@D: yes @DK|pg||
nt|wkc:  then you'll probably see that table has Qxx instead of Jxx|pg||
pc|s3|nt|wkc:  6@H: great, so let's play 6@H....|pg||
nt|wkc:  I think he want to see 6@C|pg||
nt|wkc:  ,which shows @CK|pg||
nt|wkc:  and then he could bid 6@D to ask if pn has @DK|pg||
nt|wkc:  i.e. he is trying to figure out if S have xx Qxxx AKxx  AKx|pg||
nt|wkc:  but even so, S could have 3 card @S, and then it won't be a good Grand Slam|pg||
nt|wkc:  so I would probably bid 6@H after 5@S|pg||
pc|s6|nt|wkc:  and pn is looking at you, saying"what r u doing" in his mind|pg||
pc|s7|nt|fabsayc: very difficult to bid slam, near perfect fit|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|wkc:  so one off, +100 is not a bad one for Cold Light compare board 17 and 20|pg||
pc|h3|nt|cc469: also sometimes if you double, S might bid 1NT|pg||

mb|p|nt|wkc:  in other table, S open 1@D and EW reaches 2@S for one off |pg||
mb|2D|nt|lorderic: here comes an unpredictable one. NS is open room reached 5@Dx and made|pg||
nt|lorderic: should be a good score to Cold Light|pg||
nt|wkc:  the second double shows "pn, I have hearts"|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzyk: that 3C shows 5-5 minor suit|pg||
nt|lorderic: i suppose in their agreement 3@C is not a game-forcing jump shift|pg||

mb|p|nt|wkc:  I would be more happy to bid 4@H if I have QJ in @D and short in @C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2d by north was a better bid|pg||
nt|wkc:  and maybe 5@DX= again|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: if E pass "forcing", EW might get to 5@S|pg||

pc|dQ|pg||
nt|lorderic: I would recommand a double for blood in matchpoints but not in IMPs|pg||

nt|wkc:  5@H is a good bid, if you always want to bid 5@H when S comes with 4@S, why not bid now|pg||

mb|2S|mb|3H|nt|wkc:  but it would help NS to reach the slam: I would bid 5@S even 6@S with S hand|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|nt|wkc:  here comes the aggressive bidding by E|pg||
nt|lorderic: the final schedules at 10:30 CST, which should be 8 minutes later|pg||
nt|lorderic: It might start late due to the delay|pg||
nt|lorderic: we hope to see you guys back in about 15 minutes|pg||
nt|lorderic: last board for this segment!|pg||
mb|p|nt|wkc:  another aggressive preempt|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: final will be three 12-board matches|pg||
nt|wkc:  I mean, double would only collect few hundred when you might have a cold 5@S even 6@S|pg||
pc|hA|nt|fabsayc: presumbaly 2@H invite because of range of jump response of 2@H over 1@D|pg||
nt|lorderic: thanks a lot to Stanley - the wonderful operator!|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|wkc:  that's it, the declarer could afford 5 off :P|pg||
nt|lorderic: NS reaches 4@S here, either they make it or not BTU-96 is advanced for sure|pg||
nt|wkc:  now the contract depends on not only the @C split but also @CQ|pg||
nt|lorderic: thanks Jason and Carl|pg||
nt|cc469: too timid by N imo|pg||
nt|lorderic: the last segment will start at 14:50 local time. i.e. 15 minutes later|pg||
nt|wkc:  it's interesting to stop at 3@S while the other room compete to 5@S|pg||
nt|cc469: thanks for having me :)|pg||
nt|wkc:  much much reasonable right now|pg||
pc|hK|nt|eieio: It's a well-played set by both teams|pg||
nt|eieio: They are all college students|pg||
nt|lorderic: I agree. NS play solid (and aggressively) on this table|pg||
pc|h6|nt|wkc:  N knows S don't have much point because he didn't overcall after 1N|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h7|pg||
nt|cc469: ok , not too timid it seems|pg||
