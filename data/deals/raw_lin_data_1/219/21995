nt|psyck: this is certainly not a drury hand, i don't like 3@h mixed either, would chose between 2@s & 4@h|pg||
nt|rv: in such close tight matches, accuracy is very important, this 2 IMP loss could yet prove crucial for Aristos|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: Sundar wondering if @D ruff may be the only trick for defense?|pg||
nt|rv: from passed hand, I like to play 1M-3M as mixed raise and 1M-2@s/3m (jumps) as fit showing|pg||

nt|henryb:  4@s = no singleton|pg||
nt|henryb:  maybe|pg||
nt|rv: please note East's direct 4@c splinter will be limited to 10-12, Sundarram has too much hence Jacoby and not splinter|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Henry|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: i cant read the explanations on paper... Sundar's side of the screen|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hi|pg||
nt|rv: splinters should be limited to narrow range since it takes away too much bidding space|pg||
nt|rv: Sundarram can afford 5 level, but he is not sure of how to move forward|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: 4 wasted HCPs in JMs hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: if he bids 5@d, JM may sign-off|pg||
nt|henryb:  Actually, one can play splinters two-way: either a seven loser hand, which will usually be 10-12, or a 5 loser hand, normally about 16-17. |pg||
nt|rv: in which case strong splinter will have to take another bid|pg||
nt|henryb:  The 5 loser hand can afford to bid again over partner's signoff|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: director called by Kachchu.. maybe bcoz 5@C was bid after a very long pause|pg||
nt|rv: this could be crucial deal in the final analyses|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: i am not sure of the reason though|pg||
nt|rv: Sundarram has made a great winning bid, now after 5@d by JM, they should get there|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: oh.. it seems bcoz Sundar didnt alert 3@C earlier.... and now has explained 3@C|pg||
nt|rv: possibly Sundarram wanted to hear @d cue from JM, hence 5@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: maybe kachchu wud have wanted to dbl 3@C|pg||
