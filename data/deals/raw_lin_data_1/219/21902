nt|andyv:  that's where they were saturday:)|pg||
nt|mrdct: pages 3&4 for bill & ben|pg||
nt|mrdct: so in the EW methods all one-level openings are frocing for one round|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed,    N-S are    Stamatov - Karianov|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They play Precision|pg||
nt|mrdct: so about 14+hcp|pg||
nt|sybarra: how did we not make 6 @C?|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh I see,  the @D ruff :( unlucky |pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if Yeh partnerships are playing standard or some Precision pairs|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: good start for FT|pg||
mb|1D|nt|Walddk2: all Bulgarian top pairs do|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: and NS   akama-maruyama  [not sure who's where]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=game force   a bunch of hand types  in this case  balanced  [no singleton or void]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my dream is that someday  BBO will work on software for operator and there will be functionality to just INSERT PASS  instead of having to do all of those UNDOs|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: EW in OR is team leader of FT.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: They use Blue club oriented system.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mrdct: 2@s is 10-13 5+ @s|pg||
nt|mrdct: so east is clear a big max for his bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not 1@C from east|pg||
nt|ahollan1: P-1@C-P-  then  1@H=4+@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: *clearly|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: NS of this room i know each of them, but pd-ship i don't know|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: 1@S RELAY  |pg||
nt|mrdct: btw - i'm going to predict bill jacobs is sitting east as ben thompson is a bit more agressive and would probably open 1@s with the east cards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, Bill is always E and N I noticed|pg||
nt|mrdct: believe it or not i've never noticed that|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Normal ? 2/1, i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: i think the 1st two matches are up|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|nt|pole_as_ch: NS in this room are wife(N) & hus(S)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: operator won't be able to lead   so then auction should get fixed|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: 2@C balanced  8-11 or 15+ hcp|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/home////tabid/223/Default.aspx  for tournament website. No results yet I'm afraid. They only update the page once a day if memory serves|pg||
nt|mrdct: poor result for Oz in the open room|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: sry, i have no detail about Chaina Geely Auto members|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mrdct: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/home/English/nec/17th/results/7thFeb/tabid/665/Default.aspx|pg||
nt|Walddk2: thx|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: 2N broke out of relay so East guaranteed declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vP's 1@S [RHO's suit]  showing the 2 unbid suits|pg||
pc|d5|nt|pole_as_ch: They (NS) prefer schenken|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|eamongall: yes first two rounds are up ... and 3rd round was only finished ... |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: if someone teach me |pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: 3@D = 4/5@D  not 4@H/@S|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: Andy was referring to the Dutch Premiere League final that was on BBO last weekend|pg||
nt|andyv:  declarer starts with 8 tricks and has 2 4-3 suits to find the 9th, or the @d suit.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mrdct: the problem in the open rooms is with only one @s stopper you need cashing tricks on top which just weren't there|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW team won by 1 imp after trailing by a bunch after 4 round|pg||
pc|h9|nt|andyv:  yes, they certainly made a quick turnaround to get to this tourney|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: it's not unreasonable to play 1@S as natural even though RHO has shown 4+  since 1N by passed hand is available to show the 2 unbid|pg||
nt|vugraphzws: Sorry for wrong bits.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mrdct: needs to make this to hold the damage to 5 imps - otherwise it's 8 imps out|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they did that last year too|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Walddk2: Operator, please insert names        North:  Stamatov     South: Danailov       East: Jacobs      West: Thompson|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: and went on to win the NEC Cup|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|mrdct: in fact when i last played against them i was south and screenmates with bill, but that may have been because ben didn't want to be screenmates with me|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|andyv:  when you are good, you are good|pg||

nt|sybarra: Website for this event: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/home////tabid/223/Default.aspx|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: curious that South didn't overcall this time|pg||

pc|s4|pc|d7|pc|c5|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 1@C  14+ with clubs or 15+ balanced|pg||

nt|andyv:  of course I can't see anyone passing with the W hand over 4@d|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Bad performance by papa-sentsui.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Possible club slam here, but it's poor, below 40%|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: does 1N deny 4@S?     probably  otherwise North would probably use some form of checkback|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: 2-way checkback  or  new minor force?    probably 2-way  so  2@D = artificial game force|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sybarra: may now get pushed too high?    can they even beat 4 @S?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: checkback was used in other room so Patrick Huang avoided @S lead -- but his choice of @HK wasn't a success either|pg||

nt|fabsayc: probably not but|pg||
nt|sybarra2: ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  you have all the controls ...only a question if you can set up @cs on ruffs|pg||
nt|andyv:  the poor @s spots may determine if they go on |pg||
nt|sybarra2: or smother 10 of @S? |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  you can also try the @d suit |pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@s is 8-10 bal and 3@d asks for a major I'm told|pg||

pc|s9|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this mostly needs two diamonds to survice, then a straight cross ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if @D lead 3rd/5th then unlikely choice of crossruff|pg||
nt|andyv:  if leads are 3-5, W may already know what is going on|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1N=4@H and 5+@C/@D   i think this is absolute maximum for the Raptor 1N overcall|pg||
mb|3D|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: by the huge margin of 1 imp     Dutch Premier League   i get the feeling it is analogous to the ACBL's Grand National Team|pg||

nt|ahollan1: more than the GNT?|pg||

mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: North calmly pass !|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@S forcing     2@C=5-7 HCP, 0-2@S, not 6+@C/@D  [3m], not 5+@H [2@D]|pg||
nt|sybarra2: van Prooijen-Verhees, playing in the closed room, won the Dutch Teams Championship (by 1 IMP!) less than 36 hours ago. They must be jet-lagged. Quite a journey from Amsterdam to ...|pg||

nt|sybarra2: playing here |pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmmmmm   i thought 2N showed 6+@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and game force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H confirms @C and shows extras  [i think]   maybe just extras|pg||
mb|4S|mb|d|nt|fabsayc: how can it be game force after negative 1@D?|pg||
nt|vugraphzws: Alert with P is miss.sorry|pg||
mb|5D|nt|pole_as_ch: in OR, West's 1NT !  humm.|pg||
nt|mrdct: i guess there is chance for declarer to over think a potential bad trump break going for an endplay in @d|pg||
nt|mrdct: which could be indicated with the @H opening by west|pg||
nt|mrdct: btw 2@h is 10-13 5+@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: can be weaker in 3rd|pg||
nt|mrdct: the east-west system has no weak 2 available so with hands like west you need to improvise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if 3@C again pass/correct then 2@H was just showing max|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  card says 1@s was a balanced relay so probably couldn|pg||

mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: no   1@S=relay over 1@H response|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra2: do we hear the screaching of brakes?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: over 1@D   1@H/@S look like matchpoint precision / meckwell ...   4+suit, one-round force|pg||
mb|p|pc|sQ|pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: to account for the artificial 1N overcall   EW DBL isn't pure takeout shape -- can include normal strong NT|pg||
