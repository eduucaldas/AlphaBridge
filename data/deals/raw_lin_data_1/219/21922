nt|sybarra: we have the ladies agst the women,  not sure difference  age maybe?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Alert of 1@D implies  West=Verhees  East=vanProoijen|pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|nt|sybarra: we will get names up shortly  just relax |pg||

nt|ahollan1: so    2@D denies 4@H else  Raptor 1N overcall|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: EW carding will be  upside-down count & attitude   odd/even discard|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 2@s wanna TRF to 3@c but opener ???|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NEDUK is trying to defend the title they won in 2011|pg||

pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: swiss team qualifies 8 teams to knockout phase|pg||
nt|ahollan1: swiss matches  14 boards in 2 hours|pg||
nt|andyv:  this is the 17th NEC Cup as the above site mentions|pg||
nt|petergill: The NS team is Klinger - Mullamphy - Jacobs - Thompson from Australia|pg||
pc|h3|nt|eamongall: I think the names are left over from previous match as Brown Stockdale are English Ladies |pg||
nt|ahollan1: NEDUK won the 2011 NEC Cup|pg||
pc|h4|nt|pole_as_ch: auuu, pennarized !|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|petergill: -2, -3 and -1 all look possible|pg||
nt|petergill: Hard for declarer to place East with the @D honours on this bidding|pg||
nt|petergill: 2NT was both minors|pg||
nt|petergill: The names shown on BBO are remnants from Round 11|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pole_as_ch: operater, Right names, Pls !!|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mrdct: based on what's entered for the open room - we have Thompson-Jacobs EW here|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|eamongall: however I am sure it will get fixed when operator gets a break in the play :) ...its very hard to be a vugraph operator |pg||

nt|mrdct: yes - it looks like the vugraph weren't given the hand data files until right on starting time|pg||
pc|hA|nt|andyv:  all's well despite the bad @h break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tournament page  http://www.jcbl.or.jp/home/////tabid/657/Default.aspx    includes links to much useful info including Daily Bulletins that include Team Rosters and Conditions of ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Contest|pg||
pc|h9|pc|s9|pc|h2|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh ? can make ??|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: we won't have Voice Commentary until the Knockout Phase|pg||
nt|petergill: Ace and a small club might have worked better, with partner having such good @d's and West having poor @D pips|pg||
pc|d7|nt|eamongall: Usually there is one person who goes around the vugraph tables and loads the hands each match ...I have done it ... its a busy time |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kiwibridge: who loads the names :(|pg||

pc|d5|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Operater !!!  Players name!  Right players name !!!  pls !!!|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|d8|nt|andyv:  a @s lead would probably have been better as E wouldn't be able to pull all the trump before he knocked out the A of @c|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Do we have Jacobs - Thompson   N-S   Dave?|pg||
nt|eamongall: Every event has new operators and after a few rounds they become experienced and learn stuff |pg||
nt|mrdct: but as it happens a low trump was going to work better as east is forced to rise Q and then doesn't have the tempo to take his trick|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: EW rather|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|petergill: but declarer has to allow for the fact that West might not overruff @D7 with @DQ|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|nt|petergill: Hence this play which leads to 500 I think|pg||

nt|andyv:  that's where they were saturday:)|pg||
nt|mrdct: pages 3&4 for bill & ben|pg||
nt|mrdct: so in the EW methods all one-level openings are frocing for one round|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed,    N-S are    Stamatov - Karianov|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They play Precision|pg||
nt|mrdct: so about 14+hcp|pg||
nt|sybarra: how did we not make 6 @C?|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh I see,  the @D ruff :( unlucky |pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if Yeh partnerships are playing standard or some Precision pairs|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: good start for FT|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Walddk2: all Bulgarian top pairs do|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: and NS   akama-maruyama  [not sure who's where]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=game force   a bunch of hand types  in this case  balanced  [no singleton or void]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my dream is that someday  BBO will work on software for operator and there will be functionality to just INSERT PASS  instead of having to do all of those UNDOs|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: EW in OR is team leader of FT.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: They use Blue club oriented system.|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry, 500 was only possible if West ducked @CK (he played ace) - even then it might be 300|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: 2@s is 10-13 5+ @s|pg||
nt|mrdct: so east is clear a big max for his bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not 1@C from east|pg||
nt|ahollan1: P-1@C-P-  then  1@H=4+@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ew do NOT play Namyats, so 4@S is wide range|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mrdct: *clearly|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: NS of this room i know each of them, but pd-ship i don't know|pg||
nt|cc469: 12 tricks|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: 1@S RELAY  |pg||
nt|mrdct: btw - i'm going to predict bill jacobs is sitting east as ben thompson is a bit more agressive and would probably open 1@s with the east cards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, Bill is always E and N I noticed|pg||
nt|mrdct: believe it or not i've never noticed that|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Normal ? 2/1, i guess|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mrdct: i think the 1st two matches are up|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|pole_as_ch: NS in this room are wife(N) & hus(S)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: operator won't be able to lead   so then auction should get fixed|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: 2@C balanced  8-11 or 15+ hcp|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/home////tabid/223/Default.aspx  for tournament website. No results yet I'm afraid. They only update the page once a day if memory serves|pg||
nt|mrdct: poor result for Oz in the open room|pg||

pc|cK|pc|s5|pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: 2N broke out of relay so East guaranteed declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vP's 1@S [RHO's suit]  showing the 2 unbid suits|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: They (NS) prefer schenken|pg||
nt|sybarra: hopefully we will get the names of players sorted out shortly |pg||
pc|s8|nt|eamongall: yes first two rounds are up ... and 3rd round was only finished ... |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: if someone teach me |pg||
pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: 3@D = 4/5@D  not 4@H/@S|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: Andy was referring to the Dutch Premiere League final that was on BBO last weekend|pg||
nt|andyv:  declarer starts with 8 tricks and has 2 4-3 suits to find the 9th, or the @d suit.|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|mrdct: the problem in the open rooms is with only one @s stopper you need cashing tricks on top which just weren't there|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: EW team won by 1 imp after trailing by a bunch after 4 round|pg||
pc|d3|nt|andyv:  yes, they certainly made a quick turnaround to get to this tourney|pg||
nt|kemperg: leader may play for 3@D at siide of 3!@Hs, that wont work|pg||
nt|kemperg: down now, cant finesse twice anymore|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ahollan1: it's not unreasonable to play 1@S as natural even though RHO has shown 4+  since 1N by passed hand is available to show the 2 unbid|pg||
nt|vugraphzws: Sorry for wrong bits.|pg||
nt|sybarra: tese are left over from last match |pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 17  5@DX East|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|mrdct: needs to make this to hold the damage to 5 imps - otherwise it's 8 imps out|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm pretty sure  W=Verhees  E=vProoijen|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: they did that last year too|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk2: Operator, please insert names        North:  Stamatov     South: Danailov       East: Jacobs      West: Thompson|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and went on to win the NEC Cup|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mrdct: in fact when i last played against them i was south and screenmates with bill, but that may have been because ben didn't want to be screenmates with me|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Well, if you take the 'save' over 6@C a lot can go wrong|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3@d looks like a splinter which is usually il-advised with a stiff ace|pg||
nt|mrdct: but it might mean something else|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would Shih also open 1N if distribution was 4225|pg||
nt|twcho: whoever south is, they are not regular partner|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=a) 4441@D, any  b) 4@S, BAL, 12-14  c) 5+@S 4+@D, min  or 55 MAX|pg||
pc|sK|nt|petergill: I think 2@S was forcing with less than 5 spades, and that with 5+ spades Sth would respond 2NT, but I do not guarantee that|pg||
pc|s5|nt|andyv:  the 2@h bid may have caused EW to underestimate their values|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 1@s open because of Scenken system.|pg||
nt|mrdct: so west's actions have talked NS out of 3NT|pg||

nt|sybarra2: yes thank you all |pg||
nt|andyv:  important to remember that EW do not have any weak 2 bids|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@S=10-15 HCP, 4+@S   if 2-suits  the other is LONGER|pg||
nt|twcho: east didn't open|pg||
mb|2H|nt|andyv:  except for 2@s...all the other bids are reserved because of the canape bids|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C  10-13  5+ clubs, unbalanced|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They right-sided hearts now so to speak|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not easy for Dido to lead a club|pg||
nt|mrdct: roland's analysis better than mine - the looming @c ruff and promotion of the @hJ the ket here to beat 6@h|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@d in an inv+ relay|pg||
nt|sybarra: suspecting precision here |pg||
nt|xenya: hello Germ|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: *is|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra2: canape |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D guarantees LONGER @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and minimum|pg||
nt|sybarra2: I never have been able to figure out the advantage here |pg||
mb|p|pc|s7|nt|pole_as_ch: uh! 4@h can make, but can they reach to there ?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: 2@S is a treatment i haven't seen before|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe part of transfer advances???|pg||
nt|mrdct: @d lead by south may also beat 6@h as declarer will try to pitch the losing @d on the @CAK|pg||
nt|xenya: tricky hand, this|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|andyv:  got me on that one|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: No! NS in OR go there !  10 imp would swing.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|xenya: NS have full game values but...|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|nt|petergill: Should South overcall 2@C? Fav vul = good - in Sabine Auken's book, she explains why 3@C overcall of 1@D can work well - EW have 2 unbid majors so might miss the 4-4 major fit. |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably typical contract |pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW require decent 12 hcp to open balanced hands so  vProoijen PASS|pg||
nt|kemperg: Yeh Bros on 6th place, ONI-TAKA 4/5|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sybarra: Frank,  we commented earlier about the names of teams,  women vs ladies   |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N = 15-17|pg||

nt|sybarra: where is 9th trick ? |pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|nt|mrdct: indeed it looks like anything other than @SA will beat it|pg||
nt|mrdct: sorry everyone - i have a no-GIB policy when commentating so expect serious misanalysis!|pg||
nt|mrdct: looks like only a LOW @s will let it make|pg||
nt|mrdct: trumps might be the likely lead here|pg||

pc|c5|nt|andyv:  whatever it is, it will be 2 tricks short|pg||

nt|ahollan1: seems all choices there led to -1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C or 1@D for South?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: scores thru round 9 are posted at  http://www.jcbl.or.jp/home/English/nec/17th/results/tabid/659/Default.aspx|pg||
nt|xenya: normal result, although 4@H makes|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|ahollan1: so it goes|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|pole_as_ch: oh, open! so they go to 4@s !|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: cu frank |pg||
nt|sybarra: thx for helping |pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D GF ... artificial = @H?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: 2@C Precision  most Chinese pairs play 6+@C OR 5@C & 4@H/@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: 4@H = signoff, minimum |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mrdct: 6@d tricks is a good start for 3NT NS but EW can get to their 5 before NS establish their tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after 9    NEDUK leading with 173   China Geely 2nd with 170|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: does 1N deny 4@S?     probably  otherwise North would probably use some form of checkback|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: 2-way checkback  or  new minor force?    probably 2-way  so  2@D = artificial game force|pg||
nt|twcho: yes, rather standard precision which is suitable for irregular partnership|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|sybarra: may now get pushed too high?    can they even beat 4 @S?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: checkback was used in other room so Patrick Huang avoided @S lead -- but his choice of @HK wasn't a success either|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in North America the top big club pairs are playing 2@C always 6+@C|pg||
nt|twcho: and NS aren't regular partners|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: then again  playing 2-way checkback  South might bid @C|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: well cannot make. but 2 off ?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: can N get in to lead club? |pg||
nt|sybarra: just take 4 aces   easier |pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|petergill: Best % play of @h suit in 6@H is ace - picks up bare king in either hand|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: another possible squeeze -- but this one doesn't work|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mrdct: losing 2@c, 1@h and 1@s so need to get @d right to make|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mrdct: predicated on a @c switch by west now which may not be so easy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlikely @D plays|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d5|nt|xenya: still can't make it on a @S return|pg||
nt|mrdct: wd bro|pg||
nt|ahollan1: either @DJ still in dummy or @DQ still in hand|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|petergill: but in 4@H, have to consider if safety play of low to @H queen (picks up KJx in either hand) - is safe or unsafe|pg||

nt|sybarra: lots of @H's between e/w |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 2 @D looks like multi again|pg||
nt|petergill: in 6@H - running @HQ picks up only one case - bare jack in North - so if an expert does such play against you successfully, you should hold your cards further back|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D=relay  but doesn't promise any points|pg||

mb|2C|nt|andyv:  again because of canape style, W restricted in his choice of openings|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @C as to transfer into suit (I think) |pg||
nt|vugraphzws: Sorry for mistake.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in 3rd seat, they'll open some balanced hands that don't get opened in 1st/2nd|pg||

nt|mrdct: Oz Players here are 2/3 of the runners-up in Australia National Open Teams from a couple of weeks ago|pg||

nt|sybarra: just not sure how they play this |pg||
nt|sybarra2: how to find out you have no wasted values in @H's |pg||
nt|mrdct: reasonable 3rd seat opening by north|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: EW in OR already go to there ! heww!|pg||

nt|mrdct: but content to resign when p bids his singleton|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: 2N relay for distribution|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N=5@S 5@C 1@H|pg||
nt|mrdct: close to mirrored shapes here for NS which is often dangerous, but there's no ruff on for the defence so @SA and @DAK only to lose|pg||
pc|d2|nt|fabsayc: now east hunting for slam, and may well bid it|pg||

pc|dK|pg||
nt|mrdct: beyond the 1@c strong club opening - i have no idea what the rest menas|pg||
nt|ahollan1: especially if you have my short neck|pg||
nt|ahollan1: finding @H -- what fun is that?|pg||
nt|twcho: last bd, north misdefend by continuing his @d and squeezed south on the way|pg||
nt|xenya: and E miight be tempted|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: 4@D forces 4@H   |pg||
nt|sybarra2: do you really want to be in this slam?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: probably not but|pg||
nt|sybarra2: ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  you have all the controls ...only a question if you can set up @cs on ruffs|pg||
nt|andyv:  the poor @s spots may determine if they go on |pg||
nt|sybarra2: or smother 10 of @S? |pg||
pc|c6|nt|andyv:  you can also try the @d suit |pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@s is 8-10 bal and 3@d asks for a major I'm told|pg||
pc|c4|nt|twcho: he should return a @s to break up the squeeze|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@S = light third seat non-vul openings are all the rage among genuine experts - the older experts like to open 2@S (or equivalent) in 3rd seat (takes away more bidding space) - ...|pg||
nt|petergill: the newer experts find 1@S more effective overall (less revealing to opponents in the card play)|pg||
nt|mrdct: had north passed initially i guess NS would get to 1NT makiing 7 or 8 tricks|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|mrdct: and then 3@h is a transfer to get the strong hand to play it|pg||
nt|mrdct: thanks specs!|pg||
nt|twcho: Top eight teams will enter the KO stage|pg||
nt|xenya: well...|pg||
nt|kemperg: 5@H are your @Hs good?|pg||
nt|kemperg: and W tinks AHx is enough|pg||
nt|xenya: EW lack 2 keycards, but luckily for them, they have failed to to find that out|pg||
nt|kemperg: no fancy play, trying to catch 10x in N and its made|pg||
pc|hK|nt|pole_as_ch: 4@s maybe voidwood ?|pg||

nt|mrdct: if any of you good analyst out there want to join me feel free|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: finishing in top 3 is helpful   1 chooses opponent from 5-8, then  2, then  3  [ 4 gets stuck with remaining team]|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kemperg: claim|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: 4@D set @S    4@H=avg+ or max  then RKC|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: ummm, they also go !  nice auction! |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|fabsayc: this mostly needs two diamonds to survice, then a straight cross ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if @D lead 3rd/5th then unlikely choice of crossruff|pg||
nt|andyv:  if leads are 3-5, W may already know what is going on|pg||
nt|mrdct: obviously with north having already bid @s the transfer benefits are not there - but often you need to stick to your generla structure|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h7|nt|fabsayc: yes i dont think he will play that way, i was talking in abstract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: double dummy players will  pin north's @S10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and finesse in @C|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think before the lead, @d suit looks as promising as anything else|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: No snag. cold slam !|pg||

pc|s3|pc|hT|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: RDBL may trf to @c.|pg||
nt|mrdct: looks like a routine 4@s here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=4@H and 5+@C/@D   i think this is absolute maximum for the Raptor 1N overcall|pg||
nt|mrdct: with two balanced hands EW may choose 3NT here|pg||
nt|petergill: I think West should have played his top spades (not @CK) on which East could indicate @CA somehow - for 800|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C strong|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|ahollan1:  24  Jianming in 4@SX West|pg||
nt|petergill: Dbl probably shows about 6 or 7 points, was not penalty|pg||
nt|mrdct: can ben find a reason to lead @h?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: by the huge margin of 1 imp     Dutch Premier League   i get the feeling it is analogous to the ACBL's Grand National Team|pg||
nt|sybarra2: I think a bit more than that |pg||
nt|sybarra2: I would put it more like the Reisinger |pg||
nt|ahollan1: more than the GNT?|pg||
nt|sybarra2: maybe you feel that GNT is more than I do |pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh  in importance   i made comparison because it runs over multiple months  starting at club level|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|pole_as_ch: North calmly pass !|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C = pass/correct|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@S = 4+@S [possible canape with longer minor]|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@S four or five spades|pg||
nt|sybarra2: ok that is true |pg||
nt|sybarra2: re over many months|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: 1@S forcing     2@C=5-7 HCP, 0-2@S, not 6+@C/@D  [3m], not 5+@H [2@D]|pg||
nt|sybarra2: van Prooijen-Verhees, playing in the closed room, won the Dutch Teams Championship (by 1 IMP!) less than 36 hours ago. They must be jet-lagged. Quite a journey from Amsterdam to ...|pg||
nt|sybarra2: ...|pg||
nt|sybarra2: to Japan|pg||
nt|sybarra2: playing here |pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmmmmm   i thought 2N showed 6+@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and game force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H confirms @C and shows extras  [i think]   maybe just extras|pg||
nt|petergill: Pass by West, converting East's Dbl for penalties, yields 800 or 1100 or more, I think|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|fabsayc: how can it be game force after negative 1@D?|pg||
nt|vugraphzws: Alert with P is miss.sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: in OR, West's 1NT !  humm.|pg||
nt|mrdct: i guess there is chance for declarer to over think a potential bad trump break going for an endplay in @d|pg||
nt|mrdct: which could be indicated with the @H opening by west|pg||
nt|mrdct: btw 2@h is 10-13 5+@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: can be weaker in 3rd|pg||
nt|mrdct: the east-west system has no weak 2 available so with hands like west you need to improvise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if 3@C again pass/correct then 2@H was just showing max|pg||
nt|kemperg: dbl = support 3@Hs|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  card says 1@s was a balanced relay so probably couldn|pg||
nt|andyv:  couldn't hold 6 spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: either my notes or vP's bid are wrong|pg||
nt|ahollan1: fun system to study     i first saw Ultimate Canape played by Russ Ekeblad   the Dutch have made some minor changes but the overall structure is intact|pg||
mb|p|pc|dK|nt|petergill: 4@S should make, but is not totally cold|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: no   1@S=relay over 1@H response|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was about to say  best contract 1N [which they can't reach]   when result from other room popped up|pg||
nt|petergill: the sort of contract an expert should make and an average player might not make|pg||
nt|petergill: On this lead, 4@S is even colder|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sybarra2: do we hear the screaching of brakes?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: over 1@D   1@H/@S look like matchpoint precision / meckwell ...   4+suit, one-round force|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: to account for the artificial 1N overcall   EW DBL isn't pure takeout shape -- can include normal strong NT|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|mrdct: @D10 is a good card|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|d2|nt|cc469: curious @H duck|pg||

pc|s3|nt|sybarra: not likely to see dummy |pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: did he want to save @C10 for later??|pg||
nt|mrdct: danger for declarer is ruffing stuff early and lsoing control when the bad trump break reveals itsel;f|pg||

pc|d4|pc|c9|pg||

nt|ahollan1:  11 in other room after 1@C and interference|pg||
nt|andyv:  13 also a disaster for NS as 4@s was set in OR|pg||
nt|mrdct: poor result for Oz in the open room|pg||
nt|timb: David, that is an understatemet (too say the least) of a very British kind|pg||
nt|mrdct: in fairness to matt muulamphy - what else do you suggest he does when a green vs red 3@h preempt come around to him|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H =   see previous note|pg||
nt|vugraphzws: No, 20|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: yes if i can bring a cheat sheet to all events|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this time with canape [2nd suit longer] |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  sorry, 10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3rd 2@C opener|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: now difficult 4 @s|pg||
nt|sybarra2: this is the "I have an opening bid" 1 @D |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15 HCP, 0+@D, maybe longer @C/@S, but NOT @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as here  often weak NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=4+ fit|pg||
mb|1N|nt|petergill: 12-14 in 4th seat|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: and 3rd 2@D response|pg||
nt|ahollan1: RDBL=4+@H|pg||
nt|xenya: if 20 is the limit, 4N looks purposeless|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  must be nice to have so many hands fit into your system:)|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 1@h = @s showing, and 2@s = 4 card @s  maybe !|pg||
nt|Walddk4: yes, and a minimum|pg||
pc|c2|nt|andyv:  S had a pretty easy dbl |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: thx Roland.|pg||
nt|mrdct: typically aggressive fav vul preempt by ben|pg||
nt|cc469: has to just guess the @H in 4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  25  [the weird 2N opener]   South playing 3@S|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: yep  define the system then make arrangements with The Great Shuffler|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS are rapidly becoming spectators in these auctions|pg||
nt|petergill: other table Bd 26: Ron Klinger is in 4@S, should make it|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Walddk4: Declarer mistimed this in the open room|pg||
pc|s6|nt|pole_as_ch: 3NT would be better contruct, but West choiced 4@s.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H holding 4  means  either weak NT or  4414/4405|pg||
nt|cc469: that should help the @H guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzws: 2NT maybe 20-21|pg||
nt|xenya: well a good 21 could be enough for slam|pg||
nt|xenya: 21 plus a 5-carder for example|pg||
nt|kemperg: we might upgrade that|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|pg||
nt|andyv:  you aren't dealt NT hands in order to be passing |pg||
nt|ahollan1: vP described 7+@C again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would you overcall 2N or DBL Andy?|pg||
nt|mrdct: not a challenging lead fro declarer - this should make easiluy'|pg||
pc|sT|nt|pole_as_ch: 3 in @s, 3 in @h, 1 in @d, 1 in @C, so 8 tricks.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pc|s4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if west bid 4@H   does south bid 4@S|pg||
nt|twcho: south won't bid for sure|pg||
nt|twcho: north may consider|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kemperg: so it depends on their style|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|nt|andyv:  dbl|pg||
nt|ahollan1: remember  2@C could be 4@C and 5+@S|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|petergill: I would have played a heart, not a 2nd spade. |pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer might have to guess @h's now|pg||
nt|mrdct: yeah he's a bit tangled up now|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: agree|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 2 ruff in each hand is not enought, because South would ruff 3rd @h.|pg||
nt|cc469: he seemed to thinkl a long time over 2@H|pg||
nt|xenya: true, but S was a passed hand, so no risk really |pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|nt|kemperg: 44 imps is 25 I hear from Roland|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they are accurate enough that north might have considered 3@H over west's pass|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't like Kx as stopper when opps say they have 6 of them...can't even hold up once|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and for those who pay attention to trivia   this is 2nd 8-card @S suit of the set|pg||
nt|kemperg: 25-5|pg||
pc|c6|nt|pole_as_ch: Defender shoud attack @c |pg||
nt|timb: "Disastrous" springs to mind as the correct description  - though I do feel Matt M was unlucky|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|nt|sybarra: ok  we will see what we need in 1/2 hour |pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|xenya: severe blow for Yeh Bros|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kemperg: out of first 8 temporarely|pg||
pc|h6|nt|petergill: Defence is sharp - count signals (not Smith Signal) made continuation of @S's findable |pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mrdct: EW might pencil this in as a good result|pg||
nt|xenya: how many more rounds to play?|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1 up now|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||

nt|vugraphzws: Sorry I cant watch what happened.|pg||
nt|vugraphzws: Result is 2 up|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: right  over normal Precision 2@C where length guaranteed  DBL is clear|pg||
mc|8|nt|petergill: Yes, dbl finesse in @h's was right play - fails only if K and J with East = 25% chance|pg||

nt|ahollan1:  11  [the long auction to 5@C]  Miyakuni 3N West|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, South could have defeated it (ruffing @DK)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: should North bid game?    red vs white 'preempt' in sandwich position??|pg||
nt|twcho: I think north should respect his partner bidding|pg||
nt|twcho: likely providing 7+ tricks (likely more) for his red vs white bid|pg||
nt|twcho: and bid the game|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sybarra2: bd 11 3 nt +2 in the other room |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: that picked up 2 overtrick imps   but  5@C much better at imps|pg||
nt|sybarra2: dealing machine having fun with club suit|pg||
nt|petergill: 12-14, bal or semi-bal, playing Fantunes System|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|ahollan1: how many @C has vanProoijen held this set?|pg||
nt|sybarra2: the Yeh Bros team is:  Chen Yeh, JuiYiu Shih, ChiMou Lin, Herstein Liu, Patrick Huang, Grace Lin |pg||
nt|sybarra2: and they Yeh Bros sponsor a great tourney also shown on bbo |pg||
nt|ahollan1: agree|pg||
nt|cc469: yes, but 8 card suit?|pg||
nt|petergill: transfer to @H|pg||
nt|mrdct: going with the odds and transfering to his 5cM|pg||
nt|petergill: tfr to 1H or other gf, 2@D did not promise @H|pg||
nt|petergill: if GF|pg||
nt|mrdct: may have considered waiting for the balancing dbl and then run to @d if necessary|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D = tfr to @H or game Force|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: 2 bd is remains. 40imp is 25-5 ! |pg||
nt|Walddk4: But it looked natural to him to get rid of his last heart|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ hcp|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=game force, 5+@S|pg||
nt|xenya: 1@S? -- is that @Ds?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  a lot|pg||
nt|andyv:  6@d is the lucky spot on this hand|pg||
nt|mrdct: Oz might win those imps back here|pg||
nt|mrdct: 7@h seems kind of extreme on these EW cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra2: another invitation tourney |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Patrick Huang bid only 2N  but still got to game|pg||
nt|xenya: or 1N?|pg||
nt|petergill: take the plus? |pg||
nt|petergill: or 2@S - 3@S - 4@S? |pg||
nt|petergill: dbl of 2@H is t/o|pg||
nt|mrdct: the GF option muddies the water here for W|pg||
nt|petergill: West did not expect it to be GF|pg||
nt|petergill: I think 2@S the first time is best - 3@S - 4@S |pg||
nt|petergill: but perhaps 4@S is hard to bid after the weak 1NT|pg||
nt|mrdct: yes, but the GF option affect the meanings of double of 2@d|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H if passed out will be about 300|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@S will be 620 or 650, 2@S will be 170 or 200|pg||
nt|petergill: With good shape, it's a bidder's game. Shape rules.|pg||
nt|mrdct: if 2@h is dbled, can NS escape to 3@d?|pg||
nt|petergill: I think 2@S the previous time is best, as the delayed 2@S sounds "balancing" or weaker |pg||
nt|petergill: so 2@S now might get passed by East|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra2: Patrick is a frequent commentator with us (when not playing) |pg||
nt|sybarra2: he also lived in Netherlands for many years and probably "brought these dutchies up" |pg||
nt|ahollan1: which black suit to attack??    that answer affects play to trick 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D lead director rather than showing 2 suiter missing the boss suit|pg||
nt|twcho: does 2@s here guarantee 4 cards support?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i doubt it|pg||
nt|mrdct: decided to take the plus|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sybarra: and a quiet part score |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sybarra: there is one more hand after this hand |pg||
nt|twcho: yes, I doubt it too. :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|andyv:  redbl...first round control|pg||
nt|ahollan1: also an icon in the bridge world   has been playing international level bridge since late 1950s|pg||
nt|kemperg: sorry dont know|pg||
nt|petergill: other table: On Bd 27, EW have found their way into the auction, so it might be a swing to Australia. |pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|mrdct: only an 8-card fit, west is balanced, dodgey stiff @DK in east|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: we want to thank our operator for wonder presentation |pg||
nt|xenya: i think he can make it|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1:  12  after 1@C auction  Bakhsi had no trouble finding DBL  and they've found @H|pg||
nt|sybarra2: not sure I really want to be there however |pg||
nt|fabsayc: i would not even cue with norths non=opener|pg||
nt|ahollan1: may not be an option in the partnership|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he could bid bid 4@S over the double surely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i.e.  common agreement  MUST return cuebid if available below game|pg||
nt|mrdct: 1NT is 10+ bal GF|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: different situation when 1 hand shows 5+ AND forces to game   versus  competitive bidding war|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|mrdct: 1@c is 14+|pg||
nt|xenya: possibly with an overtrick|pg||
pc|sA|nt|fabsayc: is prooijen pretending to lead a singleton|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mrdct: 2@h and 3@h look natural|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3@s i guess is a cue and 3NT is a slam try|pg||
nt|mrdct: beyond that i'm guessing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: see  @D lead director|pg||
pc|s5|nt|pole_as_ch: good contruct !  it looks cold.  so 5 imps buck.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one of the first to play Precision  [helped CC Wei with some system clarification  or maybe just in introducing the system in Taiwan]|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to NEC and the Japan Contract Bridge League for bringing this wonderful tourney once again to bbo |pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|nt|petergill: 3@S over 2@H is too risky for me - singleton heart in partner's hand seems wasted opposite KQJ10|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mrdct: suggested to me that 3NT might be blackwood and 4NT king ask|pg||
nt|mrdct: which does eem to fit|pg||
nt|mrdct: *seem|pg||

nt|mrdct: *for|pg||
nt|mrdct: managing this 5-0 @h break will take some care|pg||
nt|petergill: From West's point of view, N's expected doubleton heart makes North more likely to have 4 spades = bad for bidding @S's|pg||
