nt|ahollan1: rumor mill [web page not updated yet]   thru 7 of 12 rounds    china W2 134, Bulg A stars 131, ontaka 130, china Geely auto NEDUK down under 129 , Hackett 126 Stmatov 123|pg||
nt|petergill: Because their other openings are mostly 9-13, NS regard 14+ as "strong"|pg||
nt|petergill: North feeling uncomfortable, as 3@D might be a 4-2 fit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL was takeout|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: certainly he had better chance than in other room|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if this is not good enough they need to revise system, considering east also had 2nt for minors|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: 1NT will make 3NT a make because east won't lead a diamond|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: same as OR. and plsy ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems rich with minimum 1@C opener and weak suits|pg||
nt|petergill: Best for N to pass, as 3@S would be doubled by W|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Newell PASS just denies ability to game force|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|pole_as_ch: 3rd hand should open on good suit, i dare say. |pg||

pc|cK|pc|c7|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: East can easily slow-in and end-played, nightmare|pg||
pc|s4|nt|pole_as_ch: humm. |pg||
pc|sK|nt|fluffy: the hand will make 11 tricks comfortable, but if you look in isolation the hand you would rather play 6@c than 3NT before the lead since clubs 2-2 mean 6@c makes and @c3-1 put 3NT ...|pg||

pc|c5|pc|cT|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: if my method, @c is good. so 6@c would be in scope.|pg||
nt|fluffy: lead directing openings in third are fine but they are most useful when you open light on the 10-12 range, with 16 there is not as much lead directing need IMO|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: it would still be percentage, diamond queen at least 2-1 with north after opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: 14-16 NT EW|pg||
nt|fluffy: 4@c I think it's a splinter bid, showing slam invitational values with club shortness|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh ? 1 off in OR !?|pg||
nt|fluffy: Furuta doesn't like to hold a "useless" @cAK|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: No not high, 5@d can make !|pg||
nt|petergill: 3 rounds of clubs shortens E to less trumps than S|pg||

nt|ahollan1: of course   sometimes the opponents bid 6 over 5 :)|pg||
nt|petergill: I don't like 6@h much. The assumption that partner has very short spades can be faulty, as on the actual hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and the Kings are defensive, not offensive|pg||
nt|petergill: Also, the partner of a fav vul prempter has to take into account that the fav vul prempt might make bidding a lot later very risky|pg||

nt|fabsayc: 1@S is about as ugly a bid as imaginable, i treat 2@C as a cue bid on that auction|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: it looks like push.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh buyed 3@D, and....|pg||
nt|petergill: cf Bd 19 where at fav vul sometimes they break 4-4|pg||
mb|4S|nt|petergill: Great point by Martin, assuming EW spades 5-4 not 4-4|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: Lead of @s2 is showing 3 card, maybe. |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Ito should call this, he surely|pg||
mb|5C|nt|ahollan1: i wager 2@H would get some votes in Master Solvers' Club|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: board upside-down|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: He'll raise|pg||
nt|petergill: I expect and hope for 6@C now|pg||
nt|kemperg: not the first 26  pts hand in this tournament:|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Reid's problem is that Newell could be 1444 with no @CQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but does that hand rebid 5@C over 4@S?|pg||
nt|petergill: It's not so obvious to NS that the match has turned out badly so far - e.g. their 2@H making five (Bd 23?) might be a pickup from their point of view|pg||
nt|fabsayc: even then he has diamond hook, also 7 not impossible|pg||
mb|6C|nt|pole_as_ch: UG. ducking ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@H by South|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: so  my guess of 3N-all pass was just a little off|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe that hand would bid 4NT, Al, choice of games|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very well done Martin Reid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right  so Newell 5@C does sound like 5+ suit|pg||
nt|petergill: also well done to Sartaj Hans not to bid 2@S at other table which might lead NS to 6@C|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks to everyone in Yokohama in Japan for today's broadcast. |pg||

nt|ahollan1: hehe  you convinced me too |pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: HCP?   we don't need no stinking HCP|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|Walddk4: Sure|pg||
nt|Walddk4: if he gets 5@D now he is in slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder how auction progresses if Stamatov just jumps in @H|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pole_as_ch: 2@s ???  sry, bad comment|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: and another 6 imp.  29imp is 22-8 vp.|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|petergill: Unlucky hand for weak 1NT, this one|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think it was david gold that said weak no trump is a losing proposition at the top level|pg||
pc|dT|nt|eamongall: Hanlon is normally extremely strong as a declarer but 4-1 breaks kill most of us |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: good auction to best contruct!|pg||
pc|h2|nt|eamongall: anyway tightens up the match |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes Lui played very nicely OR|pg||
pc|d6|nt|pole_as_ch: comes Chen's Ocaltic call.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Dec can catch 8 tricks easily, but 9th ?|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: why so jumping ???|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Maybe, East Opening is not 2@c, so 6 was enough, Ch3n was thought.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: *Chen|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Now Furuta safely settled 6, or not ????|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: this is 17 imp if he make this|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: and new leader !! or not ??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't think it will convince them to change the system|pg||
nt|petergill: 12 X 14 board matches, this is Round 8 of ther Swiss|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: great auction from EW|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but for sure you should keep track|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or convince Fantunes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or Hans-Nunn|pg||
nt|petergill: this will be quite a big swing, with NS vul and tough discards to be made|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well fantunes weak no trump is not normal, can be any 5422|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and 6322 and 4441|pg||
nt|petergill: Scores after 7 rounds at http://www.jcbl.or.jp/home/English/nec/17th/results/tabid/659/Default.aspx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a couple of the Japanese Seniors also weak notrumpers|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not any 5422, Martin, not 5-4 in the majors|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d9|nt|Walddk4: Nice auction, McGann making up for his rather tame 1@S (4@S and 5@D)|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: 2 bd include this only remains|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: @d7 shows @dA ?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Defence also have not tricks|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: so the move of Dec and North deside the fate.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||

pc|s6|pc|c5|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 9th will be a little fade.|pg||
nt|petergill: will be disappointed|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the dutch card play and defense is very precise, no tricks given away carelessly|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: do you think he was worth 2@S over 1@H?    is there a default about the difference between 1@S and 2@S there???|pg||

mb|2H!|nt|ahollan1: right  that's why i asked if there's a default   [if so  i don't know which applies]|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but in this case 4 spades almost guaranteed by double so less need to distinguish length|pg||
nt|eamongall: Yeh .. how come my E and A keep getting mixed up |pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: 4@s can make ??|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 3@d = 4 supp & limit raise |pg||

nt|petergill: Relays are not as important on game hands like this one, but are very good for slam hands|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: 2 @h, 1 @s and can make|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: i think 3@H asks controls  [A=2 K=1]|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: if he behave @d no loser, this can make !! |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: The call of 3@c is very good hint for Dec. so Chen might ....|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: -10 or -11 imp is not hevy lost for Tajima, but Chen should make this for his stand !!|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: but dummy entry remains ?|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|Walddk4: flat board, 11 IMPs = 18-12 VPs, but we are not quite sure that it's scored correctly throughout|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: and so a modest victory to the Hackett team|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: scores from other matches show up under  http://www.jcbl.or.jp/home/English/nec/17th/results/7thFeb/tabid/665/Default.aspx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: must choose results, NEC and then "details"|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 4@D forces 4@H to signoff   [EndSignal]|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he needs heart queen for slam (ie 12 points)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: and AKK rather than AA|pg||
