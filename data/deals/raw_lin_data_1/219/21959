nt|rick3son:  Roland are a Man U fan?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: voice commentary for both tables in the final quarter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Newell has absolute max of 13 hcp|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my guess is a [reluctant] 3N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but move @CQ to @DQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so maybe 3N isn't right|pg||

nt|fabsayc: last time i checked there were 13 tricks :)|pg||
nt|rick3son:  5 or 6 rounds of bidding later the smoke has cleared|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm uncertain about 4N   i think it is part of denial cue bidding, but always get confused there without being able to peek at my toes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: last chance for plus|pg||
nt|xenya: most will bid slam with these cards|pg||
nt|rick3son:  spade lead yields 10th trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the good news   4@D went down|pg||
nt|xenya: i retract :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ok here's a guess   4N = top card in @D [longest suit]  NO top card in @S [2nd longest]|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: much better to go down in 6@D than down in 4@D  :)|pg||

nt|sybarra: so hang on to you seats specs |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i belive China Geely Auto pair in other room is playing Precision|pg||

nt|fabsayc: this looks like moscito|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C strong|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S weak two, can be five cards|pg||
nt|petergill: There was an earthquake today in Japan, but in both this Final and in the Consolation event, the players just kept on playing bridge - that's bridge for you.|pg||
nt|petergill: thanks to Heather Dhondy in Yokohama for that information|pg||
nt|petergill: there is some danger of EW getting overboard - 6NT by West needs @D 2-2|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|andyv:  http://www.jcbl.or.jp/home////tabid/223/Default.aspx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S consistent with Dutch system    when 1@H overcall artificial  1@S=game force balanced hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: we have the ladies agst the women,  not sure difference  age maybe?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Alert of 1@D implies  West=Verhees  East=vanProoijen|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Name is not right ! Operater pls|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 1@C 14+|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: oh no I just think 33 a LOT|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: sure! very big|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: fit showing jumo|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: not so long|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D = 6+@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: PASS will show LONGER @D|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think against this system i will need penalty double cards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my guess  East is the one who is thinking|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes, worried about getting all his clothes stolen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: going back to reference of Moscito   there are many similarities with Transfer Moscito   both systems developed around the same time|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: hi Kazuo @H|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sybarra: we will get names up shortly  just relax |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i believe E=vanProoijen and W=Verhees|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so    2@D denies 4@H else  Raptor 1N overcall|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and relay structures both mostly Symmetric|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D GF, natural|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@H natural, forcing. 3@S by East asks for spade stop|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: S playing 2@H OR|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|pole_as_ch: 1@s alert ??|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: looks like 4@h |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: this two team matched in RR|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@D to show the 6th @D|pg||
nt|petergill: 6NT makes, I think 6@C survives any ruffs|pg||
nt|petergill: Will West content himself with 3NT, or do more? |pg||
nt|petergill: More ...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: EW carding will be  upside-down count & attitude   odd/even discard|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 2@s wanna TRF to 3@c but opener ???|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NEDUK is trying to defend the title they won in 2011|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: but 6 is there, can they reach ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: after round 8 they were leading the Swiss Qualifying|pg||

nt|petergill: Newell - Reid System Card http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/New%20Zealand/Newell-Reid.pdf|pg||
nt|petergill: 11-14|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: and NS   akama-maruyama  [not sure who's where]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=game force   a bunch of hand types  in this case  balanced  [no singleton or void]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my dream is that someday  BBO will work on software for operator and there will be functionality to just INSERT PASS  instead of having to do all of those UNDOs|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: EW in OR is team leader of FT.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: They use Blue club oriented system.|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry, 500 was only possible if West ducked @CK (he played ace) - even then it might be 300|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: fufufufu|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: comes some noise|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: some randon 2 suiter?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 14+|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: ONI means demon in Japan|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the devils :)|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: and reverse nimonic of INO|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not sure what the delay is here|pg||
mb|2S!|an|C or HCP ask|nt|mrdct: 2@s is 10-13 5+ @s|pg||
nt|mrdct: so east is clear a big max for his bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not 1@C from east|pg||
nt|ahollan1: P-1@C-P-  then  1@H=4+@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ew do NOT play Namyats, so 4@S is wide range|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: specific lol|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow  thought we'd see 3rd seat 1@D|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  3nt will make i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: *clearly|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: NS of this room i know each of them, but pd-ship i don't know|pg||
nt|cc469: 12 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ hcp  [14+ in 1st/2nd]|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: not so random|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: could be in trouble|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: simple negative|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: looks good,  9 or less ?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thats a devilish 1H by Niekawa|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  by ns after lead|pg||
mb|3C!|an|max|nt|ahollan1: 1@S RELAY  |pg||
nt|mrdct: btw - i'm going to predict bill jacobs is sitting east as ben thompson is a bit more agressive and would probably open 1@s with the east cards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, Bill is always E and N I noticed|pg||
nt|mrdct: believe it or not i've never noticed that|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Normal ? 2/1, i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: i think the 1st two matches are up|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: well passed Martin|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: hewww|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 2@c ?  or X ?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh @c|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Yamada with 16 may have been surpised to hear pard bid after a strong @C on his right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=a) 0-5 HCP  b) 6-8 HCP, BAL  c) 6+ HCP, 0 controls|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it varies with seat, al?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=16-18   unless Newell upgrades to 1@H [any 19+]|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|nt|sybarra: 1 sp means 1 nt |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 1@s is No Majs, maybe.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: NS in this room are wife(N) & hus(S)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: operator won't be able to lead   so then auction should get fixed|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C balanced  8-11 or 15+ hcp|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/home////tabid/223/Default.aspx  for tournament website. No results yet I'm afraid. They only update the page once a day if memory serves|pg||
nt|mrdct: poor result for Oz in the open room|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: sry, i have no detail about Chaina Geely Auto members|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=ART, a) 9-12 HCP, 2+ controls, BAL [include 5@C/@D(332)  b) 6-9 HCP, 1-suit 5+@H [bad suit else opening bid]|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i meant the 1@C opening|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes 1/2 is 14+ 3/4 is 16+|pg||
nt|petergill: Qx and Jxx are minus factors, balancing out the plus factor in clubs, hence 1NT not 1@C by Tony Nunn|pg||
nt|ahollan2:   49  Newell-Reid  6@D East|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mrdct: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/home/English/nec/17th/results/7thFeb/tabid/665/Default.aspx|pg||
nt|Walddk2: thx|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: just shape, he knows|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes  1st/2nd seat = 14+ unbal, 16+ bal    3rd/4th=16+ unbal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  1st/2nd  15+ bal|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: or a transfer bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N relay    2@C = a) (332)5@C/@D  b) 3334@H/@S  c) (32)44 same color|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 5 quick trick|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: @d switch will get down easily, humm|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nunn NOT playing a Big Club   opened 3rd seat 1@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that got defense off to @D lead|pg||
pc|sA|nt|petergill: The undertricks are only 50's|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N broke out of relay so East guaranteed declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vP's 1@S [RHO's suit]  showing the 2 unbid suits|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D asks   and now Reid will show exact shape|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no ambition other than finding the correct game|pg||
nt|petergill: RKapalansd Rubnens Evaluator http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=j32+q5+at8+akt54  |pg||
pc|s8|nt|pole_as_ch: They (NS) prefer schenken|pg||
nt|sybarra: hopefully we will get the names of players sorted out shortly |pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  down two|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|eamongall: yes first two rounds are up ... and 3rd round was only finished ... |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: if someone teach me |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: S in 2@C OR|pg||
nt|ahollan2:   49 @C lead   bizarre game we play|pg||
nt|petergill: says south is 14.5, right on borderline of 1Nt or 1@C|pg||
nt|petergill: Kaplans Rubens |pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: 3@D = 4/5@D  not 4@H/@S|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Andy was referring to the Dutch Premiere League final that was on BBO last weekend|pg||
nt|andyv:  declarer starts with 8 tricks and has 2 4-3 suits to find the 9th, or the @d suit.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no carryover from Swiss Qualifying   only 2 of the Quarter-Final matchups did battle in the Swiss   ours is not one of them|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: y|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: good result oz in OR|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mrdct: the problem in the open rooms is with only one @s stopper you need cashing tricks on top which just weren't there|pg||
nt|sybarra: 9, or 10 tricks |pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: EW team won by 1 imp after trailing by a bunch after 4 round|pg||
nt|sybarra: or 11 |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|andyv:  yes, they certainly made a quick turnaround to get to this tourney|pg||
nt|kemperg: leader may play for 3@D at siide of 3!@Hs, that wont work|pg||
nt|kemperg: down now, cant finesse twice anymore|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it's not unreasonable to play 1@S as natural even though RHO has shown 4+  since 1N by passed hand is available to show the 2 unbid|pg||
nt|vugraphzws: Sorry for wrong bits.|pg||
nt|sybarra: tese are left over from last match |pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 17  5@DX East|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: only 200 this may be worse|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 1 trick more for defence, where ?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: i cannot find|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh, 2 more !|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Strong Club 14+ 1/2 seat, 16+ 3/4 seat - from cc|pg||
nt|ahollan1: cute @SQ|pg||
nt|petergill: Will West get squeezed? Will he bare honours smoothly? Will South pick it?|pg||
nt|petergill: @S5 then @S4 by west suggests W has 5 spades not 4 spades|pg||
nt|petergill: could play for @HK onside|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mrdct: needs to make this to hold the damage to 5 imps - otherwise it's 8 imps out|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm pretty sure  W=Verhees  E=vProoijen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room also in 3N   this hand will be more successful than  1|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: they did that last year too|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: looks like push ?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk2: Operator, please insert names        North:  Stamatov     South: Danailov       East: Jacobs      West: Thompson|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|petergill: @S4 by W might be suit pref for @DK - without @HK|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: and went on to win the NEC Cup|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mrdct: in fact when i last played against them i was south and screenmates with bill, but that may have been because ben didn't want to be screenmates with me|pg||
pc|d6|nt|andyv:  when you are good, you are good|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: no 2|pg||
nt|petergill: other table is in 3NT on a @H lead - if you go to other table to watch that drama, please come back here afterwards :)|pg||
nt|petergill: NS play UDCA|pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer also could not afford to exit a spade at Trick 3, if he was going to play for @HK with E|pg||
nt|petergill: Once W has 5 spades, E is favourite to have @HK (more vacant places) so South went with the odds|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: this auction is really ??|pg||
nt|vugraphzws: yes/|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: if so, south is phych ?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh ! alert comes|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh, bad place|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thought Newell would open 3rd seat favorable|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: not sure if lebensohl situation or 2N=2-places to play   either way  3@C is constructive|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: @cA|pg||
nt|sybarra: not the bid E wanted to hear |pg||
nt|ahollan1: East could have used Raptor 1N overcall to show 4@H/@S & 5+@C  but unfavorable vul and passed partner   =  yuk|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: and @c lead|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: or @s lead, and @c switch ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i know in Ron Klinger's version of transfers over 1@C   his 1@S=4+@D and has 4-card major ONLY IF game force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but not all pairs use 1@S to guarantee @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  this was 3rd seat opener   so  16+|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh, yes, "Color"|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: done !  good lead by newell|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes good night contract I knew you not|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 2 off maybe ?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: what 3@C?|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S is weakish, due to Reverse Drury|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: England ladiesgain big lead in first 2 BD. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: in other room  Precision 1@C - Sartaj Hans did NOT bid with East   so  1@D[neg]-1N end|pg||
nt|sybarra: 1 shouod be no problem |pg||
nt|sybarra: *1nt should not be a problem |pg||
nt|ahollan1: transportation a problem|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and nothing favorable in @S or @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so 7th trick may need help from defenders|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i bet  EW get 7 before NS|pg||
nt|sybarra: will be a mad scramble |pg||
nt|ahollan1: voice commentary talking about  run of @H maybe squeezing West in minors|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Peter takes the advance sac|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: same contract !|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT on Bd 34 is too hard for me to analyse|pg||
nt|petergill: Boring 420 here  |pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  \3nt would be trivial if he could cash 5 clubs and be in hand. with exact defence 3nt willl fail. |pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer has to think about safety plays in @s's (if bare honour offside) and possible @h ruffs|pg||
nt|petergill: I think EW play Standard leads with natural count and secondary suit pref, but I'm not 100% sure|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  he has a lot of possible lines|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: 1@C  14+ with clubs or 15+ balanced|pg||
nt|mrdct: fairly standard these days to play transfers after one-level intervention|pg||
nt|sybarra: not best lead for defense maybe |pg||
nt|sybarra: but I make these leads all the time :( |pg||
nt|sybarra: this is very prestigious event  sponsored by NEC |pg||
nt|petergill: West is M ILIEV|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: y say, good gambling ?|pg||
nt|ahollan2:  Newell's DBL=Game Force Relay (1NT=Min 1 suiter or 5332 or 3-suiter, 2C = Spades)|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: hi Al|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: X was FG !!|pg||
nt|ahollan2:  1@D = 9-13 hcp, unbal, 4+@H   if Gary didn't already mention that|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: I'm sure you'd love to be here full time loving systems as you do|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: in OR, only N(=Ino) mentioned |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H   maybe RM Lite response of any 8-11, not 5+@S|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s6|pg||
nt|mrdct: playing preciion in the open room EW never found their @h fit|pg||
nt|mrdct: losing 2@h and a @d here at least|pg||
nt|mrdct: and there's nowhere to put the deep @c loser|pg||
nt|mrdct: so i think this is going to slide one off|pg||
nt|sybarra: no reason to hop yet|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 1@d = 1s + another, some spec tell me.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra: we are in the qualifying rounds  leading to semi's then finals over the weekend |pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room at least sniffed at slam, but vanProoijen 3@S left much less room for exploration|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all matches are 14 boards, but the venue always plays  1-14  and  17-30|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: but then, N's 2@d ???|pg||

nt|sybarra: 3 @C probably said @H's and S taking a chance on 3 nt |pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 19  2@CX was +580  and 13 imps to China Geely Auto|pg||
nt|mrdct: but i could be mistaken|pg||
nt|ahollan2:  2@H=@S, 8-14 HCP, usually BAL  a) 3@S  b) 4@S, min|pg||
nt|ahollan2:  2N = max, 5+@S, forcing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C stayman OR game force relay   [so the alert]|pg||
nt|petergill: East cannot get to dummy for his 10 tricks in @S contracts - thus 4@S goes down|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: 3@h is safe ! or some snag ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other table  5@H South|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think with new ACBL rules that won't be an alert in north america|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mrdct: and put south on the spot to perhaps bid a failing slam|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think S is looking for tricks here |pg||
nt|ahollan1: probably not a hand with slam interest - that would start with 2@C [stayman OR game force relay]|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: luck he had 9 tops here|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Isporski had a chance to defend against 2@CX  but pulled and also 3N North|pg||
nt|petergill: Pass or Dbl?|pg||
nt|petergill: On the spade lead, there appear to be 9 tricks but there might be communication problems|pg||
pc|sT|nt|petergill: i played many boards against this pair in the semi finals of our Nationals 2 weeks ago (they won), but I have never played their system|pg||
nt|ahollan2:  unfavorable vul    1N=13-15|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: welcome Al who is an expert on the Newell-Reid system|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: viora !|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sybarra: and that lead lets it thru for sure |pg||
nt|mrdct: declarer will be a bit worried about getting tapped-off here|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Bill would regrett Not to go, maybe|pg||
nt|mrdct: only if he makes 12 tricks - which isn't guaranteed|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: ah the @D lead ty opps|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: just another flat push :)|pg||
nt|ahollan2:  all tables getting the @D lead|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: it is very PASSIVE|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: should attack many times|pg||

pc|sK|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Hans led @C|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 9 !|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: and @h |pg||
nt|petergill: @SK is badly located, so Pass 4@S|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mrdct: a hard-eartned 1-imp swing for Oz|pg||
nt|petergill: Non spade lead beats 4@S, @S lead is the only bad one|pg||
pc|c3|nt|dalzielpas:  north has done heaps already|pg||
nt|petergill: Things going unluckily for Dwon Under|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: the question seems to be   does 5@H make with 4-0 trump slit  AND 4-2 @C|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: but @c8 is funny carding.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes Al|pg||
nt|petergill: Tough lead for South - unlucky this time|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: y, now -2.|pg||
nt|petergill: Holding @DQx, East was in no hurry to give partner a ruff with West's 3rd (long) trump|pg||
nt|petergill: Also, if North had have played @S8 at Trrick 1, East could not tell if W had @S432 (playing UDCA)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: turns out his partner had a Penalty Card     sorry Louk|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the good news -- that one board wasn't enough to change the result of the match|pg||
nt|fabsayc: several players suggested cashing diamonds prior to playing second club, that is surely an improvement on this line|pg||

nt|dalzielpas:  Declarer will prevail because of D|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|nt|pole_as_ch: well, 1 up !|pg||
nt|petergill: and that N will have to provide a stepping stone to his tricks|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|petergill: To make, declarer had to reason: I have 3 losers, I need @SK onside to make 4@S, so I should play @SJ at Trick 2|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|petergill: Instead East played for North to have Kxx, Kxxx, xx, A10xx which does not give North much of a hand for North's apparent thinking time over 3@H|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Isporski wondering how agressive to be opposite passed partner|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|h8|pg||
nt|rick3son:  this is why many players are disturbed by exotics|pg||
nt|super nova: I put it into deep finesse and it goes for 800 on low heart lead or AC lead or JC lead the 2h x on the earlier board|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: 8 imps come ! |pg||

nt|mrdct: slam on the @d hook (more-or-less) here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: North will lead his singleton|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi Vladimir|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlucky choice of lead|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 1@s open ?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: no ?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 11 boards to go 45 imps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H must show @H & minor|pg||
nt|ahollan1: stopped both South and West from opening 1@H :)|pg||
nt|petergill: previous board: the 3424 hand gives South a very unlikely vul 2@D overcall, so perhaps "erred" is an OK word to use|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: so i think funny why bd 17 was -1 imp ???|pg||
nt|mrdct: in the event of a tie - the bulgarian all stars have 0.5 imps of carryover|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: and 4@hX ?|pg||
nt|mrdct: difficult hand for west as 3NT or 4@s could be the best spot|pg||
nt|mrdct: probably start with a dbl is best|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=10-15 HCP, 4+@H   if 2nd suit, it is LONGER  [or 5@H 5@S]|pg||

nt|Walddk2: They right-sided hearts now so to speak|pg||

nt|mrdct: 2@d in an inv+ relay|pg||
nt|sybarra: suspecting precision here |pg||
nt|xenya: hello Germ|pg||

nt|ahollan1: and 2@S=@S & minor|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe he is treating it as such|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: dbl dummy, 6@c by East|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room started P-1@C  so NS found @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will that affect final result?|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@S at this vulnerability can be a very good hand|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: oh sry|pg||
nt|petergill: Tony deciding whether to dbl or pass|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  hard to set 5s here|pg||
nt|petergill: It's a bidder's game - the person with shortage in their suit usually does best not to pass|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  d lead rise club queen shift to trump will just do it|pg||
nt|petergill: Sartaj might bid any of 4NT (two places to play), 5@D, 5@H or Pass|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: uh! 4@h can make, but can they reach to there ?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: they find best suit|pg||

pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: sure -- but why?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: woww !|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: 2@S is a treatment i haven't seen before|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe part of transfer advances???|pg||
nt|mrdct: @d lead by south may also beat 6@h as declarer will try to pitch the losing @d on the @CAK|pg||
nt|xenya: tricky hand, this|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Operater ?  last BD 2 up really ??|pg||
pc|h6|nt|andyv:  got me on that one|pg||

nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there's always that|pg||
nt|sybarra: and was the lead he wanted |pg||
nt|sybarra: over 1 nt|pg||
nt|petergill: 5@D seems to be the middle ground of those, which often is the best choice|pg||
nt|petergill: Normal bidding to the good game. 5@HX costs 800 on best defence|pg||
nt|petergill: This should be 450|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|pole_as_ch: hummm |pg||
nt|petergill: 300 is OK|pg||
pc|d3|nt|petergill: Should South overcall 2@C? Fav vul = good - in Sabine Auken's book, she explains why 3@C overcall of 1@D can work well - EW have 2 unbid majors so might miss the 4-4 major fit. |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 1 off or good/bad ??|pg||
nt|petergill: or a @H ruff can yield 500|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  a of spades then spade looks right to me|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sybarra: probably typical contract |pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW require decent 12 hcp to open balanced hands so  vProoijen PASS|pg||

nt|ahollan1: other table 4@S North|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sybarra: where is 9th trick ? |pg||

nt|petergill: Danger of switching to @C9 is that partner might play you for a singleton club|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|mrdct: indeed it looks like anything other than @SA will beat it|pg||
nt|mrdct: sorry everyone - i have a no-GIB policy when commentating so expect serious misanalysis!|pg||

nt|ahollan1: PASS, 2@S, 3@S, 4@s might all get some votes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or in this system   1@H  |pg||
nt|sybarra: hate hands like these |pg||
nt|sybarra: close to opening 1 @S here|pg||
nt|mrdct: dare i suggest a routine 4@s for EW here?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: kiwis will take that|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they are discussing fit jumps in open room on last board, i think not a good idea at that vuls|pg||
nt|dburn: not really, but he might against Grosvenor|pg||
nt|petergill: East got it right - possibly because no @H switch by West = South not 1354 shape|pg||
nt|petergill: other table: Bd 53 has started weak 1NT, 2@C by S (both majors) = danger?|pg||
mb|1C|nt|pole_as_ch: 5@hX is too risky ?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: bad play by E|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: so it goes|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S probably would have made, so chalk that little gain up to the marginal 2@C overcall|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C strong|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the Newell-Reid machine rolls on, taking all in it's wake|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: should try one more ??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C=10-12(13) HCP, 6+@C|pg||
nt|othered1: north has a petty perfect hand for 5@C, down to the @H10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might start with 3@D=RELAY, may stop in 4@C else FG|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: oh, open! so they go to 4@s !|pg||
nt|ahollan1: don't know what 3@S does to the auction :(|pg||
nt|othered1: can he get enough information from the single relay to make the 4 v 51C judgment?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: probably Reid's bid will show short @S|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@C v. 5@C, rather|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the problem with 3@D is what has actually happened|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  West pass|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  Don Evans died - today i think|pg||
nt|petergill: other table: On Bd 37, Val Kovachev found !AH lead to 4@S, so it might go down 2 or more|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  its going to be very close|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: cu frank |pg||
nt|sybarra: thx for helping |pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D GF ... artificial = @H?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice hand partner!|pg||
nt|mrdct: and too expensive - 1100 probably|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: well 3 off is not payed|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: narrow slam !   6@c !!|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C Precision  most Chinese pairs play 6+@C OR 5@C & 4@H/@S|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 1@s ??|pg||
nt|othered1: EW don't really want to get too high|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  He would stilll bid with West hand|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 53 - Newell and Reid like to play for penalties|pg||
mb|2N|an|ask|nt|pole_as_ch: oh? 4 off !|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the relay finds shortness|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 2NT asks|pg||
mb|3N|an|5332 3H max|nt|petergill: 4@H = signoff, minimum |pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: 6@d tricks is a good start for 3NT NS but EW can get to their 5 before NS establish their tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after 9    NEDUK leading with 173   China Geely 2nd with 170|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: @d4|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT = max with only 3 hearts|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  yes dble willl work well|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: does 1N deny 4@S?     probably  otherwise North would probably use some form of checkback|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: no, North !  sry|pg||
nt|othered1: 800 here on @D ruff|pg||
nt|petergill: North not really confident about 3NT|pg||
nt|petergill: E thinking about Dbl or Pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2-way checkback  or  new minor force?    probably 2-way  so  2@D = artificial game force|pg||
nt|twcho: yes, rather standard precision which is suitable for irregular partnership|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: but died !  y, it is normal, but...|pg||
nt|petergill: For aussie specs: 2 days ago - no funeral notice in newspapers yet - perhaps in monday's newspaper |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: may now get pushed too high?    can they even beat 4 @S?|pg||
nt|sybarra: my pards rarely have hands like that one when I open 4  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: from old card  Zejun @C7  =  odd/even  where odd=like this suit|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: same contract|pg||
nt|mrdct: heading for a normal push|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: i dont know this seq|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: checkback was used in other room so Patrick Huang avoided @S lead -- but his choice of @HK wasn't a success either|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in North America the top big club pairs are playing 2@C always 6+@C|pg||
nt|twcho: and NS aren't regular partners|pg||
nt|ahollan1: mine would have 13 cards   but there the similarity would end|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: c |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 2@S shows minor ? or maybe @c directly|pg||
nt|othered1: Did south's pass show @S shortness?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's my guess|pg||
nt|dburn: would not think so - would be strange if South had to bid with spade length|pg||
nt|petergill: I think I heard a sigh of relief across the whole of New Zealand and Australia|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: then again  playing 2-way checkback  South might bid @C|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: well cannot make. but 2 off ?|pg||
nt|petergill: South upgraded his 14 (weak 1NT) to 15 due to good long suit and good cards|pg||
nt|petergill: Even on this lead, surely 4@H has no chance|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: can N get in to lead club? |pg||
nt|sybarra: just take 4 aces   easier |pg||
nt|petergill: EW can make 4@C|pg||
pc|c8|nt|petergill: Best % play of @h suit in 6@H is ace - picks up bare king in either hand|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|petergill: even if N picks everything from the "think about whether to dbl" and the lead?|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  diamond now looks best|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: another possible squeeze -- but this one doesn't work|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mrdct: losing 2@c, 1@h and 1@s so need to get @d right to make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in their relays  not uncommon for  PASS=short in overcall  DBL=no shortness  other = short in bid suit|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  ddouble finesses trumpseclarer can make if he |pg||
pc|d6|nt|pole_as_ch: 2NT ?? negative ?|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  if you see what i mean|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  they've got two diamonds and one heart|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|mrdct: predicated on a @c switch by west now which may not be so easy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlikely @D plays|pg||
nt|xenya: this should make despite the4-1 trump split -- but some care is needed|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: this will switch @c|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sybarra: our pards have taken similar lessons it seems |pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  king piching spade then d|pg||
pc|c6|nt|xenya: still can't make it on a @S return|pg||
nt|mrdct: wd bro|pg||
nt|ahollan1: either @DJ still in dummy or @DQ still in hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same opening in other room|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh @h|pg||
nt|petergill: I think Tony has a plan to set up a trick in dummy on a 3-3 break |pg||
pc|c9|nt|petergill: but in 4@H, have to consider if safety play of low to @H queen (picks up KJx in either hand) - is safe or unsafe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's why they are called  CHO    cross-hand opponent|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 3@d may short, or just cue ?|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: that's better   thanks|pg||
nt|petergill: hence Tony's ducks in the pointed suits|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  im not sure it will be close|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|dalzielpas:  great plkan belittle4d by 4-0 trumps|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|mrdct: hi peter|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: ugg|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so now 20-5 after those 2 8's|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: @sJ-@d7|pg||
pc|h7|nt|xenya: but now perhaps...|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: Geely Auto always seems to provide us with a team for the NEC Cup|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  oh i see a low trump now and hes done it|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mrdct: i can't see any reason why he'd get the @dK right here|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another option   PASS=min|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  i think doomed after ruffing club|pg||
pc|hT|nt|othered1: How could a 3rd @D have hurt?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|petergill: Well played, still making|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  yes that was tidy|pg||
nt|petergill: Whichever pointed suit E exits, he can win, draw trumps and exit in that suit|pg||
nt|ahollan2:   38  Reid playing 4@SX West|pg||
nt|petergill: So we should have a new leader in the match soon|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks Al|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  likely make overtrick|pg||
nt|petergill: I@D - 3@S Dbl 4@S Dbl All Pass at other table |pg||
pc|d2|nt|pole_as_ch: Hirata is losing sharpness of his own|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Andy  are you a 2-way checkback  or NMF kinda guy?|pg||
nt|petergill: Played for 3-3 @H and @d blockage|pg||
nt|petergill: -100|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|pc|sQ|nt|andyv:  2 way|pg||
nt|petergill: @H Safety play taken, in case there are 2 club losers|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: but 3 @c trick for Defence ?|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  yes according to table he could have slotted the heart ten and made|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d8|nt|andyv:  I live in LA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: [or  2@C always the only checkback]|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: better line of play    claim after @D switch|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: you call that living?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mrdct: and now the earlier high ruff by south will cost some extra under tricks|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|s3|pc|hQ|pc|sA|nt|petergill: Sartaj bid the 4@SX hand better than his counterpart - this is a very delicate point indeed about competitive bidding|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|petergill: Newell and Reid are about to make 3NT on Bd 53|pg||

nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: DBL by East infulenced Dec's play maybe !|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5 of the wins for Geely Auto have been maximum of 25 VPs     wow|pg||
nt|cc469: a fine result|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought he'd play @D before the @H finesse, but really that was his only chance|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: this seg's last bd is  32|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: heww !|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: hummm|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: wellearned imp|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=10-15 HCP    a) 6+@C 1-suiter   b) 4+@C and 5+@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: lots of @H's between e/w |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: so 9 bd remains|pg||
nt|mrdct: probably a @h partscore for NS here|pg||
nt|mrdct: i assume EW play precision|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: wd play by K.Yamada.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 5@d is good scr !|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: but have so many defensive tricks, so tend to defence ?? |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: what is Newells gadget for this shape|pg||
nt|fabsayc: seems newell should have got the last hand right, i crashed, maybe somebody said that|pg||
nt|petergill: with the opponents having the boss suit, Sartaj did not Dbl 3@s on his moderate values because then he does not know what to do after 4@SX|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 2 @D looks like multi again|pg||
nt|petergill: in 6@H - running @HQ picks up only one case - bare jack in North - so if an expert does such play against you successfully, you should hold your cards further back|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: looks like|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=9-13 hcp, unbal, 4+@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: transfer opening  remember specs |pg||
nt|ahollan1: and as you see -- can have canape  longer @C/@D|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh !|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: up values to 14+|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=ART, PRE, 2-8 HCP, 4+@S & 4+@C/@D, aggressive style [often 4-4 nvul]|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D=relay  but doesn't promise any points|pg||
nt|sybarra: E will never believe suit is hts |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15, 0+@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=@S, 8-14 HCP, usually BAL  a) 3@S  b) 4@S, min|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|andyv:  again because of canape style, W restricted in his choice of openings|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @C as to transfer into suit (I think) |pg||
nt|vugraphzws: Sorry for mistake.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in 3rd seat, they'll open some balanced hands that don't get opened in 1st/2nd|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice trump split    5-4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i predict   3@C = non-force  LONGER @C|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: P or 4@c ?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 5 either minor pitches on the other|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: one downside of the (strong) @C no suits shown'|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: y|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: limitted place ??|pg||
nt|mrdct: good that NS stayed out of game with 4 losers on top|pg||
nt|mrdct: now north needs to play trumps for zero losers|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: 2@S=5+@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: dutch playing a canape style, hence this unusual combination|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: hum, 6@c ?|pg||
nt|mrdct: Oz Players here are 2/3 of the runners-up in Australia National Open Teams from a couple of weeks ago|pg||
nt|sybarra: I suspect 5 @h is pass or correct... or the lack of @D was what W was going to bid |pg||
nt|sybarra: just not sure how they play this |pg||
nt|sybarra2: how to find out you have no wasted values in @H's |pg||
nt|mrdct: reasonable 3rd seat opening by north|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: need 2 entries|pg||
nt|mrdct: he has entries in @d and @s|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: y|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: should move blutally ? did !|pg||
nt|petergill: but by Passing, he finds out that (i) East is happy to go to 4@S and (ii) partner has spade shortage for his t/o dbl of 4@S, making the 5 level the place to be (EW have 10 or 11 ...|pg||
nt|petergill: trumps etc)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: EW in OR already go to there ! heww!|pg||
nt|sybarra: and just need to take aces again |pg||
nt|mrdct: but content to resign when p bids his singleton|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh !|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this only -1|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: y|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2N relay for distribution|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N=5@S 5@C 1@H|pg||
nt|mrdct: close to mirrored shapes here for NS which is often dangerous, but there's no ruff on for the defence so @SA and @DAK only to lose|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 3rd @c also ?|pg||
nt|mrdct: opportunity for jacobs now as 3@h failed in teh closed room|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 1 off in OR !?|pg||
nt|mrdct: however, i suspect he'll only finese against the @HK and go one down also but we'll see|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: West opend ! easily place @hK for him, but how many trumps ?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: now West will move ?  maybe NO !|pg||
nt|petergill: bd 55: perhaps playing @H10 was almost costfree, unless @C were 6-2|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: now east hunting for slam, and may well bid it|pg||
nt|xenya: if they get to slam, they will make it|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Newell walks on water today|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: sigh !|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sybarra2: (and the k of clubs on side) |pg||
nt|petergill: bd 55: and East not splitting his hearts was a Grosvenor Gambit of sorts, maybe|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  8 bds to go|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mrdct: beyond the 1@c strong club opening - i have no idea what the rest menas|pg||
nt|ahollan1: especially if you have my short neck|pg||
nt|ahollan1: finding @H -- what fun is that?|pg||
nt|twcho: last bd, north misdefend by continuing his @d and squeezed south on the way|pg||
nt|xenya: and E miight be tempted|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think of any good reason why you woudl play west for @hK10x|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: 4@D forces 4@H   |pg||
nt|sybarra2: do you really want to be in this slam?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: probably not but|pg||
nt|sybarra2: ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  you have all the controls ...only a question if you can set up @cs on ruffs|pg||
nt|andyv:  the poor @s spots may determine if they go on |pg||
nt|sybarra2: or smother 10 of @S? |pg||
nt|ahollan1: the auction strongly suggests  @S 4333 around the table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in that case -- 3@D looks more dangerous than normal|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: like Ninja ?|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|andyv:  you can also try the @d suit |pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@s is 8-10 bal and 3@d asks for a major I'm told|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|twcho: he should return a @s to break up the squeeze|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@S = light third seat non-vul openings are all the rage among genuine experts - the older experts like to open 2@S (or equivalent) in 3rd seat (takes away more bidding space) - ...|pg||
nt|petergill: the newer experts find 1@S more effective overall (less revealing to opponents in the card play)|pg||
nt|mrdct: had north passed initially i guess NS would get to 1NT makiing 7 or 8 tricks|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mrdct: and then 3@h is a transfer to get the strong hand to play it|pg||
nt|mrdct: thanks specs!|pg||
nt|twcho: Top eight teams will enter the KO stage|pg||
nt|xenya: well...|pg||
nt|kemperg: 5@H are your @Hs good?|pg||
nt|kemperg: and W tinks AHx is enough|pg||
nt|xenya: EW lack 2 keycards, but luckily for them, they have failed to to find that out|pg||
nt|kemperg: no fancy play, trying to catch 10x in N and its made|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if West had all of the inferences about the NS @S length  and  North's proably being 46|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with  4135 or 4315  i'm not sure if Newell would rebid 3@C or just a quiet 2@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder also |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Lixin played for squeeze on last hand  so a different down 1 in 4@S |pg||
nt|mrdct: 1 *can't|pg||
pc|c8|nt|pole_as_ch: 4@s maybe voidwood ?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 5NT ???|pg||
nt|kemperg: that wont be from Qxx|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|sybarra2: happens to not be a success  |pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: (&) $)(*Y %|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no stopping now|pg||
nt|mrdct: if any of you good analyst out there want to join me feel free|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@D Precision|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: finishing in top 3 is helpful   1 chooses opponent from 5-8, then  2, then  3  [ 4 gets stuck with remaining team]|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: @d9 is good @d ?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: seems good for ONI|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kemperg: claim|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh Yes 10 is critical, thx|pg||
nt|petergill: still on the 4@SX board: Sartaj might have bid 4NT over the dbl, and 5@HX might escape for 300 instead of 500, but that's impossible to tell without seeing the unlikely @D stack|pg||
nt|petergill: same old board: Also, bidding to 5@H (not 5@D) might allow EW to tell it's a double fit and bid and make 5@SX|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@D set @S    4@H=avg+ or max  then RKC|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: ummm, they also go !  nice auction! |pg||
nt|fabsayc: reid has to guess whether spade shift from singleton or doubleton|pg||
pc|c5|nt|fabsayc: this mostly needs two diamonds to survice, then a straight cross ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if @D lead 3rd/5th then unlikely choice of crossruff|pg||
nt|andyv:  if leads are 3-5, W may already know what is going on|pg||
nt|mrdct: obviously with north having already bid @s the transfer benefits are not there - but often you need to stick to your generla structure|pg||
pc|cT|pc|h2|nt|mrdct: jacobs would much rather have the @H10 than the @CQ|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: hehehehe  |pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C Aspro|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: No snag. cold slam !|pg||

pc|c8|nt|sybarra: and how many nt do they end up in?  6 nt makes |pg||
nt|petergill: Dbl by E = to discourage West from going past 4@SX|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 3nt by W in OR|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3NT is the open room - so cold have a new leader again if it makes|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: hummm,|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: aft 4NT, 5@c, 5@d, 6@d ???|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 12 much needed  to oni|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS play Michaels shows   weak or strong |pg||

pc|c4|nt|pole_as_ch: West dbled 1@s, funny.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2NT very strong Martin raises|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so Reid hand fits in the middle ... hence 1@S|pg||
nt|petergill: EW will play trumps at some stage to beat 3@H|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|mrdct: the mirrored position in @c is bad news fro NS here|pg||

nt|sybarra: *pitches IN dummy |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh good lead !|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: @C4 discouraging  and hard to read regarding suit pref  [odd/even discards]|pg||
nt|fabsayc: verhees will continue diamonds and subseuently declarer is kind of squeezed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: agreed    probably liked favorable vul  [not-vul vs vul  aka "green"]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlucky   partner had best hand at the table|pg||
nt|cc469: evenin'|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Carl,  welcome |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Reid really doesn't have much hope of beating this|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with his @C shortness -- desperately hoping partner has 1@D and 2+@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but even then  need a 2nd trump trick|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: great decision|pg||
nt|petergill: Ew have 24 points|pg||
nt|petergill: North did very well to "steal" by opening light at the favourable vulnerability|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  seems east must act at ist turn|pg||
nt|petergill: with 2@C or Dbl?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: quite a parlay opposite an aggressive favorable vul 2@H opening|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hans opened east hand weak 1N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now in 2@DX East|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  declarer needs a lot of help to gwet home|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: in 6@S Miyakuni cashed @CA early and misguessed trump - but @D suit intact  does she still have a chance to make?   i doubt it|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think we are relaying a bunch here |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: with 7 more after this|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: it is as a water on the very hot stone|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: maybe|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: poof then it disappears?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: might we just plop into 6 nt? |pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  i like dble but you wont find many who do|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|petergill: If 3rd club is played, it's down I think|pg||
nt|petergill: Can West tell if East has 4 clubs or 2 clubs?|pg||
nt|petergill: i.e do they play count or attitude at Trick 1? (both upside down)|pg||
nt|petergill: Attitude makes this easier than count|pg||
pc|d8|nt|petergill: 4@S = due to the fav vul - might cost a little bit too much|pg||
nt|mrdct: the 3 @c losers will hurt|pg||
nt|mrdct: on a good day dummy's minors will be the other way and it's all dandy|pg||
nt|petergill: South knew trumps were 3-1 only when @SK appeared - else West has no spade stop for his 3NT bid|pg||
nt|petergill: Hristov unable to tell, due to predominant count signals|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  but his move lokes vsafe|pg||
nt|ahollan2:   55  [4@H-1]   Bulgarians in 3N South|pg||
nt|petergill: Now declarer has to rise @DK, pick spades then ruff club high - to get home|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  yes i see, but another club declarer rufff hig dk and strip squeeze|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  also m\king. what about a trump lead|pg||
nt|petergill: I see - @DK - @h to ace, ruff club high, draw trumps and endplay the strip-squeezed East?|pg||
nt|petergill: Many choices. |pg||
pc|dK|nt|pole_as_ch: The other room also 4@s !  so no swing !|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: in north america, i think Woolsey-Stewart are the only big club pair that doesn't use 2N opening as strong balanced hand|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|fabsayc: timing all wrong for defense now|pg||
nt|mrdct: but i don;t disagree with north's action and it could easily be replicated in the open room|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|sybarra: and they "we" are |pg||
nt|petergill: Might also ruff club low - if EW cannot tell that West can overruff clubs, then how can North tell?|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  Yes, a trump lead declarer might not knock out minor villains in time|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sybarra: can actually make 7 given that @H's fall |pg||
pc|sK|nt|pole_as_ch: wow ?|pg||
nt|cc469: I suggest that it is not at all clear from N's hand that they should be playing in a minor suit and thus agree with Tommy that the 2NT opening is a bit unilateral|pg||
nt|cc469: S might have held W's @Hs for example|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and then EW hold the @S|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra: and spade hook on |pg||
nt|xenya: the correct play was @SJ -- unless declarer was playing for a singleton @SK|pg||
pc|s7|pg||

nt|mrdct: some number of @h - 2 or 3 i guess|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure, but i'd wager 1+@D|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@D = 2 suits same rank  [@C&@D or @H&@S]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not pure CRASH  they use  DBL, 1@D and 2@C instead of the usually DBL, 1@D, 1N|pg||
nt|sybarra: does Reid now try 1 @S? |pg||
nt|mrdct: west doesn't have very good suit quality in @h|pg||
nt|fabsayc: lots of strong club players would upgrade east hand to 1@C opening|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  a finesse through the opening bidder and a bit|pg||
nt|petergill: but small errors are creeping into EW's game - like - would West have returned @C9 from 9xxx on the last hand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: by the huge margin of 1 imp     Dutch Premier League   i get the feeling it is analogous to the ACBL's Grand National Team|pg||
nt|sybarra2: I think a bit more than that |pg||
nt|sybarra2: I would put it more like the Reisinger |pg||
nt|ahollan1: more than the GNT?|pg||
nt|sybarra2: maybe you feel that GNT is more than I do |pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh  in importance   i made comparison because it runs over multiple months  starting at club level|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 3@h ! or 3@c |pg||
nt|petergill: I get it - even if 3NT goes minus 100, that's not bad - and the gain if it makes is so huge|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  pass is far more plausible at total-p[oints or match-points|pg||
mb|2S|nt|pole_as_ch: North calmly pass !|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C = pass/correct|pg||

nt|fabsayc: 1@S four or five spades|pg||
nt|sybarra2: ok that is true |pg||
nt|sybarra2: re over many months|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh !!!!  2@c !!|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@c can make i believe|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 1NT by W in OR|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2NT puppet to 3C or nat|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thx operator|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: i think puppet to @c|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: this would be push, or 1,2 imp|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: 1@S forcing     2@C=5-7 HCP, 0-2@S, not 6+@C/@D  [3m], not 5+@H [2@D]|pg||
nt|sybarra2: van Prooijen-Verhees, playing in the closed room, won the Dutch Teams Championship (by 1 IMP!) less than 36 hours ago. They must be jet-lagged. Quite a journey from Amsterdam to ...|pg||
nt|sybarra2: ...|pg||
nt|sybarra2: to Japan|pg||
nt|sybarra2: playing here |pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmmmmm   i thought 2N showed 6+@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and game force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H confirms @C and shows extras  [i think]   maybe just extras|pg||
nt|petergill: Pass by West, converting East's Dbl for penalties, yields 800 or 1100 or more, I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lead director :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: I thought maybe he would try 1 @S to see if it was majors |pg||
nt|mrdct: lose 2@s and a trick in each of the other suits|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: strange 3N|pg||
nt|ahollan2:   55   3N-2|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@H = 5+ spades, 8+ pts, GF|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT = minimum, fast arrival in GF auction, minimum for strong club|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: the others would wish they had interediate 2@D opener|pg||
nt|ahollan1: intermediate|pg||
nt|ahollan1: similar to the Precision 2@C opener|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually i think 1@D is fine|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: how can it be game force after negative 1@D?|pg||
nt|vugraphzws: Alert with P is miss.sorry|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes next hand please :)|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 3@d is "help suit" like  maybe .|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: GT|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: stopped ??|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is more of a bluff to open 1@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: in OR, West's 1NT !  humm.|pg||
nt|mrdct: i guess there is chance for declarer to over think a potential bad trump break going for an endplay in @d|pg||
nt|mrdct: which could be indicated with the @H opening by west|pg||
nt|mrdct: btw 2@h is 10-13 5+@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: can be weaker in 3rd|pg||
nt|mrdct: the east-west system has no weak 2 available so with hands like west you need to improvise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if 3@C again pass/correct then 2@H was just showing max|pg||
nt|kemperg: dbl = support 3@Hs|pg||
nt|sybarra: becaise if pard bids a minor Reid has a good hand |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: could be a great result though|pg||
nt|othered1: 1N response looks Bluish, not Precision|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  on this deal is the club ace a perculiar safety play to make six clubs|pg||
pc|h4|nt|andyv:  card says 1@s was a balanced relay so probably couldn|pg||
nt|andyv:  couldn't hold 6 spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: either my notes or vP's bid are wrong|pg||
nt|ahollan1: fun system to study     i first saw Ultimate Canape played by Russ Ekeblad   the Dutch have made some minor changes but the overall structure is intact|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: hu ?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: i wonder -- what is default meaning of RDBL for CRASH players|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  I wld double 1D as North, meaning both majors|pg||
pc|hK|nt|petergill: 4@S should make, but is not totally cold|pg||
nt|fabsayc: over 1@D what else ed?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: didn't mention earlier  carding  odd/even   so @H10 was discouraging  and i think Reverse Suit preference|pg||
nt|othered1: 1@H in Precision?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hence  the @C shift|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no   1@S=relay over 1@H response|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was about to say  best contract 1N [which they can't reach]   when result from other room popped up|pg||
nt|petergill: the sort of contract an expert should make and an average player might not make|pg||
nt|petergill: On this lead, 4@S is even colder|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 8 tricks ?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra2: do we hear the screaching of brakes?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: over 1@D   1@H/@S look like matchpoint precision / meckwell ...   4+suit, one-round force|pg||
pc|cK|nt|pole_as_ch: heww|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: whew|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: and lead ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think response of 1N with 3433 is just old time bridge judgement|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the hand looks like NT so ...|pg||
nt|othered1: How often have you seen 5-card major, Precision players use that type of judgment?  .05 percent of the time?|pg||
nt|petergill: Tony had a lousy hand opposite a known weak hand, so 1NT by him over 1@D would have been a gross overbid|pg||
nt|petergill: NS play weak 1NT in 1/2 seat|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  South's Pass is forced, Norths is plausible|pg||
pc|c4|nt|pole_as_ch: use @d for many tricks ?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: @C for an imps else flat|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D in context of (10)11-15 HCP  is great description of East hand|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  w3hat about 3NT shd we lay down the club ace|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT has at least 9 top tricks, even with bare @CK offside|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: to account for the artificial 1N overcall   EW DBL isn't pure takeout shape -- can include normal strong NT|pg||
nt|kemperg: 10 tricks, claim|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: or -1|pg||
pc|c7|pc|h3|nt|mrdct: @D10 is a good card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thru 8   China Women  2  leads  Oni-Taka  11-0|pg||
nt|cc469: in response to specs questions, I assume W bid this way to show that his suits were @Cs and @Hs not both minors and he seemed to feel he wanted to be in game|pg||
pc|s2|nt|pole_as_ch: britts comes|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|cc469: curious @H duck|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe "minor changes" is an underbid|pg||
nt|petergill: Inconvenience of entries, rather than prescience, led to that play|pg||
nt|petergill: South hanging on to his @D in case declarer has a guess in @D|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sybarra: not likely to see dummy |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: was Hirata on a different wave length there?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: did he want to save @C10 for later??|pg||
nt|mrdct: danger for declarer is ruffing stuff early and lsoing control when the bad trump break reveals itsel;f|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: look like flat|pg||
pc|h5|nt|petergill: Lead alteration continued on Bd 40 when Bulgaria's South mildly surprized me by not bidding (risking?) 2@H over 1NT. New leaders. |pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my thinking    should have thought before playing @DA|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: surely|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|sT|nt|pole_as_ch: @c swich by south was bad. maybe 4 make.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mrdct: he'll cross to @DA and pitch a @h now|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: but this is safe|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: coffee hand|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: make that  didn't he want to save ...|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|petergill: lead up to 8.5 imps as Down Under score their first 3 imps of the last quarter|pg||

pc|c5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we will see both the end of Quarter Finals and entire Semi Finals today|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both are 32 board matches|pg||
nt|petergill: 9.5 imps now|pg||
pc|c6|pc|sJ|nt|kiwibridge: 2 more on 9 its a 3 imp match now|pg||
nt|petergill: 70 to EW|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  6C I win the heart aq and club ace, spade ace, spade ruff djto ace spade ruff, dq q to king and spade ruff, or discard and claim|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mrdct: can make a beer card now|pg||
nt|mrdct: let's see if he's up to it|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|andyv:  that didn't work out too well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: underlead of @DA probably wouldn't work  but seems only chance to beat the contract|pg||

nt|ahollan2:   41   P-1N(13-15)-2@D-P//2@S    that will extend Down Under lead|pg||

nt|twcho: how to show both M after thsi 1@d opening?|pg||
nt|sybarra: rather unpleasant splits everywhere here |pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: Klinger also did it !|pg||

nt|kemperg: 3NT on S frequently done|pg||
nt|mrdct: 1@d is 4+ @h|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: precious 5 imps|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: gosh a natural bid |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=FG, 10+ HCP, 3+ CNTRL [A=2, K=1], a) BAL [5@C/@D(332) ok]  b) 1-suit, 5+@H|pg||
nt|petergill: other table: bd 41 - 2@s will fail by a couple of tricks for about 6 imps to Down Under|pg||
nt|petergill: The wafer-thin 5@C is a very lucky make for Ew here|pg||
mb|2D!|an|2-H|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=10-15 hcp, 4+@H    maybe LONGER 2nd suit or 5@H 5@S|pg||

nt|twcho: how to bring the @s into picture?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: mirrors?|pg||
nt|cc469: yes, why open 1@H?|pg||
nt|kemperg: I would find p with 4 @Hs and xx in @S then:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now Reid will make next bid to get complete distribution|pg||
nt|dburn: wonder why West did not overcall - maybe 1@d would be conventional|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: 2@D relay  again, not promising ANY strength|pg||
nt|kemperg: quanti|pg||
nt|petergill: China Women 2, with Wang Wenfei, who was World  1 woman player briefly before her approx two years off, back from her break|pg||
nt|petergill: this Bulgaria All Stars is almost locked into the Final 8 too, as is Japan's top team Oni-taka, some of whom came 9th in the 2011n Bermuda Bowl|pg||
nt|mrdct: i don't think the overtrick on 26 makes any difference as 180 and 200 are both 5 imps|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: or 6@d ?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: y|pg||
nt|mrdct: 6@d is a great contract|pg||
nt|mrdct: maybe 4@h by north now|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: and 5@c by south ?|pg||
nt|othered1: god question|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good point David|pg||
nt|othered1: good question|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C strong|pg||
nt|petergill: E's Pass = not many points at all, or @S|pg||
nt|petergill: and NS can make 3@D|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D denies 3 hearts|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S = Iliev likes to compete|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  the wafer thin four spades...|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: 2@H = 1-suiter, not solid suit|pg||
nt|cc469: I see|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: another approch !  why not 3NT ?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: or almost, couple of imps away|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|mrdct: is north not happy with his @s stopper?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe it *shows*|pg||
nt|mrdct: maybe 2@s is showing the @s stopper(s)|pg||
nt|petergill: Oz Players is 6th so needs to avoid a serious loss in order to qualify|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=one round force   2@C natural   don't know which suit is longer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C=exactly 4243|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@H game try|pg||
nt|petergill: which West will reject - how does 3@S play?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: @S well placed, will make 6|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, can't help it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C confirms canape hand   4@H  LONGER @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and lack of @S bid we have pretty good picture of South hand|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 3 or 4 ??|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: well, 4 !|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 4 for me too|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: 2N relay for distribution|pg||
nt|andyv:  have to like the quality of the spot cards W|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 7+@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not 7222|pg||
nt|andyv:  but he makes it up in volume|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might be the one system in the world that has trouble with 5@S 5@H :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think 3@D asks total controls  [A=2 K=1]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: step 1 = 3   |pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  West is not a greedy man|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@S could be a close battle|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  This could be his "where I spent my spade grand slam - story"|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: What is her choice for OL?|pg||
nt|twcho: interesting system|pg||
nt|twcho: another strange bid by north|pg||
nt|ahollan1: strike that  their teammates in the winning Bermuda Bowl    Tarzan Precision opens 1@H with 5@H and 5+@S  [because of their relay structure]|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@S was 4 spades, longer clubs, 14+ points|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: sry, last BD, west ! Mullanphy !|pg||
nt|cc469: appears to be -300|pg||
nt|petergill: Cannot get to 5@C if you never bid clubs!|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  better than 3nt|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mrdct: hard for south to avoid game now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: RDBL would be  to play   not sure about PASS :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: now show 0/1@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: was just typing    @H ruff will be with natural trump trick - is there a way to avoid that defense|pg||
nt|mrdct: i guess with the EW major not revealed 4@h could be contrued as natural by north|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  If North hsad randomn rubbish and Hristov had passed with good spades..|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  I think West should bid 1NT|pg||
nt|petergill: If West rebids 1NT, he should scrape home - e.g. win spade lead - club to queen, duck @H if @CK is ducked.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: well sure -- lead @D  :)|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh !  sound !?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: i c|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: agree|pg||
nt|mrdct: in the open room west showed @h naturally so north was able to cue with 4@h so i think the slam will be reached in the open room|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: alas duplication|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: i like the auction in OR.|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 3@H interpreted as asking for @h stop for 3NT|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  doomed unless the defences cross|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: 4@H slam try in @C|pg||
nt|mrdct: a nice 5-5 and partner showing some values|pg||
nt|mrdct: Oz Players are 2/3 of the team which narrowly lost the Australian National Open Team 2 weeks ago|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: they go to 6@d in OR|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@D double surely contributes nothing to defense chances|pg||
nt|othered1: perhaps a lead, as it's not clear where south is considering playing, is it?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: only works if partner ends up on lead against 6@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@DX  or  XX would have been fun to watch|pg||
nt|othered1: or 6@H?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pole_as_ch: 4 made in OR !  England Ladies will gain 1 imp.  |pg||
nt|petergill: so momentum in an untidy auction has carried EW to 4@S |pg||
pc|h9|nt|sybarra2: can not imagine W is truly interested |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S = min|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good lord, are they slamming again|pg||
nt|sybarra2: teetering on it |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i doubt verhees shows  disinterest with @CAK-7th|pg||
nt|sybarra2: maybe the 4 @S=min slows them down?|pg||
nt|petergill: Nil vul is a good vul to compete a lot at partscore level - if wrong, minus 50 plus minus 50 is only 3 imps|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think so -- but don't quote me|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ahollan1:  10  Tony Nunn in West made 3@C where Banxiang made 1N|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: yep|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i still think doubles of relays help opponents more than your side|pg||
pc|cK|nt|pole_as_ch: East could easily lost 6@d|pg||
pc|c9|pg||

pc|s5|nt|sybarra2: again the sounds of brakes are deafening |pg||
nt|xenya: maybe N could have a bit more|pg||
nt|xenya: 22?|pg||

pc|s9|nt|pole_as_ch: BD 10 ?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no this one|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||

nt|ahollan1: so good save against 3@S :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: loses 2 anyway|pg||
nt|petergill: @DA switch upon winning @SA looks likely|pg||

nt|petergill: Isee = Sartaj was not vul opposite a passed hand - so a 1@S overcall on xx, xxx, xx, QJ10xxx might have been golden?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: with non-min  Verhees would have responded keycards   that keeps them out of slam too [on this hand]|pg||
nt|mrdct: declaer in a bind here as he does have his tricks and knows that when west gets in he's off|pg||
pc|d6|nt|dalzielpas:  1s is making now i think|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mrdct: *doesn't have his tricks|pg||
nt|petergill: The psyche is more likely in Mollo books or if Michael Courtney (or Dalziel or Pascoe) is North, but I get it - Pass of 1@S is the riskiest thing for West to do. |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|petergill: other table: EW missing the making 3NT on Bd 25 means Oz Players must avoid more major adverse swings, else their Finals place will be in jeopardy|pg||

nt|ahollan2:  other table   42  after funny 2@D opener from East [weak (5+4+) @S & minor]  south ends in 2N|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  he has reduced his trumps. this rather promotes dummys ten|pg||

nt|petergill: Bermuda Bowl|pg||
nt|petergill: After 5 or 6 days' bridge, funny things happen to teams of four who have played bridge all day every day|pg||

mb|4S|nt|andyv:  sorry, 10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3rd 2@C opener|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: now difficult 4 @s|pg||
nt|sybarra2: this is the "I have an opening bid" 1 @D |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15 HCP, 0+@D, maybe longer @C/@S, but NOT @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as here  often weak NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=4+ fit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=(13)14+ unbal or 16+ bal   [unfav  1N=13-15]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this 3-suiter shows why the Precision 2@D bid was modified to include (43)15 hands|pg||
nt|dburn: what would a 2@d opening mean?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: their 2M = M + minor  so my guess 2@D=weak @H or @S|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@C = clubs and spades, at least 5-5|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  you still prefeer 1S on North Peter|pg||
nt|petergill: I think I prefer 1@s when playable in 3 suits|pg||
nt|petergill: and you?|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  After 1S EW will be promptly pushed to 5D|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@C has the advantage of bidding your whole hand in one go, avoiding last guesses and all that |pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S 5+ @s, 5+ minor|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  hi|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@D Leaping Michaels|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: and 3rd 2@D response|pg||
nt|ahollan1: RDBL=4+@H|pg||
nt|xenya: if 20 is the limit, 4N looks purposeless|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: and full of controls |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: this BD also no storm, maybe |pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the early days of Precision where 2@D was 4414 or 4405   we would open South hand 1@D rather than 2@C|pg||
nt|petergill: prev board: I see - with A96 in spades, South cannot play @S9 in case N has J10 doubleton|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: trouble hand again ??|pg||
mb|5S|nt|andyv:  must be nice to have so many hands fit into your system:)|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 1@h = @s showing, and 2@s = 4 card @s  maybe !|pg||
nt|Walddk4: yes, and a minimum|pg||
nt|mrdct: usually voids opposite AK/AQ aren't so great but no problems here in 6@d EW|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  Rebid 4S if partner raises|pg||
mb|d|nt|andyv:  S had a pretty easy dbl |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: thx Roland.|pg||
nt|mrdct: typically aggressive fav vul preempt by ben|pg||

nt|ahollan1: on  25  [the weird 2N opener]   South playing 3@S|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: someone goes to 7 ?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh !|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: yep  define the system then make arrangements with The Great Shuffler|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: how do y think 4@c /|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: *?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not nice|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  keep your clubs - you could miss a heart fit with 3c|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: hum|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the west hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  NS are rapidly becoming spectators in these auctions|pg||
nt|petergill: other table Bd 26: Ron Klinger is in 4@S, should make it|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am surprised Reid wasnt in there with spades  (except he is red) |pg||
nt|petergill: 5@D seems to be an advance save taken against a game that NS were not about to bid|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  these flippers play anything. rememder that diamond seven|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk4: Declarer mistimed this in the open room|pg||
nt|mrdct: they probably a convention that will help them avoid that|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@D is a lucky make|pg||
pc|d2|nt|pole_as_ch: 3NT would be better contruct, but West choiced 4@s.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H holding 4  means  either weak NT or  4414/4405|pg||
nt|cc469: that should help the @H guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzws: 2NT maybe 20-21|pg||
nt|xenya: well a good 21 could be enough for slam|pg||
nt|xenya: 21 plus a 5-carder for example|pg||
nt|kemperg: we might upgrade that|pg||
pc|dA|nt|pole_as_ch: 11imp comes, so 21 imps wide spreaded|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: @h2 ?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: @s3 ?|pg||
nt|othered1: In any case, minimum openings with @C aren't handled optimally by forcing @C systems.  Costly to have to spend two bids (2@C and 2@D) in many systems to handle them|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D south in other room|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|andyv:  you aren't dealt NT hands in order to be passing |pg||
nt|ahollan1: vP described 7+@C again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would you overcall 2N or DBL Andy?|pg||
nt|mrdct: not a challenging lead fro declarer - this should make easiluy'|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh !|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: ?|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@D showed 5+ @d and 5+ @H, good hand|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|pole_as_ch: 3 in @s, 3 in @h, 1 in @d, 1 in @C, so 8 tricks.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: not available    everything other than PASS = game force|pg||
nt|sybarra: lucky him |pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: ihave no experience of precision|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pole_as_ch: only play against them a few times|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: and swich @CQ ?|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if west bid 4@H   does south bid 4@S|pg||
nt|twcho: south won't bid for sure|pg||
nt|twcho: north may consider|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 2NT and 3@h is ASKing ? |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: it looks easily reach 6@d|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: anyways|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a hand of little interest, 4 to go|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: maybe|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: but entry problem |pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  yes, does double show the two aces or uutterly deny them in such cases|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  if it shows N might bid 6D to make, if it says stop then it denies|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  draw trumps now so north doesnt get o|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kemperg: so it depends on their style|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the meantime  EW did well to find 4@H|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I was just thinking trump|pg||
nt|petergill: Trump switch is best |pg||
pc|sK|nt|pole_as_ch: Both table is the same point and thinking |pg||
pc|sA|nt|andyv:  dbl|pg||
nt|ahollan1: remember  2@C could be 4@C and 5+@S|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|petergill: I would have played a heart, not a 2nd spade. |pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer might have to guess @h's now|pg||

nt|petergill: and duly found|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: agree|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 2 ruff in each hand is not enought, because South would ruff 3rd @h.|pg||
nt|cc469: he seemed to thinkl a long time over 2@H|pg||
nt|xenya: true, but S was a passed hand, so no risk really |pg||
nt|petergill: My co-commentator is Michael Courtney|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  Mere impetus- 1D 1S 2s Pass 4S|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphzws:  penalty card CQ|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: ah, @s est plan is easy i think. y, after wind up thier trump|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they are accurate enough that north might have considered 3@H over west's pass|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't like Kx as stopper when opps say they have 6 of them...can't even hold up once|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and for those who pay attention to trivia   this is 2nd 8-card @S suit of the set|pg||
nt|kemperg: 25-5|pg||

pc|h2|pg||
nt|cc469: thinking about doubleton@SQ?|pg||
nt|cc469: after unblocking the J?|pg||
nt|cc469: high school teachers always said if you decide on a plan of action and then rethink and change your mind ...|pg||
nt|cc469: you were probably right the first time|pg||
nt|cc469: yes good point, spec suggests maybe we're stuck|pg||

nt|xenya: how many more rounds to play?|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1 up now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hard to believe he ran 8@C as a winner|pg||
pc|h8|nt|pole_as_ch: well, 1 up.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|petergill: when you're playing with Tony Nunn, offering to be dummy by bidding 3@C might right-side the hand - true or false?|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Yes, South could have defeated it (ruffing @DK)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: should North bid game?    red vs white 'preempt' in sandwich position??|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: hummm. 2@h by NS ?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: he was never in danger in fact gained an imp|pg||

mb|d|nt|ahollan1: that picked up 2 overtrick imps   but  5@C much better at imps|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1N=RELAY, INV+|pg||

nt|dalzielpas:  better to show 2 suited hand with 553 if partner has passed|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: how many @C has vanProoijen held this set?|pg||
nt|sybarra2: the Yeh Bros team is:  Chen Yeh, JuiYiu Shih, ChiMou Lin, Herstein Liu, Patrick Huang, Grace Lin |pg||
nt|sybarra2: and they Yeh Bros sponsor a great tourney also shown on bbo |pg||
nt|ahollan1: agree|pg||
nt|cc469: yes, but 8 card suit?|pg||
nt|petergill: transfer to @H|pg||
nt|mrdct: going with the odds and transfering to his 5cM|pg||
nt|petergill: tfr to 1H or other gf, 2@D did not promise @H|pg||
nt|petergill: if GF|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: 3@d by E ?|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra2: another invitation tourney |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Patrick Huang bid only 2N  but still got to game|pg||
nt|xenya: or 1N?|pg||
nt|petergill: take the plus? |pg||
nt|petergill: or 2@S - 3@S - 4@S? |pg||
nt|petergill: dbl of 2@H is t/o|pg||
nt|mrdct: the GF option muddies the water here for W|pg||
nt|petergill: West did not expect it to be GF|pg||
nt|petergill: I think 2@S the first time is best - 3@S - 4@S |pg||
nt|petergill: but perhaps 4@S is hard to bid after the weak 1NT|pg||
nt|mrdct: yes, but the GF option affect the meanings of double of 2@d|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H if passed out will be about 300|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@S will be 620 or 650, 2@S will be 170 or 200|pg||

nt|mrdct: if 2@h is dbled, can NS escape to 3@d?|pg||
nt|petergill: I think 2@S the previous time is best, as the delayed 2@S sounds "balancing" or weaker |pg||
nt|petergill: so 2@S now might get passed by East|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: transfer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: more relays from Reid|pg||
nt|petergill: Thin overcall, lacking aces and balanced - by East - do you approve of 2@C, Michael?|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  i would i like having six|pg||
nt|petergill: Lead is now 19.5 imps, all in dribs and drabs - just like the second quarter of the match. |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra2: Patrick is a frequent commentator with us (when not playing) |pg||
nt|sybarra2: he also lived in Netherlands for many years and probably "brought these dutchies up" |pg||
nt|ahollan1: which black suit to attack??    that answer affects play to trick 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D lead director rather than showing 2 suiter missing the boss suit|pg||
nt|twcho: does 2@s here guarantee 4 cards support?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i doubt it|pg||
nt|mrdct: decided to take the plus|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: ah !|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and a quiet part score |pg||
nt|ahollan1: for what it is worth   Conditions of Contest actually discuss handling of "screen hesitations"|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  if you cant make a poor pun out of that you're not brian senior|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  1nt must promise 9-12|pg||
nt|petergill: Iliev prefers 1@S to my choice of 1NT|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sybarra: there is one more hand after this hand |pg||
nt|twcho: yes, I doubt it too. :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=short @H  not 7@D 0@H|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  he must guess hearts to make|pg||
pc|dA|nt|andyv:  redbl...first round control|pg||
nt|ahollan1: also an icon in the bridge world   has been playing international level bridge since late 1950s|pg||
nt|kemperg: sorry dont know|pg||
nt|petergill: other table: On Bd 27, EW have found their way into the auction, so it might be a swing to Australia. |pg||
nt|fabsayc: not much danger of reaching 6@S on this auction|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: down under eking back a few imps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  3073 still possible|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mrdct: only an 8-card fit, west is balanced, dodgey stiff @DK in east|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seeing @SK in dummy   West wants to go back and DBL|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: BD 10 oz/nz gains 3 imp|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: and 3NT ?|pg||
nt|othered1: Shouldn't be 6@S danger with their methods.  Standard bidders may have more problems.|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|sybarra: we want to thank our operator for wonder presentation |pg||
nt|xenya: i think he can make it|pg||
nt|petergill: I would not like my suit lacking AQ1098 vulnerable and would pass - it's only the club suit - which often gets outbid anyway|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ahollan1:  12  after 1@C auction  Bakhsi had no trouble finding DBL  and they've found @H|pg||
nt|sybarra2: not sure I really want to be there however |pg||
nt|fabsayc: i would not even cue with norths non=opener|pg||
nt|ahollan1: may not be an option in the partnership|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he could bid bid 4@S over the double surely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i.e.  common agreement  MUST return cuebid if available below game|pg||
nt|mrdct: 1NT is 10+ bal GF|pg||
nt|ahollan1: trump shift?????|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@C = 7@D 1@H (23)  with 4 controls????|pg||
nt|fabsayc: how does south blackwood here, al?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure, possibly Newell has shown exact 3172|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no need for blackwood|pg||
nt|othered1: if they've shows controls, no real need for Blackwood|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they use controls|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: different situation when 1 hand shows 5+ AND forces to game   versus  competitive bidding war|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mrdct: 1@c is 14+|pg||
nt|xenya: possibly with an overtrick|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: will test Peter's declarer play for sure :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: still need to find out about diamond queen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm just not sure here|pg||
nt|petergill: NS underlead (Rusinow) queen through nine usually|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is prooijen pretending to lead a singleton|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: fufufufu|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch:  11, 2@h by N in OR|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 3NT ???|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mrdct: 2@h and 3@h look natural|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3@s i guess is a cue and 3NT is a slam try|pg||
nt|mrdct: beyond that i'm guessing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: see  @D lead director|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: hummm, just make or less.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so close in the other match NEDUK bu 5 with 3 to go|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Y|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe 4@d is some sort of Blackwood|pg||
nt|ahollan1: [i think]  4@D ask for Denial Cue   shown  @D [longest] then @C [lowest when other unknown]|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i suppose south might bid 6nt in case the diamond queen is missing, hoping to run the spades in the worst case|pg||
pc|h3|nt|pole_as_ch: good contruct !  it looks cold.  so 5 imps buck.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one of the first to play Precision  [helped CC Wei with some system clarification  or maybe just in introducing the system in Taiwan]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from old Zejun convention card    carding is standard Count   odd/even discard   and presumably no attitude signals vs suit|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sybarra: and thx to NEC and the Japan Contract Bridge League for bringing this wonderful tourney once again to bbo |pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh ?|pg||
nt|petergill: By now, these two teams of four must feel like battle-scarred warriors near the end of a long campaign|pg||
nt|petergill: Maintaining concentration is vital|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|petergill: 3@S over 2@H is too risky for me - singleton heart in partner's hand seems wasted opposite KQJ10|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: No entry for south, then push ?|pg||
nt|ahollan2:  @S10 might be entry |pg||
nt|othered1: Impressive|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other table also 6N|pg||
nt|othered1: 6N makes any time either 6@S or 6@D makes.|pg||
nt|othered1: And some times one or the other doesn't make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @C lead in other room   not that it matters|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right   6N has play when @D not breaking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but then needs favorable @S layout|pg||
nt|ahollan1: OR ...  no @H lead :)|pg||
nt|othered1: so?  If you ran into a 4-0 @D break, wouldn't you like to have a secondary play?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just expanding on your claim that 6N is best contract|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mrdct: suggested to me that 3NT might be blackwood and 4NT king ask|pg||
nt|mrdct: which does eem to fit|pg||
nt|mrdct: *seem|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: that will make|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: c|pg||
nt|othered1: Oh, sorry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: )|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now 7N :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk4: Yes, nice to have 7 top tricks in 1NT|pg||
nt|mrdct: but they've got to a good spot|pg||
nt|othered1: Unlikely that would be lead against 7 :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: bonus imp|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ahollan2:  sooo close|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: uhee|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: leader changing |pg||
nt|ahollan2:  on board 29   Bulgarian All Stars take the lead over defending champions NEDUK|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  diamond looks best|pg||
nt|petergill: margin is 8.5 imps with 6 boards to go|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kiwibridge: I don't understand all these ducking plays here|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: difficult for Defence, esp for E|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  ew good for 3c|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mrdct: fro latecomers, EW play fantunes|pg||
nt|mrdct: *for|pg||
nt|mrdct: managing this 5-0 @h break will take some care|pg||
nt|petergill: From West's point of view, N's expected doubleton heart makes North more likely to have 4 spades = bad for bidding @S's|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: wow|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|andyv:  lead my get N to lose a @d  trick|pg||
nt|mrdct: i'm now told 4@s is "turbo" but i need to plead ignorance|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He might even make an overtrick|pg||
pc|cT|nt|xenya: but N correctly switched to @Ds|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 4imps for 2@H we have a battle here|pg||
pc|c7|nt|pole_as_ch: not have 2 suiter OC vs 1@d open ???|pg||
pc|d9|nt|pole_as_ch: she !|pg||
nt|Walddk4: sorry|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: BD 11, 4 imp to ONI-Taka|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|petergill: When N trumps this, he has nothing attractive to play|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  ruff then heart king is best|pg||
nt|petergill: Perhaps @HK now is best, to keep declarer away from high club?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|pc|h6|nt|jaapfr: gm ga ge all|pg||
nt|mrdct: might try to take advantge of the good @h pips here and play the hand on cross ruff lines|pg||
nt|xenya: now it's much harder|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Taka come from W in this room, maybe|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 7 tricks |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: but Deffence have not sure 5, only 4 ?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: any suit is ok ?|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|petergill: @S9 looms as threat if club is played and ruffed|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  still if declarer now plays club he must next ruff high|pg||
nt|petergill: so perhaps low heart was best, I'm not sure|pg||
nt|petergill: Complex hand to play and defend|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  ck will fail now|pg||
nt|ahollan2:   59  [4@SE-2]  where Hristov bid 1@S  Newell bid 2@C then 2@S    question now is whether they play 4@C or 5@C|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  trump queen then ruff high will succeed|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 59 - newell reid have bid to 4@c so far, bidding not over|pg||
nt|ahollan2:  4@C East|pg||
nt|petergill: looks like bd 59 might increase the margin|pg||
nt|petergill: 6 imps on Bd 59 makes it 14.5 imps with 5 boards to go|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|d8|nt|kemperg: killing defense|pg||
nt|kemperg: no@C|pg||
pc|s5|pg||

pc|hT|pg||

nt|mrdct: he hasn't made it yet|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 2NT by W in OR, and 1 off should|pg||
pc|dT|nt|petergill: now it's either -1 or -2|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|fabsayc: can make 6 now|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: little change and 6 might be|pg||
nt|petergill: New Zealand is doing equally as well as Auatralia, Michael|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 2NT = 19-20|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3@d showig @h i assume|pg||
mb|5D|nt|xenya: looks like 3 off on the surface|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S was from Reid -- normal transfer|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 3@d = INV ??|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  ns must reach any of the three main games|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  4h likeliest|pg||
mb|d|nt|jaapfr: but who would finesse @DQ over S after 3@S opening???|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@S fit-jump is forcing to 4@H and tells South what to lead if EW save |pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  good|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  here EW may reach a doomed 6H|pg||
mb|5H|nt|mrdct: not me|pg||
nt|sybarra: everyone getting too high here |pg||

mb|p|nt|kemperg: last board, thanks to my cocommentator Vladimir and our operator, see you next round in 45 min.|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks Germ, thanks everyone|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think 3@H is one round force|pg||
nt|petergill: Dbl for @d lead |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: what does that mean after 1@D which is 0+ suit?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i would think other 2 suits|pg||
nt|twcho: I will assume it to be natural|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so must DBL or bid 2N with the other 2?|pg||
nt|twcho: yes, looks natural for me|pg||
nt|xenya: i predict S will bid 6 :)|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@D transfer to @H ---> but with equal or longer spades S replies 3@S|pg||
nt|petergill: so South has shown longer @h than @S|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: and calm 3NT !|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 3 bd remains include this|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  NZ are not playing Hristov!|pg||

pc|sA|nt|pole_as_ch: now no entry for dummy ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: followers of Marty Bergen/Eric Rodwell profess    if you don't make immediate raise -- you don't have 4-card fit|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: if @s, then N may, if @h then South |pg||
pc|s9|nt|petergill: both teams look 100% safe for qualifying, barring accidents at the other table|pg||
nt|petergill: Bulg 3rd, Oz 6th before this match, 8 qualify after this match|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@H by South is a pleasant enough contract, NS sill be happy|pg||
nt|petergill: NT by South is mich harder to play, having to lead always from the South hand|pg||
nt|petergill: much|pg||

nt|petergill: which is a clue - South must have 5 spades not 3 for the 4@S bid, so North has overcalled on 4 spades, so might have 5 clubs|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for the spectators -- there is no single right answer  bidding over a nebulous 1@D   you must have partnership agreement|pg||

nt|petergill: have that agreement|pg||
nt|petergill: opening lead: the trump lead seems unlikely to succeed when you have nothing in your hand to stop dummy's spade suit from running. I would have led a @D|pg||

nt|petergill: 1NT 5-8... playing weak 1NT, with no 4M and 9-11(12) they bid 2@D invit and with GF they respond 2@C GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Hence only 2NT by S, opposite 5-8|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: pretty typical of systems based on Symmetric Relay  for 2@H rebid to show "reverser"|pg||

nt|ahollan1: thru 13    China Women  2   31   over  Oni-Taka   15|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: can make ??|pg||
nt|cc469: wrong guess|pg||

nt|ahollan1: nice play!|pg||
nt|petergill: This 3NT is just about overtrick(s)|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: surely|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a flat board wouldn't surprise|pg||
nt|petergill: Fancy @HA play by West, straight out of Mollo's books|pg||
nt|petergill: Quite the expert touch, to try to convince declarer that @HQ is onside|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  he might crossruff|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kiwibridge: has to lay down A|pg||
nt|petergill: so North, a passed hand, has @DA and @HA, so is unlikely to have @SK as well. |pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  N0w club maybe it willl work|pg||
nt|petergill: I think sartaj was trying to duck @H into the safe hand, hence delayed playing on @D in case @DQxx in E with @SK offside - but I might be wrong|pg||
nt|petergill: N is concerned that @SK may be offside|pg||
nt|petergill: He might take a while on this trick - about 3 minutes perhaps|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  Hard to get a fifth trick for the defenders|pg||
nt|petergill: Sartaj used to play very fast all the time, but nowadays he sometimes plays almost as slowly as I do|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  two clubs and two hearts just poissible|pg||
nt|petergill: I think he is a better card player as a result, but I am biased, thinking that my slow ("thoughtful") style is good|pg||
nt|petergill: Good defence by West|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d3|nt|pole_as_ch: BD 13, 2NT !|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: Last BD of this seg|pg||
nt|petergill: Beer card (@D7)  to North - Tony will buy the beer tonight|pg||
nt|petergill: or sake]|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: y|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes we must thank Sartaj and Tony also :)|pg||
nt|petergill: lead back up to 12.5 imps with 3 boards to be scored|pg||
nt|ahollan2:   61  where Iliev responded to takeout double with 1@S on 3   Reid bid 1N   raised to 2 and made on time|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sybarra: and thx to the Japan Contract Bridge League and NEC for bringing this find tourney to BBO |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@H = Michaels   weak or strong|pg||
nt|sybarra: back in 30 minutes, but sorry I will not be able to rejoin you |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: chatch them , their 4@HX, as expected ???|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: *catch|pg||
nt|petergill: It shows what can happen when Kiwis and Aussies join together, as Mike Ware from NZ at times has shown too. |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it should happen more often Peter :)|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: No! then calmly 3NT|pg||
nt|mrdct: even that won't be enough|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: will you be back for the final set Kaz?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: tomorrow we can see the battle of Down Under and Bulgarian All Stars|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: thx Gary|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Surely come |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a great pleasure|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: treatment seen during this tournament    after 1M-(2M)    cue of opponent's suit = one strength raise,  2N = different strength|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  thats a big precision NT|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 47: about who had what: If Iliev had @SK and @HAQ and @CK and @Dxx, Iliev would have doubled 1@D for t/o|pg||
pc|s5|nt|pole_as_ch: of course|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nunn opened 1@D [weak NT 1st/2nd]  ends up in 2@D|pg||
nt|othered1: I missed all the early action, but since then I certainly concur -- both pairs have done well.  Their non-standard methods may color one's perception of the results|pg||
nt|dburn: horrid lead problem for North, this|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@H = I could let you play it, but I prefer to play this one myself|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mrdct: bulgaria are a certainty to win this match now|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: agree|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: but OZ-Player did good effort, i think.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: or they could do more ?  sure it is.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: BD 22 is turning point, i think.|pg||
nt|mrdct: they had their chances for sure - but that's what bridge is all about|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thx to our great operator and our audience too|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: thx all specs|pg||
pc|s9|nt|pole_as_ch: thx all specs|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: thx all specs, we enjoy good fight !|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh ?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: try to slam ? or try to better game ??|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: thx Gary, Peter|pg||
nt|petergill: Though Down Under had to battle to qualify, if you look at their Qualifying draw, they played most of the top teams, unlike say Geely Auto who stormed home from the bottom of the ...|pg||
nt|petergill: field. So Down Under truly desevrve their place in the Grand Final|pg||
mc|11|nt|mrdct: there were a few critical hands that went the wrong way for Oz Players. 25 springs to mind where they was a chance to make 2NT and win 11 imps instead of losing 7|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@C would have been transfer to 4@H, but has danger of dbl for club elad|pg||
nt|dalzielpas:  finish|pg||
nt|petergill: 11 tricks claimed - solid results by Hans - Nunn on the last boards looks promising for them|pg||
nt|ahollan2:   62  [5@HW-2]  Reid buys  4@H West|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 62 NZ in 4@H - will he make it?  |pg||
nt|petergill: I have to congratulate Bulgaria on an excellent last quarter, hardly letting Dwon Under score any imps|pg||
nt|petergill: confirming Bulgaria's form when they kncked over the Bermuda Bowl winners in the semi final|pg||
nt|petergill: Play is finished at this table - only the other table to play|pg||
nt|petergill: Reid has safety played to amke 4@H - well done|pg||
nt|ahollan2:  4@H played very well  will make to extend lead|pg||
pg||
