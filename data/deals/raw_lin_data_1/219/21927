mb|5H|mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: oh ! south trys!|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 3NT ?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|eamongall: its about 2 years since I did vugraph so I don't remember exactly |pg||

nt|petergill: Because their other openings are mostly 9-13, NS regard 14+ as "strong"|pg||
nt|petergill: North feeling uncomfortable, as 3@D might be a 4-2 fit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL was takeout|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: certainly he had better chance than in other room|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if this is not good enough they need to revise system, considering east also had 2nt for minors|pg||
pc|s5|nt|fluffy: 1NT will make 3NT a make because east won't lead a diamond|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: same as OR. and plsy ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems rich with minimum 1@C opener and weak suits|pg||
nt|petergill: Best for N to pass, as 3@S would be doubled by W|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Newell PASS just denies ability to game force|pg||
pc|s7|nt|pole_as_ch: 3rd hand should open on good suit, i dare say. |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: so i may open 1@h.|pg||
nt|kemperg: why not 3@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  20  the ladies are in 2N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D implies desire to play in suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: here South has @C stop  and they tend not to lead @S after showing 4+|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|beauch:  looks like 2 down?|pg||
nt|cc469: I think if you bid 2@C you have to be prepared to bid your 4 card @S suit if the opportunity arises ( which it did here)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so invite for most likely game   with 2N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can't jump with south hand when playing standard because the 1@H opener could have up to  20 hcp|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|kemperg: but only invite?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|pole_as_ch: difficult contruct. to make and to defend|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: East can easily slow-in and end-played, nightmare|pg||
nt|xenya: one can sympathise with S. who wanted to show good cards in @C with the 2N bid -- still her hand is more suit=oriented|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: humm. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: for both of our pairs non 1@C openers have maximum of 15 hcp|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thru  21   Oz Players over Bulgarian All Stars by 5 imps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Stamatov is also a team of Bulgarians|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|fluffy: the hand will make 11 tricks comfortable, but if you look in isolation the hand you would rather play 6@c than 3NT before the lead since clubs 2-2 mean 6@c makes and @c3-1 put 3NT ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: in danger|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kemperg: right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course easier to bid South hand when you have tools like Gazilli or Cole |pg||
nt|ahollan1: if I was North   i would have rebid 2@S instead of 2@D|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: c.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 8 or 9 trick.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: EW play GhN)estem  but that still uses  1M-(2N) as 2 lowest unbid|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: this bd now is 17imp swing. +10 or -7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and that is actually what Gold did|pg||
pc|c2|nt|beauch:  peter what would you overcall with east hand over a1@S opener|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes it does|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: @dQ steal and @c ruff will be 10 |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: he not yet knows bad break of trump|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h5|nt|pole_as_ch: if my method, @c is good. so 6@c would be in scope.|pg||
nt|fluffy: lead directing openings in third are fine but they are most useful when you open light on the 10-12 range, with 16 there is not as much lead directing need IMO|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: well.|pg||

nt|eamongall: EW play Carrot Club which is similar to Polish Club .. with 1@C opening being 10-12 balanced or 17+ anything |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: then 5@s ?  get down ??  looks like to make, but...|pg||

nt|fabsayc: 1974|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: didn't NZ lose qualification to KO in last few boards of last RR match??|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: ah, but bad vul for Chen. humm.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: c |pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS do NOT play Namyats, so 4@H wide range|pg||
nt|petergill: The defence to beat 4@S is fairly easy to find|pg||
nt|petergill: but it seems normal for S to bid 5@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=10-15 hcp, 5+@H & 4+@D|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: Verhees still has a chance|pg||
mb|d|nt|fabsayc: yes six was a total mystery in open room also|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so we're skeptical about overtricks on 22 & 24|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H = max of 15 HCP|pg||
mb|2H|mb|d|nt|ahollan1: Danailov might be playing Precision here|pg||
nt|petergill: The suitable vulnerability, position (dealer) and suit texture are the reasons for Martin Reid's expert 4@H opening|pg||
nt|petergill: which has vaulted the World Champions overboard|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=relay   game force or INV in @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL includes strong NT   so not necessarily traditional shape|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3N = 55 with 1@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but what a singleton|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that is result of playing artificial 1N Overcalls  [Raptor]|pg||
mb|2S|nt|pole_as_ch: 4@h can make for EW ???|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems contradictory to use @SK to have points to open then show singleton @S|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|eamongall: 2@Hs and 1 @C was originally to be lost ..|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: why ?  13 tricks are there !?|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: oh ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Eddie Manfield wouldn't approve    "thinking of bidding 5 over 5?  DON'T   the 5 level belongs to the opponents"   was a BOLS Bridge Tip from Ed|pg||
nt|xenya: very true|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 24  2@D made  5 imps to Indonesia|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: Gold opened the North hand|pg||
nt|kemperg: and more to come on this hand:(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS has found a @S fit - just a question of how high the bidding goes|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i'm told both Bulgarian Pairs are playing Precision|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the threatening defense was a heart lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's consistent with what i found for 2009 Bermuda Bowl|pg||
nt|fabsayc: should put in the 10 for extra dummy entry|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: no, @d ruff i lost. sry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course   sometimes the opponents bid 6 over 5 :)|pg||
nt|petergill: I don't like 6@h much. The assumption that partner has very short spades can be faulty, as on the actual hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and the Kings are defensive, not offensive|pg||
nt|petergill: Also, the partner of a fav vul prempter has to take into account that the fav vul prempt might make bidding a lot later very risky|pg||
nt|petergill: @DQ lead would be good for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: but now declarer can manage 11 tricks |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Dawei's hummar would strick the 7 ??|pg||
nt|petergill: Trump lead looks dangerous - opponents might have hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@H snatching defeat from the jaws of victory|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Verhees could not overcall 1N   that would show  4@S and 5+@C/@D|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 3N = gambling  "possible" outside cards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  that is NS description    EW 3N  no outside A/K|pg||

mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: 3NT also ?  and |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 2@s is limit or better raise of @h|pg||
nt|petergill: If EW bid 4@D, North will probably Dbl for t/o with S bidding 4@H from the wrong side, if a spade is led (unlikely)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Peter  after 3N-DBL  do you play 4@D to mean same thing as without DBL??|pg||
nt|petergill: A trump lead might net 300 off 4@DX |pg||
nt|petergill: Yes I do - but that doesn't mean it's the best way to play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it comes up sooooooo often|pg||
nt|petergill: more likely is only 100 off 4@DX|pg||
nt|brgpro: i am surprised to see no 4@H from N the other room, i am sure after 4@h he will get 5@C from S|pg||
nt|brgpro: now N will probably raise|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: ugg. same contruct!  and 1 off should be. another push ?|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: what is 3@D ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if Tueje was forced to rebid 1@S or if she could have bid 1N to show strong NT|pg||
pc|c4|nt|eamongall: cokaholic knows this system .."2@D=3-fit, INV+ " |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: but cannot discard all @s, so anyway 1 off |pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: other room must have finished play :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But a view opposite a passed parner|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, I expected South to bid 4H or Dbl 4@D - perhaps he thought it would be unethical to do so after the long pause (obviously by N) on the other side of the screen?|pg||

mb|3C|nt|pole_as_ch: No game for NS|pg||

nt|Walddk2: In the closed room, Gold showed 25+ balanced with his 2NT rebid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this bidding should help them get to slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: why?   3N - all pass very possible|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW have done great job taking away bidding space|pg||
nt|petergill: EW have pinpointed likely short spades in South, from North's point of view|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=INV, 6+@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  INV+|pg||
nt|brgpro: once W opens 1@d (11-15) i don't think they will be in grand |pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: Same auction as OR, and ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: what side gain + score ?|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@C by South, and I think North, either slowly or quickly, will go all the way to 6@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lucky not to get 4@DI would say|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=good 11-14|pg||
nt|xenya: i might pass as S -- but Tueje has no fear|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'd expect pretty much this distribution of hcp  so PASS figures to lose a couple of imps|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk4: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=4518  Tom Hanlon, also a world class poker player|pg||

nt|ahollan1: ahhh  a picture of Hanlon|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@S is about as ugly a bid as imaginable, i treat 2@C as a cue bid on that auction|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: it looks like push.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh buyed 3@D, and....|pg||
nt|petergill: cf Bd 19 where at fav vul sometimes they break 4-4|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Great point by Martin, assuming EW spades 5-4 not 4-4|pg||
mb|4D|nt|pole_as_ch: Lead of @s2 is showing 3 card, maybe. |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Ito should call this, he surely|pg||
nt|brgpro: E will pull this|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i wager 2@H would get some votes in Master Solvers' Club|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: board upside-down|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk2: He'll raise|pg||
nt|petergill: I expect and hope for 6@C now|pg||
nt|kemperg: not the first 26  pts hand in this tournament:|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Reid's problem is that Newell could be 1444 with no @CQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but does that hand rebid 5@C over 4@S?|pg||
nt|petergill: It's not so obvious to NS that the match has turned out badly so far - e.g. their 2@H making five (Bd 23?) might be a pickup from their point of view|pg||
nt|fabsayc: even then he has diamond hook, also 7 not impossible|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: UG. ducking ?|pg||
mb|4N|nt|ahollan1: 2@H by South|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlucky choice of leads|pg||
mb|p|nt|cc469: a dearth of entries to dummy|pg||
mb|5H|nt|ahollan1: so  my guess of 3N-all pass was just a little off|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe that hand would bid 4NT, Al, choice of games|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very well done Martin Reid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right  so Newell 5@C does sound like 5+ suit|pg||
nt|petergill: also well done to Sartaj Hans not to bid 2@S at other table which might lead NS to 6@C|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks to everyone in Yokohama in Japan for today's broadcast. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: tomorrow  final 4 rounds of 14-board matches in the Qualifying Swiss.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: top 8 teams advance to Knockout|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: humm.  can make by @s finess.|pg||
mb|6D|nt|pole_as_ch: sry bd 24 & 25|pg||
nt|brgpro: that is a good call...4NT...he will get 2 KC answer...what would the KC be?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brgpro: what about 5@c on 3NT Al?|pg||
nt|brgpro: after he has shown 6+@s and preference for @d, that must be exclusion for @d|pg||
nt|ahollan1: have to confess   this is first time i've seen the auction where 2@H bidder had game force hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so i'm not sure about the rest of the bids|pg||
nt|brgpro: he will get the right answer but, then if pd has 2+@h and no @h control, he will also be in trouble|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but  Exclusion Keycard  .... very dangerous when partner has shown the suit|pg||
nt|brgpro: so 4@d was OK as long as he gets a @h cue and , he wasn't looking for a perfection 7 anyway, after all, his pd opened a limited 1@d|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: don't run away our last board is  30   [started with  17]|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|nt|pole_as_ch: No damaged.|pg||

nt|eamongall: ah yes ..I remember .. 2@Ds includes a 4414 distribution |pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: now @C hook?|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d2|pg||
pc|s6|nt|pole_as_ch: bd 26 is 3NT by E !|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: surely Hans will lead it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We are adding voice commentary from the quarter-finals Friday and onwards -->|pg||

pc|s8|pg||
nt|brgpro: that makes no difference in imps anyway|pg||

nt|petergill: Unlucky hand for weak 1NT, this one|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think it was david gold that said weak no trump is a losing proposition at the top level|pg||

mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: right  that's why i asked if there's a default   [if so  i don't know which applies]|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but in this case 4 spades almost guaranteed by double so less need to distinguish length|pg||
nt|eamongall: Yeh .. how come my E and A keep getting mixed up |pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: 4@s can make ??|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 3@d = 4 supp & limit raise |pg||
nt|petergill: Before this match, Downunder had 7 VP gap to 9th so they will possibly drop out of the top 8 overnight|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: more difficult than looking dummy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S another forcing noise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D exact shape|pg||
nt|petergill: Relays are not as important on game hands like this one, but are very good for slam hands|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is there as size ask available now al?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks for the explanation of 3N :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: on 29 ladies in 4@S|pg||

nt|ahollan1: no idea what is happening in the 2 matches that are not on vugraph :(    both were close at the half|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kiwibridge: his team mates did him proud OR|pg||
nt|xenya: this is makeable double-dummy, but hardly with the cards concealed|pg||
pc|sT|nt|eamongall: I think he will go one down |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: @dQ shows seq under that.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 2 @h, 1 @s and can make|pg||
nt|xenya: you need to play for @DK doubleton|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: i think 3@H asks controls  [A=2 K=1]|pg||
nt|petergill: Both 4@S and 3NT are safe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and 3N = 4  [1@S promised at least 3]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Newell knows an Ace  or 2 kings missing    does that help him bid over 3N?|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Come ! and be fun about new team, new heat !|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|pole_as_ch: Tajima would be lead after this BD, but how |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 6!  Chen !???|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: if he behave @d no loser, this can make !! |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: The call of 3@c is very good hint for Dec. so Chen might ....|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: -10 or -11 imp is not hevy lost for Tajima, but Chen should make this for his stand !!|pg||
pc|dK|nt|pole_as_ch: but dummy entry remains ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  29  4@S+1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so pickup for Weak NT|pg||
nt|xenya: right|pg||
nt|kemperg: 11-19 now|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk4: flat board, 11 IMPs = 18-12 VPs, but we are not quite sure that it's scored correctly throughout|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's current Victory Point result|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and so a modest victory to the Hackett team|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: scores from other matches show up under  http://www.jcbl.or.jp/home/English/nec/17th/results/7thFeb/tabid/665/Default.aspx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: must choose results, NEC and then "details"|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: 4@D forces 4@H to signoff   [EndSignal]|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he needs heart queen for slam (ie 12 points)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and AKK rather than AA|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|petergill: so S knew N had either Axxx, xxxx, xx, Axxx or Kxxx, xxxx, Kx, Axx or AKxx, xxxx, Kx, xxx with Q's and J's unknown|pg||
pc|c5|nt|pole_as_ch: and 26imp will be 21-9 vp for Senior Champion !!|pg||
