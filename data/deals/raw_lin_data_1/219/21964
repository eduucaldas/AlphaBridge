nt|rv: cards lying badly for this aggressive action|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|nt|rv: my preference is fit jump of 2@s or mixed raise of 3@h from passed hand|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
nt|rv: don't like 4@h or even drury|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
nt|psyck: 2 Aces & 2 K's lying badly...too bad|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d9|pc|dJ|pc|d2|pg||
nt|rv: 2 down and we could have new leaders?|pg||
nt|psyck: this is certainly not a drury hand, i don't like 3@h mixed either, would chose between 2@s & 4@h|pg||
nt|rv: in such close tight matches, accuracy is very important, this 2 IMP loss could yet prove crucial for Aristos|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: Sundar wondering if @D ruff may be the only trick for defense?|pg||
nt|rv: from passed hand, I like to play 1M-3M as mixed raise and 1M-2@s/3m (jumps) as fit showing|pg||
nt|rv: Kachchu could have employed either of the 2 options|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphzwh: cud even be -3|pg||

nt|henryb:  maybe|pg||
nt|rv: please note East's direct 4@c splinter will be limited to 10-12, Sundarram has too much hence Jacoby and not splinter|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Henry|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: i cant read the explanations on paper... Sundar's side of the screen|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hi|pg||
nt|rv: splinters should be limited to narrow range since it takes away too much bidding space|pg||
nt|rv: Sundarram can afford 5 level, but he is not sure of how to move forward|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: 4 wasted HCPs in JMs hand|pg||
mb|5C|nt|rv: if he bids 5@d, JM may sign-off|pg||
nt|henryb:  Actually, one can play splinters two-way: either a seven loser hand, which will usually be 10-12, or a 5 loser hand, normally about 16-17. |pg||
nt|rv: in which case strong splinter will have to take another bid|pg||
nt|henryb:  The 5 loser hand can afford to bid again over partner's signoff|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: director called by Kachchu.. maybe bcoz 5@C was bid after a very long pause|pg||
nt|rv: this could be crucial deal in the final analyses|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: i am not sure of the reason though|pg||
nt|rv: Sundarram has made a great winning bid, now after 5@d by JM, they should get there|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: oh.. it seems bcoz Sundar didnt alert 3@C earlier.... and now has explained 3@C|pg||
nt|rv: possibly Sundarram wanted to hear @d cue from JM, hence 5@c|pg||
