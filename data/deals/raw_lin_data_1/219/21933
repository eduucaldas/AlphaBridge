nt|fluffy: Nakamura has to decide between 1NT and 3@c with normal methods first|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: humm, off shape 1NT|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: 3NT ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they can be the typical  preempt OR  an opening bid with no slam interest [typically 3-fit]|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@S=5+@S|pg||

nt|eamongall: how to change the score|pg||

nt|ahollan1: rumor mill [web page not updated yet]   thru 7 of 12 rounds    china W2 134, Bulg A stars 131, ontaka 130, china Geely auto NEDUK down under 129 , Hackett 126 Stmatov 123|pg||
nt|petergill: Because their other openings are mostly 9-13, NS regard 14+ as "strong"|pg||
nt|petergill: North feeling uncomfortable, as 3@D might be a 4-2 fit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL was takeout|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S invite|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: certainly he had better chance than in other room|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if this is not good enough they need to revise system, considering east also had 2nt for minors|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: 1NT will make 3NT a make because east won't lead a diamond|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: same as OR. and plsy ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems rich with minimum 1@C opener and weak suits|pg||
nt|petergill: Best for N to pass, as 3@S would be doubled by W|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Newell PASS just denies ability to game force|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: 3rd hand should open on good suit, i dare say. |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: so i may open 1@h.|pg||
nt|kemperg: why not 3@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  20  the ladies are in 2N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D implies desire to play in suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: here South has @C stop  and they tend not to lead @S after showing 4+|pg||
mb|p|nt|beauch:  looks like 2 down?|pg||
nt|cc469: I think if you bid 2@C you have to be prepared to bid your 4 card @S suit if the opportunity arises ( which it did here)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so invite for most likely game   with 2N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can't jump with south hand when playing standard because the 1@H opener could have up to  20 hcp|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: @D lead looks normal  but  will be wrong|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kemperg: but only invite?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|pole_as_ch: difficult contruct. to make and to defend|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: East can easily slow-in and end-played, nightmare|pg||
nt|xenya: one can sympathise with S. who wanted to show good cards in @C with the 2N bid -- still her hand is more suit=oriented|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: humm. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: for both of our pairs non 1@C openers have maximum of 15 hcp|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thru  21   Oz Players over Bulgarian All Stars by 5 imps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Stamatov is also a team of Bulgarians|pg||
pc|dK|nt|fluffy: the hand will make 11 tricks comfortable, but if you look in isolation the hand you would rather play 6@c than 3NT before the lead since clubs 2-2 mean 6@c makes and @c3-1 put 3NT ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: in danger|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kemperg: right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course easier to bid South hand when you have tools like Gazilli or Cole |pg||
nt|ahollan1: if I was North   i would have rebid 2@S instead of 2@D|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d3|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: c.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 8 or 9 trick.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: EW play GhN)estem  but that still uses  1M-(2N) as 2 lowest unbid|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: this bd now is 17imp swing. +10 or -7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and that is actually what Gold did|pg||
pc|d8|nt|beauch:  peter what would you overcall with east hand over a1@S opener|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes it does|pg||
pc|h9|pc|d9|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: @dQ steal and @c ruff will be 10 |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: he not yet knows bad break of trump|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c3|nt|pole_as_ch: if my method, @c is good. so 6@c would be in scope.|pg||
nt|fluffy: lead directing openings in third are fine but they are most useful when you open light on the 10-12 range, with 16 there is not as much lead directing need IMO|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: well.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: !Q ?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|petergill: Not sure - 4@C? 3@C? 2@C?  |pg||

nt|fluffy: 4@c I think it's a splinter bid, showing slam invitational values with club shortness|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh ? 1 off in OR !?|pg||
nt|fluffy: Furuta doesn't like to hold a "useless" @cAK|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: No not high, 5@d can make !|pg||
nt|petergill: 3 rounds of clubs shortens E to less trumps than S|pg||

mb|p|nt|fluffy: clubs 6-1 make 6@h unmakeable I think|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@C is plenty - 4@C would probably get doubled|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and should be better than min|pg||
nt|beauch:  here looks like 4@H a make - but 5/0split a worry|pg||
nt|cc469: W 2 spade bid I meant :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as you can tell from the jump   Verhees expected better texture in opener's @D suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: guessing   2@C=4@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Gazilli doesn't make sense in context of Big Club system|pg||
pc|h2|nt|pole_as_ch: 1@s maybe NT|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: but no choice!|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: that would be 1 off|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: bad tide for OZ-team.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh, 1 loser for @s ! sure it is|pg||

nt|petergill: Without the double, East would not play that way  |pg||
nt|petergill: but with dbl, he might|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|fluffy: if you bid blackwood you don't stop at the 5 level with 1 missing. Normally if 1 keycard is not enough then you should not use blackwood, but cuebid instead|pg||

nt|kemperg: this can be expensive|pg||
mb|p|nt|beauch:  double was very speculative- not much upside|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@SART, 0-4 HCP, maybe BAL 5 HCP|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: c |pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS do NOT play Namyats, so 4@H wide range|pg||
nt|petergill: The defence to beat 4@S is fairly easy to find|pg||
nt|petergill: but it seems normal for S to bid 5@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=10-15 hcp, 5+@H & 4+@D|pg||
nt|kemperg: ty|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 5C by S is best but 3N obviously maes as cards lie|pg||

mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: Verhees still has a chance|pg||
mb|d|nt|fabsayc: yes six was a total mystery in open room also|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so we're skeptical about overtricks on 22 & 24|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H = max of 15 HCP|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S wishing he had more room, is coming straight off a hand where lack of space kept his side out of 5m as only making games|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: Danailov might be playing Precision here|pg||
nt|petergill: The suitable vulnerability, position (dealer) and suit texture are the reasons for Martin Reid's expert 4@H opening|pg||
nt|petergill: which has vaulted the World Champions overboard|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=relay   game force or INV in @H|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3N = 55 with 1@S|pg||

nt|ahollan1: that is result of playing artificial 1N Overcalls  [Raptor]|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: 4@h can make for EW ???|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems contradictory to use @SK to have points to open then show singleton @S|pg||

pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: Gold opened the North hand|pg||
nt|kemperg: and more to come on this hand:(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS has found a @S fit - just a question of how high the bidding goes|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told both Bulgarian Pairs are playing Precision|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the threatening defense was a heart lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's consistent with what i found for 2009 Bermuda Bowl|pg||
nt|fabsayc: should put in the 10 for extra dummy entry|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: no, @d ruff i lost. sry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course   sometimes the opponents bid 6 over 5 :)|pg||
nt|petergill: I don't like 6@h much. The assumption that partner has very short spades can be faulty, as on the actual hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and the Kings are defensive, not offensive|pg||
nt|petergill: Also, the partner of a fav vul prempter has to take into account that the fav vul prempt might make bidding a lot later very risky|pg||
nt|petergill: @DQ lead would be good for NS|pg||
pc|dT|nt|eamongall: but now declarer can manage 11 tricks |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Dawei's hummar would strick the 7 ??|pg||
nt|petergill: Trump lead looks dangerous - opponents might have hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@H snatching defeat from the jaws of victory|pg||
nt|kemperg: who is to blame:(|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: Verhees could not overcall 1N   that would show  4@S and 5+@C/@D|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|petergill: E thus finds the best lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure what S showed with his auction. on surface one would suspect just a lot of shape (since no cue over 4C), which would mean 6C was a bit of a punt, but very likely there are ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: minimum expectations and possibly other 4-level calls over 4C would have some specialized meanings that dont fit the hand|pg||
pc|dK|pg||

mb|p|pc|hQ|pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: many think  the right way to play doesn't even include 3N as solid minor  [too often wrong-side 3N]|pg||
nt|twcho: as the card lies, it is easy to get 12 tricks|pg||
nt|twcho: especially after this lead|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: or  Rag   better with double entendre|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: ugg. same contruct!  and 1 off should be. another push ?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: in the other vugraph match   Bulgarian All Stars pickup the same slam swing as our Bulgarian team|pg||
nt|kemperg: NEDUK not goiing well:(|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: @sA, @s is ruff and quickly 1 off|pg||
nt|petergill: or 50 off 4@D undoubled|pg||
nt|ahollan1: pass of 2@C seems timid   but close|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think this is 5th  8-card suit of the event  but 1st time it wasn't @S|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: DBL usually something like any 5-7 hcp|pg||
nt|brgpro: this is what we like to see , a close match will be more exciting|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: wow|pg||

nt|fabsayc: anyone for :)|pg||

nt|petergill: tactics|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@C longer minor for the majors perhaps|pg||
pc|d8|nt|pole_as_ch: what is 3@D ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if Tueje was forced to rebid 1@S or if she could have bid 1N to show strong NT|pg||
nt|gizzydrop: 3|pg||
nt|gizzydrop: woops|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|eamongall: cokaholic knows this system .."2@D=3-fit, INV+ " |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: but cannot discard all @s, so anyway 1 off |pg||
pc|dT|pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: other room must have finished play :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But a view opposite a passed parner|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, I expected South to bid 4H or Dbl 4@D - perhaps he thought it would be unethical to do so after the long pause (obviously by N) on the other side of the screen?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Martin and I did not play|pg||
nt|cc469: overtake to return a trump|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i know this is great spot -- but i wonder these types of things|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d7|pg||

pc|c3|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: but what to do ?|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|cT|pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: 14 board matches, but we started with  17    so don't leave after  28|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thinking about whether to play @D before @H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: By the way, we already have "rag" among bridge slang. Unimportant card. "My spade holding was the king and four rags"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he has to play a diamond eventually, so this does not justify thinking very long|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but how many  UMJOODOs?    Rod tells where that name came from  but i'd like to thank whoever decided to popularize Reverse Flannery|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|petergill: Peter Newell being a very ethical player, like most New Zealanders|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer did well to take the @S finesse at that point|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: especially dislike showing both majors in this partnership where  9-13 unbalanced open the bidding with "transfer" to show 4+ major|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so an imp for the major|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: now heat and heat of this match !!|pg||
pc|d6|pc|c5|pc|sJ|nt|fabsayc: apologies, i am told south is a she :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: concern was  West  22 in reds, so without cash before @H  west can pitch @D |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Now dummy is very good. enough to make contruct.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|xenya: seems any other play woiuld have led to -1|pg||

nt|marlowepi: defensive tricks and the hearts are woeful, so there is certainly a case for pass. at MPs it would be clear to do so|pg||
nt|kemperg: On 9 also in 6@C|pg||

nt|marlowepi: side fairly small. meanwhile they might not make game for a variety of reasons.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|pole_as_ch: No game for NS|pg||
nt|petergill: these two teams were =4th, though obviously that is no longer the case|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the closed room, Gold showed 25+ balanced with his 2NT rebid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this bidding should help them get to slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: why?   3N - all pass very possible|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW have done great job taking away bidding space|pg||
nt|petergill: EW have pinpointed likely short spades in South, from North's point of view|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=INV, 6+@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  INV+|pg||
nt|brgpro: once W opens 1@d (11-15) i don't think they will be in grand |pg||

nt|ahollan1: on 24  [5@D-2]  Gold sold out to 4@H North|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: what side gain + score ?|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@C by South, and I think North, either slowly or quickly, will go all the way to 6@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lucky not to get 4@DI would say|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=good 11-14|pg||
nt|xenya: i might pass as S -- but Tueje has no fear|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'd expect pretty much this distribution of hcp  so PASS figures to lose a couple of imps|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk4: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=4518  Tom Hanlon, also a world class poker player|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=4519  Hugh McGann|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahhh  a picture of Hanlon|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@S is about as ugly a bid as imaginable, i treat 2@C as a cue bid on that auction|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: it looks like push.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh buyed 3@D, and....|pg||
nt|petergill: cf Bd 19 where at fav vul sometimes they break 4-4|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Great point by Martin, assuming EW spades 5-4 not 4-4|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: Lead of @s2 is showing 3 card, maybe. |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Ito should call this, he surely|pg||
nt|brgpro: E will pull this|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i wager 2@H would get some votes in Master Solvers' Club|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: board upside-down|pg||
nt|gizzydrop: this looks like final contract, nowhere for north to go and some defence to 4@S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: these are very instructive hands for us, because all these ill-starred decisions could easily be triumphs on a different day|pg||
nt|gizzydrop: looks like a trump lead would have been best|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so failure of NS to DBL 5@D more costly than feared|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk2: He'll raise|pg||
nt|petergill: I expect and hope for 6@C now|pg||
nt|kemperg: not the first 26  pts hand in this tournament:|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Reid's problem is that Newell could be 1444 with no @CQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but does that hand rebid 5@C over 4@S?|pg||
nt|petergill: It's not so obvious to NS that the match has turned out badly so far - e.g. their 2@H making five (Bd 23?) might be a pickup from their point of view|pg||
nt|fabsayc: even then he has diamond hook, also 7 not impossible|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pole_as_ch: UG. ducking ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N should be delighted to pass. not simply endplayed into it|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: 2@H by South|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlucky choice of leads|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|cc469: a dearth of entries to dummy|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ahollan1: so  my guess of 3N-all pass was just a little off|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe that hand would bid 4NT, Al, choice of games|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very well done Martin Reid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right  so Newell 5@C does sound like 5+ suit|pg||
nt|petergill: also well done to Sartaj Hans not to bid 2@S at other table which might lead NS to 6@C|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks to everyone in Yokohama in Japan for today's broadcast. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: tomorrow  final 4 rounds of 14-board matches in the Qualifying Swiss.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: top 8 teams advance to Knockout|pg||
pc|d9|nt|pole_as_ch: humm.  can make by @s finess.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|pole_as_ch: sry bd 24 & 25|pg||
nt|brgpro: that is a good call...4NT...he will get 2 KC answer...what would the KC be?|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|h9|nt|marlowepi: trump lead comes best from S hand, i think|pg||
pc|hT|nt|brgpro: what about 5@c on 3NT Al?|pg||
nt|brgpro: after he has shown 6+@s and preference for @d, that must be exclusion for @d|pg||
nt|ahollan1: have to confess   this is first time i've seen the auction where 2@H bidder had game force hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so i'm not sure about the rest of the bids|pg||
nt|brgpro: he will get the right answer but, then if pd has 2+@h and no @h control, he will also be in trouble|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but  Exclusion Keycard  .... very dangerous when partner has shown the suit|pg||
nt|brgpro: so 4@d was OK as long as he gets a @h cue and , he wasn't looking for a perfection 7 anyway, after all, his pd opened a limited 1@d|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: don't run away our last board is  30   [started with  17]|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N will be ready to play a heart honor when declarer leads one from dummy to his king or queen|pg||

pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: now @C hook?|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW 1N opening is 14-16  so  McGann rebid shows 17+|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|pole_as_ch: bd 26 is 3NT by E !|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: and another 6 imp.  29imp is 22-8 vp.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: because 2@H is passable|pg||
mb|3S|nt|petergill: Unlucky hand for weak 1NT, this one|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think it was david gold that said weak no trump is a losing proposition at the top level|pg||
nt|ahollan1: common to play DBL of Weak NT - Stayman as Cards [rather than @C]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but is that also done over transfer?    i confess i don't know|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this should be interesting to watch. N might get home |pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: Hanlon is normally extremely strong as a declarer but 4-1 breaks kill most of us |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: good auction to best contruct!|pg||
nt|kemperg: DD or real?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Ok start for defense, good choice despite pass by W over 2H. still, statistically unlikely W would double that across the full range of hands where hearts is the best attack|pg||
nt|kemperg: opps are placed in every trick|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, W spade tricks may never get in to the game|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: just wait a minute...players taking a short rest|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and N may be endplayed by the entry situation into picking up Ds|pg||
nt|marlowepi: though the heart lead will give him an entry there, so he will probably return a heart and then take the diamond finesse into E|pg||
nt|marlowepi: then he will have 8 tricks set up and will just need to guess clubs|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|eamongall: anyway tightens up the match |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes Lui played very nicely OR|pg||
nt|brgpro: i play it myself as 8(good 7) to 12|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i should qualify   i think that is their treatment|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: comes Chen's Ocaltic call.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Dec can catch 8 tricks easily, but 9th ?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|pole_as_ch: why so jumping ???|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Maybe, East Opening is not 2@c, so 6 was enough, Ch3n was thought.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: *Chen|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Now Furuta safely settled 6, or not ????|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: this is 17 imp if he make this|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: and new leader !! or not ??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't think it will convince them to change the system|pg||
nt|petergill: 12 X 14 board matches, this is Round 8 of ther Swiss|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and endplay|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: great auction from EW|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but for sure you should keep track|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or convince Fantunes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or Hans-Nunn|pg||
nt|petergill: this will be quite a big swing, with NS vul and tough discards to be made|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well fantunes weak no trump is not normal, can be any 5422|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and 6322 and 4441|pg||
nt|petergill: Scores after 7 rounds at http://www.jcbl.or.jp/home/English/nec/17th/results/tabid/659/Default.aspx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a couple of the Japanese Seniors also weak notrumpers|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not any 5422, Martin, not 5-4 in the majors|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Nice auction, McGann making up for his rather tame 1@S (4@S and 5@D)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: normal contract but probably declared by East most of the time|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|eamongall: He sure did ..well done H Liu |pg||
nt|brgpro: i'd like to save all my pre-e|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry i didnt say that well. he will have 7 tricks set up and 8 with a club guess, which he will get right because he needs the late endplay|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 10 ticks is sure.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: *tricks|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: plus 2 tricks come from dummy reversal ??|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: He knows bad break of trump.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 17imp has it reality.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 2 bd include this only remains|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: @d7 shows @dA ?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Defence also have not tricks|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: so the move of Dec and North deside the fate.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|brgpro: will go -2 here as well, 9 away|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jack, over the nebulous bids  do you differentiate  55 and 54 hands?|pg||
nt|brgpro: michaels has to be 55?|pg||
nt|kemperg: Best choice by E|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s3|nt|petergill: North hoping @SQ is doubleton |pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: why did i think this was final board??    we still have  30 to play|pg||
pc|s6|nt|pole_as_ch: 9th will be a little fade.|pg||
nt|petergill: will be disappointed|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the dutch card play and defense is very precise, no tricks given away carelessly|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N did well there, W could not afford to overtakeand meanwhile E was endplayed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N is going to make|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: do you think he was worth 2@S over 1@H?    is there a default about the difference between 1@S and 2@S there???|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@H=4+@S & 5+@H, not 55/544|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|ahollan1: right  that's why i asked if there's a default   [if so  i don't know which applies]|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but in this case 4 spades almost guaranteed by double so less need to distinguish length|pg||
nt|eamongall: Yeh .. how come my E and A keep getting mixed up |pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: 4@s can make ??|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 3@d = 4 supp & limit raise |pg||
nt|petergill: Before this match, Downunder had 7 VP gap to 9th so they will possibly drop out of the top 8 overnight|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: more difficult than looking dummy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S another forcing noise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D exact shape|pg||
nt|petergill: Relays are not as important on game hands like this one, but are very good for slam hands|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is there as size ask available now al?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks for the explanation of 3N :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: on 29 ladies in 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: you're welcome|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: Next round will be 90 minites later |pg||
nt|ahollan1: no idea what is happening in the 2 matches that are not on vugraph :(    both were close at the half|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|kiwibridge: his team mates did him proud OR|pg||
nt|xenya: this is makeable double-dummy, but hardly with the cards concealed|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: I think he will go one down |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: @dQ shows seq under that.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 2 @h, 1 @s and can make|pg||
nt|xenya: you need to play for @DK doubleton|pg||
nt|ahollan1: north could have used 2@S or 2N to ask -- this route says  doesn't have hand that absolutely wants to declare NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H = exactly 4531|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: i think 3@H asks controls  [A=2 K=1]|pg||
nt|petergill: Both 4@S and 3NT are safe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and 3N = 4  [1@S promised at least 3]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Newell knows an Ace  or 2 kings missing    does that help him bid over 3N?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: Come ! and be fun about new team, new heat !|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not what north wanted to hee|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hear|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: Tajima would be lead after this BD, but how |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 6!  Chen !???|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: if he behave @d no loser, this can make !! |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: The call of 3@c is very good hint for Dec. so Chen might ....|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: -10 or -11 imp is not hevy lost for Tajima, but Chen should make this for his stand !!|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: but dummy entry remains ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  29  4@S+1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so pickup for Weak NT|pg||
nt|xenya: right|pg||
nt|kemperg: 11-19 now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at least they've protected the @DK|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Walddk4: flat board, 11 IMPs = 18-12 VPs, but we are not quite sure that it's scored correctly throughout|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's current Victory Point result|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kiwibridge: and so a modest victory to the Hackett team|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hint:  if you ever play against long relay like this   the 1st question you should ask is    WHO'S LEAD|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: scores from other matches show up under  http://www.jcbl.or.jp/home/English/nec/17th/results/7thFeb/tabid/665/Default.aspx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: must choose results, NEC and then "details"|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: 4@D forces 4@H to signoff   [EndSignal]|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he needs heart queen for slam (ie 12 points)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: and AKK rather than AA|pg||
pc|hA|nt|petergill: so S knew N had either Axxx, xxxx, xx, Axxx or Kxxx, xxxx, Kx, Axx or AKxx, xxxx, Kx, xxx with Q's and J's unknown|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: and 26imp will be 21-9 vp for Senior Champion !!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes, i think you need to separate those cases|pg||
nt|xenya: still makeable|pg||
nt|xenya: cash the hearts, @DA and small @D|pg||
pc|hK|pc|c7|pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: @h2 ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bulgaria v oz very close   so i think Bulgaria [3rd] and the 2 teams tied for 1st are lock with Neduk to get into KO|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d7|pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pg||
