nt|pole_as_ch: but 6 is there, can they reach ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: after round 8 they were leading the Swiss Qualifying|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|pole_as_ch: auuu, pennarized !|pg||
pc|h8|nt|petergill: -2, -3 and -1 all look possible|pg||
nt|petergill: Hard for declarer to place East with the @D honours on this bidding|pg||
nt|petergill: 2NT was both minors|pg||
nt|petergill: The names shown on BBO are remnants from Round 11|pg||
nt|sybarra: think I might rather be in 2 nt here |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: operater, Right names, Pls !!|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Operater, should show Players sir Name clearly, i think|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: esp for Japanese, home team are here !|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: very honorable|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: on the non @D lead this may make 12|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: @HJ ???|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the aussies have doubled in the OR alas|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: y |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 5 imps would add up|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mrdct: based on what's entered for the open room - we have Thompson-Jacobs EW here|pg||
pc|dT|nt|eamongall: however I am sure it will get fixed when operator gets a break in the play :) ...its very hard to be a vugraph operator |pg||

pc|cJ|pc|c4|nt|mrdct: Thompson-Jacobs use methods based on the Fantunes system|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mrdct: yes - it looks like the vugraph weren't given the hand data files until right on starting time|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|andyv:  all's well despite the bad @h break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tournament page  http://www.jcbl.or.jp/home/////tabid/657/Default.aspx    includes links to much useful info including Daily Bulletins that include Team Rosters and Conditions of ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Contest|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|pc|d5|nt|pole_as_ch: oh ? can make ??|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we won't have Voice Commentary until the Knockout Phase|pg||
nt|petergill: Ace and a small club might have worked better, with partner having such good @d's and West having poor @D pips|pg||
pc|d6|nt|eamongall: Usually there is one person who goes around the vugraph tables and loads the hands each match ...I have done it ... its a busy time |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|kiwibridge: who loads the names :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other tables are visible without login via http://bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mrdct: trumps looks best here|pg||
nt|petergill: If declarer picks @DQ with E, then -1 is possible|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|cc469: good evening? all - I'm Carl Chadwick from Canada|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|nt|pole_as_ch: Operater !!!  Players name!  Right players name !!!  pls !!!|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: cl !|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
mc|11|nt|andyv:  a @s lead would probably have been better as E wouldn't be able to pull all the trump before he knocked out the A of @c|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Do we have Jacobs - Thompson   N-S   Dave?|pg||
nt|eamongall: Every event has new operators and after a few rounds they become experienced and learn stuff |pg||
nt|mrdct: but as it happens a low trump was going to work better as east is forced to rise Q and then doesn't have the tempo to take his trick|pg||

mb|d|mb|2D|an|no major, no 2 !c stoppers|nt|petergill: 2@c Stayman|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3D|nt|petergill: Down Under - this pair from Sydney Australia and Newell- Reid from NZ have a lead of about 30 imps in part due to a 50/50 slam by Japan failing in the first half|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: It's hard to tell if 3@D makes or goes down|pg||

nt|andyv:  that's where they were saturday:)|pg||
nt|mrdct: pages 3&4 for bill & ben|pg||
nt|mrdct: so in the EW methods all one-level openings are frocing for one round|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed,    N-S are    Stamatov - Karianov|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They play Precision|pg||
nt|mrdct: so about 14+hcp|pg||
nt|sybarra: how did we not make 6 @C?|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh I see,  the @D ruff :( unlucky |pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if Yeh partnerships are playing standard or some Precision pairs|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: good start for FT|pg||
nt|sybarra: well not if I had a pard who played it this way,....down in the other room |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: and 1 imp to oz|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: oz/nz |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: ok|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so there's a free 5 for ONI|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: all Bulgarian top pairs do|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: funny, why 5?  6 !|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|pole_as_ch: what contract do u think ?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the lower the better|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: and NS   akama-maruyama  [not sure who's where]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=game force   a bunch of hand types  in this case  balanced  [no singleton or void]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my dream is that someday  BBO will work on software for operator and there will be functionality to just INSERT PASS  instead of having to do all of those UNDOs|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: EW in OR is team leader of FT.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: They use Blue club oriented system.|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry, 500 was only possible if West ducked @CK (he played ace) - even then it might be 300|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: fufufufu|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: comes some noise|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: some randon 2 suiter?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 14+|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: ONI means demon in Japan|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the devils :)|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: and reverse nimonic of INO|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not sure what the delay is here|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|mrdct: 2@s is 10-13 5+ @s|pg||
nt|mrdct: so east is clear a big max for his bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not 1@C from east|pg||
nt|ahollan1: P-1@C-P-  then  1@H=4+@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ew do NOT play Namyats, so 4@S is wide range|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: specific lol|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mrdct: *clearly|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: NS of this room i know each of them, but pd-ship i don't know|pg||
nt|cc469: 12 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ hcp  [14+ in 1st/2nd]|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: not so random|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: could be in trouble|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: simple negative|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: looks good,  9 or less ?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thats a devilish 1H by Niekawa|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: 1@S RELAY  |pg||
nt|mrdct: btw - i'm going to predict bill jacobs is sitting east as ben thompson is a bit more agressive and would probably open 1@s with the east cards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, Bill is always E and N I noticed|pg||
nt|mrdct: believe it or not i've never noticed that|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Normal ? 2/1, i guess|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mrdct: i think the 1st two matches are up|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: well passed Martin|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: hewww|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 2@c ?  or X ?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh @c|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Yamada with 16 may have been surpised to hear pard bid after a strong @C on his right|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|sybarra: 1 sp means 1 nt |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 1@s is No Majs, maybe.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: NS in this room are wife(N) & hus(S)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: operator won't be able to lead   so then auction should get fixed|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C balanced  8-11 or 15+ hcp|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/home////tabid/223/Default.aspx  for tournament website. No results yet I'm afraid. They only update the page once a day if memory serves|pg||
nt|mrdct: poor result for Oz in the open room|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: sry, i have no detail about Chaina Geely Auto members|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=ART, a) 9-12 HCP, 2+ controls, BAL [include 5@C/@D(332)  b) 6-9 HCP, 1-suit 5+@H [bad suit else opening bid]|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mrdct: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/home/English/nec/17th/results/7thFeb/tabid/665/Default.aspx|pg||
nt|Walddk2: thx|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: just shape, he knows|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sybarra: or a transfer bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N relay    2@C = a) (332)5@C/@D  b) 3334@H/@S  c) (32)44 same color|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 5 quick trick|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: @d switch will get down easily, humm|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N broke out of relay so East guaranteed declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vP's 1@S [RHO's suit]  showing the 2 unbid suits|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D asks   and now Reid will show exact shape|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no ambition other than finding the correct game|pg||
pc|h7|nt|pole_as_ch: They (NS) prefer schenken|pg||
nt|sybarra: hopefully we will get the names of players sorted out shortly |pg||
pc|h8|nt|eamongall: yes first two rounds are up ... and 3rd round was only finished ... |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: if someone teach me |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: S in 2@C OR|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: 3@D = 4/5@D  not 4@H/@S|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Andy was referring to the Dutch Premiere League final that was on BBO last weekend|pg||
nt|andyv:  declarer starts with 8 tricks and has 2 4-3 suits to find the 9th, or the @d suit.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no carryover from Swiss Qualifying   only 2 of the Quarter-Final matchups did battle in the Swiss   ours is not one of them|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: y|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: good result oz in OR|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mrdct: the problem in the open rooms is with only one @s stopper you need cashing tricks on top which just weren't there|pg||
nt|sybarra: 9, or 10 tricks |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: EW team won by 1 imp after trailing by a bunch after 4 round|pg||
nt|sybarra: or 11 |pg||
pc|d8|nt|andyv:  yes, they certainly made a quick turnaround to get to this tourney|pg||
nt|kemperg: leader may play for 3@D at siide of 3!@Hs, that wont work|pg||
nt|kemperg: down now, cant finesse twice anymore|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it's not unreasonable to play 1@S as natural even though RHO has shown 4+  since 1N by passed hand is available to show the 2 unbid|pg||
nt|vugraphzws: Sorry for wrong bits.|pg||
nt|sybarra: tese are left over from last match |pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 17  5@DX East|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: only 200 this may be worse|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 1 trick more for defence, where ?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: i cannot find|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh, 2 more !|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mrdct: needs to make this to hold the damage to 5 imps - otherwise it's 8 imps out|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm pretty sure  W=Verhees  E=vProoijen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room also in 3N   this hand will be more successful than  1|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: they did that last year too|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: looks like push ?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: Operator, please insert names        North:  Stamatov     South: Danailov       East: Jacobs      West: Thompson|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: and went on to win the NEC Cup|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mrdct: in fact when i last played against them i was south and screenmates with bill, but that may have been because ben didn't want to be screenmates with me|pg||

nt|petergill: Down Under is a term used to describe Australia and New Zealand|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|an|forcing|mb|2D|mb|2S|nt|petergill: South hand is a bit too good for a weak two at this vulnerability - aces and kings being good cards|pg||
mb|2N|nt|petergill: 4@H is likely to fail by a trick, if anyone bids H's|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: 3@C warns EW off NT's, which fails on a club lead or switch (after spade lead to ace)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|petergill: Dbl now by Tony would be take-out I think, but he decided to pass 3@C|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|sT|pg||
nt|petergill: West might have bid 3@D on the grounds that Sartaj usually has 6+ decent @d's for 2@D at this vulnerability|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sJ|pc|s3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|petergill: Sartaj ducked, because North appears to be trying to get to hand to lead a @d towards the king|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|d3|pc|s4|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|s6|pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer now has to pick clubs to make 3@C|pg||
nt|petergill: I think Declarer can count the @H's as 5-4 on the bidding, and @d as 2-6, and @s known, thus North knows West has 2 clubs left and East has 1 club left|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: not sure if lebensohl situation or 2N=2-places to play   either way  3@C is constructive|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: @cA|pg||
nt|sybarra: not the bid E wanted to hear |pg||
nt|ahollan1: East could have used Raptor 1N overcall to show 4@H/@S & 5+@C  but unfavorable vul and passed partner   =  yuk|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: and @c lead|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: or @s lead, and @c switch ?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: i know in Ron Klinger's version of transfers over 1@C   his 1@S=4+@D and has 4-card major ONLY IF game force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but not all pairs use 1@S to guarantee @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  this was 3rd seat opener   so  16+|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh, yes, "Color"|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: done !  good lead by newell|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes good night contract I knew you not|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 2 off maybe ?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|pole_as_ch: England ladiesgain big lead in first 2 BD. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: in other room  Precision 1@C - Sartaj Hans did NOT bid with East   so  1@D[neg]-1N end|pg||
nt|sybarra: 1 shouod be no problem |pg||
nt|sybarra: *1nt should not be a problem |pg||
nt|ahollan1: transportation a problem|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and nothing favorable in @S or @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so 7th trick may need help from defenders|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i bet  EW get 7 before NS|pg||
nt|sybarra: will be a mad scramble |pg||
nt|ahollan1: voice commentary talking about  run of @H maybe squeezing West in minors|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Peter takes the advance sac|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: same contract !|pg||
pc|c9|nt|Walddk2: 1@C  14+ with clubs or 15+ balanced|pg||
nt|mrdct: fairly standard these days to play transfers after one-level intervention|pg||
nt|sybarra: not best lead for defense maybe |pg||
nt|sybarra: but I make these leads all the time :( |pg||
nt|sybarra: this is very prestigious event  sponsored by NEC |pg||
nt|petergill: West is M ILIEV|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: y say, good gambling ?|pg||
nt|ahollan2:  Newell's DBL=Game Force Relay (1NT=Min 1 suiter or 5332 or 3-suiter, 2C = Spades)|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: hi Al|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: X was FG !!|pg||
nt|ahollan2:  1@D = 9-13 hcp, unbal, 4+@H   if Gary didn't already mention that|pg||
nt|ahollan2:  i'm doing commentary in other match  so only glancing here occasionally|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hey Al yes I got that far :)|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: thx Al|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'm sure you'd love to be here full time loving systems as you do|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: in OR, only N(=Ino) mentioned |pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|nt|mrdct: playing preciion in the open room EW never found their @h fit|pg||
nt|mrdct: losing 2@h and a @d here at least|pg||
nt|mrdct: and there's nowhere to put the deep @c loser|pg||
nt|mrdct: so i think this is going to slide one off|pg||
nt|sybarra: no reason to hop yet|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 1@d = 1s + another, some spec tell me.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sybarra: we are in the qualifying rounds  leading to semi's then finals over the weekend |pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room at least sniffed at slam, but vanProoijen 3@S left much less room for exploration|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all matches are 14 boards, but the venue always plays  1-14  and  17-30|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: but then, N's 2@d ???|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|cQ|pg||

pc|cT|pc|h4|nt|pole_as_ch: good switch !|pg||
pc|c5|nt|pole_as_ch: this will be 1 off. but, in OR, also the same contruct.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|sybarra: it is invitational event |pg||
pc|c8|nt|pole_as_ch: but no entry for south.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mrdct: only hope now is south pitching a @c|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: looks 1 up|pg||
pc|s7|pc|h5|pg||
nt|sybarra2: wlcm back Al |pg||
nt|andyv:  that board a possible pick up for EW in OR|pg||
nt|petergill: Other table: South for Bulgaria won 8 imps on Bd 17 by not bidding 2NT on his poor hand - EW then played for 3-2 trump break and went down in 4@S which is much easier to make if ...|pg||
nt|petergill: South bids|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s2|nt|mrdct: even that wont help|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|petergill: Weak 1NT only in 1st and 2nd seats, not in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|petergill: 2NT = red suits, at least 5-5|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|d|nt|petergill: Will south bid more over 3@D? I thought he will, but was not sure, after the minus 800 last set when he pushed|pg||
nt|petergill: Surely Ino has to bid 3NT - will it get doubled?|pg||
nt|petergill: or is he thinking of bidding 4@D to try to dodge any dbl?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: No Dbl|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: West cannot dbl, as 3rd seat opening might be light|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|nt|petergill: that lead brings the NS trick tally to 8|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry, still NS have onyl 7 tricks|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|petergill: or 6 tricks due to lack of entry to dummy maybe|pg||

nt|ahollan1: take that 90 and run|pg||

nt|ahollan1: another forcing 1@C  |pg||

nt|ahollan1: does East show minors immediately?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: if 1@s then they go too high, maybe|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: oh, 3 off !|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: 5 imps they took all they could unlike the other table|pg||

nt|cc469: a frisky 2@S bid got the result it deserved|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i have no idea :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i have some old Convention Cards for Zejun -- but not with this partner|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D accomplishes nothing    South gets to describe his non-game force strength  and  NS have all the room for Relays|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Other table: I have to admit that I prefer 4@S on Bd 19 to 3@S and think Australia fully deserved their 6 imps|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Dec is E, different from OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 4@D implies  "i know what to do when they bid 4@H/@S"|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N was bid and made in OR on  3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I wouldn't know that, so i vote for 5@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or both majors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in 4 boards we've already seen  an 8-card suit   and now 75 hand   were these shuffled??|pg||
nt|petergill: on Bd 18 I mean, not 19|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but  North not good enough to use Game Force Realy|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: passive lead !?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|andyv:  5@d makes|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  19  East playing 2@CX|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H natural, non-force   [1@H would be Relay]|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: immediately   let EW make the last guess|pg||
nt|andyv:  so, not so sure EW action was the best for them|pg||
nt|andyv:  actually, maybe not...hard to get rid of the 2nd @c loser|pg||
nt|ahollan1: doesn't this lose @S and 2@C ?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|pole_as_ch: Y, N's 2@h is very natural.|pg||
nt|petergill: @HQ = unblock jack if you have it|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: East's @C spots prevail |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Texas Transfer|pg||
nt|cc469: I'm told NS are from women China team 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i wonder why Shin didn't open?   if 2@S promises a 2nd suit, then assume 2@D multi|pg||
nt|ahollan1: China Geely Auto roster is   Gui Shengyue, Zhang Banxiang, Yang Lixin, Dai Jianming, Zhuang Zejun|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the big club auction in the other room didn't get any closer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but not a great slam for people who guess queens like me|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: East might try @d. but 3, so she choiced pass.|pg||
nt|mrdct: although if north leads 4th best of longest and strongest after 1NT:3NT it has 9 tricks then|pg||
nt|vugraphzws: thanks >Walddk2|pg||
pc|c5|nt|pole_as_ch: oh!|pg||
nt|petergill: Martin Reid has taken a better route over 1@C at the other table|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: howw ???|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they avoided that dreaded result|pg||
nt|petergill: Rather than give onself a bidding problem by bidding 2NT, Martin overcalled 1@H, allowing the NS bidding to evolve without complication|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: WHO would bid 2NT anyway|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: imagine West then East  after   3@D-DBL-5@D-?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nick point out  @H spots for declarer!!|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Well, if you take the 'save' over 6@C a lot can go wrong|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3@d looks like a splinter which is usually il-advised with a stiff ace|pg||
nt|mrdct: but it might mean something else|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would Shih also open 1N if distribution was 4225|pg||
nt|twcho: whoever south is, they are not regular partner|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: oh ? another is @c he wann show ?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: *wanna|pg||
mb|4S|nt|petergill: I think 2@S was forcing with less than 5 spades, and that with 5+ spades Sth would respond 2NT, but I do not guarantee that|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  the 2@h bid may have caused EW to underestimate their values|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 1@s open because of Scenken system.|pg||
nt|mrdct: so west's actions have talked NS out of 3NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @C probably said @H's and S taking a chance on 3 nt |pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 19  2@CX was +580  and 13 imps to China Geely Auto|pg||
nt|mrdct: but i could be mistaken|pg||
nt|ahollan2:  2@H=@S, 8-14 HCP, usually BAL  a) 3@S  b) 4@S, min|pg||
nt|ahollan2:  2N = max, 5+@S, forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: 3@h is safe ! or some snag ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other table  5@H South|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: and put south on the spot to perhaps bid a failing slam|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think S is looking for tricks here |pg||
nt|ahollan1: probably not a hand with slam interest - that would start with 2@C [stayman OR game force relay]|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: luck he had 9 tops here|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: 1 off or good/bad ??|pg||

nt|petergill: 2@S probably would have made, so chalk that little gain up to the marginal 2@C overcall|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C strong|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the Newell-Reid machine rolls on, taking all in it's wake|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: should try one more ??|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S!|nt|pole_as_ch: oh, open! so they go to 4@s !|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: cu frank |pg||
nt|sybarra: thx for helping |pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D GF ... artificial = @H?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice hand partner!|pg||
nt|mrdct: and too expensive - 1100 probably|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: well 3 off is not payed|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: narrow slam !   6@c !!|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|ahollan1: 2@C Precision  most Chinese pairs play 6+@C OR 5@C & 4@H/@S|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 1@s ??|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: oh? 4 off !|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|petergill: 4@H = signoff, minimum |pg||
mb|3N|nt|mrdct: 6@d tricks is a good start for 3NT NS but EW can get to their 5 before NS establish their tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after 9    NEDUK leading with 173   China Geely 2nd with 170|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: @d4|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: does 1N deny 4@S?     probably  otherwise North would probably use some form of checkback|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: no, North !  sry|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2-way checkback  or  new minor force?    probably 2-way  so  2@D = artificial game force|pg||
nt|twcho: yes, rather standard precision which is suitable for irregular partnership|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: but died !  y, it is normal, but...|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: may now get pushed too high?    can they even beat 4 @S?|pg||
nt|sybarra: my pards rarely have hands like that one when I open 4  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: from old card  Zejun @C7  =  odd/even  where odd=like this suit|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: same contract|pg||
nt|mrdct: heading for a normal push|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: i dont know this seq|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: checkback was used in other room so Patrick Huang avoided @S lead -- but his choice of @HK wasn't a success either|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in North America the top big club pairs are playing 2@C always 6+@C|pg||
nt|twcho: and NS aren't regular partners|pg||
nt|ahollan1: mine would have 13 cards   but there the similarity would end|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: c |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 2@S shows minor ? or maybe @c directly|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: then again  playing 2-way checkback  South might bid @C|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: well cannot make. but 2 off ?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sybarra: can N get in to lead club? |pg||
nt|sybarra: just take 4 aces   easier |pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|petergill: Best % play of @h suit in 6@H is ace - picks up bare king in either hand|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: another possible squeeze -- but this one doesn't work|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mrdct: losing 2@c, 1@h and 1@s so need to get @d right to make|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 2NT ?? negative ?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mrdct: predicated on a @c switch by west now which may not be so easy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlikely @D plays|pg||
nt|xenya: this should make despite the4-1 trump split -- but some care is needed|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: this will switch @c|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sybarra: our pards have taken similar lessons it seems |pg||
pc|cA|nt|xenya: still can't make it on a @S return|pg||
nt|mrdct: wd bro|pg||
nt|ahollan1: either @DJ still in dummy or @DQ still in hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same opening in other room|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh @h|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|petergill: but in 4@H, have to consider if safety play of low to @H queen (picks up KJx in either hand) - is safe or unsafe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's why they are called  CHO    cross-hand opponent|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 3@d may short, or just cue ?|pg||
pc|cK|pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: that's better   thanks|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: DBL by East infulenced Dec's play maybe !|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5 of the wins for Geely Auto have been maximum of 25 VPs     wow|pg||
nt|cc469: a fine result|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought he'd play @D before the @H finesse, but really that was his only chance|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: this seg's last bd is  32|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: heww !|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: hummm|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: wellearned imp|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=10-15 HCP    a) 6+@C 1-suiter   b) 4+@C and 5+@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: lots of @H's between e/w |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: so 9 bd remains|pg||
nt|mrdct: probably a @h partscore for NS here|pg||
nt|mrdct: i assume EW play precision|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: wd play by K.Yamada.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 5@d is good scr !|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: but have so many defensive tricks, so tend to defence ?? |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: what is Newells gadget for this shape|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|sybarra: 2 @D looks like multi again|pg||
nt|petergill: in 6@H - running @HQ picks up only one case - bare jack in North - so if an expert does such play against you successfully, you should hold your cards further back|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: looks like|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=9-13 hcp, unbal, 4+@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: transfer opening  remember specs |pg||
nt|ahollan1: and as you see -- can have canape  longer @C/@D|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh !|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: up values to 14+|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D=relay  but doesn't promise any points|pg||
nt|sybarra: E will never believe suit is hts |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15, 0+@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=@S, 8-14 HCP, usually BAL  a) 3@S  b) 4@S, min|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  again because of canape style, W restricted in his choice of openings|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @C as to transfer into suit (I think) |pg||
nt|vugraphzws: Sorry for mistake.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in 3rd seat, they'll open some balanced hands that don't get opened in 1st/2nd|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice trump split    5-4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i predict   3@C = non-force  LONGER @C|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: P or 4@c ?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 5 either minor pitches on the other|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: one downside of the (strong) @C no suits shown'|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: y|pg||
mb|4H|nt|pole_as_ch: limitted place ??|pg||
nt|mrdct: good that NS stayed out of game with 4 losers on top|pg||
nt|mrdct: now north needs to play trumps for zero losers|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@S=5+@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: dutch playing a canape style, hence this unusual combination|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: hum, 6@c ?|pg||
nt|mrdct: Oz Players here are 2/3 of the runners-up in Australia National Open Teams from a couple of weeks ago|pg||
nt|sybarra: I suspect 5 @h is pass or correct... or the lack of @D was what W was going to bid |pg||
nt|sybarra: just not sure how they play this |pg||
nt|sybarra2: how to find out you have no wasted values in @H's |pg||
nt|mrdct: reasonable 3rd seat opening by north|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: need 2 entries|pg||
nt|mrdct: he has entries in @d and @s|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: y|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: should move blutally ? did !|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: EW in OR already go to there ! heww!|pg||
nt|sybarra: and just need to take aces again |pg||
nt|mrdct: but content to resign when p bids his singleton|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh !|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this only -1|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: y|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2N relay for distribution|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N=5@S 5@C 1@H|pg||
nt|mrdct: close to mirrored shapes here for NS which is often dangerous, but there's no ruff on for the defence so @SA and @DAK only to lose|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 3rd @c also ?|pg||
nt|mrdct: opportunity for jacobs now as 3@h failed in teh closed room|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 1 off in OR !?|pg||
nt|mrdct: however, i suspect he'll only finese against the @HK and go one down also but we'll see|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: West opend ! easily place @hK for him, but how many trumps ?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: now West will move ?  maybe NO !|pg||
pc|dK|nt|fabsayc: now east hunting for slam, and may well bid it|pg||
nt|xenya: if they get to slam, they will make it|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Newell walks on water today|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: sigh !|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sybarra2: (and the k of clubs on side) |pg||
pc|d8|nt|mrdct: beyond the 1@c strong club opening - i have no idea what the rest menas|pg||
nt|ahollan1: especially if you have my short neck|pg||
nt|ahollan1: finding @H -- what fun is that?|pg||
nt|twcho: last bd, north misdefend by continuing his @d and squeezed south on the way|pg||
nt|xenya: and E miight be tempted|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think of any good reason why you woudl play west for @hK10x|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@D forces 4@H   |pg||
nt|sybarra2: do you really want to be in this slam?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: probably not but|pg||
nt|sybarra2: ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  you have all the controls ...only a question if you can set up @cs on ruffs|pg||
nt|andyv:  the poor @s spots may determine if they go on |pg||
nt|sybarra2: or smother 10 of @S? |pg||
nt|ahollan1: the auction strongly suggests  @S 4333 around the table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in that case -- 3@D looks more dangerous than normal|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: like Ninja ?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|andyv:  you can also try the @d suit |pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@s is 8-10 bal and 3@d asks for a major I'm told|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|twcho: he should return a @s to break up the squeeze|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@S = light third seat non-vul openings are all the rage among genuine experts - the older experts like to open 2@S (or equivalent) in 3rd seat (takes away more bidding space) - ...|pg||
nt|petergill: the newer experts find 1@S more effective overall (less revealing to opponents in the card play)|pg||
nt|mrdct: had north passed initially i guess NS would get to 1NT makiing 7 or 8 tricks|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mrdct: and then 3@h is a transfer to get the strong hand to play it|pg||
nt|mrdct: thanks specs!|pg||
nt|twcho: Top eight teams will enter the KO stage|pg||
nt|xenya: well...|pg||
nt|kemperg: 5@H are your @Hs good?|pg||
nt|kemperg: and W tinks AHx is enough|pg||
nt|xenya: EW lack 2 keycards, but luckily for them, they have failed to to find that out|pg||
nt|kemperg: no fancy play, trying to catch 10x in N and its made|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if West had all of the inferences about the NS @S length  and  North's proably being 46|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with  4135 or 4315  i'm not sure if Newell would rebid 3@C or just a quiet 2@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder also |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Lixin played for squeeze on last hand  so a different down 1 in 4@S |pg||
nt|mrdct: 1 *can't|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 4@s maybe voidwood ?|pg||

nt|fabsayc: no stopping now|pg||
nt|mrdct: if any of you good analyst out there want to join me feel free|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: finishing in top 3 is helpful   1 chooses opponent from 5-8, then  2, then  3  [ 4 gets stuck with remaining team]|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: @d9 is good @d ?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: seems good for ONI|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|kemperg: claim|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh Yes 10 is critical, thx|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: 4@D set @S    4@H=avg+ or max  then RKC|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: ummm, they also go !  nice auction! |pg||
pc|h6|nt|fabsayc: this mostly needs two diamonds to survice, then a straight cross ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if @D lead 3rd/5th then unlikely choice of crossruff|pg||
nt|andyv:  if leads are 3-5, W may already know what is going on|pg||
nt|mrdct: obviously with north having already bid @s the transfer benefits are not there - but often you need to stick to your generla structure|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h9|pg||
nt|mrdct: jacobs would much rather have the @H10 than the @CQ|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: hehehehe  |pg||
pc|sA|nt|fabsayc: yes i dont think he will play that way, i was talking in abstract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: double dummy players will  pin north's @S10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and finesse in @C|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think before the lead, @d suit looks as promising as anything else|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: No snag. cold slam !|pg||
nt|mrdct: so beating this a couple of tricks will be close to a push|pg||
nt|mrdct: the overtake there suggest he'll at least keep his options open to hook the 10|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: come the moment of truth ??|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: push !|pg||

nt|ahollan1: some big club pairs play that as less than opening bid, others as limited opener [ 10-15]|pg||
nt|twcho: really don't like such 54 opener and force partner to 3 level|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: we r vul and they r non !|pg||

pc|s5|nt|sybarra: and how many nt do they end up in?  6 nt makes |pg||
nt|petergill: Dbl by E = to discourage West from going past 4@SX|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 3nt by W in OR|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3NT is the open room - so cold have a new leader again if it makes|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: oh good lead !|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: @C4 discouraging  and hard to read regarding suit pref  [odd/even discards]|pg||
nt|fabsayc: verhees will continue diamonds and subseuently declarer is kind of squeezed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: agreed    probably liked favorable vul  [not-vul vs vul  aka "green"]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlucky   partner had best hand at the table|pg||
nt|cc469: evenin'|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Carl,  welcome |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Reid really doesn't have much hope of beating this|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with his @C shortness -- desperately hoping partner has 1@D and 2+@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but even then  need a 2nd trump trick|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: great decision|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: quite a parlay opposite an aggressive favorable vul 2@H opening|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in 6@S Miyakuni cashed @CA early and misguessed trump - but @D suit intact  does she still have a chance to make?   i doubt it|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think we are relaying a bunch here |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: with 7 more after this|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: it is as a water on the very hot stone|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: maybe|pg||

pc|h4|nt|sybarra: might we just plop into 6 nt? |pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@S = due to the fav vul - might cost a little bit too much|pg||
nt|mrdct: the 3 @c losers will hurt|pg||
nt|mrdct: on a good day dummy's minors will be the other way and it's all dandy|pg||
nt|petergill: South knew trumps were 3-1 only when @SK appeared - else West has no spade stop for his 3NT bid|pg||
pc|sT|nt|pole_as_ch: The other room also 4@s !  so no swing !|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: in north america, i think Woolsey-Stewart are the only big club pair that doesn't use 2N opening as strong balanced hand|pg||
pc|s9|nt|fabsayc: timing all wrong for defense now|pg||
nt|mrdct: but i don;t disagree with north's action and it could easily be replicated in the open room|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|nt|sybarra: and they "we" are |pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||
nt|sybarra: can actually make 7 given that @H's fall |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|pole_as_ch: wow ?|pg||
nt|cc469: I suggest that it is not at all clear from N's hand that they should be playing in a minor suit and thus agree with Tommy that the 2NT opening is a bit unilateral|pg||
nt|cc469: S might have held W's @Hs for example|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and then EW hold the @S|pg||
pc|cT|nt|sybarra: and spade hook on |pg||
nt|xenya: the correct play was @SJ -- unless declarer was playing for a singleton @SK|pg||

pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: but if you flip-flop North's majors -- then i change my vote|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: RDBL may trf to @c.|pg||
nt|mrdct: looks like a routine 4@s here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=4@H and 5+@C/@D   i think this is absolute maximum for the Raptor 1N overcall|pg||
nt|mrdct: with two balanced hands EW may choose 3NT here|pg||
nt|petergill: I think West should have played his top spades (not @CK) on which East could indicate @CA somehow - for 800|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C strong|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+   [i'm using Zejun convention card from 2009 world championship]|pg||
nt|sybarra: what 2 suited call do they have?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: but very difficult hand for 3NT, i think|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: where is they go in this bd ?|pg||
nt|mrdct: some number of @h - 2 or 3 i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1:  9  the Chinese pair took save in 5@HX|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: well deserved 7 too|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1:  24  Jianming in 4@SX West|pg||
nt|petergill: Dbl probably shows about 6 or 7 points, was not penalty|pg||
nt|mrdct: can ben find a reason to lead @h?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D = 2 suits same rank  [@C&@D or @H&@S]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not pure CRASH  they use  DBL, 1@D and 2@C instead of the usually DBL, 1@D, 1N|pg||
nt|sybarra: does Reid now try 1 @S? |pg||
nt|mrdct: west doesn't have very good suit quality in @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: by the huge margin of 1 imp     Dutch Premier League   i get the feeling it is analogous to the ACBL's Grand National Team|pg||
nt|sybarra2: I think a bit more than that |pg||
nt|sybarra2: I would put it more like the Reisinger |pg||
nt|ahollan1: more than the GNT?|pg||
nt|sybarra2: maybe you feel that GNT is more than I do |pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh  in importance   i made comparison because it runs over multiple months  starting at club level|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 3@h ! or 3@c |pg||
mb|3D|nt|pole_as_ch: North calmly pass !|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C = pass/correct|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@S = 4+@S [possible canape with longer minor]|pg||

nt|sybarra2: van Prooijen-Verhees, playing in the closed room, won the Dutch Teams Championship (by 1 IMP!) less than 36 hours ago. They must be jet-lagged. Quite a journey from Amsterdam to ...|pg||
nt|sybarra2: ...|pg||
nt|sybarra2: to Japan|pg||
nt|sybarra2: playing here |pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmmmmm   i thought 2N showed 6+@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and game force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H confirms @C and shows extras  [i think]   maybe just extras|pg||
nt|petergill: Pass by West, converting East's Dbl for penalties, yields 800 or 1100 or more, I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lead director :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: I thought maybe he would try 1 @S to see if it was majors |pg||
nt|mrdct: lose 2@s and a trick in each of the other suits|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: strange 3N|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|fabsayc: how can it be game force after negative 1@D?|pg||
nt|vugraphzws: Alert with P is miss.sorry|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes next hand please :)|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 3@d is "help suit" like  maybe .|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: GT|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: stopped ??|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: in OR, West's 1NT !  humm.|pg||
nt|mrdct: i guess there is chance for declarer to over think a potential bad trump break going for an endplay in @d|pg||
nt|mrdct: which could be indicated with the @H opening by west|pg||
nt|mrdct: btw 2@h is 10-13 5+@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: can be weaker in 3rd|pg||
nt|mrdct: the east-west system has no weak 2 available so with hands like west you need to improvise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if 3@C again pass/correct then 2@H was just showing max|pg||
nt|kemperg: dbl = support 3@Hs|pg||
nt|sybarra: becaise if pard bids a minor Reid has a good hand |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: could be a great result though|pg||
mb|3N|nt|andyv:  card says 1@s was a balanced relay so probably couldn|pg||
nt|andyv:  couldn't hold 6 spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: either my notes or vP's bid are wrong|pg||
nt|ahollan1: fun system to study     i first saw Ultimate Canape played by Russ Ekeblad   the Dutch have made some minor changes but the overall structure is intact|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: hu ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i wonder -- what is default meaning of RDBL for CRASH players|pg||
mb|4S|nt|petergill: 4@S should make, but is not totally cold|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: no   1@S=relay over 1@H response|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was about to say  best contract 1N [which they can't reach]   when result from other room popped up|pg||
nt|petergill: the sort of contract an expert should make and an average player might not make|pg||
nt|petergill: On this lead, 4@S is even colder|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 8 tricks ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra2: do we hear the screaching of brakes?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: over 1@D   1@H/@S look like matchpoint precision / meckwell ...   4+suit, one-round force|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: heww|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: whew|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: and lead ?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|pole_as_ch: use @d for many tricks ?|pg||

pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: to account for the artificial 1N overcall   EW DBL isn't pure takeout shape -- can include normal strong NT|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: was Hirata on a different wave length there?|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: did he want to save @C10 for later??|pg||

nt|mrdct: i don't think the overtrick on 26 makes any difference as 180 and 200 are both 5 imps|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: or 6@d ?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: y|pg||
nt|mrdct: 6@d is a great contract|pg||
nt|mrdct: maybe 4@h by north now|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: and 5@c by south ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@H = 1-suiter, not solid suit|pg||
nt|cc469: I see|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: another approch !  why not 3NT ?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: or almost, couple of imps away|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mrdct: is north not happy with his @s stopper?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe it *shows*|pg||
nt|mrdct: maybe 2@s is showing the @s stopper(s)|pg||
nt|petergill: Oz Players is 6th so needs to avoid a serious loss in order to qualify|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=one round force   2@C natural   don't know which suit is longer|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kemperg: @S well placed, will make 6|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, can't help it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C confirms canape hand   4@H  LONGER @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and lack of @S bid we have pretty good picture of South hand|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 3 or 4 ??|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: well, 4 !|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 4 for me too|pg||

nt|ahollan1: not 7222|pg||

pc|sA|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: What is her choice for OL?|pg||
nt|twcho: interesting system|pg||

nt|ahollan1: strike that  their teammates in the winning Bermuda Bowl    Tarzan Precision opens 1@H with 5@H and 5+@S  [because of their relay structure]|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@S was 4 spades, longer clubs, 14+ points|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: sry, last BD, west ! Mullanphy !|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mrdct: hard for south to avoid game now|pg||

nt|ahollan1: was just typing    @H ruff will be with natural trump trick - is there a way to avoid that defense|pg||
nt|mrdct: i guess with the EW major not revealed 4@h could be contrued as natural by north|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ahollan1: well sure -- lead @D  :)|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh !  sound !?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: i c|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: agree|pg||
nt|mrdct: in the open room west showed @h naturally so north was able to cue with 4@h so i think the slam will be reached in the open room|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: alas duplication|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: i like the auction in OR.|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: 4@H slam try in @C|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 4@S = min|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good lord, are they slamming again|pg||
nt|sybarra2: teetering on it |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i doubt verhees shows  disinterest with @CAK-7th|pg||
nt|sybarra2: maybe the 4 @S=min slows them down?|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think so -- but don't quote me|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1:  10  Tony Nunn in West made 3@C where Banxiang made 1N|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: yep|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pole_as_ch: East could easily lost 6@d|pg||
pc|s5|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: indeed|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sybarra2: again the sounds of brakes are deafening |pg||
nt|xenya: maybe N could have a bit more|pg||
nt|xenya: 22?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: normally playing Queen on lead of King says  I either have singleton or QJ|pg||
pc|s4|nt|pole_as_ch: BD 10 ?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no this one|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c3|pg||

nt|ahollan1: so good save against 3@S :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: loses 2 anyway|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mrdct: makes things nice and easy for ben thompson to continue @c|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c6|pc|s6|pg||
pc|d9|pc|cT|pc|h6|pc|s9|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: with non-min  Verhees would have responded keycards   that keeps them out of slam too [on this hand]|pg||
nt|mrdct: declaer in a bind here as he does have his tricks and knows that when west gets in he's off|pg||
pc|hT|pc|c8|nt|mrdct: *doesn't have his tricks|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|petergill: other table: EW missing the making 3NT on Bd 25 means Oz Players must avoid more major adverse swings, else their Finals place will be in jeopardy|pg||

mb|3N|nt|andyv:  NS are rapidly becoming spectators in these auctions|pg||

nt|sybarra: I am surprised Reid wasnt in there with spades  (except he is red) |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Declarer mistimed this in the open room|pg||
nt|mrdct: they probably a convention that will help them avoid that|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: 3NT would be better contruct, but West choiced 4@s.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H holding 4  means  either weak NT or  4414/4405|pg||
nt|cc469: that should help the @H guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzws: 2NT maybe 20-21|pg||

nt|xenya: 21 plus a 5-carder for example|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: anyways|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: maybe|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: but entry problem |pg||

nt|mrdct: yeah he's a bit tangled up now|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: agree|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 2 ruff in each hand is not enought, because South would ruff 3rd @h.|pg||

nt|mrdct: the GF option muddies the water here for W|pg||
nt|petergill: West did not expect it to be GF|pg||
nt|petergill: I think 2@S the first time is best - 3@S - 4@S |pg||
nt|petergill: but perhaps 4@S is hard to bid after the weak 1NT|pg||
nt|mrdct: yes, but the GF option affect the meanings of double of 2@d|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H if passed out will be about 300|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@S will be 620 or 650, 2@S will be 170 or 200|pg||
nt|petergill: With good shape, it's a bidder's game. Shape rules.|pg||
nt|mrdct: if 2@h is dbled, can NS escape to 3@d?|pg||
nt|petergill: I think 2@S the previous time is best, as the delayed 2@S sounds "balancing" or weaker |pg||
nt|petergill: so 2@S now might get passed by East|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: transfer|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sybarra2: Patrick is a frequent commentator with us (when not playing) |pg||
nt|sybarra2: he also lived in Netherlands for many years and probably "brought these dutchies up" |pg||
nt|ahollan1: which black suit to attack??    that answer affects play to trick 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D lead director rather than showing 2 suiter missing the boss suit|pg||
nt|twcho: does 2@s here guarantee 4 cards support?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i doubt it|pg||
nt|mrdct: decided to take the plus|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: ah !|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and a quiet part score |pg||
nt|ahollan1: for what it is worth   Conditions of Contest actually discuss handling of "screen hesitations"|pg||

nt|fabsayc: i would not even cue with norths non=opener|pg||
nt|ahollan1: may not be an option in the partnership|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he could bid bid 4@S over the double surely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i.e.  common agreement  MUST return cuebid if available below game|pg||
nt|mrdct: 1NT is 10+ bal GF|pg||
nt|ahollan1: trump shift?????|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: different situation when 1 hand shows 5+ AND forces to game   versus  competitive bidding war|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: 1@c is 14+|pg||

pc|h3|nt|mrdct: 2@h and 3@h look natural|pg||

nt|ahollan1: see  @D lead director|pg||

pc|h6|nt|pole_as_ch: good contruct !  it looks cold.  so 5 imps buck.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one of the first to play Precision  [helped CC Wei with some system clarification  or maybe just in introducing the system in Taiwan]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from old Zejun convention card    carding is standard Count   odd/even discard   and presumably no attitude signals vs suit|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sybarra: and thx to NEC and the Japan Contract Bridge League for bringing this wonderful tourney once again to bbo |pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh ?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|petergill: 3@S over 2@H is too risky for me - singleton heart in partner's hand seems wasted opposite KQJ10|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: No entry for south, then push ?|pg||
nt|ahollan2:  @S10 might be entry |pg||

nt|mrdct: managing this 5-0 @h break will take some care|pg||
nt|petergill: From West's point of view, N's expected doubleton heart makes North more likely to have 4 spades = bad for bidding @S's|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: wow|pg||
pc|s6|nt|andyv:  lead my get N to lose a @d  trick|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: what does that mean after 1@D which is 0+ suit?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i would think other 2 suits|pg||
nt|twcho: I will assume it to be natural|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so must DBL or bid 2N with the other 2?|pg||
nt|twcho: yes, looks natural for me|pg||
nt|xenya: i predict S will bid 6 :)|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@D transfer to @H ---> but with equal or longer spades S replies 3@S|pg||
nt|petergill: so South has shown longer @h than @S|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: if @s, then N may, if @h then South |pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: both teams look 100% safe for qualifying, barring accidents at the other table|pg||
nt|petergill: Bulg 3rd, Oz 6th before this match, 8 qualify after this match|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@H by South is a pleasant enough contract, NS sill be happy|pg||
nt|petergill: NT by South is mich harder to play, having to lead always from the South hand|pg||

pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: for the spectators -- there is no single right answer  bidding over a nebulous 1@D   you must have partnership agreement|pg||

pc|d3|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: Last BD and 16+1 |pg||
nt|mrdct: 16 is a lot to gain on one board though|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: now Last BD of this seg !|pg||
nt|petergill: While Peter Newell and Martin Reid played the excellent game they have been playing for about 15 years, their Aussie teammates did OK too. |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Last BD of this seg|pg||
mb|1D|nt|pole_as_ch: y|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes we must thank Sartaj and Tony also :)|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: chatch them , their 4@HX, as expected ???|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: *catch|pg||
nt|petergill: It shows what can happen when Kiwis and Aussies join together, as Mike Ware from NZ at times has shown too. |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it should happen more often Peter :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C!|nt|pole_as_ch: No! then calmly 3NT|pg||

mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: thx Gary|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Surely come |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a great pleasure|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: treatment seen during this tournament    after 1M-(2M)    cue of opponent's suit = one strength raise,  2N = different strength|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: bulgaria are a certainty to win this match now|pg||

nt|petergill: Though Down Under had to battle to qualify, if you look at their Qualifying draw, they played most of the top teams, unlike say Geely Auto who stormed home from the bottom of the ...|pg||
nt|petergill: field. So Down Under truly desevrve their place in the Grand Final|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mrdct: there were a few critical hands that went the wrong way for Oz Players. 25 springs to mind where they was a chance to make 2NT and win 11 imps instead of losing 7|pg||
pc|s5|nt|pole_as_ch: agree|pg||
nt|mrdct: and the 6@d NS missed here where it wasn't clear if 4@h by north would be a cue or natural|pg||
