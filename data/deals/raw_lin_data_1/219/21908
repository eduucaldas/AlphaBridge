nt|Walddk2: Do we have Jacobs - Thompson   N-S   Dave?|pg||
nt|eamongall: Every event has new operators and after a few rounds they become experienced and learn stuff |pg||
nt|mrdct: but as it happens a low trump was going to work better as east is forced to rise Q and then doesn't have the tempo to take his trick|pg||

nt|andyv:  that's where they were saturday:)|pg||
nt|mrdct: pages 3&4 for bill & ben|pg||
nt|mrdct: so in the EW methods all one-level openings are frocing for one round|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed,    N-S are    Stamatov - Karianov|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They play Precision|pg||
nt|mrdct: so about 14+hcp|pg||
nt|sybarra: how did we not make 6 @C?|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh I see,  the @D ruff :( unlucky |pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if Yeh partnerships are playing standard or some Precision pairs|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: good start for FT|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: all Bulgarian top pairs do|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|ahollan1: and NS   akama-maruyama  [not sure who's where]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=game force   a bunch of hand types  in this case  balanced  [no singleton or void]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my dream is that someday  BBO will work on software for operator and there will be functionality to just INSERT PASS  instead of having to do all of those UNDOs|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: EW in OR is team leader of FT.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: They use Blue club oriented system.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: 2@s is 10-13 5+ @s|pg||
nt|mrdct: so east is clear a big max for his bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not 1@C from east|pg||
nt|ahollan1: P-1@C-P-  then  1@H=4+@S|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|mrdct: *clearly|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: NS of this room i know each of them, but pd-ship i don't know|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@S RELAY  |pg||
nt|mrdct: btw - i'm going to predict bill jacobs is sitting east as ben thompson is a bit more agressive and would probably open 1@s with the east cards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, Bill is always E and N I noticed|pg||
nt|mrdct: believe it or not i've never noticed that|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Normal ? 2/1, i guess|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|mrdct: i think the 1st two matches are up|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: NS in this room are wife(N) & hus(S)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: operator won't be able to lead   so then auction should get fixed|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C balanced  8-11 or 15+ hcp|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/home////tabid/223/Default.aspx  for tournament website. No results yet I'm afraid. They only update the page once a day if memory serves|pg||
nt|mrdct: poor result for Oz in the open room|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: sry, i have no detail about Chaina Geely Auto members|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/home/English/nec/17th/results/7thFeb/tabid/665/Default.aspx|pg||
nt|Walddk2: thx|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: 2N broke out of relay so East guaranteed declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vP's 1@S [RHO's suit]  showing the 2 unbid suits|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: They (NS) prefer schenken|pg||
pc|hA|nt|eamongall: yes first two rounds are up ... and 3rd round was only finished ... |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: if someone teach me |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: 3@D = 4/5@D  not 4@H/@S|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: Andy was referring to the Dutch Premiere League final that was on BBO last weekend|pg||
nt|andyv:  declarer starts with 8 tricks and has 2 4-3 suits to find the 9th, or the @d suit.|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|mrdct: the problem in the open rooms is with only one @s stopper you need cashing tricks on top which just weren't there|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: EW team won by 1 imp after trailing by a bunch after 4 round|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|andyv:  yes, they certainly made a quick turnaround to get to this tourney|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: it's not unreasonable to play 1@S as natural even though RHO has shown 4+  since 1N by passed hand is available to show the 2 unbid|pg||
nt|vugraphzws: Sorry for wrong bits.|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|mrdct: needs to make this to hold the damage to 5 imps - otherwise it's 8 imps out|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: they did that last year too|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: Operator, please insert names        North:  Stamatov     South: Danailov       East: Jacobs      West: Thompson|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and went on to win the NEC Cup|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mrdct: in fact when i last played against them i was south and screenmates with bill, but that may have been because ben didn't want to be screenmates with me|pg||

pc|dK|nt|sybarra: Website for this event: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/home////tabid/223/Default.aspx|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: curious that South didn't overcall this time|pg||
nt|andyv:  the plus side for declarer is the opps can't really attack any suits themselves|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
pc|s5|nt|andyv:  vul maybe?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: yes, vul  but 6-card suit  and 6421 dist|pg||

nt|sybarra: E will never believe suit is hts |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  again because of canape style, W restricted in his choice of openings|pg||

nt|vugraphzws: Sorry for mistake.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@S=5+@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: dutch playing a canape style, hence this unusual combination|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: hum, 6@c ?|pg||
nt|mrdct: Oz Players here are 2/3 of the runners-up in Australia National Open Teams from a couple of weeks ago|pg||
nt|sybarra: I suspect 5 @h is pass or correct... or the lack of @D was what W was going to bid |pg||
nt|sybarra: just not sure how they play this |pg||
nt|sybarra2: how to find out you have no wasted values in @H's |pg||
pc|dT|nt|pole_as_ch: EW in OR already go to there ! heww!|pg||

pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: 2N relay for distribution|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N=5@S 5@C 1@H|pg||
nt|mrdct: close to mirrored shapes here for NS which is often dangerous, but there's no ruff on for the defence so @SA and @DAK only to lose|pg||

nt|sybarra2: (and the k of clubs on side) |pg||

nt|ahollan1: especially if you have my short neck|pg||

nt|fabsayc: probably not but|pg||
nt|sybarra2: ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  you have all the controls ...only a question if you can set up @cs on ruffs|pg||
nt|andyv:  the poor @s spots may determine if they go on |pg||
nt|sybarra2: or smother 10 of @S? |pg||
pc|h5|nt|andyv:  you can also try the @d suit |pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: ummm, they also go !  nice auction! |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this mostly needs two diamonds to survice, then a straight cross ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if @D lead 3rd/5th then unlikely choice of crossruff|pg||
nt|andyv:  if leads are 3-5, W may already know what is going on|pg||
nt|mrdct: obviously with north having already bid @s the transfer benefits are not there - but often you need to stick to your generla structure|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|h9|pc|d4|nt|fabsayc: yes i dont think he will play that way, i was talking in abstract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: double dummy players will  pin north's @S10|pg||

nt|mrdct: which could be indicated with the @H opening by west|pg||
nt|mrdct: btw 2@h is 10-13 5+@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: can be weaker in 3rd|pg||

nt|mrdct: poor result for Oz in the open room|pg||
nt|timb: David, that is an understatemet (too say the least) of a very British kind|pg||
nt|mrdct: in fairness to matt muulamphy - what else do you suggest he does when a green vs red 3@h preempt come around to him|pg||
mb|1S|nt|fabsayc: yes if i can bring a cheat sheet to all events|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N!|nt|andyv:  sorry, 10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3rd 2@C opener|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: now difficult 4 @s|pg||
nt|sybarra2: this is the "I have an opening bid" 1 @D |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15 HCP, 0+@D, maybe longer @C/@S, but NOT @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as here  often weak NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|ahollan1: and 3rd 2@D response|pg||
nt|ahollan1: RDBL=4+@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  must be nice to have so many hands fit into your system:)|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 1@h = @s showing, and 2@s = 4 card @s  maybe !|pg||
nt|Walddk4: yes, and a minimum|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  S had a pretty easy dbl |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: thx Roland.|pg||
nt|mrdct: typically aggressive fav vul preempt by ben|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: yep  define the system then make arrangements with The Great Shuffler|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|nt|andyv:  NS are rapidly becoming spectators in these auctions|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Declarer mistimed this in the open room|pg||
pc|h7|nt|pole_as_ch: 3NT would be better contruct, but West choiced 4@s.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H holding 4  means  either weak NT or  4414/4405|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|andyv:  you aren't dealt NT hands in order to be passing |pg||
nt|ahollan1: vP described 7+@C again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would you overcall 2N or DBL Andy?|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 3 in @s, 3 in @h, 1 in @d, 1 in @C, so 8 tricks.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|d9|pc|hT|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s7|nt|andyv:  dbl|pg||
nt|ahollan1: remember  2@C could be 4@C and 5+@S|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: agree|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 2 ruff in each hand is not enought, because South would ruff 3rd @h.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|d2|nt|fabsayc: they are accurate enough that north might have considered 3@H over west's pass|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't like Kx as stopper when opps say they have 6 of them...can't even hold up once|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Defender shoud attack @c |pg||
nt|timb: "Disastrous" springs to mind as the correct description  - though I do feel Matt M was unlucky|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|nt|sybarra: ok  we will see what we need in 1/2 hour |pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||

nt|mrdct: EW might pencil this in as a good result|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|pc|c3|pc|s9|pg||
nt|andyv:  on this hand anyway, letting opps play 3@c is not winning bridge.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sybarra: bit ambitious here |pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: right  over normal Precision 2@C where length guaranteed  DBL is clear|pg||
pc|c7|pc|dJ|pg||

nt|andyv:  EW can't get away from @c suit last few hands|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  11  [the long auction to 5@C]  Miyakuni 3N West|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, South could have defeated it (ruffing @DK)|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|sybarra2: bd 11 3 nt +2 in the other room |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: that picked up 2 overtrick imps   but  5@C much better at imps|pg||
nt|sybarra2: dealing machine having fun with club suit|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: how many @C has vanProoijen held this set?|pg||
nt|sybarra2: the Yeh Bros team is:  Chen Yeh, JuiYiu Shih, ChiMou Lin, Herstein Liu, Patrick Huang, Grace Lin |pg||
nt|sybarra2: and they Yeh Bros sponsor a great tourney also shown on bbo |pg||
mb|d|nt|pole_as_ch: 2 bd is remains. 40imp is 25-5 ! |pg||
nt|Walddk4: But it looked natural to him to get rid of his last heart|pg||
mb|r!|mb|2H|nt|andyv:  a lot|pg||
nt|andyv:  6@d is the lucky spot on this hand|pg||
nt|mrdct: Oz might win those imps back here|pg||
nt|mrdct: 7@h seems kind of extreme on these EW cards|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sybarra2: another invitation tourney |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Patrick Huang bid only 2N  but still got to game|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra2: Patrick is a frequent commentator with us (when not playing) |pg||
nt|sybarra2: he also lived in Netherlands for many years and probably "brought these dutchies up" |pg||
nt|ahollan1: which black suit to attack??    that answer affects play to trick 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and a quiet part score |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: there is one more hand after this hand |pg||
pc|s5|nt|andyv:  redbl...first round control|pg||
nt|ahollan1: also an icon in the bridge world   has been playing international level bridge since late 1950s|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mrdct: only an 8-card fit, west is balanced, dodgey stiff @DK in east|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: we want to thank our operator for wonder presentation |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  12  after 1@C auction  Bakhsi had no trouble finding DBL  and they've found @H|pg||
nt|sybarra2: not sure I really want to be there however |pg||
nt|fabsayc: i would not even cue with norths non=opener|pg||
nt|ahollan1: may not be an option in the partnership|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he could bid bid 4@S over the double surely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i.e.  common agreement  MUST return cuebid if available below game|pg||
nt|mrdct: 1NT is 10+ bal GF|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|nt|mrdct: 1@c is 14+|pg||
pc|c2|nt|fabsayc: is prooijen pretending to lead a singleton|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@h and 3@h look natural|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3@s i guess is a cue and 3NT is a slam try|pg||
nt|mrdct: beyond that i'm guessing|pg||
pc|s8|nt|pole_as_ch: good contruct !  it looks cold.  so 5 imps buck.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one of the first to play Precision  [helped CC Wei with some system clarification  or maybe just in introducing the system in Taiwan]|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: and thx to NEC and the Japan Contract Bridge League for bringing this wonderful tourney once again to bbo |pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|pg||
