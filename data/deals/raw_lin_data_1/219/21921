nt|petergill: Because their other openings are mostly 9-13, NS regard 14+ as "strong"|pg||
nt|petergill: North feeling uncomfortable, as 3@D might be a 4-2 fit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL was takeout|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: certainly he had better chance than in other room|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if this is not good enough they need to revise system, considering east also had 2nt for minors|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: 1NT will make 3NT a make because east won't lead a diamond|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: same as OR. and plsy ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems rich with minimum 1@C opener and weak suits|pg||
nt|petergill: Best for N to pass, as 3@S would be doubled by W|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Newell PASS just denies ability to game force|pg||
pc|c4|nt|pole_as_ch: 3rd hand should open on good suit, i dare say. |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: so i may open 1@h.|pg||
nt|kemperg: why not 3@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  20  the ladies are in 2N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D implies desire to play in suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: here South has @C stop  and they tend not to lead @S after showing 4+|pg||
pc|c3|nt|beauch:  looks like 2 down?|pg||
nt|cc469: I think if you bid 2@C you have to be prepared to bid your 4 card @S suit if the opportunity arises ( which it did here)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so invite for most likely game   with 2N|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cK|pg||
nt|kemperg: but only invite?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|pole_as_ch: difficult contruct. to make and to defend|pg||

nt|xenya: one can sympathise with S. who wanted to show good cards in @C with the 2N bid -- still her hand is more suit=oriented|pg||
pc|d5|nt|pole_as_ch: humm. |pg||
pc|d2|nt|fluffy: the hand will make 11 tricks comfortable, but if you look in isolation the hand you would rather play 6@c than 3NT before the lead since clubs 2-2 mean 6@c makes and @c3-1 put 3NT ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: in danger|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|kemperg: right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course easier to bid South hand when you have tools like Gazilli or Cole |pg||

pc|sK|pc|s5|nt|pole_as_ch: c.|pg||

pc|c7|pc|h6|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: if my method, @c is good. so 6@c would be in scope.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: DBL of 5@H     when was last time you saw that bid GAIN|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1974|pg||

nt|petergill: I don't like 6@h much. The assumption that partner has very short spades can be faulty, as on the actual hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and the Kings are defensive, not offensive|pg||

nt|petergill: Yes I do - but that doesn't mean it's the best way to play|pg||

pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: DBL usually something like any 5-7 hcp|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 4@C longer minor for the majors perhaps|pg||
pc|h7|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i wonder if Tueje was forced to rebid 1@S or if she could have bid 1N to show strong NT|pg||
pc|c5|nt|eamongall: cokaholic knows this system .."2@D=3-fit, INV+ " |pg||

nt|ahollan1: thinking about whether to play @D before @H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: By the way, we already have "rag" among bridge slang. Unimportant card. "My spade holding was the king and four rags"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he has to play a diamond eventually, so this does not justify thinking very long|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but how many  UMJOODOs?    Rod tells where that name came from  but i'd like to thank whoever decided to popularize Reverse Flannery|pg||
pc|h6|nt|petergill: Peter Newell being a very ethical player, like most New Zealanders|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer did well to take the @S finesse at that point|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: especially dislike showing both majors in this partnership where  9-13 unbalanced open the bidding with "transfer" to show 4+ major|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Reid's problem is that Newell could be 1444 with no @CQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but does that hand rebid 5@C over 4@S?|pg||
nt|petergill: It's not so obvious to NS that the match has turned out badly so far - e.g. their 2@H making five (Bd 23?) might be a pickup from their point of view|pg||
nt|fabsayc: even then he has diamond hook, also 7 not impossible|pg||
pc|h3|nt|pole_as_ch: UG. ducking ?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: very well done Martin Reid|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: 2bd remains.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: i c. West ducking @dA !!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C opened in 4th seat in other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final board of swiss qualifying for our room|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: that claim is wrong too :(|pg||
nt|petergill: top 7 plus Mr Yeh's team qualify for quarter finals|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: new leader at BD 26|pg||
nt|cc469: defenders never expected switch from spades to @DQ without another @S in declarer's hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: weak NT still|pg||
nt|xenya: 1@C is OK if allowed|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D  10-15 HCP, 0+@D  [from South's 2009 CC]|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Down 2 if a diamond was returned, then @SA and jack|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 1@c ???|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 1@d shows @h|pg||
mb|2H|nt|petergill: weak 1NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=(11)12-14|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh that's right Peter  thanks|pg||
nt|petergill: sorry, top 8 qualify - I forgot which event this is|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why Mr Yeh? Thought that only applied to the Yeh Bros Cup|pg||
nt|petergill: My mistake|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hehe  you convinced me too |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: HCP?   we don't need no stinking HCP|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 2H! or 3@h, but not 4@h|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: only 2 remains|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: point being that Bakhshi didn't pass it out either|pg||
nt|xenya: since you can pass any response by pard|pg||
mb|2S|nt|fabsayc: hanlon got any more bids?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 2@d ???|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: well, X P P 2@s X ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: 4th double figure swing in 12 boards|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: oh, No!|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Sure|pg||
nt|Walddk4: if he gets 5@D now he is in slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder how auction progresses if Stamatov just jumps in @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure how EW play DBL over the 2@D transfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: 2@s ???  sry, bad comment|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: and another 6 imp.  29imp is 22-8 vp.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|petergill: Unlucky hand for weak 1NT, this one|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think it was david gold that said weak no trump is a losing proposition at the top level|pg||
nt|ahollan1: common to play DBL of Weak NT - Stayman as Cards [rather than @C]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but is that also done over transfer?    i confess i don't know|pg||
pc|sK|nt|eamongall: Hanlon is normally extremely strong as a declarer but 4-1 breaks kill most of us |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: good auction to best contruct!|pg||
pc|s6|nt|eamongall: anyway tightens up the match |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes Lui played very nicely OR|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: comes Chen's Ocaltic call.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Dec can catch 8 tricks easily, but 9th ?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|pole_as_ch: why so jumping ???|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Maybe, East Opening is not 2@c, so 6 was enough, Ch3n was thought.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: *Chen|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Now Furuta safely settled 6, or not ????|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: this is 17 imp if he make this|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: and new leader !! or not ??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't think it will convince them to change the system|pg||
nt|petergill: 12 X 14 board matches, this is Round 8 of ther Swiss|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: great auction from EW|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but for sure you should keep track|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or convince Fantunes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or Hans-Nunn|pg||
nt|petergill: this will be quite a big swing, with NS vul and tough discards to be made|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well fantunes weak no trump is not normal, can be any 5422|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and 6322 and 4441|pg||
nt|petergill: Scores after 7 rounds at http://www.jcbl.or.jp/home/English/nec/17th/results/tabid/659/Default.aspx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a couple of the Japanese Seniors also weak notrumpers|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not any 5422, Martin, not 5-4 in the majors|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Nice auction, McGann making up for his rather tame 1@S (4@S and 5@D)|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|pc|s8|nt|eamongall: He sure did ..well done H Liu |pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 10 ticks is sure.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: *tricks|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: plus 2 tricks come from dummy reversal ??|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: He knows bad break of trump.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 17imp has it reality.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 2 bd include this only remains|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: @d7 shows @dA ?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Defence also have not tricks|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: so the move of Dec and North deside the fate.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|sT|nt|petergill: North hoping @SQ is doubleton |pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: why did i think this was final board??    we still have  30 to play|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pole_as_ch: 9th will be a little fade.|pg||
nt|petergill: will be disappointed|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the dutch card play and defense is very precise, no tricks given away carelessly|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ahollan1: do you think he was worth 2@S over 1@H?    is there a default about the difference between 1@S and 2@S there???|pg||

nt|rmb1: ah yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indonesia need to set them 2 tricks to keep 11 VP|pg||

mb|2N|nt|ahollan1: forcing 1@C [14+]|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: is that the default or just more @S??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=10-16 hcp|pg||

nt|kemperg: 3NT beer convention now?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C=Romex Stayman|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: sry, 19-11 vp|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N relay|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think that is form of 5-card ask   but don't quote me|pg||
mb|3N!|an|5!s+4!h|nt|ahollan1: right  that's why i asked if there's a default   [if so  i don't know which applies]|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but in this case 4 spades almost guaranteed by double so less need to distinguish length|pg||
nt|eamongall: Yeh .. how come my E and A keep getting mixed up |pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: 4@s can make ??|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 3@d = 4 supp & limit raise |pg||
nt|petergill: Before this match, Downunder had 7 VP gap to 9th so they will possibly drop out of the top 8 overnight|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=(32)44 same rank  [@S&@H or @D&@C]|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: RDBL = 10+ hcp   very traditional|pg||
nt|cc469: last board - I hope all enjoyed :)|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: why now by South ?|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: *next|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: can he make  ?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: more difficult than looking dummy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S another forcing noise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D exact shape|pg||
nt|petergill: Relays are not as important on game hands like this one, but are very good for slam hands|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is there as size ask available now al?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks for the explanation of 3N :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: on 29 ladies in 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: you're welcome|pg||
pc|c6|nt|pole_as_ch: Next round will be 90 minites later |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kiwibridge: his team mates did him proud OR|pg||
nt|xenya: this is makeable double-dummy, but hardly with the cards concealed|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|eamongall: I think he will go one down |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: @dQ shows seq under that.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 2 @h, 1 @s and can make|pg||
nt|xenya: you need to play for @DK doubleton|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: i think 3@H asks controls  [A=2 K=1]|pg||
nt|petergill: Both 4@S and 3NT are safe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and 3N = 4  [1@S promised at least 3]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Newell knows an Ace  or 2 kings missing    does that help him bid over 3N?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|pole_as_ch: Come ! and be fun about new team, new heat !|pg||
pc|h5|nt|pole_as_ch: Tajima would be lead after this BD, but how |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 6!  Chen !???|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: if he behave @d no loser, this can make !! |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: The call of 3@c is very good hint for Dec. so Chen might ....|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: -10 or -11 imp is not hevy lost for Tajima, but Chen should make this for his stand !!|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: but dummy entry remains ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  29  4@S+1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so pickup for Weak NT|pg||
nt|xenya: right|pg||
nt|kemperg: 11-19 now|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk4: flat board, 11 IMPs = 18-12 VPs, but we are not quite sure that it's scored correctly throughout|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's current Victory Point result|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kiwibridge: and so a modest victory to the Hackett team|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ahollan1: scores from other matches show up under  http://www.jcbl.or.jp/home/English/nec/17th/results/7thFeb/tabid/665/Default.aspx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: must choose results, NEC and then "details"|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: 4@D forces 4@H to signoff   [EndSignal]|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he needs heart queen for slam (ie 12 points)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: and AKK rather than AA|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|petergill: so S knew N had either Axxx, xxxx, xx, Axxx or Kxxx, xxxx, Kx, Axx or AKxx, xxxx, Kx, xxx with Q's and J's unknown|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: and 26imp will be 21-9 vp for Senior Champion !!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes, i think you need to separate those cases|pg||
nt|xenya: still makeable|pg||
nt|xenya: cash the hearts, @DA and small @D|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: @h2 ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bulgaria v oz very close   so i think Bulgaria [3rd] and the 2 teams tied for 1st are lock with Neduk to get into KO|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d6|pc|d3|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|twcho: the cue bid has taken them to a rather dangerous level|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too much uncertainty about Indonesia Ladies|pg||

pc|h6|nt|eamongall: The defenders don't like to get some @D ruffs |pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: but doomed ????|pg||
