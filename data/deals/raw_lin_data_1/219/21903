nt|petergill: (Aus) and Newell - Reid (NZ)|pg||
nt|petergill: At the other table, the obvious 3NT was missed - 2@D seems to have been "both majors" ... and South's 3@D is hard to understand (why not bid 3NT?)|pg||
nt|vugraphzwt: thanks all|pg||
nt|petergill: Or South could have passed 2@SX at the other table - which is particularly attractive because the opening leader will be North who can lead a trump|pg||
nt|petergill: Perhaps there was a language problem in explanations ---> S was confused, possibly thinking E had @D and W had @S - that makes S's bidding make more sense |pg||
nt|petergill: Mixups due to language problems, with all explanations written in English (using bridgey sign language whenever possible) happen quite a lot in Asia|pg||
nt|petergill: On Bd 13, West's play of 2@S (ref MOVIE) at the other table was cute and worthy of inclusion in Barry Rigal's Daily Bulletins, with N forgetting to unblock @CA|pg||
