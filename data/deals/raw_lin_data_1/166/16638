nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!  What was 1@S?|pg||
nt|janm: HI all, looks as if Bloom had a great second quarter! At least if the first quarter score on the website is correct :)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sybarra: yes and time for Milne to have a 3rd quarter like yesterdays|pg||
nt|othered1: There was a lot of tired play and some unexpected swings|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|nt|janm: 1@s was certainly an interesting bid :) - Perhaps he was hoping his partner could bid NT|pg||

nt|othered1: south's 3@C bid had to have been made with confidence that north had long @C . . .|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the qualifying event was 14-20 board matches|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Al!|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|dK|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: then "round of 20"  32 boards|pg||
nt|janm: Perhaps opening 1@c and rebidding at the 1-level shows an unbalanced hand? But he didn't want to rebid 1NT without a heart stopper|pg||

nt|ahollan1: West Sartaj Hans|pg||
mb|1S|mb|1N|nt|janm: How many of the players on these two teams are Juniors?|pg||
nt|othered1: 5 person teams seem to be more common when there are sponsors involved.  Is that the case here?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW play Weak NT 1st/2nd seat  Strong 3rd/4th|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oopss  SmirnoV   [not ff]|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: And Nunn sensibly decided this hand was too good for a weak NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: too right Jan|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm told that last member of the Milne  team was playing the aussie millions poker event so pulled out to play that|pg||

nt|janm: Hans' 1NT was a little conservative, and so was Nunn's decision not to raise, with both of them conservative they've missed a pretty good game|pg||

nt|ahollan1: this is the 2nd set of 4 16-board segments|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Andrew|pg||
nt|tejjyid: HI Shirley|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: this hand may well be opened 1NT in both rooms (but i think) its a strong NT in this room and a weak NT in the other room|pg||
nt|frankaus: The Bloom crew is staffed by hardened proffesionals - |pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can keep an eye on the other room via http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
mb|2C|nt|noodle:  seems ok to upgrade a good 14; as we have seen  opening bids are very agressive nowadays|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: both teams are playing 5-handed|pg||
mb|2D|nt|tejjyid: X presume single/suited|pg||
nt|frankaus: Milne crew the next generation of excellence - have been at the top of many international junior events|pg||

nt|tejjyid: not that it beats the contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the winners of this event will get an invitation and $6000 subsidy to attend the 2011 Yeh Bros Cup this coming April|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but highly likely to be flat|pg||

mb|1C|nt|tejjyid: Hi|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mwigor: in this situation gosney could probably have won the diamond unless he needed martin to switch|pg||
nt|noodle:  tx shirley   it seems Milne will need another comeback|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=3+|pg||
mb|2C|nt|noodle:  the imp is not much  but the fact they ended up in a great spot on a tough hand can boost morale early in the match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1st/2nd seat  Hans-Nunn play Weak NT   3rd/4th Strong|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Ain't 6.000$ a peace of cake? Is for my workers. OK. Stop now.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|tejjyid: I wold call it a lucky spot, not a great spot|pg||
nt|frankaus: false pref wit 1-2 ???|pg||
nt|noodle:  i agree :)|pg||
nt|noodle:  better lucky than good, though :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: auto 2@S, IMO|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: it's not a disastrous position, but it is difficult|pg||
nt|noodle:  opening bids are getting worse by the second imho|pg||
nt|sybarra: we saw it yesterday, maybe a repeat|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Peake never saw an 11 count he couldn't open|pg||
nt|noodle:  or i m getting old :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|vugrapha2: ok we're back live now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can keep an eye on the other room via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|rodal f: Road on?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Zone 6 is bringing us 2 fun events in the next 2 months    early/mid February  NEC Cup from Yokahama  [vugraph schedule already posted] and the YEH Bros|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: although PASS stops partner from taking your hand in any way seiously|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: [most of] Milne team is looking for 3rd straight NOT final|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in 2010 they were 2nd in both this event and the Spring NOT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with a slight change to team for the Spring event|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and Milne-Whibley were semi-finalists in 2009 while still New Zealanders|pg||
nt|sybarra: then maybe we are all getting old |pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: i think i like pass|pg||
pc|c5|nt|noodle:  often pass is better when really crappy hand|pg||
nt|noodle:  44 in minors an nothing in majors is asking for trouble in the competitive bidding|pg||
nt|sybarra: this should go quickly |pg||
pc|c6|nt|tejjyid: which, since you have complete rubish, may be a good argument for the PASS|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think there is a contradiction between overcalling on not much, and bidding game here on the East cards|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rnmalik: Hello all.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S seems like confirmation of the 3@S bid|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sT|nt|tejjyid: pass is better - that is pass of 1@S|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|s8|pg||

nt|andyv:  good evening Al, Lauren and specs|pg||

mc|11|nt|tejjyid: A number of spectators pointing out that opening isn't the prtoblem, not open 1@D is the problem|pg||

pg||
qx|o4|st||md|2S63H5DAQJ75CKQ965,S9842HQ942DT6CAJ7,SA5HKJT83D932C842,SKQJT7HA76DK84CT3|sv|b|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: does Unusual vs Unusual apply for passed hand?|pg||
mb|2N!|an|5/5 minor|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: if so   3@S is just competitive  [less than invite]|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: I would think so - after all, you could have quite a good hand in support of partner - of course the bid that shows a "forcing" heart hand probably isn't really forcing |pg||
nt|ahollan1: that was my concern Jan -- showing the other suit|pg||
pc|h5|nt|janm: or at least not forcing to game. Of course it would be a bid of one of the opponent's suits so is forcing|pg||
nt|janm: You could have an invitational hand in hearts - the sort of hand where you would have bid 2/1 as a passed hand and are willing to compete to the 3-level|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bizarre -- i'd never thought about this before   [or via senior status -- i knew but have forgotten]|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: identical auction in the other room|pg||
nt|janm: Seems like a pretty normal auction - 1@s is automatic, and 2NT is normal except for those pairs who insist it should be either weak or strong and so don't bid it on this sort of ...|pg||
nt|janm: intermediate hand, and most people play 3@s as a competitive, not invitational, raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no appeal to giving partner a ruff with natural @H trick -- question is will @D return be count or attitude?|pg||
nt|woozle: Vulnerable, this south hand could be typical of the weak version|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems @CJ rules out passive trump return|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
nt|janm: Certainly seems right to lead a diamond and it's an interesting question about whether the spot should be count or attitude - sometimes you can't tell which will be more useful to ...|pg||
nt|janm: partner |pg||
nt|ahollan1: defense harder if Nunn ducks @D9|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dT|pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
nt|janm: Yes, it is - wonder why he popped K? Although of course if N had underled the ace ...|pg||
nt|woozle: not really...what's your losing defensive line?|pg||
nt|woozle: one pitch from dummy not especially useful|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kieran -- i think it will still go @Dquack @DA  -- but south would have to think more about next play without @DK on 1st round|pg||
nt|woozle: South might have to think a little more, but I still can't see how ducking the diamond changes declarer's number of tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: example: partner could have 2@D but only 1@S|pg||
nt|woozle: giving declarer six spades, four diamonds and at most four losers|pg||
nt|janm: Hung still has a problem of what to do now - he doesn't know whether he wants to set up a club trick for his side, or play a passive spade, or another diamond |pg||

pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: NS carding  upside-down count & attitude|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vs NT the also play "OddBall" in following to declarer's suit|pg||
nt|noodle:  now we ll have a real canadian commentator :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I prefer to open my best suit of 4-4|pg||
nt|noodle:  opening best suit on weak hands is good for lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: brb guys,  checking other room |pg||
pc|h2|nt|noodle:  I think EW played the junior trial the week before the NOT , right ?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: that's my view|pg||
pc|h8|nt|andyv:  nice pull by W|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: great explanation!!|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: what does 5@D show?       faith|pg||
nt|andyv:  I wonder if that showing faith means he doesn't trust partner's penalty doubles:)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: ish is now complaining that he didn't know 3C was alerted|pg||
nt|tejjyid: West, maybe|pg||
nt|mwigor: they both played in youth week|pg||
nt|noodle:  they show stamina then|pg||
nt|mwigor: but not in the trial for the australian youth team|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I don't like this auction at all|pg||
pc|s3|nt|noodle:  tx specs :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mwigor: milne-whibley (two of the others in this team) made the australian youth team|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|rnmalik: accepts the transfer:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  seven card suits are hard to describe in middle of auctions|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: whibley shrugged and ish isn't pursing it|pg||
nt|noodle:  as spec points out NS have a different system of answers to 1@c  it might tip the scales|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Indeed, if you have complex methods 1@C is better, as leaving more room to exercise them|pg||
nt|noodle:  I also have a rattle theory when it comes to bridge gadgets|pg||
nt|noodle:  it goes like this :|pg||
nt|noodle:  if you give a kid a rattle he will shake it|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it's true|pg||
nt|noodle:  MJ went to the other room presumably|pg||
pc|hK|nt|noodle:  hung and smirnov are well known on BBO :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think South snaffled the Youth pairs?|pg||
nt|mwigor: same auction in both rooms|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Peake did raise to 2@S   --  but won't get any extra credit if both contracts make|pg||
nt|tejjyid: no, it's a purely academic point on this hand|pg||
nt|tejjyid: commentator's noise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: opposite passed hand, i actually like Whibley's PASS -- partner now KNOWS 3@S support  and  won't go overboard|pg||
nt|sybarra: knowing him,  will speak when "needed"|pg||
nt|noodle:  does anyone play unusual vs unusual ?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|noodle:  Silver used to call K from Kx a journalist lead, cause if it works you can end up in the paper (of course here it was the unbid suit)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: won't make much difference though|pg||
nt|mwigor: hung does well trying to kill the diamond suit in dummy|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|pc|d5|pg||
nt|noodle:  I don t know if it s standard but when i pass a 1 level response partner can be sure I have a 3rd seat opener and act accordingly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: plus -- what can opponents do that is bad?   if they balance in @C  West knows about the 8-card fit|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|tejjyid: well, not me|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: if they balance in @H --- East would love to defend|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c5|pg||
nt|noodle:  a nice way to play it is to use 3@c as @hs weak or strong  3@d as spades weak or strong and 3 of a major as invitational|pg||
pc|d6|nt|noodle:  gives you 3 ranges of bids   has served me well|pg||

mb|p|nt|janm: 5@c looks like 3 keycards, 5@s asking for kings? Maybe on some step response system so that 6@c shows the spade K?|pg||

mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+   i think|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|andyv:  not sure what purpose 2@s served...in OR, S bid 3@d (puppet stayman) which makes more sense on this hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: curiously playing 4-suit transfers it is easier to make mild slam try when partner does NOT like your suit|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rodal f: No inverce here|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: i was wondering what Adam [Edgtton] was going to respond|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Although you'd be unlikely to bid 7@H as it needs a fair bit, like 3-2 trumps & @S not worse than 4-2|pg||

mb|p|nt|tejjyid: I Was assuming 1@S..|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mwigor: south opened 2@h in the other room and is declarer in 4@h|pg||
nt|mwigor: (presumably this showed some 2-suiter)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i don't know their NT response ranges -- suspect 1@C-2@C requires 5+@C|pg||

pc|d9|nt|mwigor: 3NT will fail so long as the defense gets it right|pg||
nt|tejjyid: tough bid for North|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I recall that 57% is the tipping point - it'd beclose to that|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|andyv:  cleverly avoiding the 5-4 @h fit|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: for most [many?] 2/1 players --  the 1@D response either denies 4+@H/@S or hand is strong enough to invite over a weak NT rebid|pg||
pc|h2|nt|noodle:  also note that south has has the 7@d for mosy hands  very important in junior bridge|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mwigor: hard to see how they could get it wrong in fact|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rodal f: If 2@C it normaly tell 5@C at W.      Anyhow it is the best force for check cards|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|tejjyid: I think that's more true of North America than AUstralia, although I'm not in the game much these days so it may have changed here|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Gosney responded with a transfer response of 1@S, so North never bid|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hK|nt|tejjyid: That was the bid I expected here - transfer responses very popular|pg||
nt|noodle:  in north america need high level events (top bracket KO or nationals) to be allowed methods like that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't think Adam is playing with any regular partners|pg||
nt|noodle:  very restrictive system laws here|pg||
nt|tejjyid: true, it's not a good method for the casual partnership|pg||
nt|noodle:  it is my opinion that such rules deter young people from the game|pg||
nt|noodle:  that s why it is so refreshing to have BBO|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Maybe - I think the need for restrictions is overstated but I see the argument|pg||
nt|noodle:  ( end of shameless plug )|pg||
nt|tejjyid: The problem is it's hard to test in a revenue neutral way|pg||

nt|ahollan1: not sure if DBL was 4+@S or 4/5@S [which is how the Italians play it]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in North America, the standard is  1m-(1@H)-DBL = exactly 4@S|pg||

nt|noodle:  y all those players tell us vulnerability doesn t matter and stop playing :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: My best controled slam was bidded by 15HP|pg||
nt|ahollan1: harder for North to PASS after partner opens strong 1N|pg||
nt|noodle:  and we go -1100 :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I found that the weak NT solves lot's of bidding problems, but it gves away a lot of information when it ISN"T opened (player is unblanaced) plus it's hard to compete sensibly ...|pg||

mb|p|nt|tejjyid: NOrth can try 2NT or 3NT|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: some might use it as Good/Bad  [so 3@C is better hand than 2N]|pg||
nt|noodle:  the method of using pass as 10+ balanced and transfers (starting with redouble) was suggested by Garozzo over a take out double and is gaining popularity|pg||
nt|tejjyid: pragmatic|pg||
pc|hT|nt|andyv:  could be but then 3@c would be alertable|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: thinks his hand is too good for 2@S rebid -- or maybe 2@D was a transfer advance?|pg||

nt|janm: Of course when dummy came down, an optimistic North would think that 4 was possible, until he saw the club position|pg||
nt|ahollan1: IFF Sartaj ruffs, it should be with 9 or Q -- but he might just pitch|pg||
nt|janm: Hans presumably debating whether to uppercut or whether his partner's heart return means that declarer still has a heart so he can ruff low. I think he'll eventually decide that ...|pg||
nt|janm: the @s 9 won't matter after he ruffs so he might as well ruff with it in case - or maybe it's right to ruff with the Q? In case partner had Jxx instead of J10x?|pg||
nt|janm: Wonder whether the play of the hearts gave him the count? Q was unnecessarily high at trick 2, so maybe showed 4?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just giving the other room a chance to catch up|pg||

nt|ahollan1: not really sure where Open Room auction went wrong -- maybe the 5@C bid over 4N was wrong Key Card response??|pg||
nt|tejjyid: either that or the trump Q was on East's mind|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: looks like it is a 2+C meaning for 1C opening|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|noodle:  2@D was probably GF checkback|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 4@C as a natural force seems to be wasting space - why not cue 3@D on the way?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Again, West is making the decision and doesn't have enough information|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hopefully 5@C = 1/4 Key Cards|pg||
pc|dT|pg||

nt|tejjyid: why would you disturb 2@D if you had correct information?|pg||

nt|andyv:  S is lucky... lack of entries to his hand will prevent him from messing up the @d suit|pg||

nt|janm: No -1700 here, just a tame 1NT - wonder how they got to 5@h? Or is it possible that this is really the score from 13?|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|pc|s4|pc|sA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm sure that will be corrected|pg||

pc|sK|pc|sQ|mc|10|nt|babs59: at least the choice of 5HX seemed impossible :)|pg||
nt|janm: So I take it we're predicting that the score we see here is wrong - do we know what really happened on 14?|pg||
nt|babs59: just 1NT I believe|pg||
nt|janm: So take 17 IMPs away from the Bloom score and we have a close match going into the fourth quarter|pg||
nt|babs59: 14 IMPs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other Gosney's pass of 2@H seems strange|pg||
nt|janm: Here Smirnov judged better than his counterpart in the other room, raising spades instead of going after hearts, and picks up some IMPs for his decision|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: back at 515pm|pg||
nt|ahollan1: spec points out  4 rounds of @C beats 4@S via uppercut|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: sniggering all round at the auction|pg||
pc|s4|nt|andyv:  another no substance hand... Ish hoping his pass would attract some action|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for the specs -- Ish could NOT RDBL to show points   it would show 4+@D  [transfers over 1@C and 1@C-DBL]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: learn more about the hand with PASS|pg||
nt|tejjyid: not often this pair will be in a partscorewith 24|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|andyv:  but he could have bid 3N immediately|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: and he probably wouldn't want to double to show points|pg||

pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: impressive stop|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c3|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|andyv:  I agree with his pass at this stage of match... you need to try to create something... otherwise I'd just bid 3N and get it over before opps can communicate.|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N!|mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|janm: There are lots of frustrating things that can happen when you're a vugraph operator, but I think the MOST frustrating is when the internet fails and you keep trying to get back on ...|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: ahhh   we've confirmed 2@C IS  2+|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: didn't think we'd get a 2nd look at the auction|pg||
nt|janm: Just in case we had any doubt about the alert to 2@c long ago, you were right, Al - it can be 2 clubs|pg||
nt|janm: And we now also know that this auction (1@s-1N-2@c-2@s) has a very wide range for this pair|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bart really is an improvement over that situation|pg||
nt|janm: yes, it is|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: andy that's a terrible pun|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  I need better wages to hire better writers, Mark|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think this 1@S might be @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: totally illegal, but tons of fun -- in a very casual dup game, we played one system if i was dealer, another if partner dealt  and opponent's card if they dealt|pg||
pc|cT|nt|tejjyid: that is lots of fun - shame that fee-for-al aproach can't be sustained in high level games|pg||
pc|c3|nt|noodle:  another oz spade ?|pg||

nt|mwigor: this will be a disappointing result for the kids - martin may not play again if the match is close|pg||
nt|noodle:  and there is a case for finessing @c after take out double|pg||
pc|dA|nt|tejjyid: a BIG case|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: most of Milne team was 2nd in 2010 NOT and Spring NOT  -- they're going to have to find new gear to break that streak|pg||

nt|sybarra: they have another half to go,    |pg||

nt|tejjyid: well, Milne had a MASSIVE third set yesterday, 84-11, sostand by after the break|pg||
