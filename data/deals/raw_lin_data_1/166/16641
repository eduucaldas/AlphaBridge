nt|fluffy: Javier Graupera is trying a psyche 2@s bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|pelu: u would open 4@S - so u sh be prepered for that hand :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: this catched Llluis Malla off guard|pg||
nt|fluffy: oh oh, Graupera in trouble|pg||
mb|2H|nt|fluffy: this is fun :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|fluffy: last hand of first set, 15 minutes break for you, and then we come back with another 12 boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: did S pass?????????????|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fluffy: uh ohhh|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|fluffy: and the psyche works!|pg||
nt|pelu: surprise attack: @DQ|pg||
nt|fluffy: 24 balanced again not worth a game|pg||
nt|fluffy: neither low heart not @hQ work on this hand|pg||
nt|fluffy: but @hA would at least prevent declarer from making 2 tricks on the suit|pg||
pc|h4|nt|fluffy: ohhh|pg||
nt|fluffy: but still needs to guess hearts|pg||
nt|pelu: a fall from grace :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|fluffy: Wow|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|fluffy: a good guess and 1 IMP win|pg||
pc|c8|nt|pelu: hi operator - did S pass?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|fluffy: you need to play penalty doubles of new suits after a preemptive opening|pg||
nt|fluffy: because psyches are much more common than other situations|pg||
pc|c3|nt|fluffy: with AQ10 if you ahve to lead the suit, you have to guess if you ahve no entry, but with a side entry I think @hA is the best lead|pg||
nt|fluffy: to catch any honnor singleton or doubleton in dummy|pg||

mb|p|nt|fluffy: Hi all This is the Open de Cataluña tournament played in Barcelona|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|fluffy: this match features Juanito Pont and Javier Graupera (NS) one of the best and most succesful pairs in Spain all time against Xavi Massana and Norberto Bocchi, not a regular pair as ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: long as I know|pg||
mb|1S|nt|fluffy: they are confirming me now, Javier Graupera actually passed 1@s with 20 HCP on board 1 on the last set and collected +150 only|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|fluffy: I think East opened a multi 2@d showing a weak in a major hand or 22-23 balanced|pg||
nt|fluffy: or maybe 2@d is just GF hand|pg||
nt|fluffy: 1@s might be artificial|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|fluffy: 2NT is a balanced hand|pg||
nt|fluffy: 3@h is a transfer bid showing spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|fluffy: 1@s is I think Brazilian style, showing a forcing 1NT hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: this is the only way to show 10-11 HCP support for hearts|pg||
nt|fluffy: if Llluis opted for showing spades he would have to force to game|pg||
mb|5S|nt|fluffy: and Xavi now bis 3NT as choice of games|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: 2D its For.|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: 23+|pg||
nt|fluffy: Norberto picks 3NT with his stiff spade|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: thank you|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fluffy: some might be surprised by the decision of Norberto to show a balanced hand|pg||
nt|fluffy: it is a very common "lie" to show a balanced hand with 4441 and 5431 with a stiff King or Ace|pg||
nt|fluffy: the reason is that showing your shape, specially 4441 across as well as strenght is very complicated, takes 3 rounds of bidding, and in the end partner is unsure if you have 18 or ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: 23|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|fluffy: Nacho only has 11 HCP,but he goes for game, 6-4 hands only require the correct 18 HCP to make game (@hAKQ @dAKQ), this is just a dream hand, but actually with a 6-4 hand you might ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: make game with a lot less than 25 HCP|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|fluffy: but when you just go with the balanced approach you define your hand in 1 bid|pg||
nt|fluffy: or something very close to it :)|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||

nt|fluffy: Walter Johnson will soon join the comentators "team" (that is me at the moment), thx a lot Walter|pg||
nt|bigtrain: ga/e :)|pg||
nt|fluffy: this requires to trust partner's spade count with a lot of faith|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|fluffy: A superb result on previous board by EW thx to the unlucky diamond lead from south|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|bigtrain: even without the @D lead it looked like they would be able to scramble 9 tricks and only had 4 losers|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: but the @D lead surely put declarer at ease|pg||
nt|fluffy: at the other table Bocchi found the @sA duck but his partner slipped a bit in the endgame not puling trumps|pg||
pc|h6|nt|fluffy: declarer "should" missguess clubs|pg||
pc|h5|nt|fluffy: yes, to defeat it it would be needed some perfect defence, winning @sA on first round wich is almost impossible from the bidding|pg||
pc|h9|nt|bigtrain: looks like declarer will lose the race to 7 here|pg||
nt|fluffy: graupera makes an agressive switch now, clubs would be great if partner had @cA or @cJ, but sadly he has neither this time|pg||
nt|bigtrain: he may even go -2|pg||
nt|fluffy: the proper way to play @cKJ10x vs @cAxxx or @cAJ10x vs @cKxxx is to play the lonely top honnor first|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|fluffy: and then finese the queen by low to 10 or jack|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pelu: would u play @D4 or @D10 from that holding?|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
nt|fluffy: why? because if you play a force finese by winning @cA and running the @cJ, you only make 3 tricks if the suit breaks 4-1|pg||
nt|bigtrain: that's looking at the suit in isolation of course...  other information may (and usually does) indicate a different path|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c9|nt|fluffy: if hearts were 4-3 south would be squeezed and the contract might make, but as it is NS have 7 easy tricks|pg||
nt|fluffy: declarer did the right thing to go on spades, if e tries a diamond adventure he loses another trick|pg||
nt|fluffy: Yes as you can see, declarer started the hand by palying hearts|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|pg||
pc|hT|pc|d2|pc|hQ|pc|h4|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|fluffy: yes more or less, EW play some gadgets|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fluffy: like gazilli and some other stuff I am not very familiar with|pg||
nt|fluffy: Javier graupera opts for a normal 1NT but it is also possible to pass 1@D and let them play them (perhaps doubled) wich might bring a lot of points|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|bigtrain: 2@D is 4th suit forcing...  most play it GF|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d8|pc|dQ|nt|fluffy: 4th suit foricing is a very common convention, when the auctio begins with suit-suit-suit now if responder bids the 4th suit at the lowest possible level it is a conventional bid ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: that shows strenght|pg||
nt|bigtrain: at this color, i have to admit seriously considering going for the throat  :)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|fluffy: and asks further|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|nt|bigtrain: that really happened?|pg||
nt|fluffy: Bocchi had a great hand for clubs, I am a bit surprised by his 3NT pick|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|pg||
nt|bigtrain: norby has quite a reputation :)|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|pc|hA|nt|fluffy: obviously he doesn't know that partner has @d singleton instead of the more likelly @h singleton, but if he investigates the worst that can happen is that he plays 5@c|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|h8|nt|fluffy: yeah me too, I'd definetelly do it with @dKJ942, but I probably wouldn't with @dKJ742, with @dKJ842 its the critical for me, but I would do it as well|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|d2|pg||

pc|dK|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|bigtrain: it's also important to set the tone in long matches...  let them know you will penalize light intervention and they will be less apt to intervene|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sT|pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
nt|bigtrain: also, it's very likely he's facing short @D since without any stopper help since 2NT is such a convienent bid in the auction|pg||

mb|1H|nt|pelu: ok slam again|pg||
nt|fluffy: this time for NS|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|fluffy: Javier Graupera uses the Jacoby convention, where 2NT shows a hand with heart support and strenght (invitational or game forcing, depending on partnership agreements)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|fluffy: 4@d is a splinter bid, after a fit is stablished, jumping in another suit shows some slam interests and also shortness (singleton or void) in the suit jumped|pg||

mb|2N|nt|fluffy: this is probably unknown for anyone not from Bacelnoa|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: now Juan Pont identifies what keycards he is missing, he is missing only 2: @hA and @cA, if partner had both, 7@h could be made|pg||
nt|fluffy: 2@c is range stayman|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|6N|nt|fluffy: 3@c shows a maximum with at least 1 4 card major|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fluffy: you can say it Peter, it is an awful convention lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: normally when all you are missing is aces it is time for blackwood, but the problem is the @sA, if partner has it, there is no way to know after blackwood if the ace(s) he shows ...|pg||

pc|d2|nt|fluffy: my best guess is that 2@c is the XYZ convention also known as 2-way checkback|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|pg||
nt|fluffy: 2@c forces partner to bid 2@d, it might be 2 types of hands: a hand that wants to play 2@d, or any hand with 10-11 points that is gonna invite to game|pg||
nt|pelu: when your partner open in your singleton u sh not press so hard|pg||

nt|pelu: a lot of action from West on a hand where many would pass first time|pg||
nt|fluffy: this is very common in barcelona, and that might explain west's unnusual bidding|pg||
nt|fluffy: the 1@d opening means 1@c can be often be opened on 2@c, for examplo with any 4@d 2@c hand|pg||

nt|pelu: on way to 4@S (making)|pg||
nt|fluffy: its up to partnership agreements, but if yo have a shapelly hand that wants to invite to 4@s over 1NT the proper bid is 2NT|pg||
nt|fluffy: 2@c is the duri-fit convention showing 10-11 HCP (maximum for a passed hand) and support for partner's major|pg||
nt|fluffy: 2@d is a relaty bid, and that's where I bet their agreements end|pg||

nt|pelu: very few swings in this half - and no expensive misunderstandings by EW - but some defensive problems|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|d5|nt|pelu: I like the 4@S opening in OR - |pg||

pc|sQ|pc|h2|pc|s4|nt|fluffy: whenever the auction prceeds 1x open-2y overcall-pass-pass you should try to reopen the hand with a doubl whenever its possiblem adn never pass with a singleton on their suit, nor ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: with a low doubleton I'd say|pg||
nt|fluffy: yes 4@s was a good decision|pg||
nt|fluffy: I can't blame NS for playing 5@c|pg||
nt|fluffy: -1100 looks by a lot I didn't analyce the play, maybe 800 were possible but still a disaster|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|dT|nt|pelu: 5@C is a gamble - "all inn" on a mediuym hand :)|pg||
nt|fluffy: I know I would also bid 5@c hehe|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|pelu: for sure I will open 4@S against you :)|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|fluffy: but it depends on your opponents I guess, my normal opponents when they open 4@s they have an 8 card suit with few values, not 3 defensive tricks hehe|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s7|pc|s3|nt|pelu: @S3 = for me values in C|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|h5|pc|d8|nt|fluffy: yes, for me too|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|h6|nt|fluffy: but he has shown @sAK|pg||
pc|dK|pc|c7|nt|fluffy: he cannot have @cK also|pg||
