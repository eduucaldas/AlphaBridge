mb|2H|nt|fluffy: 2@h es un "cajón desastre" es una voz que puede ser cualqueir cosa sin fuerza para dar un nuevo palo, o saltar|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cJ|nt|fluffy: 3@h is not my preferred bid, I'd rather bid 2NT showing invitational balanced hand without support|pg||
nt|fluffy: north's 4@h is an overbid, but I suspect he wasn't sure if 3@h was foricng or not, because Graupera's usual partner is juan pont, not Creuheras|pg||

nt|pelu: we missed Board 13 from start|pg||
nt|fluffy: Javier Graupera is trying a psyche 2@s bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: hard to beat the other room here|pg||
mb|2C|nt|pelu: u would open 4@S - so u sh be prepered for that hand :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: this catched Llluis Malla off guard|pg||
nt|fluffy: oh oh, Graupera in trouble|pg||
nt|fluffy: NS had a missunderstanding that led to a cold contract|pg||
mb|2D|nt|fluffy: this is fun :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|fluffy: last hand of first set, 15 minutes break for you, and then we come back with another 12 boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: did S pass?????????????|pg||
mb|2S|nt|fluffy: 2@s is not natural because 1NT denied 4 spades|pg||
nt|fluffy: so it means... something else|pg||
nt|rodal f: Txs all the I got the possibility to comment here. Nice inputs from some of u.|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: uh ohhh|pg||
mb|2N|nt|fluffy: and the psyche works!|pg||
nt|pelu: surprise attack: @DQ|pg||
nt|fluffy: 24 balanced again not worth a game|pg||
nt|fluffy: neither low heart not @hQ work on this hand|pg||
nt|fluffy: but @hA would at least prevent declarer from making 2 tricks on the suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: ohhh|pg||
nt|fluffy: but still needs to guess hearts|pg||
nt|pelu: a fall from grace :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: Wow|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: a good guess and 1 IMP win|pg||
pc|s4|nt|pelu: hi operator - did S pass?|pg||
nt|fluffy: on the end NS did the right thing to stay away from this awful game|pg||
pc|sK|nt|fluffy: you need to play penalty doubles of new suits after a preemptive opening|pg||
nt|fluffy: because psyches are much more common than other situations|pg||
pc|sA|nt|fluffy: with AQ10 if you ahve to lead the suit, you have to guess if you ahve no entry, but with a side entry I think @hA is the best lead|pg||
nt|fluffy: to catch any honnor singleton or doubleton in dummy|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s3|nt|pelu: or are we playing 1@sX|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|pg||
nt|fluffy: but with every red suit 3-3, @dK onside and @s 4-4 there is no way to go down on 3NT, nor 4@h, not even 5@d|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|sQ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|fluffy: perhaps south was distracted|pg||
nt|rodal f: If u have 9 it's right to bid it Gonzalo:) Else....|pg||
pc|s7|nt|fluffy: or operator was distracted and north took an agressive pass|pg||
nt|pelu: still trying to count all his HCP :)|pg||
nt|fluffy: I wasn't paying atention did north hesitate before passing out?|pg||
pc|c4|pc|sJ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|rodal f: Needed only a @D hook 3-3 and 9 on so 50%|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|pelu: ???|pg||
pc|cA|nt|fluffy: some mistakes on the board, for sure, we will find out what really happened after the break|pg||
nt|fluffy: see you all in 15 minutes|pg||

mb|p|nt|fluffy: Hi all This is the Open de Cataluña tournament played in Barcelona|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|fluffy: this match features Juanito Pont and Javier Graupera (NS) one of the best and most succesful pairs in Spain all time against Xavi Massana and Norberto Bocchi, not a regular pair as ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: long as I know|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: they are confirming me now, Javier Graupera actually passed 1@s with 20 HCP on board 1 on the last set and collected +150 only|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|fluffy: I think East opened a multi 2@d showing a weak in a major hand or 22-23 balanced|pg||
nt|fluffy: or maybe 2@d is just GF hand|pg||
nt|fluffy: 1@s might be artificial|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fluffy: 2NT is a balanced hand|pg||
nt|fluffy: 3@h is a transfer bid showing spades|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|nt|fluffy: 1@s is I think Brazilian style, showing a forcing 1NT hand|pg||
pc|c7|nt|fluffy: this is the only way to show 10-11 HCP support for hearts|pg||
nt|fluffy: if Llluis opted for showing spades he would have to force to game|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|fluffy: and Xavi now bis 3NT as choice of games|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: 2D its For.|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: 23+|pg||
nt|fluffy: Norberto picks 3NT with his stiff spade|pg||
pc|c6|nt|fluffy: thank you|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|pc|c5|pg||
pc|cA|nt|fluffy: some might be surprised by the decision of Norberto to show a balanced hand|pg||
nt|fluffy: it is a very common "lie" to show a balanced hand with 4441 and 5431 with a stiff King or Ace|pg||
nt|fluffy: the reason is that showing your shape, specially 4441 across as well as strenght is very complicated, takes 3 rounds of bidding, and in the end partner is unsure if you have 18 or ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: 23|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|fluffy: Nacho only has 11 HCP,but he goes for game, 6-4 hands only require the correct 18 HCP to make game (@hAKQ @dAKQ), this is just a dream hand, but actually with a 6-4 hand you might ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: make game with a lot less than 25 HCP|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c9|pg||
nt|fluffy: but when you just go with the balanced approach you define your hand in 1 bid|pg||
nt|fluffy: or something very close to it :)|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|sA|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|fluffy: saly for him partner had zero points in his suits, not even @h10 wich would be enough to make game after a non trump lead|pg||

mb|3H|nt|fluffy: wellcome Bernard|pg||
nt|fluff: hola :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|fluffy: NS have no clear agreements as we saw on firs board, and Creueras doesn't know yet hot to force in spades|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|fluff: phantom save at the other table|pg||
mb|5C|nt|fluffy: he has stablished a diamond fit that seems to work well to aboid a diakaond lead|pg||

mc|11|nt|fluff: psychic|pg||
nt|fluffy: tehy don't have agreements|pg||
nt|ferlema: esta es una mano donde si N/S huybieran subastado correctamente se hubieran dado cuenta que faltaba el control en el palo de @D|pg||
nt|fluffy: so he just bid whatever forcing|pg||
nt|fluffy: probably 2Nt would be natural|pg||
nt|fluff: no Jacoby 2nt ?|pg||
pg||
qx|c15|st||md|1SQJT75HKJ7DQJ65CA,S2H98542DAT97CK42,SAK98643HAQD83C53,SHT63DK42CQJT9876|sv|n|nt|bigtrain: '|pg||
nt|fluffy: Walter Johnson will soon join the comentators "team" (that is me at the moment), thx a lot Walter|pg||
nt|bigtrain: ga/e :)|pg||
nt|fluffy: this requires to trust partner's spade count with a lot of faith|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|5C|nt|fluffy: A superb result on previous board by EW thx to the unlucky diamond lead from south|pg||
mb|5S|mb|6C|nt|bigtrain: even without the @D lead it looked like they would be able to scramble 9 tricks and only had 4 losers|pg||
mb|6S|mb|7C|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: but the @D lead surely put declarer at ease|pg||
nt|fluffy: at the other table Bocchi found the @sA duck but his partner slipped a bit in the endgame not puling trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: declarer "should" missguess clubs|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|fluffy: yes, to defeat it it would be needed some perfect defence, winning @sA on first round wich is almost impossible from the bidding|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bigtrain: looks like declarer will lose the race to 7 here|pg||
nt|fluffy: graupera makes an agressive switch now, clubs would be great if partner had @cA or @cJ, but sadly he has neither this time|pg||
nt|bigtrain: he may even go -2|pg||
nt|fluffy: the proper way to play @cKJ10x vs @cAxxx or @cAJ10x vs @cKxxx is to play the lonely top honnor first|pg||
pc|sA|nt|fluffy: and then finese the queen by low to 10 or jack|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|pelu: would u play @D4 or @D10 from that holding?|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|pc|h8|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|favallu: hola a todos|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d4|pc|dJ|nt|fluffy: why? because if you play a force finese by winning @cA and running the @cJ, you only make 3 tricks if the suit breaks 4-1|pg||
nt|bigtrain: that's looking at the suit in isolation of course...  other information may (and usually does) indicate a different path|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|fluff: l|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|fluffy: hey Peter nice to see you again :)|pg||

nt|pelu: tx|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|fluffy: and Walter :) I was feeling lonely here|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
pc|d3|nt|fluffy: if hearts were 4-3 south would be squeezed and the contract might make, but as it is NS have 7 easy tricks|pg||
nt|fluffy: declarer did the right thing to go on spades, if e tries a diamond adventure he loses another trick|pg||
nt|fluffy: Yes as you can see, declarer started the hand by palying hearts|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|d7|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s5|pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
nt|fluffy: the reason this time is, that you want to knock out north's entry if he has one before touching clubs|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s3|pc|cJ|pc|s7|pg||
pc|cT|pc|sT|pc|h4|pc|s4|pg||
pc|c9|nt|bigtrain: i tend to lead low from 5+card suits and the honor sequences from shorter ones (to avoid blockage problems)|pg||
nt|favallu: que se puede decir de esta subasta, muy valiente y buena ,  por parte de Ventin la voz de 5@C, la de 7, es mas dudosa|pg||

mb|p|nt|fluffy: ventin was very agressive on the other room, as he uses to, this time unsuccessfully|pg||
nt|fluff: here slam if u find the spades|pg||
mb|2H|nt|fluff: sorry no slam|pg||
nt|ferlema: hola Bernard|pg||

nt|fluff: ok|pg||

nt|ferlema: Para quienes no conocen a Bernard, él es un excelente escritor y ha publicado una serie increible de cuentos de bridge|pg||
nt|fluff: here u can have a nice agreement : 4h can say = i have sp and h, no controls in the minors, no sing either|pg||
nt|ferlema: pueden acceder a todos ellos tanto en ingles como en castellano haciendo click aqui: http://www.confsudbridge.org/hits/brbm000.aspx|pg||

nt|ferlema: N/S solo ganan 11 bazas|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ferlema: se puede apreciar que se pierde el @D A y una baza de @S|pg||
nt|fluffy: now north has UI issues|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluff: right fluffy|pg||
mb|5C|nt|favallu: do|pg||
mb|p|nt|ferlema: quizas hubiera sido mejor 3@H y no 4@H|pg||
mb|5D|nt|fluffy: since he doens't know what 4@s is (it might be a cuebid or natural) he just bids 5@c cuebid and lets partner bid whatever|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|nt|fluffy: but partner is a bad guy and bids 5@d back lol|pg||
nt|fluff: for those who are wondering, fluff and fluffy; no agreement before; the Y in fluffy says he is much better than me :)|pg||
nt|fluffy: he finally took 4@s as a cuebid|pg||
mb|p|nt|ferlema: serán 11 IMPs mas para LLopart|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: one of the most annoying things on this game is to lose 22 IMPs or more because a finese is bad, or because a suit splits 3-1 instaad of 2-2 on a slam|pg||
nt|favallu: don t they play any kind of splinter? and if splinter is limited, any minisplinter, and when south bids his singleton, north stps just in game,,,, many lost points in  @C|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|mb|4C|nt|fluffy: like gazilli and some other stuff I am not very familiar with|pg||
nt|fluffy: Javier graupera opts for a normal 1NT but it is also possible to pass 1@D and let them play them (perhaps doubled) wich might bring a lot of points|pg||
mb|p|nt|favallu: 2nt parece un jacoby , eso si, con semifallo....|pg||
mb|4H|nt|bigtrain: 2@D is 4th suit forcing...  most play it GF|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fluffy: 4th suit foricing is a very common convention, when the auctio begins with suit-suit-suit now if responder bids the 4th suit at the lowest possible level it is a conventional bid ...|pg||

nt|bigtrain: at this color, i have to admit seriously considering going for the throat  :)|pg||

nt|rodal f: Am to quick with TV at left side. Right u are and I was:)|pg||

nt|pelu: 1@S pro 2-3 @ss|pg||
nt|fluffy: these transfer bids normally allow NS to bid with more hands, since they can now double of bid 1@s, however when you have no agreements and have fear of missunderstading you ...|pg||

pc|cA|nt|fluffy: my best guess is that 2@c is the XYZ convention also known as 2-way checkback|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|pg||
nt|fluffy: 2@c forces partner to bid 2@d, it might be 2 types of hands: a hand that wants to play 2@d, or any hand with 10-11 points that is gonna invite to game|pg||
nt|pelu: when your partner open in your singleton u sh not press so hard|pg||
pc|d5|nt|fluffy: 3@d shows an invitational hand with diamonds, and no interest on playing in spades, so exactly 4@s|pg||

nt|fluffy: maybe captain said that they needed to squeeze every posibility and tire the opponents|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: we probably have some vugraf operator types on the play of last board, nevermind, 3@d after a non trump lead must make 9 tricks|pg||

mb|2N|nt|fluffy: they play 5 card diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: 1@d openingis 5+ @d for NS|pg||
nt|pelu: a lot of action from West on a hand where many would pass first time|pg||
nt|fluffy: this is very common in barcelona, and that might explain west's unnusual bidding|pg||
nt|fluffy: the 1@d opening means 1@c can be often be opened on 2@c, for examplo with any 4@d 2@c hand|pg||
nt|pelu: so 1@c could be a sigleton - but not after 1@S|pg||
nt|rodal f: Waited that 2NT|pg||
nt|fluffy: so 1@c can be 2 cards often|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: surprised by the 3NT rebid, most partnerships show 18-19 balanced with 2NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: I hardly ever play against this system, so I am not sure how common is west's approach|pg||
pc|d8|nt|fluffy: not as much as singleton, cos 4441 opens 1@d also, but low doubleton yes|pg||
nt|fluffy: 2NT is fine, but why didn't west raise diamonds?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Had his minimum12HP but we need to ask W.|pg||
nt|fluffy: might he try to sneack a heart trick before trying clubs?|pg||
nt|fluffy: thx Allan, yes indeed, it seems that 4@h is completelly cold as the cards lie|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or do 1@D promisse minimum 4@D by there system, 1@C +2|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|pelu: and - as I see - no way to 9 tricks with @Hs 4-1|pg||
nt|fluffy: the best Pont can do is go 1 off after a club lead|pg||
nt|fluffy: worst for him is that 4@h on the other side might only lose 1@h 1@c and 1@D|pg||

mb|p|nt|fluffy: his spades were a bit lousy, might he have though that 2@s "oculd" maybe be real?|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|fluffy: better to avoid temptations here, the hand looks very good, but as the cards lie 5@s is down|pg||
nt|fluffy: oh well didn't expect a 1NT overcall with @sKx|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: that is something I would never do, I don't like playing NT when I win first trick but the opponents have 4-5 tricks ready for the next time they get in|pg||
nt|pelu: most players would X in East 3 "suirs" to play - and 4 card @h|pg||
nt|fluffy: 1@s alerted?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|fluffy: or drury sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: doubling instead with good support for all the other suits is IMO superior, but obviously Norberto is better than me, so who knows|pg||
nt|pelu: why not 2NT by W = both minors????|pg||
mb|3S|nt|fluffy: becasue it would be one level higher probably|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fluffy: I don't really understand what Graupera is up to|pg||
nt|pelu: could be playing in 5-2 with 5-4 in @C - for sure I would bid 2Nt in West|pg||
nt|pelu: on way to 4@S (making)|pg||
nt|fluffy: its up to partnership agreements, but if yo have a shapelly hand that wants to invite to 4@s over 1NT the proper bid is 2NT|pg||
nt|fluffy: 2@c is the duri-fit convention showing 10-11 HCP (maximum for a passed hand) and support for partner's major|pg||
nt|fluffy: 2@d is a relaty bid, and that's where I bet their agreements end|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR only 10 tricks - decl played on a non-chance|pg||
mb|p|pc|hT|nt|fluffy: when opponents open or overcall a strong NT, you can use the 2NT bid as a cuebid when partner shows a suit|pg||
nt|pelu: depend on system agreements - many would X first|pg||
pc|h2|nt|fluffy: I think Fernandez downgraded @hK|pg||
nt|fluffy: with his hand with no opposition the normal bid is 4@s vulnerable at IMPs|pg||
nt|rodal f: If 3@C was positive trail E had for a.....|pg||
nt|fluffy: but having @hK under the 2@h bidder is bad news normally|pg||
pc|hA|nt|fluffy: yes, but it doesn't take much imagination to construct a hand where 1NT X makes and so does 4@s|pg||
nt|pelu: u can also use 2NT as minors from S|pg||
nt|fluffy: constructing a hand consisten with west passing 1NTX will be a lot tougher though|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|fluffy: 3@s is in no danger, but 4@s requires to guess diamonds|pg||
nt|rodal f: Normaly Y. Still E have to take the trail ask if it was that|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s8|pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
nt|pelu: but now NS have preblems|pg||
nt|fluffy: you can play the suits in 2 ways to score 1 trick, either low to the king, or run the @dJ|pg||
pc|s2|nt|fluffy: this makes double dummy|pg||
nt|fluffy: but requires verty precise timing|pg||
nt|fluffy: you have to cross ruff all the minors|pg||
nt|fluffy: and then put East in with @sK|pg||
nt|fluffy: but from the bidding is is a possible play|pg||
nt|pelu: S has shown are better hand - but N know that East has @SK so vewry agresssive to go for slam with 5@D|pg||
nt|fluffy: yes, and, what is 5@d anyway? shouldn't it be 5@c?|pg||
nt|fluffy: declarer was looking for something amazing on Open room, I am too lazy today to try to igure out what|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|s5|pg||
nt|fluffy: anyway, note that the key for this hand is to use dummy's entrys properly|pg||
nt|fluffy: ye sit was a trial ask, east decided to go with the low road this time, wich is not normal, because he is a very agressive player|pg||
nt|rodal f: Still though. 4@S is down with a @C lead|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|fluffy: sorry, thx netto for pointing out, obviously on a @c lead 4@s goes down if defence finds the @hA entry|pg||
pc|sK|pc|d5|nt|fluffy: cos then they ruff a club, and even 2 down is possible then|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|fluffy: good start|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@D is not in my book :)|pg||
nt|pelu: snd easy ride in OE after a @h-lead|pg||
