nt|odysseus69: 3S looks normal then 4D|pg||
nt|jcwla: N could just compete with 3@S, but would not be shocking to see a game try or even a blast.|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: A quick blast is OK since oppo liable to take the "save" - this will end in 4D now I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzwc: www.ibf-festival.org for the Israeli bridge festival  that starts in 5 days|pg||
nt|odysseus69: try was bad idea I think - and slow 4S will hear a double|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: many Juniors tend to bid slowly|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 4D now clear|pg||
nt|jcwla: If the direct 2@S over the X showed a not so great raise, it is conceivable for S to have gone up as it would then be on the high end.|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzwb: Schwartz thought of X but then he looked at his hand and saw zero defence against 6@D so he passed |pg||

mb|p|nt|robbg:  I don't love the 4@h bid. When partner hits your 5 card suit, it would seem prudent to stay there (or raise).|pg||

nt|yuval10: but we'll have to wait for the final results to get confirmation|pg||
nt|vugraphzwb: And on a club lead he is lucky A@H is not on West hand|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|robbg:  Certainly reasonable to rebid 1NT, but if that is partnership style, then South should pattern out.|pg||
nt|yuval10: so that'll be all, thanks Ronpa for the excellent operating  from the event!|pg||
nt|robbg:  We saw some very good bridge here, a real pleasure.|pg||
