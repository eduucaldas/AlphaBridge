nt|mrdct: hi everyone|pg||
nt|sybarra: DelMonte know as "ish" |pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: looks like a dull 4S for EW although 12 tricks can be made with the favourable diamond position|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mrdct: EW play a variant of the fantunes system|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: hi all e/w are playing fantunes|pg||
mb|d|mb|r|nt|mrdct: 1@h presumedly a transfer to @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: *known as "|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|sybarra: and our mates at the other table (in 2nd half) said "all they did was open 1 @C everyhand" |pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|peachy: We'll get settled here shortly, welcome back everybody.  http://www.summerfestivalofbridge.com/index.php|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: if they got to 6, declarer would have a 50-50 guess -- whether to play for DJ singleton with north or DK singleton with south|pg||
mb|p|pc|hT|pc|hQ|nt|marcsmith: my guess is 1 IMP to BROWN|pg||
nt|mrdct: EW play a weak 1NT opening, so the 1NT rebid is usually strong|pg||
nt|caitlin: @D transfer to @Hs|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mrdct: good start for EW as 3NT looks to be a superior contract to 4@s|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|mrdct: although both appear to make comfortably today|pg||
pc|d6|nt|marcsmith: at the other table they played from West and north led his singleton, solving declarer's problems in the suit|pg||
nt|marcsmith: draw trumps and play ace and another diamond looks like a normal line here|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|dA|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mrdct: 11 tricks should roll home now as declarer will never have to touch @C|pg||

pc|c7|pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: grand time|pg||
nt|sybarra: just sit back here we go |pg||
nt|vugrapha1: bid in the closed|pg||
nt|t 2: Team Milne had a deep run last year in this event only to lose the final, i'm hoping they can do one better this year|pg||

nt|t 2: wow|pg||
nt|t 2: 7nt?|pg||

mb|3C|nt|rodal f: At least the Hung hand is good enough for @H and 9 tricks. Just miss some HP beside:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|sybarra: not a high card point,  just playing strength |pg||
mb|p|mb|7N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|t 2: one of the nicer problems you will get in bridge having the north hand opposite a 2c opening|pg||

mb|p|nt|marcsmith: EW can make 2C NS a couple of either major |pg||
nt|nickf: can we have player names please|pg||
nt|janm:  Sorry to be a little late - I just got a new computer and it isn't playing well with the Windows BBO client|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mrdct: Klinger won the South-West Pacific Teams which finished a couple of hours ago and is the top qualifier to the National Open Teams finals|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Im trying to find them out|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: EW have the majority of HCP but  shapes run wild|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mrdct: this match is from the top section of the draw, whereby the loser gets a second chance|pg||
nt|mrdct: EW could be in trouble here but vulnerability is on their side|pg||
nt|ahollan1: favorable vulnerability = bid 'em up!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm:  I'll try not to get too confused using the web version :)|pg||
nt|janm:  In the other room, East bid 3@s over the takeout DBL of 2@s - here, with East passing, we may see NS declare.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: And West too is yet another refugee from Sauron's Middle Earth|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|mrdct: 3NT for NS is touch and go|pg||
nt|janm:  I'm guessing that 2NT is some sort of Lebensohl, asking his partner to bid 3@c and showing a non-constructive hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Andrew specs and vug boss:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Rodal  |pg||
mb|4N|nt|marcsmith: heart lead a spade switch is best for the defence -- not obvious to find tho|pg||
nt|rodal f: Shirly:)@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: only has 8 obvious tricks but the defence could falter and present a @s trick for delcarer before getting to their 5 tricks|pg||
mb|5S|nt|ahollan1: can Thompson find the double hook in @C for the make??|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm:  Most of us play Lebensohl after a T/O DBL of a weak 2 bid, but not everyone does in this auction - in fact, maybe here S is playing Lebensohl and N isn't|pg||
mb|5N|nt|janm:  Although N certainly has a good hand and good support for clubs and spade stoppers, so maybe he bid 3NT on the theory that 9 tricks would be as easy in NT as in clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|nickf: Can we have the player names please?|pg||
mb|7H|mb|p|mb|7N|nt|mrdct: if delcarer plays on @s himself it will need to be a low @s to the 9|pg||
nt|mrdct: although actually low to Q will also work if he drops the J on the 2nd round of @s|pg||
nt|rodal f: Seems as 9 will come by the  auto|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|janm:  On this hand, I think he's going to be wrong - with no club spots so that West doesn't even have to hold off to have the clubs stopped (although surely he will duck here) - there isn't much of a source of tricks in NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: what he doesn't want to do is cash @d first as that could very easily set up the 5th defensive trick|pg||
nt|mrdct: choosing to win is hand looks like he's planning to go after @s immediately|pg||

nt|ahollan1: nicely done|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: there are only a few of us in the room so if there's something special you want to discuss -- just holler|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: multi  (wk in one major) and N is sure which it is|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mrdct: Alex Smirnov is a regular on the german open team and the welland team in US nationals|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i believe 2@D=artifiicial game force|pg||
nt|rodal f: NT not the best idea EW|pg||
mb|2S|nt|janm:  Will our West be able to restrain himself from bidding 3NT with all those spade stoppers and not much else? No|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: he has been a regular visitor to the main australian summer events in recent years - particularly Youth Week|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H = 4+ hcp, no good suit|pg||
nt|tejjyid: tough fro East 3@C an underbid, but what is better?|pg||
nt|rodal f: I was wrong. @D blocked when W have the NT|pg||
mb|3H|nt|nickf: -------------------------------------------------->   Can you please put the player names in?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|mrdct: south worth a raise now given that he passed 1st round|pg||
nt|mrdct: north has quite a good hand with some game prospects even opposite a very weak hand|pg||
nt|janm:  Now we'll get to see whether NS can do as well here as in the other room. Looks as if they need to get clubs going, but they do have all those aces, so should manage the club shift when it becomes obvious that spades are pretty hopeless|pg||
nt|sybarra: nervous about the stiff @D for sure|pg||
nt|rodal f: The best Andrew is to have it nice at home:) Just home now after a week seminar.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marcsmith: a heart lead or switch forces declarer to guess the clubs, but he can afford a wrong guess on a spade continuation|pg||
nt|mrdct: but he will anticipate that communication will likely be a problem|pg||
nt|mrdct: even more so with dummy a 4333|pg||
nt|janm:  Which red suit do you attack first?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: the players in the NOT [national open teams]  qualified for the event via a 14-round swiss event called the SWPT|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: Klinger won that event after gaining the lead in round 3 or 4 [and never looked back]|pg||
nt|peachy: E wants a diamond lead, I assume|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: back to back 5@D contracts   you won't see that often -- especially in non-imp games|pg||
pc|c3|nt|marcsmith: now he has to guess the clubs again|pg||
nt|peachy: this is a challenging hand to make, but not impossible|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|mrdct: at the risk of some differing views, i would say that EW have been quite easily the top pair in Victoria for the past 5 years or so|pg||
nt|janm:  I guess hearts, since then perhaps it won't be clear to the defenders which minor they want to play. Maybe heart to the ten, ducked, second heart won, now will N know to shift to clubs? |pg||
nt|raghavan: since South has checks in both Majors( whatever is 2D), North might have tried DJ - |pg||
pc|h6|nt|janm:  Even if he doesn't though, S can hold up the diamond ace and declarer only has 4 hearts, 1 spade and 1 diamond before he has to give up a black ace.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Whar's best? @C 2-2 + Qdrop single or play N for QXX. Not best I've seen.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|peachy: But I believe Justin would make it.  Has to avoid giving too many natural spade tricks to the opponents|pg||
pc|s7|pc|h3|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: wow -- i just noticed that the other room played 10@D on last hand -- so 4 imps to Bloom|pg||
pc|cK|nt|timb: As a commentator, I'm not a fan of the 3@H but I can't imagine not bidding 3@H at the table|pg||
nt|timb: it's also known as being a "result merchant" :)|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|nt|timb: Edgtton has done well! North cannot have @CK and he has nine tricks|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|mrdct: 4@h was surely going to be at least one off and i think this will come up a trick short|pg||
nt|peachy: I think S hand is a bit too good and suit oriented for 2NT opening|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: that is a fun event to watch  and i'm told fun to attend/play|pg||
nt|mwigor: its the best event in the australian calendar|pg||

nt|mwigor: if you're coming from overseas - come for a couple of months and play both - seeing the sights in between|pg||
nt|ahollan1: web site for Yeh Bros  is   http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest.html|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other match, through 18 of 32 boards,  Milne 65  Tishler 41|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: that team of youngsters [Milne] did very well in 2010    don't quote me, but i think 2nd in both this NOT [after winning the qualifying] and the Spring NOT|pg||
nt|sybarra: ugh|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|cA|nt|tejjyid: maybe the @S Q would have avoided that, but East's defence is very optimistic|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|mrdct: ben might regret that @d shift now that a @c is going to go on the @SQ|pg||
nt|mrdct: but smirnov can't deal with all of his @h losers so this can't possibly make|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|pc|s8|nt|ahollan1: NS use upside-down count and attitude |pg||
nt|ahollan1: but we'll need smoother play for that info to matter to us|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|pc|sJ|nt|janm:  Here we see a difference in style with the West hand - in the other room, West rebid 1@s and played in spades. Here, W showed his balanced hand and is in hearts - Both will make on this hand - I'm not sure which would survive bad breaks better|pg||

nt|marcsmith: 4@S is certainly a strange contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not vul Hans would open 2@S -- but this hand will pass|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree u there.|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think the 10 was right,  maybe E not thinking it out?|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2H|nt|marcsmith: 5@D is clearly where you want to play|pg||
mb|d|nt|rodal f: Up to partnership. I like Q best|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: 3NT for NS here with @c 2-2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=(11)12-14 and includes some unexpected shapes|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: 3rd/4th seat  NS play 1N=good14 to bad 17|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D = @S and @C/@D  [ASPRO]|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm:  Bridge is a funny game, isn't it - if North had a club singleton, instead of a diamond singleton, his splinter would be encouraging for S, but here, it's going to turn S off, yet it's really the same, since N has only 3 clubs and they can go on |pg||
nt|janm:  the diamond KQ leaving him with a club stiff |pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: presumably 1@S shows four spades and a negative double would deny four|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N looks like either transfer or lebensohl|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or  transfer lebensohl|pg||
nt|ahollan1: either way   i think Thompson is supposed to bid 3@C unless holding a really strong hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmmm maybe they play 2@D=@S & another  [including @H]|pg||
mb|p|pc|c9|nt|peachy: I don't know what NS 1NT vul opening range is, but I assume 10-12. Kibitzer says "gutsy"|pg||
pc|c3|nt|marcsmith: 2@H likely now from South|pg||
pc|cA|nt|marcsmith: bit too good for 3@C|pg||
nt|janm:  Of course N wouldn't have enough to splinter if he weren't a passed hand. |pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Gosney in 1N West|pg||
pc|h6|nt|marcsmith: now 3@D from north and another game try with 4@C by south seems sensibel|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Klinger led the 14 round Qualifying Event [South-West Pacific Teams] from Round 3 or 4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another possible double partscore swing -- but both will be close|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: the defenders from 2010, McManus just barely made it into the NOT in the final match of the SWPT|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mrdct: this looks like the road to 3NT|pg||
nt|peachy: could be 12-14 with an upgrade to 12 due to good spots|pg||
nt|raghavan: may end in +2 with C lead|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|mrdct: or not|pg||
nt|mrdct: 5@c a maker also |pg||
nt|peachy: tricky lead but declarer has no other hope than K now|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok specs, all saying q was best,  I thought after winning ace, a spade back and covered by queen was enough|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: but they were knocked out last night in the NOT Round of 20|pg||
pc|d3|nt|peachy: South cnnot go wrong nearly whatever he returns|pg||
nt|peachy: but understandably he wants to weigh the options at this time|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|mrdct: first imps for milne as klinger-mullamphy got too high on the earlier @s partscore hand where andy hung delayed his raise|pg||

nt|t 2: 2nt two places to play i guess|pg||
nt|t 2: and north a pretty easy 3nt bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: and the "opening" bid locates a few cards|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: West thinking at the moment|pg||
pc|h2|nt|t 2: you would think a normal heart lead but W probably pondering the possibility that N doesnt have spade for their take out X|pg||
nt|t 2: having bid 3nt over 2nt|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hQ|pc|h5|pg||

nt|janm:  With all these claims, why is the other table 2 boards ahead? :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: whatever|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Milne v Tishler is also close in the early goings   15-12|pg||
nt|janm:  2@d probably multi, although a few pairs like to play it as a weak 2@h bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D because  1st/2nd seat 1N is weak|pg||
nt|janm:  N will suspect his partner has hearts, but will probably find out before settling for 3NT|pg||
nt|janm:  Or maybe not after the 2@s overcall|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|marcsmith: slam in either major looks like an easy make -- not so easy to bid perhaps tho|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=9-11 HCP|pg||
mb|1S|nt|marcsmith: a diamond lead might beat 6@S but 6@H is solid|pg||
nt|janm:  Probably S could have a bit less for a vul vs not weak 2 bid, but N probably thinks he has 9 tricks in his own hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: the problem with 6@S is that you have to ruff a club. If North then ducks the first round of trumps, declarer may be tempted to repeat the finesse|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmm  i thought EW played 15-17 NT throughout |pg||
nt|ahollan1: blast 3N?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sybarra: a big key was not to block the suit with q10x |pg||
nt|sybarra: we might play it here in 2 1C |pg||
nt|sybarra: *2 @C |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: did Bill Jacobs think the hand was too good  ...  or have they changed System since the 2009 Team Playoff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the 1N response with 11 HCP and 3 quick tricks suggests system change|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: ahhh I'm told they now play the Fantunes system  that exlains sooooo much|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in that case, 1@C was a one round force, usually 14+ HCP|pg||
nt|sybarra: was chancey to bid 2 @H although it would have worked here|pg||
pc|h4|nt|janm:  And he does, with the A of hearts for 10|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|nt|rodal f: A correct but sadly pass from E, and a nice lead.|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|peachy: this again will be a challenge when diamond development and entries make it a tangle|pg||
nt|janm:  At matchpoints, declarer would probably take the spade finesse for 5, but here he'll probably settle for his safe 10 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: reverse red suits in W |pg||
pc|c3|nt|peachy: I expect defenders will prevail|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|nt|marcsmith: North has to duck the first round of trumps, then I don't think declarer can make 12 tricks|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @SA looks like weaker lead than @SK  -- that's typical of current treatment, but in the olden days Ace was the strong lead [for unblock or count]|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|marcsmith: now it's easy|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs use  upside-down count & attitude|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so @S6 was encouraging in @S|pg||
nt|rodal f: If u have 6@H at 1NT one round force OK. But by 5 cards after 9+black cards at W. Nope|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s9|pc|s2|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|d6|nt|peachy: It was maybe 1 or two down, now certainly -3|pg||

nt|ahollan1: nice position for Jacobs -- his lead didn't matter, Nunn only had 8 quick tricks|pg||

mb|1H|nt|rodal f: Major 5-4|pg||
nt|sybarra: no trump on a @D lead???|pg||
nt|sybarra: no thanks|pg||
nt|t 2: NS have some system so they have a choice with what to open with 15-17 balanced with a 5 card major|pg||
nt|sybarra: or did you mean E/W?|pg||
nt|t 2: i would open 1nt with the south hand i guess|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rodal f: Txs Shirly and 2 specs. Agree wit u:)|pg||
nt|t 2: because i dont want to hear a 1nt response to 1H |pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|t 2: i like 3h from N|pg||
nt|sybarra: me too |pg||
nt|t 2: will probably end the auction|pg||
nt|sybarra: describes the hand |pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: The best 3@H hand Ive seen by long time|pg||
mb|p|nt|t 2: i would like it more if the singleton was a spade, but same difference really|pg||
nt|sybarra: had a spec suggested 2 @D flannery....  (I may get fired for using that word) |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|rodal f: Not many using flannery theese days. But happens.|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|sybarra: however this is at least one world class pair who uses that convention |pg||
nt|t 2: E has no entries so this will make, possibly with overs via the defence trying to beat it|pg||
nt|sybarra: any one know the pair? |pg||
nt|t 2: i give up|pg||
nt|rodal f: After 1@H opps 1NT u have 4 possible variants to show ure hand. N is a bit to good for 3@H |pg||
nt|t 2: i think on the S hand you will find a lot of experts very adamant about opening 1H, and some experts very adamant about opening 1NT|pg||

nt|marcsmith: 11 tricks with the heart finesse onside|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks Tom|pg||
nt|janm:  Wrong again! I guess he had enough faith in West's overcall to play him for either the diamond A or the spade Q or both|pg||
nt|janm:  NS need to start winning more than 1 IMP a board to get back into this match, though.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: 1N is the system opening for Thompson|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: all systems have their flaws,  often you land on feet in that one |pg||
mb|2C|nt|sybarra: and W opened a dog of a hand |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N = (11)12-14  and conventionally covers some distributions that would surprise many|pg||
nt|tez: operation time:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: n/s close to making 3 nt|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: random decision for who declares 4@S  seems if East declares, no @H lead so extra overtricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: if they play weak nt i belive you must bid |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Thompson's other option was a limited 2@D opening which is unbal, but that's an ugly @D suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: If I do, it end with a swim:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm:  Reynolds must agree with me that they need to start getting some IMPs, and making a somewhat aggressive vul 2@s bid (presumably spades + a minor) is his way to try to do it|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: but with a transfer [seems normal]   North has natural @H lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what a random 2 imps that would be|pg||
nt|rodal f: What NT do EW use at vul?|pg||
nt|sybarra: carry on to 4 @S now|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: in 1st seat, Tony Nunn had to either PASS or try 3@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmmm   in the other room declarer WAS East -- auction must have pin-pointed @H lead|pg||
nt|timb: This looks like 11 to Milne, putting the match almost out of reach for Markey|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|janm:  Unfortunately, unless he can make this (which would be a real miracle), his attempt had backfired.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|raghavan: Play in 4S making +1|pg||
nt|sybarra: pls dont tell me you want to open 1 nt with W?|pg||
nt|sybarra: on that pattern???|pg||
nt|rodal f: 15-17 a spec told. 1NT opening for me at W|pg||
pc|dT|nt|tez: if theu play weak nt..dbl is 14+ 2@c majors..others transfer..we play this way|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: EW are playing 2/1 so 15-17 NT |pg||
pc|dK|nt|vugrapha2: and alex (N) says good luck|pg||
nt|timb: South has to ruff two hearts and lose a trump trick or make five trumps and lose a heart|pg||
nt|timb: West has to play a heart now|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|peachy: I don't know what EW NT range is, it could even be 15-17 with an upgrade here, or 12-14|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugrapha2: this should go off|pg||

nt|rodal f: As it is for 5@S@H and 6@D@C at 1NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: only because pard has you covered|pg||
nt|rodal f: System on as I said. But must be on.|pg||
nt|raghavan: Bd 2 here 3NT went 1 down. Open making. with same C lead - Open room after winning with Cj, a club  was played back developing 9th trick|pg||
nt|raghavan: He had 2 entries to develop club trick|pg||
nt|rodal f: And lost one by @S play when he might climed. Safe teamplay u told as I did at beginning.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|peachy: defenders did well not to open up the clubs for declarer|pg||
nt|timb: Still down one is 6imps and 43 is a good buffer over 9 boards|pg||
nt|timb: low @S to @SA, @C9 throwing a heart & a trump finesses sees South emerge for down one|pg||
nt|janm:  I think he still has the heart/spade problem - he can't pull trumps and end in dummy to use the clubs and if he ruffs the heart, he'll have a spade loser|pg||

mb|1C|mb|d|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=forcing 1 round -- usually 14+ HCP|pg||
mb|1S|an| |nt|ahollan1: they just started bidding  7 in the other room|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|janm:  South is being very quiet - maybe waiting to see where the opponents end before bidding his 8 card suit?|pg||
nt|janm:  Presumably 2@d was a transfer to @hs and 2@s was a super-accept|pg||
nt|janm:  South thinking now might be the time to bid those @ds?|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: This confirms (to me) that EW Nt OPENING RANGE IS 15-17|pg||
nt|peachy: ooooops, caps, sry|pg||
nt|janm:  This auction has a very different feel from the one in the other room, where N opened the bidding, so EW might DBL this|pg||
nt|rodal f: @H lead for -1 but didn't exspect it.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ahollan1: Hinge was able to open 2@D with the South hand so 3N North easily reached|pg||
nt|tez: 2@d is artificial|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=4+@H, 0-11 HCP|pg||
nt|janm:  Or they might bid more hearts :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: 2@h=weak hand no @s support|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe a transfer??|pg||
nt|janm:  Doubling would be more successful, but I'm sure there are hands where 5@d is down only 1 and 5@h makes|pg||
nt|janm:  East has a maximum in HCPs, but there are so many "quacks" that he knows he doesn't really have a good hand for play in a suit - still, his side has 9 hearts and the opponents probably have a bunch of diamonds. Perhaps he should DBL to say that |pg||
mb|3N|nt|tez: 2@h=min 4 card in @h..min hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|janm:  I guess 2@s is natural, not a 2-suiter - didn't he open 2@d with a weak 2@h bid earlier? This 2@s bid is far from a thing of beauty, but he still needs to swing|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ahollan1: regardless of result, i think being in 4@H was better than stopping in 3|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|cQ|nt|mrdct: the @d layout looks bad for declarer but the @HK doubleton may help - the play will be interesting|pg||
mc|11|nt|ahollan1: very difficult to predict what will happen at the other table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: IF Bloom does open, will it be 1@H or 2@H [weak with @H & @C/@D]|pg||
nt|janm:  1 @d, 2@ss, at least 1 @h and a couple of clubs - down something like 3 or maybe even 4? Another nice pickup for Markey|pg||
nt|janm:  Is a diamond or a spade here best? From the spade 8, Reynolds knows that his partner has either one or 2 spades (surely he'd have led the 7 from J87), probably 2, since he didn't lead a spade to start. He also knows that there isn't anything to |pg||

mb|1C|nt|ahollan1: is this a MAX 2@H or min 1@H opener?|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: make that 11 even|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|mrdct: 3rd seat might do something creative with souths hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this East hand is the exception to the rule that 1-suit openings show 14+ HCP   it is 12/13 when 5/4 in Majors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but it IS forcing|pg||
nt|rodal f: Spot as max level 3 at bought|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: min 1@H -- forcing 1 round|pg||
nt|peachy: There were wilder hands early in the match|pg||
nt|raghavan: here NS should be in 5 Diamond contract|pg||
mb|d|nt|marcsmith: i much prefer a weak diamond raise to 1@S on that West hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm:  4 boards to compare and still 24 IMPs to the leaders, but board 30 looks as if it's good for the trailing team, so the fat lady hasn't started to sing yet.|pg||
nt|rodal f: No X and NS gain 1IMP|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C covers a number of hands including a normal raise  [1@H-2@H is weak]|pg||
nt|marcsmith: surely, you know North is going to raise hearts and the only question is whether you have a save, and partner is only likely to find it if you tell him what you have |pg||
nt|marcsmith: ie a weak hand with some diamonds|pg||
nt|janm:  2NT an interesting bid by South|pg||
mb|4D|nt|ahollan1: 51 imps exchanged so far this set -- translating to a whopping +7 for Bloom|pg||
nt|marcsmith: 1@S is far less likely to hel him|pg||
nt|janm:  Oh, I see that board 30 actually looks good for the winning team - sorry!|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|mrdct: good news for NS is they have found their 4-3 @h fit rather than 3-3 @s fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: east's @h9 may prove to be a critical card|pg||
nt|marcsmith: having not raised the diamonds, West should lead the Jack here|pg||
nt|marcsmith: leading low is likely to tempt East to try to cash the ace to give you a ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Even having raised, it might be a good idea as partner might want another suit led thru|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm:  I don't think 2NT is going to be any better than 3@d here - and it might be worse, but it's hard to know how the play will go - West might end up having to lead spades to dummy |pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|nt|raghavan: May cash SA and play D|pg||
pc|h4|nt|janm:  The spade Q was good news, but the split is definitely bad news|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|hA|nt|janm:  2 spades and a heart in dummy, 2 clubs in hand, and not a lot of diamonds - I guess the good news is it isn't doubled|pg||
nt|janm:  2 of @cs looks like suit preference for diamonds over hearts, but Edgtton knows which red suit is better|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: so Rusinow leads against both NT and suits|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry -- i really did try to send that before trick 1 finished|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|marcsmith: that's true, but having not raised leading low is particularly dangerous|pg||
nt|raghavan: There is nothing much to do makes 5D|pg||
pc|h2|pc|dK|pc|c2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|mrdct: dead in the water now|pg||
nt|mrdct: perhaps - east can still go wrong here by the most viable defences seem to be tap declarer with a @d or give p a @s ruff|pg||
nt|mrdct: it can't be right to play a trump, but i guess there are layouts where @c is right|pg||

nt|marcsmith: NS likely to go down in a game here|pg||
nt|marcsmith: perhaps 3N by North will make if they don't mark the heart lead in the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: set up by a good presure 3@d bid by west where some may have made a simple 1-level overcall|pg||
nt|ahollan1: winner of this match advances to Semi-Final, loser gets to play again|pg||
mb|1S|nt|janm:  Yes, it's the leading team that seems to have a good result here - EW bid a slam off a cashing AK and NS cashed them (and doubled as well).|pg||
nt|bebechira: was a good double by Milne as well... :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: NT by N is unlikely to get a heart lead|pg||
nt|marcsmith: anyone have any idea what 2@S is?|pg||
nt|rodal f: A new spot but 3NT is on as 2@H|pg||
mb|2D|nt|tez: exiciting match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is some form of magic that is based upon the results of the 14-match Swiss Qualifying into the NOT, then results from last nite Round of 20 matches|pg||
nt|tez: nack n nack|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think the other match now on vugraph is in lose & go home mode|pg||
nt|ahollan1: forcing 1@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same 2@C response??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or 2N|pg||
nt|janm:  Was it? How did he know that South and not East had the @c K?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: because @C don't run?|pg||
nt|marcsmith: surely not the systemic action on this???|pg||
nt|mrdct: yes he correctly diagnosed that with no @c cue by east at worst his @CAQ was sitting over dummy's K|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: i think 2N= a) 7-9 3@S or b) 5-9 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: This is another of their 3-9 two suiters, blacks this time|pg||
nt|marcsmith: hardly what I'd call a -suiter|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bebechira: lol... it was a good double for Milne team|pg||
nt|sybarra: W really pushing with his 8 count|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@S = limit raise, exactly 3@H|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Actually, According to their score books, the 4H made|pg||
nt|janm:  And E couldn't have had a stiff club and decided to cue bid the A of diamonds first?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Second X=negative|pg||
mb|4S|nt|marcsmith: surely not sound either|pg||
nt|peachy: Yes systemic, we have knowledgeable kib|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i initially forgot East was passed hand :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good-o 4@H on time makes more sense|pg||
nt|marcsmith: bizarre|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: 2NT likely inquiry|pg||
nt|mrdct: he was screenmates with east so i'm sure he asked him whether or not he'd cue a stiff @C in preference to a @d control|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: as pointed out - after pull last trump - unblock @C honor when Nunn flies Ace  |pg||
nt|marcsmith: think I'd rather open 1@S|pg||
nt|mrdct: and it's always more useful to get that info from the actual person holding the hand|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mrdct: nice stop here for ew|pg||
nt|rodal f: If @H lead direct for @D hook.|pg||
nt|raghavan: May have problem in 4 S if West plays Heart twice and get a ruff |pg||
nt|raghavan: But not so happened|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mrdct: thin values, no fit, no source of tricks = no game|pg||
nt|marcsmith: 3@H presumably maximum with clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: I suspect the 1st X was negative  |pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|bebechira: lool..here we go|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: @D10 may make it easier for Hans to find @C shift|pg||
nt|tez: @c now|pg||
nt|tez: declarer has aqjx in @d|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i suppose @DK will get @C shift too, but it is harder after that Trick 1 play|pg||
nt|tez: @d 1t won|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes --- i'm just saying @DT makes @C shift much easier than @DK|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c6|nt|mrdct: this auction is slightly curious as this time it seems east has denied @C control but east makes a slam try anyway|pg||
nt|mrdct: sry west|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2 boards left|pg||
nt|mrdct: so Bloom, Milne and Noble into the semis with the other semifinalist to come from the match not on BBO|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|sybarra: this and one more in this quarter |pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: it will be interesting to see if defense is different at other tables when @DK is played at trick 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=(11)12-14  covers many shapes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: last year there was a big discussion on BBO Forum [or r.g.b] about whether or not to use conventional runout after Weak 1N - DBL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the conclusion matched the arguments about 1M-1N  forcing vs semi-force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: each camp is absolutely sure their treatment is right and the other treatment is wrong|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and vice versa :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: are we really waiting for Jacobs' bid?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one runout scheme uses RDBL to force bid of 2@C   the other would bid 2@C as Natural [totally new concept]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: winner gets to rest the rest of the evening -- qualifying into semi-final|pg||
nt|ahollan1: loser plays 32 more boards in the Quarter Final|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S forcing, usually 14+ HCP|pg||

nt|raghavan: HQ|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: and there's the flaw with the initial PASS  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=a) 7-9 3@S or b) 5-9 4@S|pg||
nt|peachy: I once read (I'd swear it was a Mike Lawrence book) that leading from xxx has the same effect on your defense as a sleeping pill would have on your attention span|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mrdct: Klinger was down 17-31 to Yezerski at the half|pg||
nt|mrdct: it would be somewhat of an upset if Yezerski held-on given that Klinger won the swiss qualifying|pg||
pc|c8|pg||

nt|raghavan: trying for extra club trick|pg||
nt|raghavan: Spade K is his 9th |pg||

nt|rodal f: Playable but will Liam find the road?|pg||
pc|hA|pg||

pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: @S shift -- just didn't occur to me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D8 still looming large|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if Sartaj just plugs away with major suit cards he eventually score all 3 trump tricks for down 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but surely @HK most likely to establish an extra trick if partner holds any more points|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Thompson still has 1N opener without @HQ |pg||
