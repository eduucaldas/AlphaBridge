nt|Walddk4: Hello Martin, Hans and Vladimir|pg||
nt|xenya: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Problem is, that the slam must be played by South!|pg||

nt|saverio: hi all|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Saverio|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Bob Heitzman and Andrew Webb|pg||
nt|bobh1: hello everyone|pg||
nt|tejjyid: hi Bob, Roland|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Lots of fairly classical precision for system, I believe|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I was hoping to find system cards on the NEC site, but if they are there, I can't track them down|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome back to Yokohama |pg||
nt|sybarra: with PO Sundelin,  we will not be the "speed" table here|pg||
nt|vugraphzyt: sorry this is wrong board|pg||

nt|tejjyid: But Precision is, in a way, *the* Chinese system|pg||
mb|2D|nt|hawe45:  - ah, I didÂ´nt see the 9 of @H, important card |pg||
mb|3H!|nt|tejjyid: West adopts the iew that passing with a weak balanced hand is better than trying to fluke a partscore|pg||
nt|tejjyid: *view|pg||
mb|d!|mb|4H|nt|othered1: Do we know NS's system?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Anyway - a tuff start|pg||
nt|bobh1: EW belong in 3@H|pg||
mb|4S|nt|fabsayc: as i play 4@D has to be ace (not king or singleton)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the Hacketts are father Paul and son Justin two fine English players|pg||
mb|p|nt|saverio: 3NT available for EW here   but not easy to get there|pg||
nt|bobh1: apparently the second double is takeout|pg||
nt|tejjyid: a fair treatement if West's 1st pass doesn't show values|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bg: seems natural so far:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: the question will be can n/s stay out of game |pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|hawe45:  Yes North canÂ´t be young, I played in at team with him in 1970...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: welcome Hans|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Thks|pg||
pc|hA|nt|othered1: If something lilke Precision, there would be questions about relative minor suit length, v what a double would show, etc.|pg||

pc|h7|pg||

pc|h4|nt|kiwibridge: still young at heart I expect|pg||

pc|h3|nt|fabsayc: it may have asked about clubs and 5@D denied|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hi all|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I'b be happy ot pass 2@H as East; I've done enough, IMO, with a 4441|pg||
nt|bobh1: yes but its so prime|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I'm not unsympathetic to the raise; but I expect West to be aggressive with say, 5 trumps & a black K|pg||
nt|tejjyid: and bid 3@H over the X|pg||

nt|janm: It seems to me that opening bids have been getting lighter and ligher|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: prediction 2-NS will get too high|pg||
nt|sybarra: but we will be the slow table |pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|othered1: What's east's 1@C?|pg||
nt|othered1: From south's 2@C bid, I might infer it's a big @C|pg||
nt|bg: not sure but is normal start for a 2nnt rebid|pg||
nt|bobh1: EW will make a game try...bid 3N and try to make it|pg||
nt|othered1: west apparantly denies 5@S if he passes over 1@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: regardless of strength?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|fabsayc: might even land in wrong suit|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I can tell you the McGann in the OR is indeed in 3N and looks like making so it could be 1st blood to Hackett|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: and cant really fail a cards lie|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: 6@D ? asks a kibitzer|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - on this board?...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes|pg||
nt|saverio: NS could take 11 tricks in 5@d here     another "not easy to find" game  |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'd prefer 2@C over the X|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 8 easy tricks is a good start; usuallythe defence will provide one along the way|pg||
mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|saverio: 6@d should be off on a @s lead  even if it is a though lead|pg||
pc|h2|nt|othered1: NS will h ave another chance to take 7 top tricks.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|bg: it was 16+|pg||
nt|othered1: looks like a normal big @C auction, with 2@S showing a limited positive response.|pg||
nt|othered1: ty operator|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: in the other room West raised to 5@C|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 3N made on 1 for 6 imps|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|sybarra: goofy little hand |pg||
nt|lestergold: after A@c could be interesting if PO tries to sneak a spade he may may make|pg||
nt|othered1: in the OR, it was east who thought his hand worth initial action and opened 1@C, cheating his partner out of the chance to be first to bid.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sunsamvar: i might be tempted to do so too.|pg||
nt|xenya: makes sense, considering the vulnerability |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: with the west hand... 7 points in partners preemt might not produce a single trick|pg||
nt|xenya: putting maximum pressure on NS|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bg: same result in other room on board 1|pg||
nt|othered1: the overcall does give west some useful information|pg||
nt|fabsayc: are you prepared to bid 7 if opponents reach slam, because that often happens with these extreme preempts|pg||
nt|xenya: spades behave, in a sense, so declarer can get out for -1|pg||
nt|saverio: do you agree on S 3NT?    |pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest11/nec.html   for Daily Bulletins (scroll down in the column to the left)|pg||
nt|bobh1: @c lead gives a trick|pg||
nt|othered1: first of EW, that it|pg||
pc|c2|nt|tejjyid: Those bulletins are astounding, the eds/authors do a fantastic job|pg||
nt|lestergold: question of overtricks now|pg||
nt|lestergold: surely no tank here must be odds to play J or T @c|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|cK|nt|saverio: wd by N to move from 3NT anyway|pg||
pc|c7|nt|kiwibridge: indeed the stiff A@H didn't look that great|pg||
nt|tejjyid: T1 tank is OK for planning - but tankins at T@@ as well is a bit rough|pg||
nt|tejjyid: T2|pg||
nt|bobh1: he's trying to decide which red suit S has|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c9|nt|hawe45:  MY partner(s) doÂ´nt open 3 @C|pg||
nt|saverio: i think i'd pass 3NT as N   (i'd expect something like AQ for that bid)|pg||
nt|bobh1: good choice|pg||
nt|bobh1: now 11 tricks?|pg||
nt|bobh1: are available anyway|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s5|pg||
pc|c8|nt|fabsayc: me either but then that is the crux of how high to preempt|pg||
nt|lestergold: north will he hold onto all his 1ds|pg||
nt|lestergold: @d s|pg||
nt|othered1: This shouldn't be too tough to defend, since passed hand east has shown up with AK-K|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s6|nt|lestergold: end of defence|pg||
mc|7|nt|lestergold: well |pg||

nt|kit: South's defense seems right from his point of view, looking at 2 small hearts and doubleton club in dummy.|pg||
nt|petergill: @C10 - lowers of equals (usually not best by declarer to do this) - perhaps was a slight clue to South that North had @C9.|pg||
nt|petergill: EW are in an unseeded Japanese team|pg||
nt|janm: Now a heart through and then the spade ruffed with the Q will get them to 7 defensive tricks|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: PO going to the new fangled stuff?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|othered1: The longer north keeps this off of a quantitative NT track, the better for NS.|pg||

nt|super nova: Since it says I also have @D support|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 1:30 in writing also|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|bg: would you rebid three clubs here?|pg||
nt|bobh1: 3N has a shot|pg||
nt|tejjyid: you could try 3NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: why should north accept 3N?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: North going very slowly|pg||
nt|lestergold: how old is PO he was world famous when i was a teenager|pg||
mb|d|nt|bg: Taipei + 620 in other room|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Bedst to be said about 5 @H: even 4 @H is no winner...|pg||

mb|p|nt|othered1: I don't hate 2@C rebid, but I think it would be nice to have methods that didn't require me to balckwood on north hand, though maybe it will work out.  7th @C, as yet unbid, is key ...|pg||
nt|othered1: and north can't count it.|pg||

nt|lestergold: sorry i used to be a teahcer its just habit|pg||
nt|chilloncan: mike is telling you to comment on the Go stand, in the corner|pg||
nt|tejjyid: NOrth has shown an appreciation of the "soft" nature of his 16 count, but 'm not sure whathe can do about it|pg||
nt|chilloncan: mirrored shapes and marginal game values dont mix well|pg||
nt|lestergold: well if he bids it will west lead his fourth best from hismlongest and strongest the only lead to give 3N|pg||
nt|lestergold: and that was a few decades ago|pg||
nt|lestergold: like 4|pg||
mb|1N|nt|hawe45:  Another good move from Hac-Hac|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 6@C has good chances |pg||
mb|p|nt|saverio: true but here we need to give credit to 2@h opening|pg||
nt|tejjyid: OK, 4@D is a surprise|pg||
nt|lestergold: only in bidding comp migt gamke not be bid here|pg||
nt|sybarra: so likely to hear 1 nt  and we did|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: Bulgaria are 2nd and Hackett are 6th at this time|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: That's an effort you'd see in many duplicate clubs.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|xenya: the auction in the other room was completely different -- S chose to preempt in 1st seat|pg||
pc|s5|nt|saverio: not easy to get to slam after 2@h/3@c/4@h...  a lot of space wasted and no more room to investigate|pg||
nt|tejjyid: OH, thy're certainly getting to game|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like 4@d is systematic|pg||
nt|chilloncan: the double by W makes S hand worse, and NS not vul. but most wiould bid game even if appreciating the negative factors|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I guess, that's why it took so long to find.  |pg||
nt|chilloncan: 6 LTC + 8.5 LTC means larginal for game even apart from the mirror|pg||
nt|tejjyid: South *might* have passed 2@S NV< but once not, no way to stop|pg||
nt|bobh1: actually no way to misdefend|pg||
nt|chilloncan: it is a difficult double dummy problem i ndeed to imagine a scenario where EW could let it make|pg||
nt|lestergold: well North was very max for his 2@s and south was sub min for 2N|pg||
nt|tejjyid: If they routinely make single raises with 16 HCP, South is pretty much compelled to try will 9+|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bobh1: E is thinking hard about finding one|pg||

nt|saverio: after the 2@h opening in the earlier board we can understand why N opened 1@h here     though it is not my style since i prefer sounds openings and overcalls....:)|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i dont really agree with the double by W, but the position is a very awkward one|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: 1 off guaranteed club guess needed to avoid 2 light|pg||

nt|sybarra: some sort of drury by N |pg||
nt|tejjyid: and on that lead, it won't be too hard|pg||
nt|othered1: west's pass, compared to an earlier board, must mean he looks at the vulnerability before bidding|pg||

pc|d5|nt|hawe45:  Even the @D 2 would do |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: west has to perforce continue @C after seeing the major holding in dummy|pg||

nt|othered1: might depend on how declarer thinks @S split.  Remember west ddin't overcall|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dQ|nt|saverio: E should have play a @d here in order to play again after ruffing third @h by Q   i think it wd set it  (not sure though)|pg||

nt|saverio: uh ho   now he could be in trouble (if my def lines works :))|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it enabled the good sac to be made, relying on teamies who let the side down|pg||
nt|hawe45:  South might regret having played this @D to the Ace|pg||

nt|gowdy: passed hand  needs some help |pg||
nt|petergill: Subhash's overcalls are virtually unlimited in strength - one of his bridge partners just told me!|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer can get 3 diamonds, 3 clubs, 2 spades, but the ninth trick may be difficult|pg||
nt|janm: With the diamonds and hearts so foul, it's going to be tough to take 9 tricks - I guess he could take 2 spades, 3 diamonds and 3 clubs, but where's the 9th?|pg||

mb|1H|nt|kiwibridge: the big flat use a lot of space nt|pg||
nt|othered1: south, perhaps feeling too good for a 1N overcall (if available naturally), tried a simple 1@D and gets a bid out of partner.  Now what?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bg: sry it was 2 clubs x by E down 1 -100|pg||
nt|othered1: so far very normal.  Now north's hand says do something @H focused, like raise or support double|pg||

mb|p|nt|chilloncan: wow. apparently 2N was forcing|pg||
nt|tejjyid: a simple & descriptive bid...|pg||
mb|p|nt|saverio: but the seems not to have a bid showing both M so they could have wronsided the contract if they happened to have @h and not @s fit....|pg||
pc|s2|nt|xenya: the 4@S bid is routine -- E doesn't need much from partner for game to be good |pg||
nt|chilloncan: looks good for W|pg||
nt|sybarra: how did they make 4 @S?  not sure I see enough tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: as cards lie|pg||
nt|sybarra: I see,  @H lead and hopped ace|pg||
nt|chilloncan: club ruffs out third, and they may have led D ace|pg||
nt|lestergold: surely only lose 1 trick in each side suit|pg||
nt|othered1: That doesn't come up all that often on defensive bidding, and I might think it showed a different hand with longer, better @D and a bit less outside.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bg: many players do not like to doubles with voids and a weakness in defensive cards  probably best here just to overcall 1 heart|pg||
nt|saverio: wrongsided*|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it probably gets bid with your hand type more often - 19-20 balanced usually goes through a X|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|dA|nt|dburn: not sure I'd have responded to 1@d at all with the North cards, let alone responded 1@h. But Kokish is very big in Japan, so that a 1@d overcall has a range of about 9 to about 29|pg||
pc|d4|nt|othered1:  a little wild and wooly, but I'll take defending 4@S on these hands.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h4|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Oups|pg||
nt|saverio: over 3@d it is a normal agreement to play 4@c both M with slam interest and 4@d w/out.....|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|sybarra: well hopefully there is a real explanation, I am getting several from kibs|pg||

pc|h2|nt|dburn: meanwhile, though, how will he make it?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I can't imagine introuding the @H suit though|pg||
pc|h5|nt|othered1: eventually, the auction will let declarer get the @D position right|pg||

pc|c6|nt|ritong: difficult lead for north|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|pelu: 4. best - very easy :)|pg||
nt|ritong: bakhshi can see that contract is cold with @hs 3/2, so he has to work out something if this is not the case|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he wasn't sure the auction would end if he doubled - maybe he would get to double 4@s|pg||
nt|chilloncan: absolutely|pg||
nt|lestergold: or maybe they wopuil;d play in clubs which is rather hard tol double|pg||
nt|sybarra: but I would have bid 3 hts on the get go with S hand|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pc|s6|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 3H could be good news bad news...might kep them out, but might turn plus into minus|pg||
pc|d4|nt|othered1: The name of the game at IMPs today is "bid them up"|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|pc|d6|pg||
nt|xenya: well. S has support in all the unbid suits -- sort of|pg||
nt|chilloncan: always hard to know what to do with those|pg||
nt|lestergold: i vote for 3@h|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|nt|dburn: in which position?|pg||
nt|lestergold: and let opps get on with it...|pg||
nt|lestergold: south raising to 3@h|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d2|pg||
nt|sybarra: pard did open red, with 2 hts,   he cant be totally broke|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 2 rounds @H then try to ruff a @S|pg||
nt|tejjyid: thanks all for coming|pg||
nt|tejjyid: thanks operator & NEC|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|pelu: 5@Hs was down 2 so a +board for NEDUK|pg||
nt|othered1: even fewer part scores in the OR|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ritong: for this reason, i would have played a @c at trick 2|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i was taught that to dbl 1@S you need a bit more :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kiwibridge: We'd like to thank our great operator Murakami, Saverio Hans and James for their commentaries, Akito Omasa of the JCBL and NEC for their great sponsorship|pg||

nt|petergill: and I thought West was thinking about 3NT or 4@H, having a maximum with good trumps|pg||
nt|kit: Normal 2@H call here I would think|pg||
mb|2H|mb|d|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|kit: The trick here is to get to 3NT with the 9-card spade fit|pg||
nt|petergill: East passed his 11 count due to the poor suit, then he could surely have bid 2@S over 2@H, I would think|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|kit: they did well to get spades played from West side.  From East side, 3@S is in trouble on stiff heart lead.|pg||
nt|petergill: Great 3NT bid, opposite a passed hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Impressive!|pg||
nt|petergill: Very well bid by Akama and Maruyama|pg||
nt|kit: So often the case that 4-3-3-3 hands belong in 3NT regardless of how good major-suit fit is.|pg||
nt|janm: KISS picked up another 13 on the hand that Kit wanted to save over 4@s, when N overcalled 1@h and then sold out to 2@d by West|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c8|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|kit: cross to club to lead spade up|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|petergill: Bd 28: There are still some experts in countries like Australia who think that it's right to overcall 1@H instead of Dbl 1@D. As Kit, Jan and the outcome demonstrate, Dbl is best. |pg||
pc|sK|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kit: With me, it is automatic to always double with 5-4 in majors and always overcall with 5-3 in majors|pg||

mc|10|nt|petergill: and thanks to Kit Woolsey and Jan Martel for being the best BBO commentators I have had the honour to work with for a long time |pg||
nt|janm: I think Kit deserves that comment :) and so do you Peter. |pg||
nt|petergill: It's not on the internet, but there's a gweat interview in the Feb 2011 issue of Bridge World magazine with Kit Woolsey, which makes it almost worth paying to be a BW subscriber ...|pg||
nt|petergill: just to read the interview.  |pg||
nt|petergill: Next match starts in about 82 minutes|pg||
nt|janm: The best bargain ever was a lifetime subscription to the Bridge World back when they were available! I forget what it cost, but I know it wasn't enough|pg||
nt|petergill: We don't have an advance schedule of which teams on Vugraph. The leading match this round is Australia versus China Women (current Women's World Champions), so we might see one of ...|pg||
nt|petergill: those teams next match|pg||
nt|petergill: http://www.bridgeworld.com/ is the magazine's website, but the Woolsey interview is not in their sample content online.|pg||
nt|petergill: A good win by KISS, mainly won in the bidding. Bye everyone|pg||
nt|petergill: The leading team at present is Sartaj Hans - Tony Nunn  and Paul Gosney - Nabil Edgtton (a teenager) from Australia.|pg||
nt|petergill: I think declarer may have claimed his contract here|pg||
nt|petergill: 430 is the claim. 19 imps is 20-10 in VPs.|pg||
nt|petergill: Last year I was playing in the Oz2 team. This year Nabil Edgtton has replaced me, as he is Paul Gosney's partner in the upscoming Playoff for the 2011 Australian Open Team. for ...|pg||
nt|petergill: yhje Yeh Cup, I return in Nabil'  |pg||
