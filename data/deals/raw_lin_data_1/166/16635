nt|bvdahl: Yes, but want to be anonymous....|pg||
nt|bvdahl: could start with a hend passed out...?|pg||
nt|disa: unless someone plays 10-12 Nt then we have 3 opening NTs |pg||
nt|bvdahl: I usually open 5card major and 11, but I'd might make an excption with East hand....|pg||
nt|andersk: Not these losy 11|pg||
nt|bvdahl: had I had spades, perhaps....|pg||
nt|vugraphzzh: Enjoy :)|pg||
nt|andersk: Hi|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome.|pg||
nt|vugraphzzh: Welcome and enjoy :)|pg||
nt|andersk: great hand to start with|pg||
nt|rnmalik: action packed:)|pg||
nt|bvdahl: Welcome to the last round of the teams event at Reykjavik Open|pg||
nt|bvdahl: Team Gillis are in the lead, and their opponent needs to win 20-10 to draw even|pg||
nt|bvdahl: There are also other teams in the hunt, but if Gillis can win 18-12, no one will catch them|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|vugraphzzh: wlc and enjoy :)|pg||
nt|andersk: 4@H makes EW and 5 minor good save, might even make on a good day:)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|bvdahl: Helness obviously knows something I don't :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jameslee 2: hi all wellcome to Norwegian Seniors vugraph|pg||
nt|bg: 4 H EW good save NS |pg||
mb|1N|nt|andersk: 1 @S I assume is 6-9 NT or @D suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|jameslee 2: starting on board 17 |pg||
nt|bvdahl: looks like a fairly easy 3NT on this first hand|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|andersk: @C  lead and easy make|pg||
nt|bvdahl: yep|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: HI gUDNI|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  hello to all|pg||
nt|bvdahl: Hello Sveta :)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|bvdahl: might get 8, even|pg||
nt|bvdahl: looks like 10 tricks, though it might be possible to make 11 on an endplay of W if declearer does everything right.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  when the stacks are so high, each overtrick matters. let's see|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rnmalik: -1 as the cards are placed.|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: here we have a very intervention from West of 1@S trying to make dificult a slam b|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: but South went direct to 6Nt fast|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Jaime, Kenneth and Povl|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kskov: hi all|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 12 opener +20 = makes the contract |pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|nt|lestergold: Good evening all|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|bvdahl: playing @h ot the J and later running the major tricks and putting in W in hearts to get a lead away from the spades. Not sure it is so easy without seeing the opponents hands, ...|pg||
nt|bvdahl: though|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jameslee 2: the contract is safe 12 tricks 6nt making |pg||
pc|c7|pc|c5|nt|disa: cards are very favorble for e-w|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|andersk: To set 5@C Helness have to jump up on @C K and switch @S|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|nt|jameslee 2: no finesse |pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: and more with the bidding|pg||
nt|bvdahl: sorry...running the minor tricks|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jameslee 2: needs 10@C to drop|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|nt|bvdahl: S has already shown 7 HCP's so not a stretch to put N on an ace, possibly 2|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome back to Andy|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  5 rounds of @c will help declarer count the hands|pg||
pc|c8|pc|h7|pc|cK|nt|bg: no way to avoid two spade losers first possible swing to Gillis|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: hi all|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kskov: not so obvious to make now|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty and hi everyone|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h3|nt|rnmalik: J@S in N a vital card.|pg||
nt|andersk: I do not agree, 5 @C makes many times|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  the @d position is clear now|pg||
nt|bvdahl: yes, but looks as though he will just cash his winners now|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jameslee 2: will go for the red suits see if opps discard a @C |pg||
pc|s8|pc|d7|nt|bvdahl: playing hearts now could be dangerous|pg||
nt|bvdahl: or maybe not...|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: spade to king and more spades is perfectly safe|pg||
mc|10|nt|kskov: might play for a show up|pg||

nt|andyv:  hi James|pg||
nt|kskov: Hi James and Andy|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Board 18|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but cashing @s K makes 9 tricks and endplay works|pg||
nt|bvdahl: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|sarkar_suk: the final contract shd be 3 Nt :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  and Kenneth:)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: minors 5/5 in E|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 1@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: 4@H is -500|pg||
nt|disa: e-w have a save in 4Hs|pg||
mb|2N|an|20-21|nt|jameslee 2: = length star with the hier suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|sarkar_suk: yes|pg||
nt|bvdahl: but 5 @c makes, right?|pg||
nt|andersk: id 3 NT now|pg||
mb|3C|nt|andersk: NS wont bid 3 NT now|pg||
mb|p|nt|kskov: 8 tricks in spades seems to be the limit, 10 tricks in minors EW|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 2@D =  11 + invitational to game in @S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: looks like an easy 4@S for EW.|pg||
nt|andersk: Some comment on Helness opening, I totally agree with opening 1 @S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: just fine with @S suit.|pg||
mb|3H|an|no major|nt|sarkar_suk: in 5 @C @SJ will play a vital role:)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: support @S|pg||
nt|sommer:  hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|disa: are N-S playing a weak NT?|pg||
nt|andersk: Yes thats correct|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 6@d makes, but 3NT is where they will end up, I guess|pg||
mb|3N|nt|andyv:  good discipline by S not to get carried away with his 6 card suit|pg||
nt|bg: good 1 spade opening 3 clubs is singleton should stop in 4 spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|disa: in 5C S goes on the heart|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Hi Polv|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Polv|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: N goes even S denided to go to Game|pg||
nt|andyv:  N however has no such problem|pg||
nt|kskov: difficult to double this, ew might end up in a phantom save|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: W has the last call :)|pg||
nt|bg: not sure what 3 dia is|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: We saw a 13p 1 NT opening privious round|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: no, because when you play @h's towards KQx, you will either avoid 1 @h loser or 2 @s loosers|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: prudently passed out|pg||
nt|kskov: well, he bid 4@d, so he probably felt he had done enough|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  we have very comfortable position - sitting here and seeing @d are 2-2 :) |pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|sarkar_suk: they r playing precession probably :)|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|andyv:  probably -200 vs. 130...not a huge swing|pg||
nt|lestergold: north is about to ruff with his trump trick|pg||
nt|georgia19: evening Mike|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  at the table, 3nt is normal|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sarkar_suk: cold contract now :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 2 down for 200 for E-W|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bvdahl: was always cold|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sarkar_suk: correct|pg||
nt|sommer:  200 seems ok|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 500 would have been better |pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|sommer:  sure|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lestergold: club loser will be taken care of by either heart finesse or ruffing out Q cant go wrong|pg||
nt|georgia19: what happened to the first contract, I was trying to get ungagged and missed it|pg||
nt|bvdahl: yes, I am just stating what is possible :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  exactly :)|pg||
mc|10|nt|bg: W should pass but fortunately they can stop safely in 5 spades|pg||

nt|jbgood: 560, yes|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|c4|nt|nicksan: We can see that Boye can make two tricks in each suit, but things can happen. |pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|nicksan: Probably, East's best chance is a small diamond shift  (!)|pg||
nt|jbgood: i think Boye would sniff tha out|pg||

nt|bvdahl: teo standard contracts so far, which is good for the leading team|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: and this is the third|pg||
mb|1C|nt|jameslee 2: board  19|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|disa: this looks like a spade partscore|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 2 big hands 1 aginxt the other |pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: which ace was not cashed. Not possible.|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: standard contract|pg||
nt|bvdahl: both 3NT and 4@h's makes so can't really go wrong|pg||
mb|2N|an|21-22|nt|jameslee 2: North 19|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: E 14 plus a 5/5 @S/@D|pg||
nt|georgia19: and yet another 4@s with no problems...|pg||
nt|vugraphzzh: @H|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|an|transfer|nt|kskov: 4@s making|pg||
nt|andyv:  W has a mixed raise here|pg||
nt|sommer:  nah..@Druff|pg||
nt|kskov: even on 3x @d lead|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: W suppports 2@S 1 less the total tricks as is vul and has not much |pg||
mb|d|mb|4H|nt|disa: 2C tranfer to diamonds?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: openner X = big hand |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|andersk: @S lead will set 4@H|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|nt|vugraphzzh: Don´t know yet|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jameslee 2: xx= nice hand |pg||
nt|lestergold: can even ruff out the K@H for overtrick|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|bvdahl: looks like an exact make. N hasn't really got any choice in @d's|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 3@H shows the suit to play |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 3@S end |pg||
nt|andyv:  with vul, would anyone risk 4@s here?|pg||
nt|bg: score on last board corrected to 5|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|sarkar_suk: correct:)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sommer:  then @c 2nd @C can be discarded later, right|pg||
nt|lestergold: not exactly a priority and could of course lead to trouble if spades dont break|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|hT|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|nt|bvdahl: W is trying to find a way for declearer to make 10 :)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|georgia19: no need to ruff a @d with that play - nice|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  4 teams (2-5 places now) are very close, Garos realizes it, I suppose|pg||
nt|bvdahl: seems difficult to find 11, but 10 is easy|pg||

nt|bvdahl: had @cK been offside, the club shift would have been uncomfortable. Now he couldn't make a mistake|pg||
nt|andyv:  unusual for Helness not to have gone to game|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: would be a nice call !|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: to big hands againxt |pg||
nt|lestergold: needed to handle entries differently but as i said iut was risky to play for that|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|andersk: 6@S makes EW here|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: E = 5/4@D/@C 15 |pg||
mb|p|nt|disa: this should be a quiet 4S|pg||
nt|bvdahl: standard 4@s EW here with standard 11|pg||
nt|andersk: not|pg||
nt|georgia19: NS must be wondering when they'll get hands to bid|pg||
mb|4S|nt|jameslee 2: 5/4/2/2 = modern style to open 1Nt |pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: unless that get greedy for slam|pg||
nt|disa: you have 2 diamond losers|pg||
nt|andersk: @C 8 in North prevents the squeeze|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: today there are much more hands openning NT |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 6@s will surely be bid however there is duplication here and may be hard to avoid loss of two minor suit tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|jameslee 2: not only 4.3.3.3  / 4.4.3.2 / 5.3.3.2   but also 6.3.2.2  / 5.4.2.2|pg||
nt|sommer:  @H may be Nilslands slinkningar.. weak, both MA|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: This requires accurate defense|pg||
nt|bvdahl: intersting hand. Seems like S must shift @c when he wins with A@h|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  having @s you have the power. @s game is very tiny, but possible, if defence asleeps for a while|pg||
pc|c3|nt|andyv:  have to love those 4-2 fits|pg||
nt|kskov: Farstad cant double again as it probably would have been take out|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: X from opps makes W bid a defensive 2@H |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  or so...|pg||
nt|bvdahl: now it is over....|pg||
pc|c6|nt|pbmarstr: slipped in the first trick|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: double dummy its easy single dummy not so|pg||
nt|rnmalik: EW can land into 3NT and would make on non-@C lead and @S switch.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bg: N should lead a club here|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jameslee 2: playing with a 4/2 trumps :(|pg||
nt|georgia19: it's hard for us to say how they SHOULD play, when we can see that it fails...|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@s c9mbined 32 9 card fit and all the controls etc and yet its not a very good contract|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|bvdahl: and it woun't e difficult discards since declearer must play 3 x @h's before trying for a squeeze|pg||
nt|lestergold: dont see how you can stay out of it|pg||
nt|georgia19: has he shown 5 keys + trumpQ?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Interesting defense.|pg||
nt|bg: spade Q-A then 8 back will stop further spades|pg||
nt|rnmalik: have to be precise because of @D squeeze.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|nt|pbmarstr: Leads are blind and difficult|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s7|pg||
nt|lestergold: it will be intyeresting to see what one of the world's very greatest card players makes of it|pg||
nt|bg: deuce of spades now would be a mistake S would not know who had nine|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true.|pg||
nt|bg: club Q ok also|pg||
nt|bg: actually N can lead any card in his hand except spade deuce!|pg||
nt|andersk: that not tru, after @S2 Svendsen can switch @C|pg||
nt|andersk: true|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|andyv:  probably should have pitched a @D instead of a @c|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @H swithch would remove any chance of making and no squeeze to S.|pg||
nt|bvdahl: NS needed to let S win 1st @h trick and then switch @c's|pg||
pc|c7|nt|georgia19: predict the lead?|pg||
nt|georgia19: hard to find anything obvious|pg||
nt|lestergold: what are the squeeze end play possibilities here?|pg||
nt|bg: spade deuce just creates a problem who has the 9?|pg||
nt|andersk: @D was the only to make, then South would be endplayed|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: oh this will help|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: if defence open the @C the can make it up to few down|pg||

mb|1C|an|prec|nt|georgia19: will youmlook at East's hand!! I thought he had the same one again.|pg||
nt|bvdahl: yes, it could easily, but a great result for Gillis |pg||

mb|2D|an|!H or !S and !C|nt|bvdahl: how did they claim 12?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: well they might have a second look to the hand |pg||
nt|vugraphzzh: sorry is 3 will change|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: looks 3 down 10@S not dropping |pg||
nt|georgia19: he could have made by leading a low club off dummy|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good defense.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  good position for EW to compete destructively|pg||
mb|d|nt|jameslee 2: board 21 |pg||
mb|4H|nt|jameslee 2: 4@D = splinter support|pg||
mb|d|nt|rnmalik: But how did he make 12 tricks, unless S played the A@D on @D play by E?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzh: they played very fast few rounds and i did miss one round but claim 12|pg||
nt|bvdahl: must have risen with @dA|pg||
nt|dburn: a miracle? the best percentage play for three club tricks with that combination is low to the ten|pg||

nt|andyv:  W needs to pull this|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: E = x !|pg||
nt|kskov: not so tempting to defend with Hauges hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  choice of -750 or -500|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: this one looks uncomfortable even with the nice @c layout|pg||
nt|andersk: undo pls|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I guess NS can make 5@h, but needs to make some good guesses|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|jameslee 2: 5@S = -3  500 5@D= 600  x = 750|pg||

nt|andyv:  I'm surprised that N didn't dbl |pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Heart position should now be clear if NS compete|pg||
nt|bvdahl: yes|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and @c too|pg||
nt|bvdahl: clubs will be revealed as the hand plays out|pg||
mb|5C|nt|andyv:  these are hands that have partners looking for asperin bottle|pg||
nt|georgia19: is that not what I just said?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: would you play @d's? Can never reach them.....|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 5@c, however, might not be so easy....|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Will they play in opponents known suit?|pg||
nt|bvdahl: ah... I thought 2@d could contain @d's|pg||
mb|5D|nt|dburn: well, you said "he could have made by leading a low club off dummy" - I would go a little further and say "he should have made by elading a low club off dummy"|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  after 4@s bid, E is known to have @s and @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|jameslee 2: not X = is a big mistake |pg||
nt|bg: in other room opening lead was the same  spade queen returned N then returned spade 8 but south did not pay attention and contineud spades to set up ninth trick|pg||
nt|bvdahl: yes, I missed that|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  not the best suit, after all|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 5@c was probably meant as 'pick a contract pd'|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  preempt done its job|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: 5 @C should mean chose between the red suits. Haukur should have bid 5 @H I feel|pg||
nt|bvdahl: yes, I agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|disa: looks better 2 play on clubs since dummy has 0 entrys|pg||
pc|h8|nt|dburn: good stop, this|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rnmalik: Here we saw an excellent @H switch.|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Since 4 @S is on this is not necessarily a great success for EW|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|dA|nt|andyv:  too much respect for opps:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: he seemed to play it too quickly DaVID|pg||
pc|d3|nt|georgia19: did he pass a forcing bid?|pg||
nt|dburn: although I guess with the club lead and that position in the suit, he may make four now|pg||
pc|d5|nt|andyv:  I don't think N thought it was a forcing pass but I could be wrong|pg||
pc|d2|pg||

pc|h4|nt|bvdahl: yes, Anders is right. -4 with hearts now|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: the lead also tended to suggest the position of the @d q would u lead from a Q against thos bidding?|pg||

nt|georgia19: an easy grand slam to make|pg||
nt|dburn: but even if the defence hadn't given him an entry with @s10, he could have put South in with the fourth spade to take a red-suit finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: sure the interest is in tyhe bidding|pg||
nt|georgia19: good hand for splinters and key card blackwood|pg||
nt|dburn: if North can show his singleton club, then Blackwood and a king-ask ought to do the rest|pg||
nt|bg: another NT hand how high will they get?|pg||
nt|bg: answered:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: one of those hands where it is easy to identify possesion of fit and controls but counting 13 tricks in the bidding is not always sttraightforward|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: interesting|pg||
mb|3D|nt|jameslee 2: just a 1@S call without no more bids |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: looks like 7 tricks for  1@S= made |pg||
mb|p|nt|pbmarstr: endplay|pg||
mb|3H|an|half or one stopp in !H|mb|p|nt|bvdahl: if East had promised 10 black cards, then it's really the only chance|pg||
mb|3N|nt|bvdahl: I would never leap to 3 NT with N's hand against 12-14 opening...|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Easy grand slam to make with suits breaking nicely.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jameslee 2: coming  with the K@C !|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: or a x @H !|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: North must find @hK here.....|pg||
nt|bvdahl: ugh... Gillis lost 12 IMP's on one of those 'standard' boards....|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andersk: I would snap pass, and hope EW balances:)|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: clap hands|pg||
nt|bvdahl: nice :)|pg||
nt|bvdahl: that could be the lead of the tournament|pg||
nt|bvdahl: so now EW can argue about why they didn't end up playing 5 in a minor|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|jameslee 2: defence try  to incomunicate so he does K@H |pg||
nt|kareno: Love to know what 3nt meant.  Perhaps some undisclosed singleton?  Spade singleton?|pg||
nt|georgia19: if South doesn't know about the singleton he will stop in 6|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|bvdahl: yes, I am always wondering why people don't do it more often with 8 HCP's against strong NT's and 11 like here....|pg||
nt|bvdahl: Perticularly these days when players seems eager to balance in all positions|pg||
nt|andersk: Since North have 4432 and 4 card spades, I have to agree with 2 club|pg||
nt|bvdahl: sure, but in general...|pg||
nt|andersk: we probably make 8 tricks or better in NT|pg||
nt|disa: well the way meckstroth explaines it with 11 you always go because the other table playing 15-17 will invite and now 13 is a max and even if you only have 23 points they still have ...|pg||
nt|disa: to beat you|pg||
nt|bvdahl: maybe I have played too much poker, and like to get my check raises in at the brigdge table as well :)|pg||
nt|andersk: cheek raises in bridge is common:)|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h5|pc|hJ|nt|disa: i know them well|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure - may just have been "serious 3NT" to initiate cue-bidding|pg||
nt|dburn: but whatever it was, it doesn't seem to have worked|pg||
nt|lestergold: as i feared |pg||
nt|bg: better to duck heart Q only get two heart tricks any but opps cannot set up suit|pg||
nt|rnmalik: has 7.|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: let,s dummy brake comunications |pg||
nt|kareno: It's hard - the one-clubbers have an easier time with this sort of hand.|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: And it was a very silly misplay in 2 D redoubled|pg||
nt|bvdahl: ok? I didn't look at it|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: in one of these standard boards|pg||
pc|h9|pc|s5|pc|h3|nt|georgia19: 1@H - 4@C would make it easy|pg||
nt|dburn: this ought to have been OK - presumably 4@c meant something|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|bvdahl: yes, ha had 6 tricks ans still ATxx over KQJx in trumps|pg||
pc|c4|nt|andersk: opps|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: And this was Brogeland, not Gillis|pg||
pc|s3|nt|andersk: had to run the Q|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|georgia19: maybe just a cue bid|pg||
nt|kareno: A little heavy for a splinter as I play.  |pg||
nt|dburn: and North did bid 4@s, above game on his own|pg||
nt|lestergold: problem is we do not know esactly what some of their bids meant|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|dburn: nor did they, by the look of things - good chance for Hauge there|pg||
nt|vugraphzzh: N told E that 3nt was spade|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe they invert 3@s and 3NT, so that 3@s is "serious" and 3NT is a spade cue bid|pg||
nt|dburn: but it's all speculation|pg||
nt|kareno: Are these KO matches?  Round Robin?|pg||
nt|lestergold: there is alot to identify here not just the two black singletons but also the K@d |pg||
nt|dburn: this is a Swiss, I think|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|bvdahl: don't like the @h play here. Trying to run the 9@s or play small club seems more flexible|pg||

pc|sT|pg||

nt|georgia19: as you've got lots of commentators now, and I had a car crash today, I think I'll excuse myself and open the wine, night all.|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Jon is holding possible 13 imps in his hand|pg||
nt|bvdahl: not so easy, because there are not a bunch of tricks from the top|pg||
nt|bvdahl: the question is what the alternative to @d is... If NS has @h tricks they will probably bot go anywhere|pg||
nt|bvdahl: not...|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bvdahl: should be 9 provided he gets a @s ruff|pg||

pc|hA|nt|jameslee 2: @C suit to work on 2 lossers also |pg||

nt|nicksan: Hard to see this ending up in anything other than 4 @H, making, or possibly 3 NT|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bessi2: i wonder what 3@h means|pg||
pc|c9|nt|nicksan: I wonder if a trump lead from South could break it? This, however, won't do it.|pg||
nt|jbgood: guess 2 @c was @ds, perhaps W just showed his distribution?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bessi2: i think a trump beats it Nick|pg||
nt|jbgood: This is the last board of this weekend, and some thanks are due.  Thank you operator operator Hrafnhildur, for your tireless efforts during these days. Well done indeed! And thanks ...|pg||
nt|jbgood: to sponsor Iceland Express and Bridgesamband Íslands (Ólöf),  for making it possible for us to watch the this exciting bridge live.  And of course thanks to BBO and Roland Wald.|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: board 20 both players played 2@H but diferent N-S  & E-W|pg||
nt|andyv:  other table opened 1@D|pg||
nt|lestergold: there are more commentators than specs|pg||
nt|dburn: ther term "suicide squeeze" is often used when one defender squeezes his partner, but this was the genuine article - West contrived to squeeze himself|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|jameslee 2: board 21 swing 5@S x - other 5@S NO X |pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|rnmalik: has 10 tricks at 4@S, as the cards are placed: friendly.|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|bvdahl: What happened there? After ruffing @c, declearer should have gone down, right?|pg||
nt|dburn: 2NT = four-card spade raise, I guess - fairly common treatment nowadays|pg||
nt|dburn: board 20 was flat when declarer at the other table also went down in 6@s|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|bg: 5 clubs good save with spade lead but 500 otherwise|pg||
mb|3N|nt|disa: he ruffed with the 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: yes, but he was getting short in trumps|pg||
nt|dburn: so this could be a big win for Hauge now - not that he needs it|pg||
mb|4C|nt|rnmalik: against 420 to save for 500 or more:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  2@s?  @s and minor?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pbmarstr: trump lead is best|pg||
nt|bvdahl: yes|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jameslee 2: 2@S capp = @S + minor  |pg||
pc|d7|nt|bvdahl: anyway... nine tricks here and nothing more, it seems|pg||
nt|vugraphzzh: 2nt was 4 card support and a litle with it hehe|pg||
nt|dburn: when South turns up with @sA, declarer will not get hearts wrong, so this should make|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rnmalik: -1 would be good save.|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|bvdahl: that was helpful|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: should not be any problems now|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jameslee 2: parner 2Nt= play in your minor|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: 3@C = my other suit |pg||
nt|vugraphzzh: correct|pg||
nt|andyv:  pretty ugly capp|pg||
nt|bvdahl: brogeland did not lead single @d on the last hand and 4@s made|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h6|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|nt|andersk: -3 now|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|nt|andyv:  ok, that makes more sense|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Gudni|pg||
nt|dburn: 4@h reasonable contract, but unlucky lie of cards - still, how would East-West do in diamonds?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: this is a hand that showes why I dont like 20-21 NT in multi|pg||
nt|bvdahl: @d lead here is not good......|pg||
nt|andersk: EW might overcall if vouln is oposit|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: yes ty |pg||
nt|vugraphzzh: everything for you :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: with a 5/5 open 1@D going for a thin openner |pg||
nt|andyv:  should have a lot of bidding here|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 1@H= 5 card nice intervention  with 4@S on the side|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jameslee 2: 2@C shows a 5 card 11 +|pg||
nt|bg: god result for Hauge in open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer:  minor slam NS now..but 4@h makes too|pg||
mb|2D|nt|dburn: not very well if no one bids them, of course|pg||
nt|bg: good|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: D|pg||
nt|rnmalik: x here by W, would demand @S lead, is it not?|pg||
nt|andersk: find my major|pg||
nt|andyv:  with vul, NS may do well by sacrificing in 7@c if EW get to 6@h|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4@H / 5@C  end contract|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: from here will see :)|pg||
nt|chick: worst danger is pushing NS to 6|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: K@C finesse adn not play for drop makes |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 5@C|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 5!@H= -1|pg||
mb|3C|nt|disa: most experts play dbl either shorter majo or spades now if it's spades rdbl by N should show doubt|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I'd lead a @h now since I hold @sJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzzh: Helness alert the dbl|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|rnmalik: may be, I play for @S only.:)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 5@H X = -1 = 200|pg||
nt|sommer:  the 4@H bid doesnt look like a stiff @CK|pg||
nt|andyv:  if vul, N's pass would be forcing... not sure how NS play pass here|pg||
nt|sommer:  sacrifice now....|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: yes ty Fcarioca is wright with finesse can make 6@C ty  :)|pg||
nt|bvdahl: can make 5@d by playing @d to T, I guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: actually the double ask for weakes major out|pg||
nt|dburn: still, I'm not sure 4@h is down yet|pg||
nt|dburn: though Helness has done well to avoid leading a top spade|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|dburn: however, he may have wasted some of the potential of his heart spots|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 3 NT as well, for that matter since @s are 4-4|pg||
mb|4H|nt|andyv:  6@c the insurance bid:)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: @D = discards a @S losser in S|pg||
nt|kskov: now he needs to get the clubs right for a push|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  finessing a slight favortie over 1-1 split|pg||
nt|caitlin: @C break here is a killer|pg||
mb|p|nt|kskov: think he will do that|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jameslee 2: lets see he could get it correct :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  favorite|pg||
nt|dburn: still, the strong temptation will be for declarer to rely on one of two spade finesses|pg||
pc|s2|nt|dburn: but he is going about it the right way so far...|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s4|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bvdahl: you expect pd to hold a rock solid suit, and not as much of a chance that the suit is @s when you hold @sJ|pg||
nt|sommer:  quite obvious to bid 6@C, yes|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bg: this points out fallacy of takeout double when holding a good biddable suit|pg||
pc|h5|nt|disa: should make 10 tricks|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: ther he goes |pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|andyv:  looking into the stars for a clue|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jameslee 2: go it correct yes :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  wd|pg||
nt|andersk: @H Q|pg||
pc|s7|nt|dburn: ..two diamond ruffs, five hearts, two clubs and a spade, but...|pg||
nt|bvdahl: unlucky to find the @h's breaking 5-1. This is a reasonable contract, I think|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h6|pg||
nt|nicksan: No commentators in this room? Or are thay all stunned by the auction?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|dburn: that spade suit was just too much of a temptation|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sommer:  the 4 and 5@H doesnt include stiff K|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
nt|bvdahl: peter and sveta was here.....|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Hi. |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|nt|rnmalik: flat board.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|caitlin: so much for split honours|pg||
nt|dburn: especially since Helness didn't lead one - the chance that he would turn up with @sKQ was probably a lot less than the usual 24%|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c9|pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|nicksan: Ah, Baard. This is going to be a close finish to the tournament. Hauge are scoring 23 at the moment and are only 6 V.P's behind|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: They found the game that did not succeed. |pg||

nt|vugraphzzh: last board and then is lunchbreak|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting that passing 5@c was the big winner...and, yes, S could infer the W was void in clubs to be doing all that bidding.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|bvdahl: 1@h (2@s) 3NT?|pg||
nt|disa: so if you play 12-14 Nt invite with 11 but GF with 4 over 20-21 hmmmmm|pg||
nt|vugraphzzh: last board and 19 min left of playing time so next round in about 25 min or so|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|nt|pbmarstr: A little unlucky|pg||
mb|1D|an|!H|nt|disa: when is the next match?|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|andyv:  N will close eyes and pick a card to lead|pg||
nt|bg: right|pg||
nt|vugraphzzh: yes and then lunchbreak until 14:45 gmt I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzh: 14:45 gmt|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|dburn: botn North-Souths able to get diamonds into the auction because West transferred|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but 2nd place is under question still|pg||
nt|bvdahl: maybe. Seems that 4@h's needed 3-3 break. 5@d had betterodds, I think|pg||
mb|2N|nt|bg: this result will change the leaderboard Gillis now leading|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: not that East-West would have enjoyed the play in 2@h a lot - they had clubs, but no one ever bids clubs|pg||
mb|p|pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|rnmalik: Thanks Bruce, Anders and Gudni, we saw some entertaing bridge.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sommer:  a quiet overtrick seems to be the end here|pg||

nt|andyv:  different philosophies on leads depending on type of event|pg||

nt|vugraphzzh: last board thx all for watching and hopy you enjoyed it|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|andyv:  going passive in this may not cost tricks but certainly doesn't lend itself to setting contract either|pg||
