mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rmb1: Less likely to make 11 in 4@S (so much for predictions)|pg||

pc|dT|nt|patricck: Welcome everyone|pg||

nt|vugraphzyj: N signaled with the 9@s... and gave a trick away...|pg||
nt|sybarra: that hand may get some discussion .....|pg||
nt|rmb1: so we are in for an exciting day!|pg||
nt|roswolf: i have been doing bbo commentary for a long time and that was truly unbelievable|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|april7: here EW might go go overboard but perhaps they will stay in a good 3NT contract|pg||
nt|sybarra: in the recap |pg||
nt|rmb1: 1@C strong artificial (I guess)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: nothing much here    |pg||
mb|1D|an| |nt|april7: 6@C is a possible contrACT|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: 6@C is a lucky contract, but not 6@D|pg||
nt|ady: need to stop around 1NT|pg||
mb|1S|nt|roswolf: indeed think west should pass here|pg||
nt|neobas: I don't like the 3NT rebid tbh|pg||
nt|neobas: I usually play it as solid diamonds and a bit too much to open a Gambling 3NT|pg||
nt|april7: no W is thinking about a 6 @C contract and will have the luck to make it if he decides to do it|pg||
nt|neobas: Anyone for 3@D?|pg||
nt|roswolf: but 4@C may be ok provided they could stop in 4NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: is North worth a positive (if 1@c is strong)?|pg||
nt|ady: west may compete|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: 3@D is the more normal rebid...  I don't think 3NT is such an ugly choice tho|pg||
nt|rmb1: I can't find convention cards on line: I think this is a picture of East http://www.bridzs.hu/node/184/52|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is sane so far|pg||
mb|2H|nt|roswolf: AH AH|pg||
nt|neobas: "My @C are more solid than your @D"|pg||
nt|roswolf: now a major cue?|pg||
nt|neobas: :)|pg||
nt|april7: now 4 @D and then 6@C perhaps|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 1nt?|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: Signaling Rule  2:  Never signal with a trick.|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: now e/w should get to 6@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: and   1 is?|pg||
nt|panja: 1@S pass might be the best spot...|pg||
nt|roswolf: we shall see|pg||
nt|panja: would have been difficult to make 7 tricks in 1Nt|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this looks like a normal pass for South now|pg||
nt|ady: cam ,ake 9 tricks in hearts|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rmb1: Another auction you do not see that often (with opener passing 1S)|pg||
nt|rmb1: In the other match, 1@C was an little as an ordinary 16, so North is probably not worth a positive|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|roswolf: must avoid 6NT|pg||
nt|patricck: 6@C can be beaten on a @H lead as long as when the Q@S is run on the first round of the suit South ducks|pg||
nt|april7: W should ofcourse pull trumps before giving up a @S|pg||
nt|roswolf: that would be tough i think|pg||
nt|april7: 6NT possible except on @H lead,but S will lead @H ofcourse|pg||
nt|patricck: sorry, stupid of me, diamonds don't need to be set up in clubs|pg||

pc|c4|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes they will feel luck isnt with them|pg||
pc|c8|pc|h2|pc|c9|nt|april7: 3NT by E shouldn't be with a singleton @C from W's point of view ofcourse|pg||

nt|rmb1: 2@S = @C ?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sybarra: may nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: transfer to @C|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|april7: missunderstanding?|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: you would want to play 3NT here...a ot of work to make 5@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: may not have been my choice|pg||
nt|roswolf: and 3@C probably denies a fit|pg||
nt|panja: good scheme|pg||
nt|rmb1: Is East worth one try?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one would think so - but maybe 4@C would be natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: Difficult/dangerous/fearless for South to bid 10xxxxx at the 3-level VUL|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: it also depends on what 2NT-4@h means. This sequence may suggest slam-try vlaues  |pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d5|nt|april7: if 2@D is nonforcing; S should cue the @C|pg||
pc|d2|nt|panja: the thought itself is dangerous|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|ady: I used to play a direct raise to 4@S after 2NT was this kind of hand  but  the west hand would not have gone any further |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s8|nt|rmb1: There is room to play this sequence, or 4 level transfer, or direct 4@S as a mild slam try|pg||
pc|s9|nt|rmb1: Less so if partner can flash @HAKx|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sK|nt|patricck: I guess it depends how fast and loose you play the 1 level overcall...  |pg||
nt|roswolf: a spec says "not supporting with North is ridiculous" i agree|pg||
nt|april7: but  still forcing or not,that is the question!!!|pg||
nt|roswolf: true but you must bid the full value of your hand|pg||
nt|neobas: I like to play it as nf, can always cuebid with good hands|pg||
nt|april7: so, cue!!|pg||
nt|roswolf: agree|pg||
nt|patricck: The 6@C slam was worth 10 Imps to team 1|pg||
nt|mdgraham: useful to have a distinction between 2NT-3@h (xfer)-3@s-4@s and 2NT-4@h-4@S|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h7|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|d8|nt|rmb1: We all agree :)  I also agree that West would not accept|pg||

mb|3C|nt|roswolf: true in modern style and with junior elan|pg||
nt|patricck: A couple of nice 10's but no Aces and only 1 King i would have chosen to pass|pg||
nt|april7: going down on @D lead and S from N|pg||
nt|sybarra: Yotam,  this table being compared with Table 1 right |pg||
nt|roswolf: play may be tricky|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: not other table|pg||
nt|chick: E is being timid, but I think I'd bid 4@H ... double then cuebid normally shows about 20 pts|pg||
nt|rmb1: and a bit more work if clubs 4-0|pg||
nt|ady: some open the east hand   |pg||
mb|3N|nt|roswolf: south offerring an alternative|pg||
nt|rmb1: as long as 3@D isn't invitational|pg||
nt|roswolf: north should pass although he may still have a decision over 3@H|pg||
nt|panja: now was the 3@D bid an invitation of some kind or just a preference to @D?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: I play it as pref as does n/s|pg||
nt|panja: right, as it should be...|pg||
nt|rmb1: routine :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: 3@H*|pg||

pc|s5|nt|april7: 2 down on best defence|pg||
nt|ady: leaders may lose  ground here|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|nt|roswolf: n/s have performed very solidly thus far - no doubt now the commentators curse will strike|pg||
nt|rmb1: EW have only an eight card fit but maybe do not know about the dounble fit in @C which makes 3@H more attractive|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|panja: well..East opened 1@D..|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair point robin|pg||

nt|jcwla: Well, I think the value shown by that sequence changes when pd has shown 9-11 or so as here, have to be able to search for best game.|pg||

pc|s4|pc|c2|pc|s6|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|roswolf: probably phoney|pg||
nt|panja: East opened 1@C...and it is supposed to be natural...|pg||

nt|ady: another slam|pg||
nt|mdgraham: certainly swing potential in the last two boards|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|chick: Jordan, what would you play the 3@DX to mean if you were South?|pg||

nt|neobas: I recently started playing 2@H as both Majors and I must say I really do like it|pg||

mb|3D|an| |nt|jcwla: A or K|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might not be a pleasant spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: trump lead should be the norm here..|pg||
nt|rmb1: Previous stanza (different team) 1NT=12-16, 2@C GF relay|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North could simply ask for aces over the 1NT opening, whatever their methods are for that |pg||
nt|ady: north hand seems right for a direct ace asking bid and then appropriate level in diamonds|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|patricck: NS can make 4@S with the A@C onside and the Q@S probably being picked up, but it was never very likely they could bid it|pg||
nt|roswolf: as north i would have thought i must invite here -any idea about the range of 2@H?|pg||
nt|neobas: 6-10 probably|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok then not to invite|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|chick: assuming 3@H is showing a stopper, 4@C looks right for S|pg||
nt|chick: these are juniors, anyone want to bet on 3N?  :):)|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am betting on 6 @D |pg||
nt|jcwla: If I had one bid for my life as S it would be 6@C.|pg||
nt|sybarra: or 6 @C |pg||
nt|chick: all the kibs are voting for 5@D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, NS have presumably paid their entry fee, so they will want to make as many bids as possible|pg||
nt|rmb1: More IMPs back to Dumbovich on  18: 4@H-1 by NS 6IMPs|pg||
nt|ady: agree Mike   this auction should be around 4 bids|pg||
mb|4N|nt|roswolf: the attitude signal (reverse I am told) wont help south much here|pg||
mb|p|nt|neobas: I don't think I know any juniors who don't play weak 2 openings haha|pg||
nt|sybarra: will we hear 6 '@C?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or 6 @D?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or just 5 @D.... |pg||
nt|sybarra: my bet is on 6 @D |pg||
nt|sybarra: I like 5 @S as suggested by a spec |pg||
nt|jcwla: It is hard to imagine N not going on - a jump like this, right or wrong, should show this type of hand - including worry about @S that N knows is no problemo.|pg||
nt|chick: I think 5@D, N is still not sure how good S's clubs are|pg||
nt|sybarra: more I think about it 5 @S is right |pg||
nt|jcwla: And primo @C's.|pg||
nt|jcwla: N may fear that has shown better @C than actually has but that ship has sailed.|pg||
nt|sybarra: N should know 6 level is ok,   dont you think?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Totally.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm - this seems to be over-complicating things|pg||

mb|p|nt|rmb1: Hope South recognises this is the end of the auction|pg||
nt|mdgraham: This hand is ideal for one of Roland's unfavourite conventions|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: In open room, NS bid to 3NT on  3 but only -1 for flat.  On  4, NS got in to the auction and reached 4@H-1 for 5IMP (out)|pg||
