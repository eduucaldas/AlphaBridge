mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|5D|nt|roswolf: transfer to 4@S in reality|pg||
mb|d|nt|bjacobs: Not a problem - allows East to continue his lovely auction|pg||

nt|Walddk2: @DQ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Can he play @DQ?  |pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: if he plays @dQ now|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He really wants to get to dummy to take his pitch, and if North should happen to have @DK ...|pg||
pc|d5|nt|roswolf: indeed but just because you emerge smelling of roses doesnt mean you dont deserve the ordure|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bjacobs: Why so critical?  East is 7-5: he's backed his judgment and deserves the imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: homonnay hesitated a bit before playing the 3|pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: so now Gal thinks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The 10 would not have been a good idea|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|h7|pg||

nt|roswolf: Hove is damp but otherwise back to the action|pg||
nt|roswolf: do we know the systems?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Hanna|pg||
nt|panja: hi Hanna|pg||
nt|rmb1: starting out at paved patios between victorian terraces - it would spin from the off |pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: hi all|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w will reach 4@H here|pg||
nt|rmb1: With the @DA onside there should be no problem making 11|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/c play precision with a lot of relays i am reliably told|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s|pg||
nt|xenya: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: NS plays precision|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: they are chammpions  from Bejing and from Philly |pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Hanna - Vladimir and specs.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mdgraham: good evening all|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|xenya: the E hand is worth 1N|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|sybarra: may hear a X from S |pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone|pg||
nt|sybarra: or??|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Cornelia,  welcome|pg||
mb|p|nt|neobas: Hey all, welcome to some Israeli junior bridge|pg||
nt|roswolf: the first board is not the place for a psychic adventure|pg||
nt|rmb1: With the first pass being alerted (now withdrawn) I thought we were in for an exciting day|pg||
mb|p|pc|d4|nt|nigel_k:  4@h will just be showing a good raise to 4@s so North doesn't have enough to bid further|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Which is just as well since 10 tricks are the limit|pg||
nt|shevek: *I would prefer 4@h by East|pg||
pc|d3|nt|peachy: website http://www.bridzs.hu/verseny/20102011_orszagos_csapatbajnoksag_elodontok_donto_bronzmeccs   but it is in Hungarian|pg||

nt|vugraphzvx: i missed the first board|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: sry|pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West will not be disappointed with the @cQ in dummy  |pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: i will claim the result|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hi everyone from a rain sodden Manchester|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nothing new there, then|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's an odd double |pg||
nt|peachy: Hello Kath|pg||
nt|yo_yo: lovely name :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: asks for a heart lead, I guess|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it didnt do a lot of good |pg||
nt|yo_yo: here's one pic : http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=14233|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it was a good idea, just in case partner took it into his head to lead something else |pg||
pc|dA|nt|rmb1: Less likely to make 11 in 4@S (so much for predictions)|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@S as a final contract?|pg||
nt|rmb1: This is the second 16-board stanza of 4 in the semi-final, finals tomorrow|pg||
nt|ady: good lay of the cards for 4@S|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|patricck: Welcome everyone|pg||
nt|neobas: I must admit I have heard of the NS players but not the EW players|pg||
nt|patricck: I believe 1NT is the best bid on the North hand, tho I know it is't to everyone's taste|pg||
nt|april7: hello everybody and good afternoon|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the other semi-fianl wasa 33-33 after 16 boards |pg||
nt|nigel_k:  The problem is that 4@h could be far too much if partner has heart shortage|pg||
nt|shevek: 7-5 still....|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  But with some heart support or good diamonds opposite the East hand is huge|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and 5@h is only -1, if E can play @d the right way|pg||
nt|shevek: yes always 9 tricks in @h for EW, so even 5@h would be a good sacrifice|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|nt|Walddk4: http://www.israbridge.com/home/results/2011/jun11-f.pdf  for standings after round 8|pg||
nt|Walddk4: N-S leading by 10 miles|pg||
nt|Walddk4: E-W are young ladies|pg||
nt|neobas: I think it is fair to say the Israeli U21 and U26 teams have good chances of medals at every youth competition so we should see some good bridge here today|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|pg||
nt|shevek: always 2 losers in @d, one club and 1 heart|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rmb1: No there was a swing on the last board 38-33 to GAMAX|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hQ|nt|mdgraham: ah, sry|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  You might start with @dQ, or more likely a low diamond from dummy then guess right on the next round|pg||
pc|sA|nt|roswolf: this was a real auction - sacre bleu!|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If E bids 4@h on the first round he can follow up with 5@d......|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  It would depend who you think has short @d|pg||

nt|roswolf: welcome to the magical mystery tour|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi Adam - fine job last time|pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: thx|pg||
mb|1H|nt|vugraphzvw: in fact, if there is a director call, they don't have to call him too loudly, since I'm the director :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: lol|pg||
nt|roswolf: :):)|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: You have 500+ advisors ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Peter, did you wake up when they bid 7@S off 3 aces?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, they were off 3 aces - but the fourth suit was VERY well controlled: both the ace and a void|pg||
nt|roswolf: might as well punt 4@H|pg||
mb|2N|nt|bjacobs: Note that 1@S overcall, not double.  Generally, it's best to show your 5-card major in these situations|pg||
nt|pelu: No, Roland, I am still on my morning tea+toast|pg||
nt|psridhar: direct 4@H might not show 18 hcp, so he will take a circutious route to game|pg||
nt|roswolf: i understand bidding 3nt but not 2nt|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's ok - we don't have to understand it ... as long as they reach 4@H in the end|pg||
nt|roswolf: too true blue|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: may be 2N is F|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: not alerted|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphzvw: not alerted here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: well the tour bus stopped at the right stop|pg||
pc|dA|nt|pelu: but most pairs play 2@s here as forcing to 3@h . so...|pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: 2NT was forcing, 3@h was not|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: It's bridge logic that 2NT is forcing on this auction where responder has shown heart support. 2NT can't be a wish to play 2NT rather than 3@H|pg||

pc|s8|pc|s4|pc|sT|pc|sK|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|nt|Walddk2: 1@H  2@H  ;   2NT   is different because responder only committed to the 2 level|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d7|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|mc|11|nt|Walddk2: Here is forced to the 3 level, at least|pg||

nt|vugraphzyj: N signaled with the 9@s... and gave a trick away...|pg||
nt|sybarra: that hand may get some discussion .....|pg||
nt|rmb1: so we are in for an exciting day!|pg||
nt|roswolf: i have been doing bbo commentary for a long time and that was truly unbelievable|pg||
nt|xenya: action here|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps|pg||
nt|rodal f: A bit more interesting board.|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: hi all|pg||
nt|xenya: hi Csaba|pg||
nt|peachy: This is the first board of the 4th segment|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but South could have reopened with 2@d - or even 2@h|pg||
nt|peachy: 49 was...|pg||
nt|shevek: good point Ralf|pg||
nt|ralfwil: N is probably short in @d|pg||
mb|1H|nt|vugraphzvx: im ready with the names :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|april7: here EW might go go overboard but perhaps they will stay in a good 3NT contract|pg||
nt|sybarra: in the recap |pg||
nt|rmb1: 1@C strong artificial (I guess)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Csaba, so not Hanna:)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I prefer dbl as S. not 1@s|pg||
nt|shevek: 1@s is the correct bid by south|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  1@s for me too|pg||
mb|2S!|an|inv+|nt|ady: nothing much here    |pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: no :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: 6@C is a possible contrACT|pg||
nt|peachy: Looks like EW play prevision|pg||
nt|shevek: the idea is "don't double if you don't want partner to leave it in sometimes"|pg||
mb|3N|nt|patricck: 6@C is a lucky contract, but not 6@D|pg||
nt|ady: need to stop around 1NT|pg||
nt|peachy: precision|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: indeed think west should pass here|pg||
nt|neobas: I don't like the 3NT rebid tbh|pg||
nt|neobas: I usually play it as solid diamonds and a bit too much to open a Gambling 3NT|pg||
nt|april7: no W is thinking about a 6 @C contract and will have the luck to make it if he decides to do it|pg||
nt|neobas: Anyone for 3@D?|pg||
nt|roswolf: but 4@C may be ok provided they could stop in 4NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: is North worth a positive (if 1@c is strong)?|pg||
nt|ady: west may compete|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not easy to find a @D lead from W if 5@S|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  West has chosen to show a limit raise which is about right I think|pg||
mb|4H|nt|patricck: 3@D is the more normal rebid...  I don't think 3NT is such an ugly choice tho|pg||
nt|rmb1: I can't find convention cards on line: I think this is a picture of East http://www.bridzs.hu/node/184/52|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is sane so far|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: AH AH|pg||
nt|neobas: "My @C are more solid than your @D"|pg||
nt|roswolf: now a major cue?|pg||
nt|neobas: :)|pg||
nt|april7: now 4 @D and then 6@C perhaps|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 1nt?|pg||
nt|xenya: even 4@S goes down here on an inspired @D lead...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: not on a 3-suiter. We can miss all possible fits|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: Signaling Rule  2:  Never signal with a trick.|pg||
nt|shevek: east bid 3NT dutyfully|pg||
pc|dA|nt|roswolf: now e/w should get to 6@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: and   1 is?|pg||
nt|panja: 1@S pass might be the best spot...|pg||
nt|roswolf: we shall see|pg||
nt|panja: would have been difficult to make 7 tricks in 1Nt|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this looks like a normal pass for South now|pg||
nt|ady: cam ,ake 9 tricks in hearts|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rmb1: Another auction you do not see that often (with opener passing 1S)|pg||
nt|rmb1: In the other match, 1@C was an little as an ordinary 16, so North is probably not worth a positive|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rodal f: Easyer if E doubble|pg||
nt|xenya: now... -- no, almost impossible to find...|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: Lakatos is thinking|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|roswolf: must avoid 6NT|pg||
nt|patricck: 6@C can be beaten on a @H lead as long as when the Q@S is run on the first round of the suit South ducks|pg||
nt|april7: W should ofcourse pull trumps before giving up a @S|pg||
nt|roswolf: that would be tough i think|pg||
nt|april7: 6NT possible except on @H lead,but S will lead @H ofcourse|pg||
nt|patricck: sorry, stupid of me, diamonds don't need to be set up in clubs|pg||
nt|chick: Signaling Rule  1:  Every card is a signal (whether you mean it or not)|pg||
nt|peachy: well, I take it back, I really dont know|pg||
nt|chick: prevision is good too :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mdgraham: you come across lots of new things on BBO|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and 1@d-1@S=GF is sure new to a lot of us|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rodal f: Well. @H10 give a signal. Might it'll come|pg||
nt|xenya: great!|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rodal f: Yes. Well done|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|april7: well done!|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm that was cool|pg||
nt|neobas: NS will dislike the lucky slam this early|pg||
pc|hK|nt|roswolf: yes they will feel luck isnt with them|pg||
pc|s8|nt|yo_yo: new to me, yes|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|april7: 3NT by E shouldn't be with a singleton @C from W's point of view ofcourse|pg||
nt|roswolf: possibly|pg||
pc|h9|nt|chick: kinda depends on what 1@D means|pg||
nt|mdgraham: probably 13 cards, some of them high ones |pg||
nt|peachy: kib says 'short diamonds, may have both majors'|pg||
nt|chick: cute :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: EW plays precision|pg||
nt|sundiszno: hi all from the site|pg||
nt|peachy: He said already earlier, but I remember from earlier sessions (IFRC) that EW played precision|pg||

nt|jcwla: 20/20 hand|pg||
nt|xenya: incidentally, E could bid 5@D instead of 5@H, making things easier for partner |pg||
nt|sundiszno: we had some technical problems with the dealing machine, especially it is broken, so we dealt this set by hand|pg||
nt|sundiszno: if there'll be a misdeal, you won't be able to follow that, sorry for the inconvenience|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Would you call over 1@D with E?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sundiszno: hope it wil not happen|pg||

nt|panja: y|pg||
nt|rmb1: I don't like 2@S on 2 aces|pg||

nt|sundiszno: hungarian style :)|pg||
nt|shevek: 2@s a bit timid?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: the colours have dampenes west's ardour|pg||
nt|april7: easy 4@S by S with a safety play in @S cashing ace first|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Hasan A Zaidi|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3NT best|pg||
nt|yo_yo: maybe 3@H isnt forcing so he has to go thro 2NT?|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: south balance with suitable shape   only 8 hcp   but passed in first seat|pg||

pc|h8|nt|peachy: thx|pg||
pc|h5|nt|roswolf: is this imp pairs or mps?|pg||

pc|hA|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rmb1: weak NT and stayman|pg||
nt|rmb1: 14-16 in 3rd|pg||

nt|xenya: NS cam make 6@D on this layout|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Hasan|pg||
nt|xenya: what about 3N? |pg||
pc|sT|nt|panja: looks like S downgraded his hand...10 with 4333..|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah that explains the bidding which is remarkably sane|pg||
nt|xenya: again, good lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: The same help @DKX as needed in 6@D, but need to find @HQXXX in 6|pg||
pc|s5|nt|chick: not me|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ady: needed a club lead and heart return|pg||
pc|sA|nt|roswolf: i cant wait to see the next e/w effort!?:(:)|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|vugraphzyj: IMPS |pg||
pc|s8|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|panja: this will just make I guess..it needs backward @H finesse to make 9 tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmmph-  wanton waste of the @D7|pg||
nt|shevek: and on @d lead you know who has the ace :)|pg||
mc|11|nt|april7: otherwise losing 2 @S if K is singleton with W|pg||
nt|panja: strictly...pinning @HT...rather than backward finesse|pg||

nt|rmb1: Some one on BBF recommended leaving @D7 in dummy with no interest in the beer card, but hoping the defence would think you were interested|pg||
nt|xenya: two healthy results for GAMAX|pg||
nt|shevek: these vulnerable games have to be tried imo|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: (with a passed partner besides) :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yeah all the factors point to passing - but change one of them and I would have a grudging admiration.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: here's a Roland slam|pg||
nt|ady: as they lay a sllam is on for east west   can actually make 13 tricks with diamond position|pg||
nt|famus: fight for a partial spot here|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rodal f: 19HP EW for best spot|pg||
nt|peachy: rhis hand looks dull to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: "dashing"  3 @C  |pg||
nt|rmb1: 2@S = @C ?|pg||
mb|2D!|an|transfer|nt|sybarra: may nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: transfer to @C|pg||
mb|d|nt|peachy: 1S limited opening, nax 15|pg||
nt|peachy: Max|pg||
mb|2H|nt|april7: missunderstanding?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: must be natural 2@C, not drury|pg||
mb|3D|nt|patricck: you would want to play 3NT here...a ot of work to make 5@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: may not have been my choice|pg||
nt|roswolf: and 3@C probably denies a fit|pg||
nt|panja: good scheme|pg||
nt|rmb1: Is East worth one try?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one would think so - but maybe 4@C would be natural|pg||
nt|shevek: dbl = tko of @h|pg||
mb|3H|nt|rmb1: Difficult/dangerous/fearless for South to bid 10xxxxx at the 3-level VUL|pg||
nt|peachy: good guess Kath :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: it also depends on what 2NT-4@h means. This sequence may suggest slam-try vlaues  |pg||
nt|shevek: very gutsy...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|april7: if 2@D is nonforcing; S should cue the @C|pg||
nt|peachy: Breathtaking bravery vulnerable|pg||
nt|yo_yo: looks like Dumbovich has converted a plus score to a minus|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Those kind of doubles are dangerous because RHO might redouble and you don't have much defence|pg||
nt|shevek: vulnerable too....|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Especially when you're not even sure a diamond lead will be best|pg||
pc|h5|nt|panja: the thought itself is dangerous|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: I used to play a direct raise to 4@S after 2NT was this kind of hand  but  the west hand would not have gone any further |pg||
pc|hT|nt|peachy: Maybe W didn't double because his partner opened in third seat, potentially dogpoo|pg||
nt|mdgraham: interesting turn of phrase... |pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|shevek: declarer can pitch a @s on the 4th club|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ralfwil: declarer must play on @s and not @c finess to make (discard a @c on 4th @s)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|rodal f: Why did S want to be in? @C from N would been best|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rmb1: There is room to play this sequence, or 4 level transfer, or direct 4@S as a mild slam try|pg||
nt|yo_yo: we are struggling with south's name, we cant abbreviate it|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|rmb1: Less so if partner can flash @HAKx|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agree with West, though. Why double opposite a third-hand opener and possibly struggle to get 200? Not worth it   |pg||
pc|cA|nt|chick: Spell it "south" :)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Or a club on the fourth spade :)|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|nt|patricck: I guess it depends how fast and loose you play the 1 level overcall...  |pg||
nt|roswolf: a spec says "not supporting with North is ridiculous" i agree|pg||
nt|april7: but  still forcing or not,that is the question!!!|pg||
nt|roswolf: true but you must bid the full value of your hand|pg||
nt|neobas: I like to play it as nf, can always cuebid with good hands|pg||
nt|april7: so, cue!!|pg||
nt|roswolf: agree|pg||
nt|patricck: The 6@C slam was worth 10 Imps to team 1|pg||
nt|mdgraham: useful to have a distinction between 2NT-3@h (xfer)-3@s-4@s and 2NT-4@h-4@S|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|famus: easy ride now|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rmb1: We all agree :)  I also agree that West would not accept|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|neobas: I believe the scoring is IMP pairs so the tables are just linked so we can at least get some comparison|pg||
pc|c6|nt|shevek: :)|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|nt|neobas: I might be wrong though :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes aless imaginative sequence|pg||

nt|yo_yo: some good suggestions from the kibbs :)|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||

nt|roswolf: with these players at the table i would expect the 3 level at least|pg||

nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|psridhar: 3@d can make but not 3@h|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|d|nt|bjacobs: Not 3@H?|pg||
nt|roswolf: diamonds seems to be agreed now as the trump suit|pg||
nt|psridhar: Is W keeping 3nt in play?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: 3@H can make, but perhaps you rate to lose to @DQ on this auction|pg||
nt|psridhar: no one knows abt @c of course|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@D looks appropriate now|pg||
mb|3H|nt|roswolf: :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: West wants to show his good hearts, but still maintain a plus position.  It's hard to do|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And on this auction, East might think he's forced to bid now|pg||
nt|pelu: in my book 2@S ? 3@H = forcing|pg||
nt|roswolf: a spec predicts 3nt now|pg||
nt|psridhar: this shd be f|pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: what does rdbl means?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: after 1@d-x?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Redouble is some sort of blame-transfer bid|pg||
mb|4H|mb|d|nt|bjacobs: Oh I thought you meant redouble after 2@S - pass - pass|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: well my initial prediction about the level was right|pg||
nt|psridhar: Gamax is about to get off the schneider now|pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: if this contains all strong hands, then this 2@s can only be invitational|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|psridhar: d1 or d2 depending on @d guess|pg||
pc|s6|nt|roswolf: the axe was always likely to fall|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|psridhar: now no need to guess @d|pg||
nt|pelu: need @C now|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, if the first redouble contains all strong hands, then perhaps 2@S doesn't game force.  But many partnerships don't make that restriction|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pc|c7|pg||
nt|bjacobs: They prefer to allow natural (and potentially game-forcing) bidding to occur after 1@D-double|pg||
nt|psridhar: @s ace was played in the air other tbl too, but deal records show declarer ruffed dummy's @s winner , inexplicably|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Declarer should be able to get out for one off - discarding his potential diamond loser on the third spade|pg||
nt|roswolf: this may not be so clear for south|pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: especially if they lead A from AK|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: but than where is east's invitational hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: west's|pg||
nt|pelu: easy for S to play @cA - then he can "see" 4 tricks for defense|pg||

nt|ady: another possible slam|pg||
nt|famus: :) well--no further comments on riding Frank--lest we venture into imaginary visions|pg||
nt|rodal f: :)|pg||
nt|xenya: on 34, EW were allowed to play 5@H in the other room -- down one doubled and 5 imps to GAMAX|pg||
nt|shevek: because he led a trump!|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: +710 is the sort of result that you are slightly worried about|pg||

nt|ady: 6@C    on aclub finesse|pg||
mb|1D|nt|nigel_k:  Spectators correctly pointing out that playing on spades not clubs would make it easier to avoid this kind of problem|pg||
mb|d|mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|2D|nt|patricck: Yes, IMP pairs, not teams as I was thinking|pg||
nt|sybarra: the text books will tell you to land in 4 @H here|pg||

nt|rmb1: XX 3 card raise|pg||

nt|jcwla: 3@D 3@H 4@H|pg||
mb|3H|nt|panja: now will @S make?|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: NOW THE LAW DECISION?|pg||
nt|panja: will 3@S make rather..?|pg||
nt|chick: a club lead won't help much, they need to find the spade sac|pg||
nt|shevek: east should pass this|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: true in modern style and with junior elan|pg||
nt|patricck: A couple of nice 10's but no Aces and only 1 King i would have chosen to pass|pg||
nt|april7: going down on @D lead and S from N|pg||
nt|sybarra: Yotam,  this table being compared with Table 1 right |pg||
nt|roswolf: play may be tricky|pg||
nt|peachy: as we are not getting comparisons, you can spy on the other table via this link, watch both tables simultanously                                http://www.bridge...|pg||
nt|peachy: base.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: not other table|pg||
nt|chick: E is being timid, but I think I'd bid 4@H ... double then cuebid normally shows about 20 pts|pg||
nt|rmb1: and a bit more work if clubs 4-0|pg||
nt|ady: some open the east hand   |pg||
nt|mdgraham: North deciding discretion is the better part of valour - can they find their 5/5 spade fit? |pg||
nt|peachy: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
pc|c2|nt|roswolf: south offerring an alternative|pg||
nt|rmb1: as long as 3@D isn't invitational|pg||
nt|roswolf: north should pass although he may still have a decision over 3@H|pg||
nt|panja: now was the 3@D bid an invitation of some kind or just a preference to @D?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|yo_yo: redouble, does it mean happy to play in 2@C xx?|pg||
nt|chick: apparently not|pg||

nt|panja: right, as it should be...|pg||
nt|rmb1: routine :)|pg||

nt|chick: 3@H*|pg||
nt|panja: because 3@H was an option for invitation as Andras(kib) points out..|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and why not 3@s from S?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I think South has nothing extra after the double|pg||
nt|shevek: because they are vul?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|april7: 2 down on best defence|pg||

pc|c3|nt|famus: meant|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@D ask for hold I belive. |pg||
pc|c9|nt|roswolf: n/s have performed very solidly thus far - no doubt now the commentators curse will strike|pg||
nt|rmb1: EW have only an eight card fit but maybe do not know about the dounble fit in @C which makes 3@H more attractive|pg||
nt|xenya: accurate prediction, Hasan|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|panja: well..East opened 1@D..|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair point robin|pg||
pc|h3|nt|roswolf: one of my rules when playing against juniors is in defence ALWAYS be prepared that they are MINIMUM for their bidding|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|panja: sorry..1@C|pg||
nt|famus: a @d ruff ought to see this home|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, I think the value shown by that sequence changes when pd has shown 9-11 or so as here, have to be able to search for best game.|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT on the same finesse as 6@C  on the spade lead|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|roswolf: probably phoney|pg||
nt|panja: East opened 1@C...and it is supposed to be natural...|pg||
nt|rmb1: But 1@C only shows four in the sleepy back-waters of Acolland (e.g. Devon and Sussex)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|c5|nt|peachy: As opener, I would have passed Rdbl, but ithe XX was alerted so they may have a specific agreement on it|pg||
pc|d4|nt|april7: S can make 3@D so no swing|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|jcwla: Nice thoughtful X by N of the 3@D.|pg||
nt|rmb1: Can cash @CA to drop the king and then @D finesse|pg||
nt|ralfwil: perhaps 1@s with 10 black cards is a little bit weak|pg||
pc|s5|nt|chick: perhaps, but should E not bid 3@H over the X?|pg||
nt|famus: but GAMAX seem to b on a roll--in the other room|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|yo_yo: well they missed their game|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|yo_yo: depends on getting the trumps right|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|pc|sJ|nt|famus: a @s back n a @c pitch by declarer|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y. 3NT and @H lead for +2|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ady: suppose cpould cchoose to finesse diamond   pr cash ace and king of diamonds   and when queen does not appear  take club finesse|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: i think i get that|pg||

nt|psridhar: well coped Adam :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: i hope it wont happen again|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think i would bid it bill|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A gutsy alternative is to pass|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If not pass, then 4NT saying: "pick a minor"|pg||
nt|roswolf: that would be my second choice|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And if you belong to the chicken society, you bid 4 of a minor yourself|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: a nice red suit sac on the cards!?|pg||

nt|rmb1: Now 4@D retransfer :)|pg||
nt|ady: certain to bid game I would think|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1N=2D=3D=4D=4H is always a test of partnership understanding|pg||

nt|roswolf: this is practical|pg||

nt|vugraphzvx: it was orkc|pg||

nt|april7: if 3@D is positive, why not 4NT by E!!!???|pg||
nt|neobas: All depends on methods|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed |pg||
nt|roswolf: west should blackwood hinself i think|pg||
nt|april7: it only depends on aces and ofcourse sometimes which|pg||
nt|april7: 4NT by W doesn't serve much|pg||
nt|roswolf: sorry that adds a different dimension|pg||
nt|neobas: 4@S looks to show 9 tricks with @S as trumps|pg||
nt|april7: interchange ace of @H with ace of @C and down you go|pg||

pc|h2|nt|neobas: Never argue with success :)|pg||
nt|april7: W must continue with the 2 aces, E has only 19 points, could easily have more|pg||
nt|patricck: EW don't get any plus scores except when they bid slam :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: quick claim|pg||
nt|april7: well done|pg||
nt|jcwla: Light opening by S.  Double a reasonable choice by W.  N might have bid @S.  Nobody has anywhere to go over 2@C.|pg||

mb|p|nt|pelu: but 5@c prob also making - strange that East in CR didnt bid 4NT = ps pick a minor|pg||
nt|bjacobs: all right, now it's a lot more complex, and depends on E/W's methods|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: In my experience you should get in rigtht away over the multi|pg||
nt|roswolf: the multi may well keep e/w out of game|pg||
mb|2S|mb|d!|nt|psridhar: they just wait for 2@S for t.o X and lebensohl|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Now 2NT (Lebensohl) followed by 3NT by East SHOULD show a game going hand but with only a single spade stopper|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would have raised to 3@S as north|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|pelu: most players bid 1. time on the W hand D = 13-16 balqnced or 17+|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Instead, it looks like he's just happy to show some values with 3@d - a small underbid, but not a huge one|pg||
nt|psridhar: as Roland observed , if W had overcalled 2nt -raised to 3nt , N has to guess the major his pd has|pg||
nt|pelu: he expo a weaker hand by pd|pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: or you can play against multi: x: one-suiter major, 2@h/2@s t/o double of that suit|pg||
mb|3S!|mb|d|mb|p!|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: this auction is fast entering the Twilight Zone|pg||
nt|roswolf: since 3@D should deny 4 hearts then i feel west may settle for 4@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The bottom line is that you must get in on your first turn. It's much too complicated if you wait|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Next you see is  3@H  3@S to you|pg||
nt|psridhar: doesnt 3@D also deny clubs-so effectively EW have no fit now |pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Totally agree Roland.  A simple approach is "double of 2@D shows a sound opening hand"|pg||

nt|famus: 5@s @dA and @hA= -1|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's an easy game to play badly |pg||
nt|peachy: It is typical Precision bidding philosophy: one side asks, the other answers, opposite of natural bidding where hand qualities etc. are often shown instead of asked|pg||

mb|5D|nt|patricck: NS need to play an early club to beat 4@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: easts pass was odd imo but may pay dividends|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: this wont play well|pg||
nt|shevek: @cA, @c ruff, etc....|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: wrong suit and the singleton is on lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: you got it Patrick:)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  But there are still 11 tricks after that|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: but a club ruff lets it through as spade loser goes on fourth heart?|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|nt|xenya: this can be defeated but not so easy |pg||
nt|famus: shud b -1 with proper ddef|pg||
pc|s6|nt|roswolf: if they keep their t/o dbls up to strength - there is a real argument they should pass 3@H BUT the girls have induced the phantom|pg||
nt|april7: 4@H ven makable if @C are not opened|pg||
nt|patricck: If North's 2@S said he didn't like spades much then South bought a very lucky hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: south's bid is ill disciplined|pg||
nt|april7: what should S lead against 4@H?|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|shevek: south remembered that he "passed" for a @s lead :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|roswolf: south shouldnt have reopened i think but then i can understand the temptation to do so|pg||
nt|peachy: 1@C = 16+, the rest alerted and I don't have info, syscards are available on the hungarian website, but only in hungarian |pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: we know that about west: he has 5@s bal or 5@s+ club suit|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|nt|nigel_k:  Tough problem for declarer|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|peachy: The operator in the other room told that the score on board 53 is incorrect here. 4D made. Operator made an error in claiming.|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: 4@s bid = choose a minor|pg||
pc|dK|nt|famus: tuff under lead @d|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|rmb1: Tricky to make 3@H on this layout|pg||

pc|d6|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mdgraham: ty|pg||
pc|d5|nt|patricck: probably would lead a dimaond and the contract makes|pg||

nt|ralfwil: must clean trumps now and play on @h|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d8|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|nt|roswolf: there is an argument for a @D but a top heart is natural|pg||

nt|roswolf: what did i say at the start wild and macho bidding!?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Apart from this result, it also warns the opponents off an 8-card spade fit should they happen to have one|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why would I open 1@S when I have both majors is my reasoning for not doing it|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Among several 100 others|pg||
nt|psridhar: you could shorten it to " why would i open"|pg||
nt|roswolf: south needs to cash his trump ace and then play a red suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: for the max i think|pg||
nt|roswolf: deathwish 2011|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ask Peter (are you here?). According to him there is no such thing as a "3rd seat opener". Open if you have enough, don't if you haven't|pg||

nt|yo_yo: 3@S is often a splinter but obviously not with NS|pg||
nt|peachy: This could be interpreted as splinter, if they have splinter on card|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not so much a spade splinter, more a spade plank|pg||
nt|peachy: does North have any reason even to think over 3S?  Apparently he wonders whether it is or isnt|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: looking common these days for aceless 11-hcp to be opened even vulnerable in second seat|pg||

mb|3H!|an|doubleton !h|mb|p|nt|jcwla: For sure.|pg||
nt|shevek: if they don't ... :)  they shouldn't open flat 11 in 2nd seat vulnerable anymore |pg||
nt|nigel_k:  From South's point of view, North could still have as many as 15 HCP|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  He may stop but it would be a big position|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|famus: time for a drink here--cheers all--am today for irish whisky|pg||
mb|p|nt|pjs_ch: big difference between 11 hcp and 15 in bidding a slam|pg||
mb|3N|an|WK hand|mb|p|nt|neobas: Oh, right, miscounted haha|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it does seem a slightly odd treatment, having 3@s here pre-emptive. Maybe 1@s followed by 2@s would be more constructive|pg||
nt|peachy: Dumbovich is an active bidder, we have evidence plenty in this match.  Kibitzer messages are highly disapproving of 3S and I agree|pg||
nt|peachy: Moreover, both opponents are passed hands so there was not much to preempt anyway|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's good to be an active bidder actually, very annoying for opposition|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: South presumably knows there is no fit|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: he could always try with a quantitative 4N|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  They can probably find a tenth trick somewhere as long as they get no higher than 4NT|pg||
nt|shevek: minors don't split, so anything higher than 3NT is too high|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|shevek: ok, they earned the right to do it again :)|pg||

nt|mdgraham: told 2@s= 5@s+4@h  inv |pg||

nt|yo_yo: difficult to choose between 4S and 3NT for West|pg||

mb|1S|nt|roswolf: do we know the systems|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Walddk2: 14-16 first, followed by comparisons from the closed room when we circle back to board 1|pg||

mb|p|mb|5D!|nt|roswolf: i trust 3@D wasnt natural!:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H!|nt|bjacobs: 5@D will probably be exclusion|pg||
nt|psridhar: Here is the first of the series u were predictinng Geoffrey !|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: In this case, what they will be excluding is a making contract|pg||
mb|7S|nt|roswolf: why are we now in the stratosphere!?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But 5@D is a serious overbid|pg||
mb|d|nt|bjacobs: And the 0/3 response has been humorously misinterpreted|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: as is 7@S :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: maybe north thinks there is a misdeal|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Cash @SA before partner revokes!|pg||
nt|psridhar: Gal evidently expected more for that 3@d bid -judging from the confidence he has on the 0/3 rkc reply|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Presumably, East should have bid 5@S, and expected West to continue with the 3 aces|pg||

mb|1S|nt|roswolf: the preempt may actually help them here|pg||
nt|shevek: in the open room, exclusion BW gone wrong, 5@d = how many aces outside @ds|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2S|nt|rodal f: A coffe board.|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: looks like Exclusion Blackwood got an ambiguous response, and East hope for 3 aces not 0|pg||
nt|shevek: 5@h = 0/3 , 7@s gotcha :)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|yo_yo: pass if you have nowt, bid if you have a bit of help|pg||
mb|3H|nt|roswolf: and the support too - n/s have more room|pg||
nt|rmb1: South must surely double, trusting that if partner passes he has done the right thing|pg||
nt|roswolf: another educated punt likely|pg||
nt|peachy: or semiforcing 1NT, I just cannot see any benefits of that :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: ah science!|pg||
nt|rmb1: At least you are not worried about top losers|pg||
nt|shevek: east shd bid 5@s, pass with 0, bid with 3 kinda|pg||
mb|4H|nt|rmb1: No obvious contract for EW, happy to let NS find somewhere to stop|pg||
nt|chick: sort of like an invitation that you beg your partner to accept :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: perfectly redundant Ace ask|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or? Feel EW a bit active now|pg||
nt|chick: semiforcing is a joke, sort of like semipregnant|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: 2nd highest from rubbish|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: i agree but there may have been a grand on|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: there is a defence to 4@H|pg||

pc|sA|nt|rmb1: Carefully avoiding the grand|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ady: trump leadsare best here|pg||
pc|s8|nt|xenya: GAMAX leads by 25 imps at this point. Considering a likely game swing on 45, Royston will have their work cut out for them in the last segment. |pg||
nt|yo_yo: the 9 is mostly doubleton or from an interior sequence with us|pg||
nt|peachy: North in the hot seat, must guess which suit to swith to, I think with spade continuation this could make|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he will surely switch |pg||
nt|peachy: *switch, pardon my repeated typos, I have two fingers in each hand numb :(|pg||
nt|chick: with declarer leading spades back, hard to imagine not switching to a club|pg||
nt|chick: I'm told that the low @S3 was suit pref for clubs|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes, confusious say:  when 2 lead same suit, one wrong|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|nt|psridhar: and that W seq of H,H and C is weak 6-4 , else he wd hv bid 2c at his 2nd turn|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In some circles you don't double a grand slam when holding trump ace. That is an unwritten rule in Sweden for example|pg||

mb|2H|nt|peachy: 1S = 11-15, could be sghir (Precision)|pg||

nt|peachy: North-South have shown throught the match that they are active bidders|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no that's if they preempt a major|pg||
nt|peachy: This one sure gives E a problem|pg||
nt|chick: I don't ... yes I know the theory that you are preempting 2 opponents and only 1 partner, but with a Hxx in a major, it's going to cost when partner has that major, like here|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: scheduled restart in 20 mins approx|pg||
nt|peachy: Doing it in second seat with this kind of hand could be hazardous to your score, partner is odds-on to have a good handm there is already one passed opponent....|pg||

nt|ady: a thin 3NT here  assume  north 2@C shows 5 clubs and a 4 card major    or 1 suited clubs?|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: @D are 3-3 it is not all over yet|pg||

nt|shevek: @cK led in OR|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|peachy: South of course doesn't know the running score, he might have tried to get a swing, perhaps he would not have doubled early in the match,|pg||
nt|chick: All I can say Kath is that if I ever have the pleasure of playing with you, I hope you are this understanding a partner :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: errr  not always :)|pg||
nt|peachy: 6D would have been making, neither side found it|pg||
nt|chick: the question is, would they have found 6@D without the preempt?|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: I always learned that KQ was given to you to solve the lead problem|pg||
