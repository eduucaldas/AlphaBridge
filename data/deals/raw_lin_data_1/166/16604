nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
nt|peachy: Good afternoon kibs!|pg||
nt|garnetts: That band of brothers lol|pg||
nt|bridge_one: board 1 is always difficult :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: sry boards seem to be wrong|pg||
nt|daman: small slam is on    can make the grand if you bid it|pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: these are the wrong hands|pg||
nt|idc: well done for spotting that Hugh - it happens, we will wait patiently|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Now OK Hugh ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: yes|pg||
nt|peachy: CAMROSE LIVE RUNNING SCORES http://bridge.silvertexter.eu/|pg||
nt|roswolf: this was a strange board in the other room|pg||
mb|1D|nt|Walddk4: South is Matheson|pg||
nt|paulg:  Welcome back everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Walker is playing in the open room|pg||

mb|1S|nt|lestergold: Good afternoon welcome all|pg||
nt|justin c: reasonable 6@S here|pg||
nt|justin c: hi Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Justin|pg||
nt|peachy: NS system card http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/systems/ConvCardCoVo.pdf|pg||
nt|disa: i guess N-S might still br talking about last board|pg||
mb|d|nt|bridge_one: strong @C also for E/W|pg||
nt|toobad: good evening all|pg||
nt|peachy: http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/systems/hanlon-mcgann.pdf  EW system card|pg||
nt|garnetts: very interesting hand--who does it belong to?  |pg||
nt|idc: Both pairs here 15-17 NT and 5 card majors|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|justin c: NS, in theory|pg||
nt|peachy: EW system card http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/systems/roderick-best.pdf|pg||
mb|2D|nt|diablo666: Actually 10 in clubs normally just mean that you don´t like the suit, rare with Lavinthal in these positions in Sweden.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D is interesting - SUCTION - one suit in @H or two suit @S@C|pg||
nt|justin c: 3@D = shortage|pg||
nt|sybarra2: the dealer all day has been less than kind re distribution  |pg||
nt|idc: Last set saw Matheson open a frisky 3rd seat 9 count, but this is more than I'd expect from him|pg||
nt|sybarra2: so this is a frisky 5 count|pg||
nt|bridge_one: not ok|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
mb|3C|nt|garnetts: Good afternoon everyone |pg||
nt|peachy: http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/systems/TeddSalisburyCC090918.pdf  NS system card|pg||
nt|rmb1: But are NS English or Welsh?|pg||
nt|justin c: let them bid a bit more :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: EW have nine tricks in spades and NS 11 in clubs --but not perhaps in hearts |pg||
nt|idc: Well spotted Hugh - this looks like right board (at least it matches other matches Bd1)|pg||
nt|daman: I would have raised North's 4@S bid had I held the South hand|pg||
nt|daman: tell those guys to get in the program Hugh|pg||
nt|idc: I'm sure operator just typed in final contract to avoid getting behind table|pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: sry had to catch up not sure the opening lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: yes|pg||
nt|peachy: Welcome back, this is the second half or WBU-Scotland match|pg||
mb|3D|nt|odysseus69: welcome to this all-ticket confrontation|pg||
mb|4C|nt|paulg:  Walker is *thinking* in the other room Roland|pg||
nt|justin c: rehi all|pg||
nt|peachy: Website for Camrose resultsm running scores, and other info http://www.cbai.ie/|pg||
nt|lestergold: perfect fit here but still difficult to find slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|greerm: good evening, this is the first CAmrose cap for Willie Hamilton, brother of Ian, we wish him well|pg||
nt|garnetts: South did very well to start with 2@C|pg||
nt|rmb1: Much easier when your suits break 3-2|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would have thought that the ability to show short @d might have excited Selway given his control reach no trump not to mention 5 spades|pg||
mb|d|nt|chick: NS can make 3N pretty easily|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  pretty similar systems for both pairs, 5-card majors, strong 1NT and three weak 2s|pg||
nt|greerm: Willie has also represented Northern Ireland at fencing in I think the Commonwealth Games|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: this is on a diamond guess -- not too hard considering N has opened|pg||
nt|peachy: An easy hand to start with, no special problems for declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: the lead J@S is a surprise holding QJ10987 in @H|pg||
nt|justin c: a @h and a @S to lose here|pg||
nt|justin c: who is winning this event lately?|pg||
nt|roswolf: easy sequence so far the last double was silly imo - n/s are on tilt|pg||
pc|dK|nt|po-s: EW can sacrifice in 4D or S|pg||
nt|chick: If they think the 3N is making, yes :)|pg||
nt|justin c: saw WBU in the lead for a while yesterday|pg||
nt|justin c: If 3@S for East, which looks more normal, still not clear they would get there|pg||
pc|d6|nt|odysseus69: dummy was a disappointment - |pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but South think to find a suit better that @H, because his K in @C is very bad after 3@C by W|pg||
nt|garnetts: at least there is no money involved |pg||
nt|odysseus69: with a banced 15 it is normal to bid 3NT over 3D - but sometimes it can lead to a big penalty though not here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: difficult to find a discard from dummy|pg||
nt|odysseus69: diamond looks best|pg||
nt|garnetts: would you have expressed an opinion about 3NT Victor ?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i am too much of a coward - but you would be there David - what do you think about club king as alternative lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think it best for the usual reasons |pg||
nt|justin c: am told CBAI in the lead by 1 point|pg||
nt|andersk: My exspiriense is, when u pay oy 1700, its better to be quiet, for all!|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h8|pc|h5|pg||
nt|garnetts: Good afternoon all |pg||
nt|garnetts: http://bridge.silvertexter.eu/results/1O3.TXT  |pg||
pc|h9|nt|chick: but would still be more for NS than this will be |pg||
nt|po-s: or think that 4S makes|pg||
nt|lestergold: they had the kit to reach slam and Erichsen used it but Selway opted for the conservative |pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
nt|roswolf: i remember once in a very strong event my pard and i had a mixup over a multi sequence which cost -2300 we nver said a word and won the match and reached the final|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|nt|bridge_one: the question is: the opps probably have 9 tricks - the lead @H try to beat the contract finding any good layout - the lead @S need to find more cards |pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|pg||
nt|garnetts: should have held this ace up too perhaps |pg||
pc|c4|nt|xenya: uptrick now|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
nt|rmb1: WBU is the Welsh second team.  The hosts for the second weekend of the event are invited to send a second team (to both weekends)|pg||

nt|nicksan: Now, they're too high|pg||
nt|bg: with this bidding structure just have to wait until they stop:)|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|garnetts: Maybe it is a sequence that happens once every decade and they forgot |pg||

nt|chick: I look forward to seeing what happens at the other table :)|pg||
nt|justin c: would it not be better to invite another country to join in rather than have two teams from same place?|pg||
nt|roswolf: this could be exciting|pg||
nt|daman: I know he did that   I was making light|pg||
nt|peachy: cashing the second heart would have removed any diamond guess (not that there was much to uess)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|justin c: could end up anywhere|pg||
nt|lestergold: plenty of disaster potential on thisn deal|pg||
nt|justin c: isnt there :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: very optimistic sequence in the other room expect a @D partscore here|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: yes, open weak NT :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: especially if n/s declare|pg||
nt|lestergold: now what do u bid with north's  monstrou8sn hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: dbl|pg||
nt|justin c: double|pg||
mb|d|nt|rmb1: If they were to invite a team from the near continent (France/Netherlands) they would win :)|pg||
nt|daman: lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: very difficult slam to reach|pg||
nt|lestergold: followd by no trumps i expect|pg||
nt|roswolf: the rebid is trickier|pg||
nt|diumraid: *** Live Overall Scores - CAMROSE *** http://bridge.silvertexter.eu  then "browse results" then 1o3.txt  *****|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Good morning everyone |pg||
nt|justin c: hi all|pg||
nt|idc: Sorry George, humour deserted me for a minute :)|pg||
nt|xenya: 5@D looks best here -- might not be easy to reach|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: they are so aggressive that is possible to see 3@H now|pg||
nt|paulg:  normal high level bridge, three passes to you and then no-one passes before your next call|pg||
nt|chick: first they have to get into the bidding|pg||
nt|peachy: Second seat Vul maybe kept Salisbury from opening|pg||
nt|peachy: not unreasonable at all, when the suits are minors|pg||
nt|po-s: if he bids 3C I will leave|pg||
nt|peachy: heh PO|pg||
nt|justin c: isle of man suggested by two kibs|pg||
nt|garnetts: I am not at all convinced by that %@C effort --do you think he thought he had no defence |pg||
nt|garnetts: 5@C |pg||
nt|justin c: tho judging by what i saw yesterday, they too might win|pg||
nt|justin c: this lacks aces|pg||
nt|lestergold: south has no choice|pg||
nt|justin c: 2@H-2NT-3@D perhaps|pg||
nt|roswolf: west might regret that|pg||
nt|lestergold: and now brown cow?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: 2@s does not play that badly north will be endplayed a lot|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is a shootout at high noon|pg||
pc|h6|nt|odysseus69: I dont know much about the Welsh pair. They will do well to restrainIrelands leading pair|pg||
nt|garnetts: clear cut 3@D bid now |pg||
nt|odysseus69: and then 3NT?|pg||
nt|chick: whew!!   we want po to stay!!|pg||
nt|garnetts: quite--why bid over 4@C ?  I think its a sort of reaction bid--failed to think first |pg||
nt|justin c: now 2NT i think|pg||
nt|justin c: and 3@D for S|pg||
pc|h9|nt|idc: which given its normal standard, some would say is a blessing|pg||
nt|idc: Rather a view from West but he's escaped the @d lead so no harm done|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|chessmaste: All five of us!|pg||
nt|peachy: I am happy you can stay now po|pg||
nt|roswolf: disaster looms if south shows a 2 suiter|pg||
nt|lestergold: and now will Tedd give up|pg||
nt|sybarra: is this correct?|pg||
nt|daman: it seems to me Stayman would have been helpgul|pg||
nt|daman: f*|pg||
nt|idc: 2@s is a range probe, so I guess 2NT showed minimum|pg||
nt|sybarra: but I doube N bid 3 nt|pg||
nt|sybarra: *doubt|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bridge_one: in money game DBL now for sure |pg||
nt|justin c: quality that counts Mark|pg||
nt|po-s: thanks, I maintain it is a difficult hand to find slam on|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bridge_one: in IMP competition need to be more safe|pg||
nt|justin c: speaking of quality, this 3NT contract lacks it|pg||
nt|justin c: horrible contract, but neither N nor S can remotely put a red card on it|pg||
nt|garnetts: Nothing exceptional here|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not clear cut is it?  |pg||
nt|roswolf: i dont think so|pg||
nt|lestergold: he should be able to envisage the near yarborough opposite|pg||
nt|roswolf: and the guns ring out|pg||
pc|dK|nt|paulg:  3@c is a brave call as Sime was not guaranteed a fit (Matheson might hold five hearts for example)|pg||
nt|greerm: helpful lead|pg||
nt|paulg:  blame the 2@s bidder|pg||
nt|justin c: so i guess this will just drift several off|pg||
nt|odysseus69: very respectful of partners balancing action|pg||
nt|garnetts: Probably done well to pass as 3NT needs the diamond finesse and thats certainly not clearcut |pg||
nt|garnetts: this contrcat needs the same view I suppose too|pg||
nt|garnetts: I am afraid that I would have overcalled with 2@S earlier |pg||
nt|po-s: even without an opening by West|pg||
nt|justin c: had a feeling this auciton would end with a red card from somebody|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|greerm: when the other 3 suits look dangerous too|pg||
nt|lestergold: he hasnt got the message but Selway comes to life and gives it to him|pg||
nt|xenya: hardly any problem with 3N though -- with the club suit blocked|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|s9|nt|garnetts: South will just cash three aces in a while--and if I were east i would be thinking of some acerbic comment |pg||
nt|rmb1: South cash out now!|pg||
nt|roswolf: who forgot to axe!?|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm prepared to double 3N with an A and a K but frightened to double 4@d holding 4 trumps to the Q|pg||
nt|lestergold: seems inconsistent to me|pg||
nt|roswolf: the welsh have escaped a nasty wound|pg||
pc|d4|nt|garnetts: I think we would all bid this the same way |pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|garnetts: have to say a club looks so obvious I wouldn't even think about it |pg||
nt|idc: South's lead brings up that old chesnut about leading from 2nd longest of two suits|pg||
pc|c6|nt|odysseus69: I would like to be in 3NT - and maybe right to take the diamond finesse|pg||
nt|roswolf: dummy may cheer south up a bit|pg||
pc|c3|nt|garnetts: But then what do I know |pg||
nt|idc: Mind you, I expect South used the lack of Stayman as a reason for trying a major|pg||
nt|sybarra: but also doubt S could/would pitch the @s |pg||

mb|2N|an|has clubs for him|nt|odysseus69: not much to get excited about here|pg||
nt|rmb1: We didn't think of that!|pg||
nt|justin c: was thinking a @S lead will beat 5@H EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: where they would presumably play after a higher @D preempt|pg||
nt|garnetts: I had some antiquted idea that a busybody on some laws committee said you could not psyche your sides strong bid--perosnally I would make it compulsory |pg||
mb|3N|nt|paulg:  i'm not sure the Scottish East will bid 2@s, but West may push anyhow|pg||
nt|peachy: at least according to sys card, which was is it :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: Hallo all|pg||
nt|paulg:  You can find the convention cards for these pairs at http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/camroseteams.htm|pg||
nt|diana1: hi all and welcome to the first match in this year's Camrose series - the home internationals|pg||
nt|sheila a: South's hand is pretty poor but NV she figured it was worth a pre-empt|pg||
nt|greerm: not a brilliant contract but...|pg||
nt|paulg:  impossible for anyone except Deep Finesse or GIB to find the @cK lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: south will show his shape nopw with 3@c|pg||
nt|lestergold: well he chose to show club guard i prefer 3@c as it serves same purpose but shows void heart|pg||
nt|peachy: surprising turn in auction|pg||
nt|xenya: well of course NS know their system better than me, but i would never pass with the S hand |pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: there is no lead that will do any good here--and a spade costs |pg||
nt|peachy: 1C is their only strong opening |pg||
nt|roswolf: transfer to clubs?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Welcome to Lars Andersson|pg||
nt|bridge_one: N/S are playing strong @C or not ?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 12 on spade lead- 11 on rest|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphzxd: they are :)|pg||
nt|bt: thx roland, good to be here|pg||
nt|garnetts: I like 3@S now |pg||
pc|d4|nt|garnetts: I know it is fashionable but I think the opening bid is dreadful |pg||
nt|justin c: no game for EW with the @SK wrong|pg||
pc|d2|nt|po-s: just forcing probably|pg||
nt|peachy: 2NT showed max, either bal or with support|pg||
nt|rmb1: That regulation has been dropped (in England)|pg||
nt|justin c: ive never been clear on what qualifies as psyching your strong bid|pg||
nt|garnetts: Let me be clear I would rather chew my own arm off than open with 3@D |pg||
nt|justin c: saw a 2@C opening yesterday on a solid @S suit and not a lot else|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hi Lars :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N by default as we may have predicted|pg||
pc|d8|nt|diablo666: Hi|pg||
nt|garnetts: thats a pretty well thought out sequence |pg||
pc|dT|nt|Walddk5: http://bridge.silvertexter.eu/results/1O3.TXT for running scores|pg||
nt|po-s: I think he should appreciate his spade doubleton as extra trick value in a club contract|pg||
nt|idc: I'd feel a little worried as West not having bid @c at all, but it has worked well enough this hand|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|pg||
nt|lestergold: 8 tricks easy but where is 9th coming from?|pg||
nt|lestergold: im not convinced that heart was best lead|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bt: it seems skara is still winning, but 2 game swings will put it in jeopardy|pg||
nt|lestergold: a bit busy on this misfit auction|pg||
pc|c6|nt|chessmaste: Nothing to the play - 10 tricks|pg||
nt|chick: Being declarer did have some value in protecting his two AQ holdings|pg||
pc|c5|nt|garnetts: wastes energy thinking here when you know its a spread |pg||
nt|lestergold: i prefer spade passive|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|roswolf: well should get overtrick imps here|pg||
pc|h9|nt|justin c: after 2@C-2@D-4@S, partner passed and put down an ace and a king etc|pg||
nt|rmb1: opening 2@C (strong, artificial) on South hand would be a psyche|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think we sort of disagreed on that lol --it was EW here that bid it |pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|garnetts: it has almost certainly kept EW low which is to their advantage |pg||
nt|justin c: potentially West being put in with the 4th @S to lead into the @HA7 at the end|pg||
pc|cA|nt|garnetts: However-- I would rather bid anyhting than 3@D --its sending a boy on a mans errand in spades |pg||
nt|lestergold: Tedd could now try to establish his long heart|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|pc|c9|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|bridge_one: another line would be to play 5 round of @C before the finesse in @H|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|idc: Runing the clubs can lead to a squeeze for 11 tricks I think|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c3|nt|po-s: I suppose declarer might have had 4135 with more points and worse clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: i cant see a genuine play for this contract|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|bridge_one: to take informations about the distribution - but probably the use 4th lead, so @D 4/4|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|andersk: E squeezed for 11|pg||
pc|cT|pc|d9|pc|h5|nt|idc: North has to pitch to singleton @s, then hearts and South squeezed in @d & @s|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|c8|pc|s3|pc|d7|pc|sJ|pg||

nt|Walddk3: and welcome to Vladimir Ivanov|pg||
nt|bt: skara needs 12 vp i think|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: Sorry for the delay all we are live at last|pg||
nt|sheila a: I know from experience that it takes a while to get the vugraph running smoothly|pg||
nt|Walddk4: What was the contract and result on 17, guys?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: OK; done|pg||
nt|paulg:  we have seen a lot of two-suiters tonight, perhaps the theme of the weekend|pg||
nt|greerm: 3C+2 by Norht on 17|pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: ok we are back! lost the play on 19, sry|pg||
nt|garnetts: well played :)|pg||
nt|justin c: 3NT for EW here|pg||
nt|roswolf: really only 10?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|diana1: the pre-empt worked well|pg||
nt|paulg:  the play on 19 would have been uninteresting, we can live without it :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: figured as much :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: North has a clear 3@S opening in my view these 6-4 hands usually play well and the spades are pretty good |pg||
nt|odysseus69: will South double 3 hearts?-|pg||
nt|justin c: nv against vul looks like a 5@D opening to me|pg||
nt|peachy: EW play Benji Acol, strong NT and 5-card suits (incl diam)|pg||
mb|d|nt|diablo666: Skara playing their first year in "Elitserien" doing a fantastic job, a true outsider looking to win.|pg||
nt|paulg:  1NT is 14-16|pg||
nt|vugraphzzh: sorry +2|pg||
mb|1S|nt|diana1: the Northern Irish pair play a pretty basic system with weak NT and 4-card majors|pg||
nt|odysseus69: if he does willNort pass|pg||
nt|peachy: NS play Acol and 4-card majors|pg||
nt|justin c: which might get a huge result if you find a @S lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: I absolutely agree|pg||
nt|justin c: choice of games to play here|pg||
nt|xenya: popular auction |pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: yes and about as difficult to make as the last one |pg||
mb|2C|nt|paulg:  Charles and Vi Outred play a system developed by Charles, something akin to Polish Club|pg||
nt|sheila a: NS are likely to bid too high with that tasty @c suit|pg||
nt|garnetts: If NS get to some number of no-trumps there is a classic intra finesse position in clubs |pg||
nt|justin c: 3NT by N maybe here|pg||
nt|peachy: Even those who do not pass if they hold a King as responder, surely will pass this time|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: it is like fc copenhagen winning the champions league|pg||
nt|Walddk3: :)|pg||
nt|bt: oddswise|pg||
nt|diana1: why do I never seem to get suits like that?:)|pg||
nt|paulg:  as it happens a direct 5@c would work as West would lead a spade, but now wrongsided|pg||
nt|greerm: promise 3H maybe|pg||
nt|paulg:  tough for Willie now, doubling with a void always a concern|pg||
nt|justin c: y indeed|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2@S or 3@S Victor?  |pg||
mb|2D|nt|sheila a: 2@d showed both majors, 2NT obviously some kidn of transfer|pg||
nt|sheila a: Question is what 3@c showed|pg||
nt|paulg:  East has made a vulnerable overcall of a strongish 1NT, so I think pass rather than double is prudent over 3@c|pg||
nt|diana1: I think most people these days treat 14-16 NT as a strong NT|pg||
nt|greerm: difficult for east too|pg||
nt|paulg:  impossible for East|pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: double explained as promising 3 @Hs|pg||
nt|garnetts: Lets see if they can do it in defence |pg||
nt|justin c: close to 3NT for NS|pg||
nt|garnetts: this will tell us |pg||
nt|odysseus69: the ultra conservative approach continues|pg||
nt|garnetts: I bet he would bid 4@H over 3@S |pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|greerm: seems a simpel 1 off, anyone see anything lese?|pg||
nt|justin c: too early for difficult contracts|pg||
nt|justin c: off on a @C lead |pg||
nt|lestergold: 43/ spade game looks reasonable but 3N makes with the favourable position in the minors|pg||
nt|justin c: seems to me 5@D needs the @D finesse and nothing else|pg||
nt|bridge_one: read now ACOL for e/w, but 5 cards Major|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Give us Man Utd|pg||
nt|bt: what are the chances of that roland?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Non-existent|pg||
nt|bt: seems board 23-24 are slightly favorable for skara|pg||
nt|bt: well skara is winning here so|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i like 3S bur expected 2|pg||
nt|justin c: while 3NT needs a @C position also|pg||
nt|lestergold: east was bound to bid 3N with his q high holdings |pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: Looks like the same ten tricks too|pg||
nt|rmb1: X|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://bridge.silvertexter.eu/results/1O3.TXT  for running scores|pg||
nt|justin c: another double?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|diana1: very hard for Vi to imagine that Charles has also 3 losing @hs|pg||
nt|sheila a: I suppose she might have made a try for 3NT, not that it helps on this hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: technically he should have passed 3@d but risks worth taking for vul game|pg||
nt|daman: 3NT is the par spot|pg||
nt|xenya: plat du jour, so to speak|pg||
nt|roswolf: ouch|pg||
pc|d6|nt|idc: Declarer could try for extra tricks in either black suit?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|justin c: S might have continued here|pg||
nt|idc: spades works well, clubs maybe not so well|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|bridge_one: North can make 1Nt if opps play 4 round in @H also with return @D guessing @C figure|pg||
nt|garnetts: my current pet idea 6-4 with a reasonable six carder open three|pg||
nt|daman: spades work for sure|pg||
nt|roswolf: that double was for t/o probably|pg||
pc|dK|nt|garnetts: For me yes--I would give it one more try |pg||
nt|justin c: if only to play 3@D|pg||
pc|d8|nt|xenya: but this might make|pg||
pc|dT|nt|odysseus69: he knows where the king of clubs is so ak of hearts then ace of clubs|pg||
nt|bridge_one: losing only 2 @H can try both |pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|sK|nt|garnetts: North might just float it |pg||
pc|sA|nt|bt: the natural play works|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but right start @S|pg||
pc|s7|nt|diana1: so early on in the match she is probably going for what she thinks is the safest thing|pg||
nt|paulg:  all the reasons are there to make North declarer on this hand, but it just did not work here|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think that west should bid 1@D rather than pass--playing a system where 1@C can be short alolows you to respond on garbage when you have short clubs  |pg||
nt|odysseus69: oops- bad play|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer gets it right|pg||
nt|lestergold: ten tricks now|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: wasnt difficult on the lead|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|nt|bt: did north just discard a winner?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|garnetts: so was that |pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|daman: had better play a @H now to save IMPs|pg||
nt|bridge_one: E/W play 1@C 2+C and 1@D = 4+cards|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|c8|pc|c7|pg||
nt|peachy: even a magician would go down|pg||
nt|roswolf: ouch |pg||
nt|roswolf: south has endplayed north|pg||
pc|cT|nt|xenya: home now|pg||
nt|bridge_one: could play also @S for the A and small @C at the Q|pg||
pc|d9|nt|bt: no probs yet for skara but ...|pg||
pc|cA|nt|justin c: with @S1098 can afford to try the @C finesse, still safe |pg||
nt|justin c: going a few off in a 3-2 fit at 100 a trick is an expensive business|pg||
nt|odysseus69: club ruff was a stand out - bad play all  round|pg||
nt|garnetts: Now three clubs and exit with a @D or a spade |pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|s8|nt|rmb1: Cross ruff and pick up @CJ might jsut make|pg||
nt|justin c: y|pg||
nt|idc: N-S play Smith Peters but North clearly not able to play spades in a meaningful way|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@C and 2@d are strong open  -  2Maj weak 5+cards|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok all sorry I have to leave for a lunch date,  have fun |pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk3: Maybe you could tell the audience where in the world Skara is located (other than in Sweden)|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like E needed to play a diamond early to set up 7th trick for his side|pg||
nt|bt: i dont know?|pg||
nt|bt: where is it?|pg||
nt|bt: :-)|pg||
nt|diablo666: Skara is about 150 km northeast of Göteborg.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|justin c: @DQ, @D ruff, @H ruff low|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|bridge_one: for north need to find A in @C in East - then now @D is correct|pg||
nt|bt: close to åmål, of movie fame?|pg||
nt|roswolf: cruel|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bt: "f.....ing åmål"|pg||
nt|bridge_one: bye shirley|pg||

pc|h2|nt|diablo666: Nopr, wrong side of Lake Vänern :) .|pg||
nt|bt: wrong side of sweden also :-)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4 imp|pg||
nt|bt: 17 and 18 coming up are exactly what skara wants|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|pg||
nt|paulg:  would everyone double 3@s? Or is a risk you just need to take?|pg||
nt|greerm: I think most bid 4C|pg||
mc|8|nt|rmb1: timing is wrong now|pg||
nt|justin c: i think he is off now, isnt he|pg||
nt|rmb1: spade discard from N stopped the ruff|pg||
nt|justin c: predictably|pg||

nt|rmb1: More on a non-spade lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: but very hard to find unless West bids |pg||
nt|justin c: @S lead stopping 6@H|pg||
nt|idc: Best game here is 4@h on 4-3 fit|pg||
nt|peachy: two-way club again, 11-13 bal OR strong|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sheila a: This is the slight downside to the Multi, in that it's easier for E to come in over 2@d than 2@s|pg||
mb|4S|nt|greerm: 3NT?|pg||
nt|justin c: but the chances of doing so were dramatically improved by N endplaying S|pg||
nt|rmb1: Now it will be difficult to stop East|pg||
nt|idc: not great, but if you must get to game that's probably the best shot|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but down the same playing @s by North |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|garnetts: this theme came up in the first set--do you guys think 1@S is best or 2@C?|pg||
nt|garnetts: Canape opening |pg||
nt|garnetts: interesting |pg||
nt|garnetts: Now no one will know who the hand belongs to --if North pre-empts |pg||
nt|lestergold: Erichsen has opted top make a cautious bid here but selway will bid again |pg||
mb|p|nt|diana1: very true|pg||
nt|justin c: i think souths pass suggests playing in @D|pg||
pc|h5|nt|garnetts: likely to finish in a partcsore --1NT or 2@S |pg||
nt|justin c: 2@C for me|pg||
nt|idc: even on @c leads you can probably beat it by keep pounding on clus|pg||
nt|disa: at least they got 2 imps for the squeeze good for upplyfting|pg||
pc|h4|nt|greerm: not the greatest dummy but has chances|pg||
nt|greerm: in theory 4@C 2@S 2@D and 1@H |pg||

pc|hT|nt|justin c: 3NT or 4@S here i think|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 4@S is possible|pg||
nt|garnetts: I must admit I would have bid 4@S over 3@D --I think it is right to pressurise here |pg||
nt|garnetts: EW really missed a chnace in my view |pg||
nt|idc: clubs|pg||
nt|xenya: no beating around the bush here -- indeed 4@S by E looks a good practical bid |pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|paulg:  i don't think they can, but a few concerns for declarer|pg||
pc|sK|nt|paulg:  the upside is that West may not have a cue bid available|pg||
nt|garnetts: Norman did well to avoid 2@C |pg||

nt|garnetts: strange auction on Board three in the OR  and they failed to double the final contract and still gained 5 imps |pg||
nt|odysseus69: The Irish South must have heard your tip David - he opened 3D with 6-4 on board 2 and picked up 5 imps|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bt: we had an undo. makes more sense now. maybe there should be a bid for the west hand|pg||
nt|djneill:  I like 2@c as well|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|garnetts: well I agree I much prefer 2@C |pg||
nt|daman: he has to run his @Ds and hope the oppspitch poorley|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think @h now|pg||
nt|daman: still only 8|pg||
nt|bridge_one: hoping @S return|pg||
nt|idc: I love that expression!|pg||
nt|daman: right     good thought|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes perhaps a little encouragement for the next match|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|justin c: for one thing, 2@C to be followed with 2@S is more economical than 1@S then 3@C, as here|pg||
nt|garnetts: he did--but I wouldn't bid it with a side major unless partner had passed laready |pg||
pc|s8|nt|justin c: which has helped N find the best lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: no choice here simple heart finesse for 9|pg||
pc|s9|nt|justin c: intra the @S suit :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: Yes I forgot we all overbid here nbecause we are such great card players these days |pg||
nt|chessmaste: Will not be easy - at the very least needs an intra finesse in spades  |pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|sheila a: I think if partner bids one major have to use the other as a cue|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Always easy to overbid from the commentators seat|pg||
nt|garnetts: If plays the intra he likely looked --he will surely try and ruff a club and try ace and another spade|pg||
nt|chessmaste: I suspect he will struggle whatever he does|pg||
nt|lestergold: after discovering the bad news in clubs of  course|pg||
pc|h8|nt|idc: How did your game go last night?   Oh, we were opppspitch poorley|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bridge_one: J|pg||
pc|h9|nt|garnetts: He surely did not play the Q@H  |pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: yes :)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: A cunning fasle card Mr B. |pg||
nt|justin c: helping declarer to finesse the @H10 later|pg||
nt|garnetts: it was a bit windy not to double 4@C |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|d3|nt|garnetts: maybe that is a better idea than helping partner--|pg||
pc|dK|nt|xenya: 2@C by W would have been the winner, but perhaps that is not allowed by their system|pg||
nt|daman: :)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|garnetts: He must be so glad he played that Q@H now |pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|bt: people usually dont work much on 1X-(1N)-?? in their system, pretty common auction|pg||
nt|disa: that is the beauty of this tournament iceland has a lot of bridgeplayers and they love to play this event|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|greerm: looks like defence can make it difficult but not quite difficult enough|pg||
nt|greerm: @C now only postpones it|pg||
nt|paulg:  a club now would force declarer to guess the layout|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bridge_one: N/S have @D, greter that @C|pg||
nt|garnetts: and does show the five four shape you actually have--C plus S  not the other way round |pg||
pc|d7|nt|rmb1: OK 12 tricks on a non-spade lead was a bit double-dummy|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|odysseus69: veer windy- partner opened 3D vulnerable in 2nd seat and it looked like 4 tricks in his own hand|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|garnetts: he has to play a club --no option |pg||
nt|chessmaste: No reason to play the king here - unless you are on declarer's side|pg||
nt|garnetts: and it almost makes the intra finesse a possibility --just because of a false card--strange game |pg||

pc|s6|nt|greerm: difficult for East|pg||
nt|justin c: against 4@S, can cash @HA@DA then 4 rounds of @C, promoting @SK, for 500|pg||
nt|disa: if only the best played the field wouldn't be very big|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|diablo666: 2cl is allowed, but i suspect the closer we get to the final board the more reluctant EW will be to stuck out their necks :) .|pg||
nt|xenya: are we stuck?|pg||
nt|peachy: cashing two diamonds off the top would have worked for defense but in real life a diaomnd lead from N is never coming|pg||
pc|sT|nt|bt: still possible to do something|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|justin c: the @H finesse not as simple as all that here tho|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|c6|pc|c4|pg||
nt|justin c: if S had @HK, would have been squeezed|pg||
nt|lestergold: erichsen has no choice but he will take the heart finesse with confidence as the bidding and discards mark the heart K with  North|pg||

nt|rmb1: Do EW know how to bid when they actually have values ? :)|pg||
nt|justin c: i still dont see it|pg||
nt|justin c: south would blank the @HK rather than let himself get put in with the fourth @C|pg||
nt|lestergold: well we have a coffee break hand |pg||

nt|vugraphzzh: this is rigth|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: 3NT EW here|pg||
nt|garnetts: looks like 4@H -1 if east opens |pg||
nt|peachy: regular weak two, imagine that :)|pg||
nt|daman: some number of @Ds EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: yes and it makes |pg||
nt|daman: unless they try to slither into 3NT by East|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: the spade pips make 3NT the best game|pg||
nt|justin c: 3NT or 5@C for NS here|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Another easy game for NS|pg||
nt|lestergold: at those colours north was rather likely to have one high card|pg||
nt|roswolf: a more sedate hand|pg||
mb|1N|nt|chick: not tooo regular, bad suit, bad hand, first seat vul|pg||
nt|justin c: 3NT here |pg||
nt|garnetts: The point about the last hand is that not evryone will bid 1@S and when he did--they should have reaped the rewards|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  4@d splinter?|pg||
nt|justin c: 2NT 20-22|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no- probably 1 down regardless - i failed to spot club position|pg||
nt|peachy: Second seat vul would be worse, at least in first seat there are two opps to preempt|pg||
nt|peachy: prepared club, 1D, 1H, and 1S would be 5-card suits for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: 3@C 5 card stayman|pg||
nt|rmb1:  2 was flat in 5@CX-1 on the same auction: West raising with defence and little chance that 5@C was making|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: Not all weak NT players would open the E hand 1NT|pg||
nt|paulg:  3@c is a very wide-ranging call .. i think North will be a little nervous until dummy hits|pg||
nt|justin c: looking for 5-3 @H fit|pg||
nt|garnetts: well a club will be out of the question and if South makes a passive trump lead it won't make--attacks with a spade curtains too |pg||
nt|idc: This should be comfortable unless declarer decides to play North for @d length|pg||
pc|s5|nt|toobad: oops|pg||
pc|sT|nt|greerm: a spirited dbl by I H|pg||
pc|s2|nt|odysseus69: trump looks normal|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|bridge_one: another push board|pg||
nt|diana1: pity Burns didnt bid 2@c to show sme sort of a weak hand with majors as then Lindsay may have found a 3@s bid which does very nicely|pg||
nt|paulg:  perhaps H & H |pg||
nt|garnetts: that will not take any prisoners either |pg||
nt|garnetts: I quite like the 2@C bid--good psyche|pg||
nt|justin c: coffee time here|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2@C may be systemic: clubs or GF balanced, as some play; but its not on their card|pg||
nt|lestergold: as well as the distibution markibng south with 3 hearts 2 of mwhich he had discarded i admiot that it would have been good la to rapidly blamnk the K but it does not happen opften ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: in practice|pg||
nt|bridge_one: thid Dbl by south give too much informations at declarer|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer may need to pick the @H suit|pg||

mb|p|nt|diana1: so it wouldnt surprise me if the other E/W pair find their @s fit on that last hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  West removing socks to count points|pg||
nt|sheila a: In the other room they're playing strong NT so would open 1@s|pg||
nt|odysseus69: most of world are opening balanced 11s (not me or Maddocks)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: this is the type of slam you want to be in when it makes|pg||
nt|xenya: not sure about declarer's line though -- playing on spades rather than clubs looked better|pg||
nt|justin c: not a lot of imps going to move around on these first boards|pg||
nt|garnetts: true- nothing to say is there?  |pg||
nt|justin c: possible 4@S here|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3NT likely ?|pg||
nt|garnetts: 5@C good  --possible 4@S   but not 3NT |pg||
nt|lestergold: will do well to reach the 5/2 heart fit game|pg||
nt|justin c: when West bids @H and @C, think East might get them to the right game|pg||
nt|idc: Quite a shock...|pg||
nt|peachy: again, 11-13 bal, or strong|pg||
nt|xenya: might be a dangerous hand for both sides|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bt: i thought this was the 1@S = i have 13 cards|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@S suction - so one suit hand in @C or two suit @D+@H|pg||
nt|justin c: East hearing a lot of bidding, considering his hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: well I would bid that now |pg||
nt|bridge_one: interesting hand now|pg||
nt|peachy: N must be smacking his lips with anticipation|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: if I think of anything, will let you know|pg||
nt|djneill:  short and to the point|pg||
nt|garnetts: Me neither Victor--I spend my life on here moaning about it --don't care what you do in third seat but dreadful in 1 and 2 |pg||
nt|odysseus69: cant understand 1 heart|pg||
nt|justin c: this was a @H partscore for NS|pg||
nt|justin c: great cards in his partner's suits|pg||
nt|xenya: well W has stuck his neck out (not that i blame him) -- now things look bleak for them|pg||
mb|2C|nt|bt: kinda both hands actually|pg||
nt|paulg:  and a weak 5-6 hand with a void in partner's suit is probably not what you were looking for, but things will improve|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: NS clearly keep 1@D to show at least four--so 1@C maybe tow|pg||
nt|diumraid: ** CAMROSE LIVE RESULTS ** http://bridge.silvertexter.eu  then browse results then 1o3.txt|pg||
nt|lestergold: west ot strong neuf to rebid his clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: east m,ay probe now with 3@c|pg||
nt|peachy: W is a bit thin for entering the bidding|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bt: @C and @D+@H|pg||
nt|paulg:  i guess 2NT shows 22-23 balanced|pg||
nt|sheila a: N couldn't be blamed for leading a @h against 3NT, which won't be a great success|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: back to my usual comments about opening bad 11 counts |pg||
nt|odysseus69: maybe they play Drury- if so North would be troubled- but ok|pg||
nt|garnetts: not much I do understand about the bidding these days --but if 3@D is a splinter they have done well |pg||
mb|2N|nt|peachy: I would guess Rdbl says equal length? whaddya think Vladimir|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: I am getting too old --I have never liked drury much either |pg||
nt|idc: North risking an overbid to make sure they find a major fit - not a huge overbid mind you|pg||
mb|3C|nt|paulg:  could be blamed now :)|pg||
nt|diana1: yes probably or else he is upgrading his hand and showing the normal 23-24|pg||
nt|lestergold: no selway has shown excellent judgment |pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: what is 3NT supposed to mean?   3@S I get but 3NT?  |pg||
nt|odysseus69: 5 clubs now enough|pg||
nt|odysseus69: maybe thinking about 4 clubs but not a good idea|pg||
nt|odysseus69: partner marked with 4-4-1-4 now|pg||
nt|garnetts: what is 3NT then?  Am I being stupid?  |pg||
nt|odysseus69: i thinh- only 4 hearts|pg||
nt|xenya: oh sure -- and vulnerable too -- but hard to resist the temptation|pg||
nt|peachy: trump lead seems obvious to me|pg||
nt|andersk: I would prefeer 1 NT replay instead of 2 @C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|greerm: 6-5 come alive |pg||
nt|garnetts: No need to play a 4-3 fit--why risk it |pg||
nt|xenya: yes, i think redouble says pick your longest major|pg||
nt|roswolf: so would i|pg||
nt|roswolf: well the partscore is bid|pg||
pc|h4|nt|paulg:  2NT is a minor pre-empt, so they may play some form of kokish|pg||
nt|djneill:  David are you saying that East can use the information from the opening now to find the big honors?|pg||
nt|justin c: 9 imps to wales for making 3NT on brd 20|pg||
nt|justin c: intra finesse in @C, as predicted|pg||
nt|justin c: (east doubled the opening bid, making that the indicated line)|pg||
nt|garnetts: partly yes--also it makes life hard for partner knowing when to compete--and also leads to too many abd contracts |pg||
nt|garnetts: no objection in third seat though |pg||
nt|justin c: certainly reassuring on this board to know the @HA is in S, so you have an entry for @S tricks|pg||
nt|garnetts: there was an earlier hand where North had a nine count after partner opened but did not compete on board 19 |pg||
nt|peachy: this lead COULD have been brilliant on another layout|pg||
nt|idc: Just looking at E-W hands 5@c is a possible sac but cards lie badly|pg||
nt|bridge_one: need to ruff otherwise down|pg||
nt|andersk: If my partner cant bid over 1 NT, we dont have game|pg||
nt|disa: most players would play 2C as some sort of drury|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bridge_one: 4@S with A A and Q of trump is conservative|pg||
nt|bt: y i agree, was a sweet hand|pg||
nt|diana1: yes I think they do|pg||
nt|sheila a: If Vi knows this is from 3 she can duck|pg||
nt|garnetts: I see what you mean--3@S shows maybe five hearts and 3NT  4-4-4-1   nice |pg||
nt|idc: And as you note, 4@h not made yet|pg||
pc|hA|nt|odysseus69: trump lead would solve all|pg||
nt|garnetts: the lead isn't exactly damaging is it |pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|paulg:  still only four tricks for the defence ... really need to lead both blacks suits to trick one|pg||
nt|djneill:  I think South can consider many things here, it is hard to know which is best|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course AQ is very adequare support opposie rebid hearts|pg||
pc|hT|nt|bt: i assume west didnt splinter because of @CA singelton, and east then assumed no shortness, thats the only explanation for 4@S on such a prime hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  and, naturally, continue both blacks suits when in with the diamond|pg||
nt|garnetts: well a @D was |pg||
nt|garnetts: it would have inconvienced east --make him need to get hearts right I think |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|garnetts: EW using reverse attitude|pg||
nt|peachy: I would have never guessed a club lead in this auction|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps this is the worst lead of the tournament|pg||
pc|c7|nt|paulg:  it's clearly a very good hand when partner shows four in one of your suits|pg||
pc|c3|nt|justin c: this is where the auction helps him|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||
nt|chick: being brilliant by underleading an A against a suit contract should be reserved for the newpapers|pg||
nt|bridge_one: A@D|pg||

nt|roswolf: yes indeed although it is not common in england -used to be banned for a long time|pg||

nt|bt: unlucky for örebridgen maybe|pg||
nt|sheila a: thank goodness that hand is over, Paul's analysis was too confusing for me |pg||
nt|toobad: that will settle them|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think even the mouse would bid 4@s there|pg||
nt|greerm: we are getting our moies wworht this set anyway|pg||
nt|chessmaste: As a diversion I saw an excellent film last night - The Kings Speech|pg||
nt|justin c: if you dont know where the @HA is, could get the play wrong form that point|pg||
nt|peachy: although either one was successful|pg||
nt|idc: Small lead for Scotland, Walker/Short in other room stopping in 3@d sensibly on Bd 5|pg||
nt|disa: never knew that when was it alllowed|pg||
nt|vugraphzzh: talking at table this was not drury|pg||
mb|1N|nt|greerm: i dont think EW play acol 2 |pg||
nt|paulg:  weak twos|pg||
nt|greerm: so difficult hand for Willie H|pg||
nt|paulg:  Sime might even bid 4@s here|pg||
nt|garnetts: looks like a routine 3NT |pg||
nt|bridge_one: slam for E/W depending on @D 2-2|pg||
nt|idc: Hmmm, almost a 4 or 6 hand if West plays in @d on @sJ lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: I see Sime-Matheson were lured into doubling 5@h on board 3|pg||
nt|sheila a: Aha, the 2-way @c springs into action|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@c is 11-13 balanced or any strong hand .. Lindsay will think he knows which|pg||
nt|paulg:  generally best to pass with very strong hands|pg||
nt|sheila a: It looks as if EW play 2-suited jump overcalls but maybe not over a murky @c|pg||
nt|odysseus69: looks like back to 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 3@H are ON - 3@S down finding the ruff in @C|pg||
nt|paulg:  sorry, I might even bid 4@s here .. Iain will settle for two spades|pg||
nt|toobad: not after 1280|pg||
nt|peachy: NS play Acol style|pg||
nt|justin c: another 3NT...|pg||
nt|garnetts: maybe 4@H  |pg||
nt|lestergold: junior imn gae to me senior in bridge|pg||
nt|dagold: you are what?|pg||
nt|roswolf: it was permitted in england some 10 years ago if i remember correctly|pg||
mb|p|pc|cT|nt|bt: they went down in slam and may have to leave 1st division|pg||
nt|bt: not that 6@S was that great|pg||
nt|justin c: imdb says colin firth is in it|pg||
nt|justin c: u sure about this mark?|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer could get out for -2 via an endplay -- +800 is juicy, particularly as 3N by NS is by no means cold|pg||
nt|disa: not the best lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: the weak nt strikes|pg||
nt|andersk: I would have overcalled|pg||
pc|c2|nt|xenya: chance for Bjorken now?|pg||
nt|roswolf: nope always lead a major if a weak nt is opened unless you have an obvious sequence|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|paulg:  it seems that 2@c should be a strong 1-suited hand|pg||
nt|justin c: NS could get into trouble here|pg||
nt|garnetts: you should work out why a @D back is best--North clearly must have two or three clubs only so play partner for the right @D holding |pg||
nt|nagini: :)|pg||
nt|chick: If S thinks that is the @DA, he could get carried away|pg||
nt|garnetts: but not likely on this start|pg||
nt|lestergold: u are junior to me in age and senior to me in bridge i think that is fair to say|pg||
nt|dagold: well written|pg||
nt|idc: Meaning if you have a @d loser, can't even make game, so you might as well be in slam as 5@d|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes , so better call 6 :)|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|disa: i have a feeling that N-S are not very expirenced|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|greerm: will not take long to play 3N|pg||
nt|toobad: next board|pg||
nt|paulg:  Sime saved an overtrick|pg||
nt|paulg:  conceivable that some may bid 6@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: for a change|pg||
nt|dagold: North could double|pg||
nt|bridge_one: only 3Nt is safe|pg||
nt|bridge_one: played by East|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sheila a: Lindsay will want to do something more|pg||
nt|paulg:  double is most flexible|pg||
nt|paulg:  at least you are on lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: Lindsay interrogating Outred...|pg||
nt|diana1: it says on their convention card that 2@c over a strong 1@c opening is natural|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think 3@C is what this rebid is worth |pg||
nt|garnetts: 3NT looks on too |pg||
nt|garnetts: Q@H has its attractions |pg||
nt|justin c: 2@D?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bridge_one: yes - 4@H too much :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 10 tricks probable - 9 certain|pg||
nt|chick: safe now|pg||
nt|dagold: double more flexible but may miss 6-2 diamonds|pg||
nt|dagold: hope Espen doesn't bid 3@C|pg||
nt|dagold: he might|pg||
nt|lestergold: having opened with a 9 count and already rebid  his clubs i would have beedn surprised to hear 3@c|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 6@C are on also over @D 2-2|pg||
nt|idc: Having bid fairly strongly tilll now, East may not cooperate much more - West may just have to blast slam|pg||
nt|bridge_one: South is really thinking ?|pg||
nt|peachy: E giving tempo or trick with any lead|pg||
nt|peachy: not fun :)|pg||
nt|xenya: E endplayed at trick 1?|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|bridge_one: sry, 4@H too much (my yes was for pass at 3@S)|pg||
nt|paulg:  over a multi-way club it is 1-suiter (note 3)|pg||
nt|sheila a: neither explanation appears to match what he has|pg||
nt|garnetts: early calim coming I think |pg||
nt|garnetts: claim|pg||
nt|justin c: heres hoping|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s8|nt|djneill:  2@h = "I'm not so bad"|pg||
nt|xenya: this looks like the least of the evils|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|dagold: wow|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh erichsen u mean|pg||
nt|dagold: that really is a chance missed by south|pg||
nt|dagold: I didnt mean Espen Selway|pg||
nt|dagold: if that is what you are asking|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: cant believe this goes unpunished|pg||
pc|s9|nt|peachy: agree. Normally singleton trump is no good, but was good here|pg||
pc|s3|nt|paulg:  seems he has no way to show a strong 2-suiter unless the minors|pg||
nt|diana1: yes sorry Paul you are right (I forgot about their notes)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I like 2@H-sufficient to make a try|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|garnetts: anyone think North might double 3@D?  After all it must be optional |pg||
nt|justin c: not so sure about 2@H myself|pg||
nt|rmb1:  3 flat in 4H=.  At least crouch opened 4@D as South :)|pg||
nt|dagold: 4 and a bit tricks with a singleton in partner's suit|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sheila a: this might be a let-off for NS|pg||
pc|sA|nt|odysseus69: right to play low if declarer has KJ doubleton|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bridge_one: 1IMP for Bj|pg||
nt|xenya: this should go down but probably by just 1 trick|pg||
nt|justin c: opposite a passed hand?|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|c7|nt|justin c: 3NT is lucky rather than good|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Yes, 2@C looks like an underbid - still only a non vulnerable game|pg||
pc|c4|nt|odysseus69: either red suit for 9 tricks -club for 10|pg||
nt|justin c: 3@D distinctly unswashbuckling|pg||
nt|dagold: down 3 is the target|pg||
nt|lestergold: do u agree with esricksen's 3@c it seems very dangerous to me oppsite a third in hand non vul opener|pg||
pc|cK|nt|xenya: so an imp, yes|pg||
nt|sheila a: Could he possibly have bid @s and then @d?|pg||
nt|dagold: and he may acheive it|pg||
nt|roswolf: finesse is clearcut|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|idc: This is going to work well - I'd guess E-W in other room are unlikely to get to this one|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|nt|nagini: this way?:)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
nt|xenya: ensplayed for the second time|pg||
nt|disa: and since they can make a spade partscore this shud be 6-7 imps t naising|pg||
nt|roswolf: true|pg||
pc|c5|nt|justin c: in 3N, it just so happens that you can get to dummy in a red suit of yr choosing, and then collect the @CK (doubleton onside)|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|nt|paulg:  thinking that North has a balanced 11-13, then he probably thought he could|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|dagold: usually 1@C then 2@C is not a light opener. I think 3@C is moderately normal|pg||
pc|c8|nt|garnetts: well you say that--but isn't that what we were just discussing--|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|nt|roswolf: ?|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|andersk: Im not sure abt that, EW can make 3 @C|pg||
mc|8|nt|roswolf: surely the @CQ was played|pg||

nt|odysseus69: club partial predicted|pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: toliet break|pg||
nt|garnetts: looks like it but will South bid 2@S ?   Then should east dbl or bid 3@C ?  |pg||
nt|odysseus69: they also opened 1H on 4-4-1-4 in open room but there South responded 1NT to conclude bidding - still cant understand 1 heart|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 1H-2S-x- 3C end|pg||
nt|justin c: seems to have made rather a lot of tricks there|pg||
nt|lestergold: narrow escape|pg||
nt|dagold: missing a double like that is like missing a game, even if it was only a chance|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3Nt ON for N/S here with finesse in @S and stop in @D|pg||
nt|xenya: but only for 11th trick -- 10 were already there|pg||
nt|roswolf: 6@C looks good here - also 6NT possible|pg||
nt|andersk: interesting to see what bidding system EW have here|pg||
nt|vugraphzzh: true|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: another 3NT here|pg||
nt|peachy: NS NT 14-16|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: especially if it is a slow auction and West clips it speculatively |pg||
nt|justin c: heres hoping :)|pg||
nt|peachy: 14-16 NT|pg||
nt|justin c: close to 6@H here|pg||
nt|lestergold: an easy one|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: Meckwell make a living bidding this type of 3NT |pg||
mb|2C|nt|paulg:  how it's not clear that you can make 4@s anyhow|pg||
nt|greerm: an offbeat 1NT with 54 in Majors|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@C for me here |pg||
nt|justin c: moderately normal, anyway|pg||
nt|peachy: 2C shows both majors|pg||
nt|xenya: 6@D is excellent here|pg||
mb|p|nt|toobad: must be playing 5 card stayman|pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: IH suddenly realises he has pulled 1NT by accident|pg||
nt|paulg:  West about to bid an invitational 4NT?|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3NT or 4@H ?  |pg||
nt|justin c: 2@D = 6-9, 4+ card support|pg||
nt|peachy: South is not playing the SDAM "convention"|pg||
nt|peachy: :)|pg||
nt|xenya: but very hard to reach with all that obstruction by EW|pg||
mb|2D|nt|paulg:  but you can probably get more from 5@h-X|pg||
nt|sheila a: I think you can if you pick every card, and the strong bid from N helps|pg||
nt|djneill:  brd 23 other room same auction, same result|pg||
nt|justin c: the card also says inverted minors|pg||
nt|odysseus69: maybe contemplating lead directing 2D but opted for routine 2S|pg||
nt|justin c: need to squash East in @S@C, not take a @D finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: losing imps sometimes is well deserved|pg||
nt|bt: sorry|pg||
nt|bridge_one: East find the right lead !|pg||

nt|greerm: Ian Hamilton, also known as maddoc |pg||
mb|2H|nt|justin c: so i guess 1@C-3@C is something truly awful|pg||
nt|garnetts: why the second double--3@C better isn't it?  |pg||
nt|odysseus69: double looks a bad idea - why not 3C|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i don't know if 2@C is conventional (similar gazzilli) but i think so|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: spec tells me 1NT was 15-17|pg||
nt|garnetts: I like to get in and out quickly with this hand type--3@C makes them find fit at that level 21D might let them in more easily |pg||
nt|roswolf: pass missed|pg||
mb|2N|nt|paulg:  2@c was 5-card stayman|pg||
nt|garnetts: I agree with Mark 3NT looks like a good shot now |pg||
nt|justin c: needs a @S lead i think|pg||
nt|garnetts: six solid and a rag outside |pg||
nt|chessmaste: Will westr lead a spade now?|pg||
nt|justin c: could even ruff out the @SA, but the entry position awkward for that|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i go to see the CC|pg||
mb|p|nt|toobad: stretcher please??|pg||
nt|justin c: making now|pg||
mb|3C|nt|sheila a: The Outreds routinely open light so Vi has to invite with her 12 count|pg||
nt|chessmaste: All over for the defence now|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: it looks as if McGann has overbid his cards and Hanlon may raise|pg||
mb|4C|nt|bridge_one: playing 3Nt instead 4Nt is a advantage|pg||
nt|greerm: out alive :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  nice auction from West ... this must show some slam interest with no diamond control|pg||
nt|justin c: grab this, pitch a @S on the @CA, and pull trumps|pg||
nt|odysseus69: he knows his partner|pg||
nt|garnetts: To me this looks like a very strong sequence by East--the second double and then 4@C  |pg||
nt|garnetts: I am wondering why anyone would rebid 1NT--when you have a perfactly good rebid in hearts available|pg||
nt|idc: 2@c is transfer to @d I think, but some other hand types too|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, gazzilli - 2@C is natural or any 16+|pg||
nt|idc: ahha, my mistake|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2Nt after means bal 15/17|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: this looks difficult|pg||
nt|rmb1: On  4, East opened 3@C not 1@C and the 4441 20HCP South hand could not go plus.  4@D-1.  5IMP to WBU|pg||
nt|dagold: moderately normal= middle of the road, normal for some not for all|pg||
nt|dagold: 3@S showed 4/4M exactly|pg||
nt|dagold: with 4/% he would bid 3@H|pg||
nt|dagold: 4/5|pg||
nt|dagold: I mean|pg||
nt|dagold: allowing Espen to bid 3@S if he had 4 of them|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D is positive relais, means 7+hcp|pg||
nt|roswolf: should get there now|pg||
nt|disa: 6C makes but hard to get there|pg||
mb|4D|nt|bt: can discard a sapde and a club, what next|pg||
nt|diana1: they are obviously playing transfer responses to 1@c here and the 1@s bid denies 3@hs |pg||
nt|paulg:  not so obvious I'm afraid|pg||
nt|diana1: 3@ss rather|pg||
nt|justin c: there are preemptive raises, and preemptive raises|pg||
nt|justin c: not a bad idea to give p a clue what is happening|pg||
nt|justin c: for instance, he has 18-19 bal, and needs to know whether to bid 3NT now|pg||
nt|justin c: kibs asking - 1@C showed 3+ @C|pg||
nt|garnetts: true--if he has then bid it in my view--having all this extra system burdens the mind for the play and serves leiitel useful purpose |pg||
nt|garnetts: little |pg||
nt|diumraid: ** CAMROSE LIVE RESULTS ** http://bridge.silvertexter.eu  then browse results then 1o3.txt|pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: toilet break|pg||
nt|djneill:  West can put East with the @dA and a @h honor, but that's it|pg||
nt|djneill:  maybe @sJ or @cQ if lucky|pg||
nt|justin c: @H10 i think|pg||
nt|justin c: planning on forcing the S hand|pg||
nt|djneill:  @h would kill a red squeeze against East in some situations (@hA is communication)|pg||
nt|justin c: playing in @H, can isolate the @S threat, but not here|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  1@h shows any 12+ and 1@s shows 11-13 balanced|pg||
nt|diana1: I know that David and Rex in the other room do |pg||
nt|paulg:  then 2@h is a transfer to spades followed by invitational 2NT|pg||
nt|diana1: ok|pg||
nt|sheila a: some work needed here|pg||
nt|paulg:  this would not be a good hand for lead of 10 showing 0 or 2 higher honours|pg||
nt|lestergold: this looks ,lioke it gives an extra trick but its still 9 tricks on any lead|pg||
mb|4H|nt|bt: spade|pg||
nt|garnetts: here endeth the squeeze |pg||
nt|rmb1: If South played @D7 would East find the 8?|pg||
nt|garnetts: west can now take care of the diamonds --the J@D was a little naive as no one would really lead from a Q against 6NT |pg||
nt|rmb1: ... and declarer could always postpone @D finesse|pg||
nt|justin c: needed to win @DK keeping @DJ in dummy, then cross in @C and play @S off|pg||
nt|justin c: W must duck it|pg||
nt|rmb1: I hate to say this (again) but isn't declare thinking a trick too late|pg||
mb|p|nt|toobad: 3h denies a d control|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|rmb1: tempting to duck to not rectify the count|pg||
nt|justin c: then cash many winners, and endplay West or drop the @DQ, depending on his choice of discard|pg||
nt|peachy: CAMROSE live running scores http://bridge.silvertexter.eu/results/1O3.TXT|pg||
mb|5C|nt|paulg:  okay, even better|pg||
nt|justin c: this needs him to read the position in the ending, but if the @D2 was 4th highest, should get it right|pg||
nt|dagold: only if they cash out|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: aK of clubs and then hearts?  |pg||
nt|dagold: which is tricky|pg||
nt|lestergold: providing of ocurse n/s cash their @ds now|pg||
nt|lestergold: whioch is not obvious|pg||
nt|dagold: if south had the diamond T a diamond switch would even beat it|pg||
nt|dagold: so he probably should|pg||
nt|justin c: nothing much else to try for|pg||
nt|lestergold: Tedd cant be certain of the urgency here|pg||
nt|dagold: looks like 3@H tricks|pg||
nt|dagold: 3@C|pg||
nt|dagold: tricks|pg||
mb|6C|nt|bridge_one: now 4 @D are good for N/S|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: well when the auction looks confident I was always told to attack--and for the record I hate leading a random doubleton |pg||
nt|bridge_one: can lose this 3Nt|pg||
nt|daman: given there is only one way to play the hand this should go quickly|pg||
nt|bridge_one: can make 3nt also with K@S in East|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: Not so loud:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: and likely some number of spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: well he has found it|pg||

nt|disa: good job by e-w|pg||
nt|roswolf: efficient well done|pg||
nt|roswolf: trump lead!?|pg||
nt|andersk: to be honest, I dont think many pairs will stop below 6 @C, many will miss the club fit, and land in 6 NT|pg||

pc|c5|nt|disa: wich makes with spdaes splitting|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|bt: i think so too, lol|pg||

nt|vugraphzxd: he discarded a spade immediatly, but I didnt see it until he showed his hand on the next trick.. :)|pg||
nt|xenya: blind spot -- it cost nothing to play spades first|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|bt: if you are going to finesse, does it hurt to cash 2 spades hmm|pg||
nt|paulg:  unless Lindsay ducks this|pg||
nt|andersk: 6 NT have 11 winners and favruble sp, or many many squeeze options|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vugraphzxz: he took out then put back @HA|pg||
nt|peachy: lucky 12 tricks, not quite biddable and after 4D (assume splinter) difficult|pg||

mb|p|nt|nicksan: Did'nt seem to my eyes like east showed anything at all, but what do I know?|pg||
nt|nicksan: (Don't answer that)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I prefer 2@S over 2@H as a sort of relay--reserve 2NT for a more constructive use |pg||
nt|bg: I like 2nt in this sequence to start Baron whereby both sides bid suits of 4 cards or longer up the line that way they would find ths club fit|pg||

nt|chessmaste: leadign from a king is dangerous - but it looked logical enough from the bench|pg||
nt|justin c: 1@D-4@S maybe|pg||
nt|garnetts: The j@D was also attacking --question which is best|pg||
nt|garnetts: this was weak defence by west --|pg||
nt|justin c: y|pg||
nt|justin c: even 3 rounds of @C accomplishes something|pg||
nt|garnetts: error at trick one--so often the case|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think over the return @C would play for K @D in East - so small from dummy|pg||
nt|bridge_one: making 1@S 1@h 1@D 6@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm a freakish deal|pg||
nt|andersk: nasty|pg||
nt|andersk: South will open and north will not give in before 4@H is reached, many will play 4@H X here|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzxz: IH double checks his 1S card this time...|pg||
nt|rmb1: 4@S here|pg||
nt|garnetts: maybe 3NT |pg||
nt|diumraid: *** Live Overall Scores - CAMROSE *** http://bridge.silvertexter.eu  then "browse results" then 1o3.txt  *****|pg||
nt|roswolf: has east got a gadget for the hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: nope|pg||
nt|disa: lot of icelandic pairs will open the east hand with some sort of weak majors warning N|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|garnetts: 5@D looks logical now --maybe 4NT then 5@D over 5@C say to suggest a slam interest |pg||
nt|peachy: brisk IMP exchange in this second half, no pushes|pg||
nt|chick: I think the splinter killed it .. splintering a singleton A is usually a bad idea|pg||
nt|peachy: I agree|pg||
nt|justin c: 4@S by N, anyway|pg||
nt|rmb1: First they have to establish its their hand|pg||
nt|peachy: 1D opening promises 5-card D|pg||
nt|peachy: (unless 444-1)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|bridge_one: playing for finesse in @C need however to try, first, the @S ... no money for see if @S are 2/2|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3NT again|pg||
nt|justin c: how will this one go on a @S lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: who can resist overcalling against a strong club?  |pg||
nt|chick: Makes partner think you have a loser there|pg||
nt|lestergold: 20/20 combined but e/w likelyyo outbid with @s|pg||
mb|3S|nt|garnetts: needs care on a spade lead |pg||
nt|justin c: 3 rounds of @D beats 4@S by S i think|pg||
nt|andersk: this south pass is not common, Im sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  3@c is 9-12 HCP with 3 spades|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 1C is Polish - either weak balanced or strong club|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: I know--but it would have been a good time to try 1@H wouldn't it?  |pg||
nt|odysseus69: I suppose that East was limited on last since he didnt open 1 club|pg||
nt|garnetts: thats true but it wasn't our system |pg||
nt|peachy: 11.5-14 NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: there is play for 4@s as cards lie but i think part score will be all here|pg||
mb|4H|nt|garnetts: It did not occur to me that North might double |pg||
nt|justin c: sorry not sure im right about that|pg||
nt|justin c: would have two pitches on @D |pg||
nt|rmb1: After @DQA, South discards a club on third diamond, and a club on @DK, and finesses for no club losers.  may not have the entries|pg||
nt|roswolf: ouch|pg||
nt|andersk: wow|pg||
nt|disa: bloody|pg||
mb|d|nt|sheila a: E must have known he was giving up the chance of ever getting his A@h so he was relying on partner to have a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|garnetts: needs to duck a @D to west |pg||
nt|andersk: 4@H even now, with a passed partner|pg||
nt|roswolf: ouch x a lot|pg||
nt|roswolf: the vampires gather for a feast|pg||
mb|4N|nt|xenya: yes, that's what i meant -- cash two high spades first|pg||
nt|justin c: hope he can see how to beat this, I sure cant|pg||
nt|garnetts: this looks cast iron |pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: how does one do that?|pg||
nt|garnetts: my kind of play hand |pg||
nt|garnetts: good try by East--wrong K  |pg||
nt|peachy: defense needs to be sharp to get 4 tricks|pg||
mb|5D|nt|odysseus69: been in worse slams|pg||
nt|roswolf: frying pan and fire come to mind|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: exactly--was being ironic |pg||
nt|peachy: 3D alerted, apparently re-transfer|pg||
nt|chick: I suppose 2N shows @D shortness?|pg||
nt|dagold: can just defend 3@C for 200|pg||
nt|lestergold: sell out wow|pg||
nt|dagold: who should bid on do you suggest?|pg||
nt|andersk: If My partner have bidded like north, I would be more than happy to play 4@HX|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w need to beat this|pg||
nt|dagold: neither hand is close to bidding 3@s|pg||
mb|d|nt|dagold: it is down 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|diana1: the play here shouldnt be too difficult although no entries to dummy|pg||
nt|garnetts: Kx looks like a dead holding --so why bother---West might have re booted this and then the double really costs |pg||
nt|justin c: very speculative double|pg||
nt|chessmaste: He is lucky his @D K is a trick - or is he? If East held the ace 6@D would be making.|pg||
nt|garnetts: you get away with this to an extent when the opps forget to use the blue card |pg||
nt|dagold: trivially|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: calling slam it is made with @S 3/3|pg||
nt|peachy: well, perhaps not, no way for declarer to get the tenth|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: Ian needs to play @H for 1 loser, with no clues?|pg||
nt|roswolf: now this was panic bidding|pg||
pc|s5|nt|djneill:  South was hoping North could bid NT, maybe with Qxx, better sided|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|greerm: more natural to play first @H from the table which will mean 1 off|pg||
nt|paulg:  i can't see any|pg||
nt|peachy: their card does not go that far in continuations|pg||
nt|xenya: um -- i've been trying to work out how the defence can go wrong :)|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|dagold: west can't double|pg||
nt|lestergold: agree west has enuf defence against 3@c |pg||
nt|dagold: facing AQJxx spades and out|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4 figures at least|pg||
nt|disa: -5 looks like|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|pc|d2|nt|peachy: I would just assume 2NT was some sort of superaccept|pg||
nt|dagold: 3@c could easily be cold|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|roswolf: might even be worse|pg||
pc|hA|nt|diana1: so he can afford to throw a @s and a @h|pg||
nt|sheila a: Best defence is to cash A@s and then exit with a @c, but will S know that?|pg||
nt|justin c: will play @D from S twice, |pg||
pc|h2|pc|c4|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|bt: meanwhile another board that does not matter, we should congratulate skara to an amazing performance!|pg||
nt|bt: and see what happens in champions leauge :-)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|justin c: hoping @DQ in W, so can duck|pg||
nt|peachy: not common to have a singleton in NT opening, also an assumption of mine|pg||
pc|h5|nt|paulg:  Matheson's redouble on board 22 has earned 13 imps for Scotland|pg||
pc|d3|nt|diablo666: Yep, big congrats! Well deserved! The year of Nobbe is here :) .|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|garnetts: 12 tricks too |pg||
nt|roswolf: over ruff|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|d5|nt|diana1: course 2 rounds of spades could give him a bit of trouble - or 1 even:)|pg||
nt|idc: Other room in 5@d on Bd 8 so WBU about to take the lead|pg||
nt|peachy: I was copmmenting/tyuping before my brain caught up, sry|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|odysseus69: careless again for 12th|pg||
nt|garnetts: well should have |pg||
pc|d9|pc|dJ|nt|greerm: he done it, vwd|pg||
nt|greerm: Ian MAtheson did well toduck, but declarer has started so I'll finsih :)|pg||
nt|greerm: started to play for this @H holding I mean|pg||
nt|paulg:  I'm told that Scotland will probably play this in 2@s, as they use 2@c for this type of raise|pg||
nt|paulg:  so Hamilton's play important and will win an imp rather than losing six imps|pg||
nt|rmb1: A good hand for an intermediate jump overcall (which NS play at this vulnerability)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|chick: true, but a lot of people play variations on bidding small doubletons while accepting a transfer|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|garnetts: flat board then |pg||
nt|andersk: -1700|pg||
pc|c5|nt|diana1: well defended but Lindsay shouldnt be hanging on to those @hs|pg||
nt|roswolf: the corpse will be very white |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cJ|pc|c9|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h6|nt|lestergold: Erichsen taking no chances waitimng for the tricks his side is due|pg||

pc|sT|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d7|pc|c2|nt|peachy: yes, either that or some other structure, a few ways to do it|pg||
nt|justin c: East's 1@S was a bit random, was it not?|pg||
