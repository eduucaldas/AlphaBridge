nt|woozle: S9 lead?|pg||
nt|woozle: Smirnov should be ready with the eight on the first round of hearts, making ace then king a much stronger play|pg||
pc|c4|nt|woozle: Someone asked me "why not the longest suit?". Well, my rule, for which I've been given some level of naming rights, is "never lead from four to the ace-anything against notrumps ...|pg||

nt|sybarra: welcome Andrew|pg||
nt|tejjyid: HI Shirley|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: this hand may well be opened 1NT in both rooms (but i think) its a strong NT in this room and a weak NT in the other room|pg||
nt|frankaus: The Bloom crew is staffed by hardened proffesionals - |pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can keep an eye on the other room via http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
mb|1H|nt|noodle:  seems ok to upgrade a good 14; as we have seen  opening bids are very agressive nowadays|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: both teams are playing 5-handed|pg||
mb|2H|an| |nt|tejjyid: X presume single/suited|pg||
nt|frankaus: Milne crew the next generation of excellence - have been at the top of many international junior events|pg||
nt|tejjyid: interesting problem for East|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|tejjyid: signaling ofr a @C|pg||

nt|tejjyid: not that it beats the contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the winners of this event will get an invitation and $6000 subsidy to attend the 2011 Yeh Bros Cup this coming April|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but highly likely to be flat|pg||
nt|sybarra: just one of those hands :(|pg||

nt|noodle:  re hi every one :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: rehi and welcome |pg||
mb|1S|nt|tejjyid: Hi|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: in this situation gosney could probably have won the diamond unless he needed martin to switch|pg||
nt|noodle:  tx shirley   it seems Milne will need another comeback|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=3+|pg||
mb|2H|nt|noodle:  the imp is not much  but the fact they ended up in a great spot on a tough hand can boost morale early in the match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1st/2nd seat  Hans-Nunn play Weak NT   3rd/4th Strong|pg||
mb|3D|nt|rodal f: Ain't 6.000$ a peace of cake? Is for my workers. OK. Stop now.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|tejjyid: I wold call it a lucky spot, not a great spot|pg||
nt|frankaus: false pref wit 1-2 ???|pg||
nt|noodle:  i agree :)|pg||
nt|noodle:  better lucky than good, though :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: auto 2@S, IMO|pg||
mb|5D|nt|tejjyid: it's not a disastrous position, but it is difficult|pg||
nt|noodle:  opening bids are getting worse by the second imho|pg||
nt|sybarra: we saw it yesterday, maybe a repeat|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Peake never saw an 11 count he couldn't open|pg||
nt|noodle:  or i m getting old :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: ok we're back live now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can keep an eye on the other room via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|rodal f: Road on?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Zone 6 is bringing us 2 fun events in the next 2 months    early/mid February  NEC Cup from Yokahama  [vugraph schedule already posted] and the YEH Bros|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: although PASS stops partner from taking your hand in any way seiously|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: [most of] Milne team is looking for 3rd straight NOT final|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in 2010 they were 2nd in both this event and the Spring NOT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with a slight change to team for the Spring event|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and Milne-Whibley were semi-finalists in 2009 while still New Zealanders|pg||
nt|sybarra: then maybe we are all getting old |pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: i think i like pass|pg||
mb|5H|nt|noodle:  often pass is better when really crappy hand|pg||
nt|noodle:  44 in minors an nothing in majors is asking for trouble in the competitive bidding|pg||
nt|sybarra: this should go quickly |pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: which, since you have complete rubish, may be a good argument for the PASS|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|tejjyid: I think there is a contradiction between overcalling on not much, and bidding game here on the East cards|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rnmalik: Hello all.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S seems like confirmation of the 3@S bid|pg||

mb|p|mb|3C|nt|vugrapha1: the score on 14 was correct |pg||
nt|woozle: Peake going slowly. I think he might as well just bid 4S over 2D...hard to see where else he's going|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|d|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|woozle: 3H then 3NT from Gosney should mean "good hand, marking time:, then "good hand with the ace of hearts"|pg||
nt|peachy: well, E does have 5 controls total so slam not really out of the question but I like direct 4S nevertheless|pg||
nt|woozle: Peake should pull to 4S|pg||
nt|woozle: Very hard for Peake to ever reach 6S or 3NT intelligently|pg||
nt|peachy: "game before slam" and "slam before grand" good to reach|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|peachy: put that "right game"|pg||
mb|p|pc|hK|pc|h5|nt|peachy: E should not have a reason for staying in NT|pg||
nt|woozle: Someone asked if a diamond ruff can beat 4S. I'm only just looking now. The diamond ruff with a trump trick is not useful for the defense. Realistically, declarer will make two ...|pg||
nt|woozle: diamonds, five spades, two clubs and a heart...a diamond ruff just subtracts a diamond trick but adds a spade|pg||
nt|woozle: 3NT doomed unless the opponents forget to lead more hearts|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h8|pg||
nt|woozle: Gosney trying to feign AJ8 and make Hung's card look bigger|pg||

nt|andyv:  vul should not stop E|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Martin Johnson |pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|noodle:  some people think it is easier to bid 1@d over 1@c than the opposite, hence the 1@c bid... i prefer 1@d on 44 minors|pg||
nt|noodle:  hi MJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW play 1@C=2+ with transfer responses|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: NS carding  upside-down count & attitude|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vs NT the also play "OddBall" in following to declarer's suit|pg||
nt|noodle:  now we ll have a real canadian commentator :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I prefer to open my best suit of 4-4|pg||
nt|noodle:  opening best suit on weak hands is good for lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: brb guys,  checking other room |pg||
mb|p|nt|noodle:  I think EW played the junior trial the week before the NOT , right ?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: that's my view|pg||
mb|4S|nt|andyv:  nice pull by W|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: great explanation!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: what does 5@D show?       faith|pg||
nt|andyv:  I wonder if that showing faith means he doesn't trust partner's penalty doubles:)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: ish is now complaining that he didn't know 3C was alerted|pg||
nt|tejjyid: West, maybe|pg||
nt|mwigor: they both played in youth week|pg||
nt|noodle:  they show stamina then|pg||
nt|mwigor: but not in the trial for the australian youth team|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I don't like this auction at all|pg||
mb|p|nt|noodle:  tx specs :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mwigor: milne-whibley (two of the others in this team) made the australian youth team|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Al nd spectators|pg||
nt|peachy: dont see others|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rnmalik: accepts the transfer:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  seven card suits are hard to describe in middle of auctions|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: whibley shrugged and ish isn't pursing it|pg||
nt|noodle:  as spec points out NS have a different system of answers to 1@c  it might tip the scales|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Indeed, if you have complex methods 1@C is better, as leaving more room to exercise them|pg||
nt|noodle:  I also have a rattle theory when it comes to bridge gadgets|pg||
nt|noodle:  it goes like this :|pg||
nt|noodle:  if you give a kid a rattle he will shake it|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it's true|pg||
nt|noodle:  MJ went to the other room presumably|pg||
pc|h6|nt|noodle:  hung and smirnov are well known on BBO :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think South snaffled the Youth pairs?|pg||
nt|mwigor: same auction in both rooms|pg||
nt|mwigor: it looks like hung has hit on the best lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: Strange to see that some still give from the Mol. HUM. Pass over 1@S? |pg||

nt|sybarra: he is here, just being his quiet self|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sK|pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: Peake did raise to 2@S   --  but won't get any extra credit if both contracts make|pg||
nt|tejjyid: no, it's a purely academic point on this hand|pg||
nt|tejjyid: commentator's noise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: opposite passed hand, i actually like Whibley's PASS -- partner now KNOWS 3@S support  and  won't go overboard|pg||
nt|sybarra: knowing him,  will speak when "needed"|pg||
nt|noodle:  does anyone play unusual vs unusual ?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|noodle:  Silver used to call K from Kx a journalist lead, cause if it works you can end up in the paper (of course here it was the unbid suit)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: won't make much difference though|pg||
nt|mwigor: hung does well trying to kill the diamond suit in dummy|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|noodle:  I don t know if it s standard but when i pass a 1 level response partner can be sure I have a 3rd seat opener and act accordingly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: plus -- what can opponents do that is bad?   if they balance in @C  West knows about the 8-card fit|pg||
pc|d5|nt|tejjyid: well, not me|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if they balance in @H --- East would love to defend|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|nt|noodle:  a nice way to play it is to use 3@c as @hs weak or strong  3@d as spades weak or strong and 3 of a major as invitational|pg||
pc|c3|nt|noodle:  gives you 3 ranges of bids   has served me well|pg||
nt|tejjyid: seems reasonable|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|hK|pc|s2|nt|tejjyid: IF West opens all 6 ard suits with a weak 2, then maybe pass is OK|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting position in @C suit if duck @D  possible intrafinesse via @C to J/Q  then @CA sets up finesse against @C9|pg||

mb|2C|mb|d|nt|tejjyid: roll out the Adam Meredith textbook|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=(11)12-14, maybe singleton|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: pure transfer of   size ask or trf?|pg||
nt|andyv:  2N probably super acceptance|pg||
nt|frankaus: 3NT is anothet scycic option but thats fairly transparent|pg||
nt|tejjyid: nice read by Gosney|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Peake also bid 2@S -- i must admit i wouldn't have thought of that call|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mwigor: not that tough|pg||
nt|noodle:  4@s coming up|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: i hold four cards in a suit which partner makes a penalty double of|pg||
nt|tejjyid: YOu think N's X is penalty?|pg||
nt|noodle:  100%|pg||
nt|mwigor: almost unplayable any other way|pg||
nt|rodal f: A pay by the opening?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: right  if 2@S was size ask, 2N would say  reject NT invite|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: prescott says |pg||
nt|vugrapha2: "sorry if we've missed it"|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: so sounds like 2S= range ask|pg||
nt|andyv:  didn't miss anything|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: hmm maybe not|pg||
nt|tejjyid: no way is it 100%; it's by arrangement|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3rd seat, great shape  @S suit -- automatic 3rd seat opener|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think I'd be more likley to bid 3@H - not so successful here|pg||
nt|noodle:  I like 3N better than 2@S :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in fact I bet he'd open 1@S in ANY seat|pg||
pc|hA|nt|frankaus: green V red + youth - 5 level NP|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|h7|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mwigor: david beauchamp thinks that south should have doubled 5@h|pg||
nt|tejjyid: yes, to stop anyone bidding 5@S|pg||
nt|mwigor: although we can see that they can make 650 if they bid on|pg||
nt|mwigor: taking the money in 5@h is a much safer option|pg||
pc|cK|nt|noodle:  agreed  this ia a forcing pass situation double as 2 losers is relatively normal (by arrangement of course)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: S hand doesn't look like 11 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duplicate auctions -- i must admit i would have bid a mere 3@H with East|pg||
nt|tejjyid: seems about right to me as well|pg||
pc|c2|nt|andyv:  only thing missed is possibly wrong siding this NT:)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: i can see "like C" written by prescott|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: of course - i wouldn't overcall 2@H  but that is a different topic :)|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|rodal f: To many loosers at S. Why not trust ure pard and bid then???     If ure pard act.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told that the 1700 from 3rd Quarter is showing up on the ABF site, which reflects scores entered by the PLAYERS -- so it must be right   [even if hard to fathom]|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|mwigor: same contract in both rooms - so i predict another flat board|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: so looks like C transfer, positive acceptance, and then shutdown|pg||
nt|tejjyid: maybe as a passed hand you have alittle more scope to bid 2@S - but must surely be rock bottom for it|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|d4|pc|d6|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 6N West looks best|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Yes|pg||
nt|tejjyid: after 1@S-2@C, may not be so easy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not really sure where Open Room auction went wrong -- maybe the 5@C bid over 4N was wrong Key Card response??|pg||
nt|tejjyid: either that or the trump Q was on East's mind|pg||
nt|ahollan1: welcome back patient patrons|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can spy on the other room using http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: looks like it is a 2+C meaning for 1C opening|pg||
mb|1D|nt|tejjyid: OK, that confirms EW are playing 15-17, not 14-16|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: 2@S or 3@S?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: best lesson i learned at rubber bridge -- if you win $20  that calls for a $30 celebration|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|noodle:  I think they upgrade quite freely though|pg||
nt|tejjyid: (via the machinery)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 15|pg||
nt|tejjyid: any good 14 is a 15|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: run baby run!|pg||
nt|tejjyid: now, if u'r not playing 2/1 this is an ugly buit|pg||
nt|tejjyid: *bit|pg||
nt|tejjyid: a space-filling 3@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if 2@C 100% game force, then 2N gets my vote|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=4+  but 4@C & 4@D usually opens 1@C|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|tejjyid: definitely - thi sis the hand which justifies 2/1 (maybe)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as we see -- it let's partner clarify hand with 3@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  I might have bid 1@h first time with N hand just get away from this mess|pg||
nt|tejjyid: OK, so now we can start cue-ing early, or maybe even BW with 4@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems now a couple cue bids then some form of Blackwood should get to slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: andrew types faster :(|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I dn't think BW is the right way to go|pg||
mb|3H|nt|tejjyid: THat seems likely to get a director call|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: apparently they use 1C=1+C and 1D=5+D, according to heather|pg||
nt|andyv:  I guess EW don't have any agreements here regarding passing runout bids|pg||
nt|ahollan1: strange not to dbl -- i would assume Whibley's pass was forcing|pg||
mb|3S|nt|tejjyid: (but it's a long standing prejudice)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Liam's hand getting better|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 4@C was just natural force|pg||
mb|3N|nt|andyv:  it would seem so|pg||
nt|tejjyid: certainly if you can use it at the 4@C level, it's better|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|noodle:  2@D was probably GF checkback|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 4@C as a natural force seems to be wasting space - why not cue 3@D on the way?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Again, West is making the decision and doesn't have enough information|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hopefully 5@C = 1/4 Key Cards|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugrapha2: pass is low-variance... opposite a passed hand|pg||
nt|tejjyid: lead a @D!|pg||
nt|tejjyid: why would you disturb 2@D if you had correct information?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: auction screams @C lead so 3N doesn't appear to have a chance|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ummmm screams @C lead|pg||
pc|hA|nt|tejjyid: The @C QJ are invisble - they bid with filth & East has had no chance to show that he has a good hand|pg||
pc|h9|nt|tejjyid: it's a good start|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|drewsky: Ill bet that 4@C was keycard|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still not easy to take 9 tricks|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|tejjyid: The've got to the right contract, so success vindicates their method|pg||
nt|noodle:  always depends if it was a bidding mistake or a mistaken explanation|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|dK|pg||
nt|andyv:  and trump lead is called for|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Liam Milne -- 3rd player in the triad confirmed 4@C was NOT ace ask|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the best play for 4@D works  IN ISOLATION  but Milne doesn't know he has 2 entries to hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very niced unblock of @D9!!!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so he will make 4@D without abandoning the entry to hand|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: i.e.  what hand would want to punish 1@C but rest in 1@H undoubled|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|pc|h7|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: duh -- he's a passed hand  thanks Mark|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it does, but I would call the director to find out|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h6|pc|hK|pg||
pc|d2|pc|c5|nt|andyv:  I think even with a passed hand it's a force for one round (maybe up to 1NT)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but still seems strange|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d6|pc|d8|nt|andyv:  otherwise you are one and done|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: i'm with you on that Andy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i bet Whibley thought that too -- otherwise he probably bids 1@S over 1@H|pg||

mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: there's an alert for 1@C wherever you turn|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: maybe 3@C/2N shows full weight, with 3 @C and a bad hand yu can just bid 3N|pg||

nt|tejjyid: We do|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: it must also show a pretty weak hand|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@S normally 6@S but 5 allowed if "great suit"    you be the judge|pg||
pc|dK|nt|andyv:  N will bid 3@d or 3@s|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: not sure if good/bad or what|pg||

pc|d2|nt|rnmalik: After seeing all cards-yes::)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks like lebensohl|pg||
pc|d3|nt|andyv:  I think 2N was relay to 3@c to get out|pg||
nt|andyv:  S should now bid 3N and answer the question (or redbl to show first round control)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: scramble 2NT is also sensible... south can't have values after two passes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but a reasonable sequence for 2N to show "2 places to play"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmm  should Nunn bid 4@C?|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: again Mark beats me to the type|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|tejjyid: I gues 2@C is 2-way; 19-21 balanced or...|pg||
pc|dT|nt|tejjyid: well, I would, but I'd expec a touch more from 3@C|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 2@D is Xfer, or ...|pg||
pc|d6|nt|andyv:  nice bid|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and play of @D suit to come.|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: ish and whibley are joking about the DQJ behind the screen before thelead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since only one entry to hand -- after @S lead must rely upon @D2-2|pg||
nt|tejjyid: mildly surprising to pick up in that way against a junior team|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|andyv:  S is lucky... lack of entries to his hand will prevent him from messing up the @d suit|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: NS carding upside-down count & attitude|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|noodle:  nowadays many pairs use a jump to 4@c to show a big balanced raise and leave room|pg||
nt|mwigor: (interestingly?) all bloom's pickups have come when VUL - while milne's have been non-vul|pg||
nt|noodle:  yes juniors generally bid anything thAT moves|pg||
nt|mwigor: obviously vul is a factor when making decisions|pg||
nt|noodle:  yes I lost so many vul game swing i decided to bid them all from now on :)|pg||
nt|mwigor: but that sort of "luck" can be worth a lot of IMPs|pg||

nt|ahollan1: well that was a delayed posting of my comment|pg||
mb|1D|nt|tejjyid: nice action, 5 imps a board|pg||
mb|1H|nt|noodle:  I heard they were scoring on an abacus then, Andrew|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: remember there are 2 more 16-board sets remaining in the championship|pg||
nt|tejjyid: es, this is quitea small margin given the number of boardsleft|pg||
nt|ahollan1: take my word for it  ---  that is nice support for partner|pg||
nt|tejjyid: prima facie evidence that partner has psyched :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: IMo 1NT here does not promise a stopper|pg||
mb|1N|nt|tejjyid: sure, but we still had beer!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: blast into Ace Ask?   Splinter then Ask??   ART Game Force -- all make sense|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  4@s good contract for EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ART Game Force Raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this auction is the one that used to have universal default where DBL=exactly 4@S   now it can be  4+@S, 4/5@S, less than 4@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|noodle:  true lol|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or not on same page|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Can't balme SOuth for biding 5 with all that shape. North's three key cards must be looking pretty good to him|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 3 small @H, maybe pd is void....|pg||
nt|noodle:  except 4@d is not slammish as a rule|pg||
nt|tejjyid: agreed; but he may talk himself into it|pg||
nt|noodle:  i m floored at 4333 yarborough 5 level bid red|pg||
nt|noodle:  might be a big winner here|pg||
nt|tejjyid: very attacking bid|pg||
nt|noodle:  he had a junior moment :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: DOn't forget, North is probably feeling a bit sick about going down in 4@S on the misguess|pg||
nt|tejjyid: still thinking?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N just shows Strong NT|pg||
nt|tejjyid: flexibility is good, right?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|tejjyid: interesting problem for North|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would have been nice to hear about opener's singleton @H|pg||
pc|h5|nt|tejjyid: I think 2@D understates the hand, but I admint @C K doesn't llok great|pg||
nt|tejjyid: time for a quick coffee|pg||
pc|hA|nt|andyv:  aggressive opener by E made it easy to get to|pg||
nt|rnmalik: EW make 6@D on finesse in @S and @D.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: (odd 5@D bid)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S and 5@D are both a mystery to me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe Whibley thinking 3@C was less than game force.  That would explain 4@S|pg||
nt|tejjyid: how about - 4@S = @C spport & @S Ace; 5@D = 3 @C ACes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but 5@D ???|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that could fit Andrew|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I hope not - it was an effort to make that up, I wouldn't advocate playing it!|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|andyv:  and all the dreamers are talking about 6@s or 6@d... I'd be happy to get to game with the E hand:)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: there's hope for noble in the other room, then|pg||
nt|andyv:  this is the type of hand that they can take a chance on|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Cashing at rubber bridge.:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  slam about 30-35%|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: and they will know that time is runnin gout|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: the results in the other room have been more boring than here|pg||
nt|tejjyid: anyway, he does have a stopper|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unfortunately -- convention cards don't require explanation of how pairs play the sequence|pg||
nt|ahollan1: regarding the DBL|pg||
pc|c5|nt|tejjyid: yes, have to ask|pg||
pc|c6|nt|tejjyid: still, I think with 6 ard @D, you cna try 3@D here|pg||
nt|noodle:  after the pass maybe 3@d ?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: right, you have limited your hand already over 2@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahhh another guess --- 5@D is operator error and should be 5@H|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I'll have to wait for the book|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|andyv:  usually when you have a large number to catch up, you have to decide that one pair will play the boards even and the other will do the swinging.|pg||
nt|noodle:  pard knows you re under 10H and you didn t open a @D prempt|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just in from Liam    3@C is splinter in either minor, either weak or very strong|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: thanks Liam !!!|pg||
pc|s7|nt|tejjyid: imp-gaining lead|pg||

pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: the other room is on the final board of the 2nd Quarter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Whibley will claim as soon as Nunn leads     we hope|pg||
pc|d4|nt|tejjyid: with 7 HCP I hate to bid as if I have 0|pg||
nt|tejjyid: although in principle I'm for all conventions, they are time consuming|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: easier to do that when you're at the table -- not so easy for us out in the ether|pg||
nt|tejjyid: no, true, I was on a slightly different wavelength|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 48 imps with 3 to play --- nice position for Milne|pg||
nt|tejjyid: good work by South|pg||
nt|noodle:  dare we predict a flat board ?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: no predictions...|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ahollan1: only 3 to play in this room -- and NS appear to have a decent set going|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C still 2+|pg||
mb|3C|nt|noodle:  E has another borderline opening|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|tejjyid: Frankly, I would rather bid 2@S than 1@S on South's cards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=20-22|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: tomorrow's final will also be  4 sets of 16 boards|pg||
nt|tejjyid: SOuth counting the @H in the deck|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|tejjyid: but having lucked out with my 1@S opening, I am going to raise here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: i understand your reluctance to bid 1|pg||

pc|c9|pc|c3|nt|noodle:  anyone for pass ?|pg||
nt|noodle:  4 jacks|pg||

nt|andyv:  yes... you may be right about percentage...i thought it would be a little higher because of lead, etc....but @ds do have to be 2-2 if you are dropping stiff Q|pg||
pc|d6|nt|andyv:  EW probably anxious now to get with teammates to compare|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: they look relaxed|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@s can still be made|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: both North players bid 1N  --  i wish i knew wheter it was ostensibly Strong NT  or minors|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|tejjyid: I think Hans-Nunn are the only pair underleading I've seen all weekend|pg||

nt|ahollan1: specs still talking/asking about  14 from last set when pair for Milne went for 1700 [against partscore, i think]|pg||

pc|h6|nt|noodle:  my style for overcalls : good hand or good suit  doesn t cut it for me|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h9|pc|hK|pg||
nt|tejjyid: looking at the hand record, it's a nonsense; the 5@H contract was in a 3-2 fit|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dK|pc|dJ|pc|d4|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but I have no idea of what really happened|pg||
mc|6|nt|ahollan1: Hans-Nunn the only ones i've seen leading Rusinow [underleading] vs BOTH Suit & NT, but i've seen others use it in just one situation|pg||
