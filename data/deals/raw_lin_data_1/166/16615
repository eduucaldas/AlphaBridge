nt|marcsmith: that way you get to defend 3@C (afrer 1@S-P-2@S-X-P-3@C-AP)|pg||
nt|peachy: It is a matter of style, my bid would have been 2S|pg||
nt|marcsmith: seems clear to me -- just seems technically better|pg||
nt|peachy: Even if N wanted to bid 2C (different cards mind you) he might think twice bidding over 2S rather than 1NT|pg||
mb|3H|nt|marcsmith: bad hand with fit wants to get the auction as high as possible as quickly as possible|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|peachy: If our operator is not too busy, he will likely show us alerts etc.  But as someone said "the operator jos is like being a long-tailed cat in a small room full of rocking chairs" |pg||
nt|peachy: *job|pg||
mb|4D|nt|peachy: Tell that to the Constructive Raise crowd:)|pg||
nt|marcsmith: bidding 1NT makes things so much easier for NS|pg||
nt|marcsmith: stupid method -- use the 1NT sequence for the constructive raise if you must|pg||
nt|marcsmith: with a bad hand you want to pre-empt|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|peachy: 3Nt was better, this requires help from opponents (likely not coming though)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|peachy: When holding long trumps, the textbook approach is to leadd a long suit, hoping to force declarer to shorten his trumps.  That isn't happening here though|pg||
nt|peachy: called "tap"|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|nt|peachy: Well, I'll leave the show in your capable hands Doc and Marc, bhanks and enjoy!|pg||
nt|peachy: Thanks|pg||
nt|marcsmith: the general standard of bidding these days is much higher than it used to be so you have to consider what makes things the most difficult for the opponents|pg||

pc|dK|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|pc|dT|nt|marcsmith: always better to defend 3@C than 2@C, particularly when the opps can make exactly 8 tricks|pg||
nt|raghavan: Even if CJ scores, C9 will be finessed|pg||
nt|marcsmith: has to lose a trump, so surely it's clear to play a trump to the Q so you can ruff the last spade in dumy|pg||
nt|raghavan: Yes Marc, EW have 8 spades and atleast 18 points - both will make 2 in their suits|pg||

mb|1S|nt|tejjyid: right - if South can have a hand so week that PASS by NOrth iscorrect the 2nd time, why is SOuth bidding at all?|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: you can't bid 1@S -- that would show an unbalanced hand|pg||

nt|tejjyid: these 5-5 isfits are ugly to bid and play|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|peachy: At IMPs, vulnerable games should be aggressively bid, partly because it yields IMPs and prtly because if it doesnt yield IMPs, then it will be a push (down both tables)|pg||

mc|8|nt|ahollan1: in the other match, with 1 to score   Milne 55  Noble 27|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if memory serves  Milne was 2nd in this event last year -- and also 2nd in the Spring NOT|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think that's right|pg||
nt|mrdct: but slightly different lineup for the SNOT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right Smirnov wasn't on the 2nd team|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it was the full Junior White House Team|pg||
nt|mrdct: with a playing sponsor on the team also iirc|pg||

nt|peachy: Last hand up, next segment begins 45 minutes from now|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|peachy: W will raise whether there is 3S bid or not|pg||
mb|1N|an| |mb|p|nt|marcsmith: i'd much rather open that one 1@S personally|pg||
nt|peachy: We had quiet kibitzers today, feel free to comment or ask questions, the commentators are here to serve you|pg||
mb|2D|nt|peachy: but after 4S, tough|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: i prefer 2@C, but i assume system dictates @d|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|marcsmith: for me, that hand is totally wrong for a pre-empt -- bad suit, loads of defence, opening values etc|pg||
mb|3C|nt|raghavan: Yes Marc- values in other suits|pg||
nt|peachy: one does not usually have four controls on the side for weak two, but styles vasry as we se|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marcsmith: take away the AK of clubs and i'd certainly pre-empt (but with 3@S)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I'm lost for printable words|pg||
pc|cA|nt|peachy: I'm dumbfounded, I thought 2S instead of 2H was clear, but of course I don't know their methods|pg||

nt|tejjyid: it would be a pretty bizarre method that mandated getting to 3@S on those hands|pg||
