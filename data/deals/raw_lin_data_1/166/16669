nt|psridhar: welcome :)|pg||
nt|janm: HI all|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Jan welcome|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest.html|pg||
nt|janm: We get to start with a competitive hand - wonder how high they'll get on this one?|pg||
nt|sybarra: click on NEC in middle, then look at teams or scores or whatever you want|pg||
nt|psridhar: both sides have only 8 card siot fits-so 3 level is high enuf|pg||
nt|janm: Looks as if EW can probably take 9 tricks in spades - with E's good spots, he can't be uppercut, despite the 4-1 break.|pg||
nt|psridhar: or 3@H|pg||
nt|psridhar: rufffing @s with nat trump|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|janm: In hearts, NS can get two ruffs, can't they (or a ruff and an uppoercut)|pg||
nt|vugraphzys: hi all-from operator|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2H|nt|psridhar: it is likely 3@h now by ew|pg||
mb|3C|mb|4S|nt|janm: No, guess S can only get in once, but then declarer has to guess the hearts. And somehow I think the KQJT98 of spades look like trump :)|pg||
nt|nicksan: Hi again|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|janm: Well, they got to spades, but one level too high|pg||
nt|psridhar: thats ambitious 4@s....the 9 HCP outside @s ..had they contained 2 aces may be it will make|pg||
mb|5D|mb|d|mb|p|nt|janm: Although NS might scramble 9 or even 10 tricks in clubs? |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|janm: Now, that's ambitious!! (5@d I mean)|pg||
nt|psridhar: but it served to create an illusion to N who has saved|pg||
pc|sK|nt|psridhar: can lose trump conntrol here|pg||
nt|janm: It seems a little pessimistic to save with 3 pretty clear defensive tricks and a partner who bid, but I'm sure you're right that he doesn't think he's making this|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s6|pg||
nt|nicksan: He will get severely forced, this will not be pretty|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||

pc|dA|pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|janm: Definitely not a good position to be in|pg||
nt|psridhar: somehow i thk it will be more|pg||
nt|psridhar: 800 i fancy|pg||
nt|nicksan: Looks like 500 if he goes to dummy now and plays Clubs again|pg||
nt|janm: When he gives up the next club, he gets tapped again and now W has more trumps than declarer. I don't think declarer is going to enjoy those long clubs|pg||
nt|nicksan: he gets tapped, But West has to give North the lead with the heart..|pg||
nt|janm: But West will eventually have to lead hearts for him, so he should score the heart K as well as (probably) 5 trumps and the club & spade A's|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|c4|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|c9|pc|h7|pg||
nt|janm: That would be 500 I think, but if he's held to 4 trumps, which is possible if he releases the trump Q and West can play the J, it'll be 800. Definitely not a good result compared ...|pg||
nt|janm: to the +50 in 4@s|pg||

nt|janm: So an 8 IMP loss for NS, who would have gained 5 if they'd let EW play 4@s|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|janm: Do we know EW's methods? Guess so, strong club?|pg||
nt|nicksan: Could be more trump control issues here in 4 @S..|pg||
nt|psridhar: Precision is popular in China|pg||
mb|1S!|mb|p|nt|janm: I wonder what their range for a 2NT opening is, or do they use that for minors?|pg||
nt|janm: And 1@s is some sort of artificial intervention - possibly short or long spades? Or maybe a transfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: I'm told that EW open 2NT with 20-21. Have to confess that I'd upgrade this E hand to that - 3 Aces, only one Quack|pg||
nt|nicksan: And lot's intermediates and a 5-card suit...|pg||

nt|janm: flat distribution|pg||

nt|nicksan: In the previous match we saw a disgraceful disdain of the @D 7. Can we finally have a declarer making the last trick with it here? |pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|janm: 1 @d, 1@h and 1@s to lose, even after getting the spades right - does he have 10 tricks? I think so, with the 4th diamond in dummy setting up - having won the spade finesse, he'll ...|pg||
nt|janm: probably play AK and a diamond, so that if they're 4-2, he can ruff the fourth one for his tenth trick|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||
nt|janm: Or maybe he's seen a sort of dummy reversal? Ruff a heart and 2 clubs in dummy and score the spade K and then the AJ in hand to go with the AK, AK, A?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h9|pc|h8|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|s5|pc|hT|pg||
nt|nicksan: He's going for all the spade tricks|pg||
pc|cT|nt|janm: The opponents took out an entry with the diamond shift, but he can still try to score all the trumps, until he finds out the club split|pg||
nt|nicksan: He should know from the overcall that Clubs are bent|pg||
nt|janm: Then it'll be back to diamonds probably, needing them 3-3 I think (has to pull N's remaining trumps before giving up a diamond, or S can lead a club through to score the spade Q)|pg||

nt|psridhar: why not 4@C over 3@H? |pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|4N|nt|janm: What was 3@s?|pg||
mb|p|nt|nicksan: very hard to locate the 7th Club and the @D queen, but perhaps they'll get there on strength alone|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|psridhar: thats why i feel S shd hv taken control|pg||
nt|janm: Sounds as if S thinks 4NT is Keycard for hearts - now it's going to be hard for N to envisage all those tricks|pg||
nt|psridhar: he is looking at the 7 th @c|pg||
nt|nicksan: CR only in 6 @C, so a lot of IMP's at stake|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|janm: Now N knows that S doesn't have the heart Q; maybe the 3@c bid missing the K should be AQJ? Although surely 6 would be enough|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|janm: Presumably 5NT is asking for specific Kings and shows that N thinks they have adequate trumps and all the controls|pg||
nt|janm: No, guess it was number of Kings, since S bid 6@c|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|janm: Or perhaps I just have the auction all wrong :)|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|psridhar: wont he lose a club, dia and 2 trumps? of course this lead helps|pg||
nt|janm: Most leads would help and he can take the spade finesse to get rid of 2 diamonds so only lose 1 club and 2 trumps?|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|dK|pg||
nt|janm: Yes, definitely worked better to play this one from the strong hand and also have the stronger defensive hand on lead|pg||

nt|janm: first and second), maybe E can bid the slam|pg||
nt|psridhar: and only 800|pg||
