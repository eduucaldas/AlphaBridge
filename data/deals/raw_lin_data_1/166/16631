nt|disa: unless someone plays 10-12 Nt then we have 3 opening NTs |pg||

nt|jameslee 2: and more with the bidding|pg||

mb|1S|nt|sarkar_suk: the final contract shd be 3 Nt :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  and Kenneth:)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: minors 5/5 in E|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 1@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: 4@H is -500|pg||
nt|disa: e-w have a save in 4Hs|pg||
mb|2N|nt|jameslee 2: = length star with the hier suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|sarkar_suk: yes|pg||
nt|bvdahl: but 5 @c makes, right?|pg||
nt|andersk: id 3 NT now|pg||
mb|3C|nt|andersk: NS wont bid 3 NT now|pg||
mb|p|nt|kskov: 8 tricks in spades seems to be the limit, 10 tricks in minors EW|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 2@D =  11 + invitational to game in @S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: looks like an easy 4@S for EW.|pg||
nt|andersk: Some comment on Helness opening, I totally agree with opening 1 @S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: just fine with @S suit.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sarkar_suk: in 5 @C @SJ will play a vital role:)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: support @S|pg||
nt|sommer:  hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|disa: are N-S playing a weak NT?|pg||
nt|andersk: Yes thats correct|pg||
mb|3S|nt|andyv:  good discipline by S not to get carried away with his 6 card suit|pg||
nt|bg: good 1 spade opening 3 clubs is singleton should stop in 4 spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|disa: in 5C S goes on the heart|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Hi Polv|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Polv|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: N goes even S denided to go to Game|pg||
nt|andyv:  N however has no such problem|pg||
nt|kskov: difficult to double this, ew might end up in a phantom save|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: W has the last call :)|pg||
nt|bg: not sure what 3 dia is|pg||
mb|4C|nt|andersk: We saw a 13p 1 NT opening privious round|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: no, because when you play @h's towards KQx, you will either avoid 1 @h loser or 2 @s loosers|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: prudently passed out|pg||
nt|kskov: well, he bid 4@d, so he probably felt he had done enough|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|sarkar_suk: they r playing precession probably :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  probably -200 vs. 130...not a huge swing|pg||
nt|lestergold: north is about to ruff with his trump trick|pg||
nt|georgia19: evening Mike|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sarkar_suk: cold contract now :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 2 down for 200 for E-W|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: was always cold|pg||
mb|4N|nt|sarkar_suk: correct|pg||
nt|sommer:  200 seems ok|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 500 would have been better |pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer:  sure|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: club loser will be taken care of by either heart finesse or ruffing out Q cant go wrong|pg||
nt|georgia19: what happened to the first contract, I was trying to get ungagged and missed it|pg||
mb|p|nt|bg: W should pass but fortunately they can stop safely in 5 spades|pg||
pc|h4|nt|andersk: Wont be any problems here|pg||

nt|nicksan: Ooh, that's a great lead on this hand|pg||
nt|nicksan: Gillis of course the holder of this event..|pg||
nt|sharkey: kib questions whether this is really a "nice" stop on these hands; perhaps shud be in game?|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|nt|kskov: 4@s making|pg||
nt|andyv:  W has a mixed raise here|pg||
nt|sommer:  nah..@Druff|pg||
nt|kskov: even on 3x @d lead|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: W suppports 2@S 1 less the total tricks as is vul and has not much |pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|disa: 2C tranfer to diamonds?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: openner X = big hand |pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|andersk: @S lead will set 4@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzzh: Don´t know yet|pg||
mb|p|nt|jameslee 2: xx= nice hand |pg||
nt|lestergold: can even ruff out the K@H for overtrick|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|bvdahl: looks like an exact make. N hasn't really got any choice in @d's|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 3@H shows the suit to play |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 3@S end |pg||
nt|andyv:  with vul, would anyone risk 4@s here?|pg||
nt|bg: score on last board corrected to 5|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|nt|sarkar_suk: correct:)|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|sommer:  then @c 2nd @C can be discarded later, right|pg||
nt|lestergold: not exactly a priority and could of course lead to trouble if spades dont break|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|hK|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|bvdahl: W is trying to find a way for declearer to make 10 :)|pg||

pc|sT|pc|s5|pc|s6|pc|sA|pg||

pc|d8|nt|jameslee 2: nice 2/2 @S drop |pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|d4|pg||
nt|georgia19: as you say, Mike, can make an overtrick, if he thinks it worth the effort, overtricks can be vital in a close match|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h6|pc|h8|pg||
nt|andersk: Had to play @H to A and @C to make 10, however not much interesting when game not bid|pg||

nt|bvdahl: had @cK been offside, the club shift would have been uncomfortable. Now he couldn't make a mistake|pg||
nt|andyv:  unusual for Helness not to have gone to game|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: would be a nice call !|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: to big hands againxt |pg||

nt|jameslee 2: E = 5/4@D/@C 15 |pg||
mb|d|nt|disa: this should be a quiet 4S|pg||
nt|bvdahl: standard 4@s EW here with standard 11|pg||
nt|andersk: not|pg||
nt|georgia19: NS must be wondering when they'll get hands to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|jameslee 2: 5/4/2/2 = modern style to open 1Nt |pg||
mb|2S|nt|bvdahl: unless that get greedy for slam|pg||
nt|disa: you have 2 diamond losers|pg||
nt|andersk: @C 8 in North prevents the squeeze|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: today there are much more hands openning NT |pg||
mb|3S|nt|lestergold: 6@s will surely be bid however there is duplication here and may be hard to avoid loss of two minor suit tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|jameslee 2: not only 4.3.3.3  / 4.4.3.2 / 5.3.3.2   but also 6.3.2.2  / 5.4.2.2|pg||
nt|sommer:  @H may be Nilslands slinkningar.. weak, both MA|pg||
mb|3N|nt|andyv:  have to love those 4-2 fits|pg||
nt|kskov: Farstad cant double again as it probably would have been take out|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: X from opps makes W bid a defensive 2@H |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: double dummy its easy single dummy not so|pg||
nt|rnmalik: EW can land into 3NT and would make on non-@C lead and @S switch.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|bg: N should lead a club here|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jameslee 2: playing with a 4/2 trumps :(|pg||
nt|georgia19: it's hard for us to say how they SHOULD play, when we can see that it fails...|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@s c9mbined 32 9 card fit and all the controls etc and yet its not a very good contract|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
nt|bvdahl: and it woun't e difficult discards since declearer must play 3 x @h's before trying for a squeeze|pg||
nt|lestergold: dont see how you can stay out of it|pg||
nt|georgia19: has he shown 5 keys + trumpQ?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Interesting defense.|pg||
nt|bg: spade Q-A then 8 back will stop further spades|pg||
nt|rnmalik: have to be precise because of @D squeeze.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|lestergold: it will be intyeresting to see what one of the world's very greatest card players makes of it|pg||
nt|bg: deuce of spades now would be a mistake S would not know who had nine|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true.|pg||
nt|bg: club Q ok also|pg||
nt|bg: actually N can lead any card in his hand except spade deuce!|pg||
nt|andersk: that not tru, after @S2 Svendsen can switch @C|pg||
nt|andersk: true|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|andyv:  probably should have pitched a @D instead of a @c|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @H swithch would remove any chance of making and no squeeze to S.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|georgia19: predict the lead?|pg||
nt|georgia19: hard to find anything obvious|pg||
nt|lestergold: what are the squeeze end play possibilities here?|pg||
nt|bg: spade deuce just creates a problem who has the 9?|pg||
nt|andersk: @D was the only to make, then South would be endplayed|pg||
pc|h8|nt|lestergold: oh this will help|pg||
nt|georgia19: is that a question - would it help?|pg||
nt|lestergold: Helness will not expect this to be a lead away from Q|pg||

nt|sharkey: Surprised Erik cashed @S10 since he knew @S9 with Gillis after North's return of @S8|pg||

nt|sharkey: indeed|pg||

nt|georgia19: an easy grand slam to make|pg||
nt|dburn: but even if the defence hadn't given him an entry with @s10, he could have put South in with the fourth spade to take a red-suit finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: sure the interest is in tyhe bidding|pg||
nt|georgia19: good hand for splinters and key card blackwood|pg||
nt|dburn: if North can show his singleton club, then Blackwood and a king-ask ought to do the rest|pg||
nt|bg: another NT hand how high will they get?|pg||
nt|bg: answered:)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: one of those hands where it is easy to identify possesion of fit and controls but counting 13 tricks in the bidding is not always sttraightforward|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: defence try  to incomunicate so he does K@H |pg||
nt|kareno: Love to know what 3nt meant.  Perhaps some undisclosed singleton?  Spade singleton?|pg||
nt|georgia19: if South doesn't know about the singleton he will stop in 6|pg||
pc|d9|nt|bvdahl: yes, I am always wondering why people don't do it more often with 8 HCP's against strong NT's and 11 like here....|pg||
nt|bvdahl: Perticularly these days when players seems eager to balance in all positions|pg||
nt|andersk: Since North have 4432 and 4 card spades, I have to agree with 2 club|pg||
nt|bvdahl: sure, but in general...|pg||
nt|andersk: we probably make 8 tricks or better in NT|pg||
nt|disa: well the way meckstroth explaines it with 11 you always go because the other table playing 15-17 will invite and now 13 is a max and even if you only have 23 points they still have ...|pg||
nt|disa: to beat you|pg||
nt|bvdahl: maybe I have played too much poker, and like to get my check raises in at the brigdge table as well :)|pg||
nt|andersk: cheek raises in bridge is common:)|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d8|pc|c2|pg||

pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|s7|pg||
nt|georgia19: 1@H - 4@C would make it easy|pg||

pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|andersk: opps|pg||
pc|s6|nt|andersk: had to run the Q|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|georgia19: maybe just a cue bid|pg||
nt|kareno: A little heavy for a splinter as I play.  |pg||
nt|dburn: and North did bid 4@s, above game on his own|pg||
nt|lestergold: problem is we do not know esactly what some of their bids meant|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|dburn: nor did they, by the look of things - good chance for Hauge there|pg||
nt|vugraphzzh: N told E that 3nt was spade|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe they invert 3@s and 3NT, so that 3@s is "serious" and 3NT is a spade cue bid|pg||
nt|dburn: but it's all speculation|pg||
nt|kareno: Are these KO matches?  Round Robin?|pg||
nt|lestergold: there is alot to identify here not just the two black singletons but also the K@d |pg||
nt|dburn: this is a Swiss, I think|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|bvdahl: don't like the @h play here. Trying to run the 9@s or play small club seems more flexible|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  ok, that makes more sense|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Gudni|pg||
nt|dburn: 4@h reasonable contract, but unlucky lie of cards - still, how would East-West do in diamonds?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|andersk: this is a hand that showes why I dont like 20-21 NT in multi|pg||
nt|bvdahl: @d lead here is not good......|pg||
nt|andersk: EW might overcall if vouln is oposit|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: yes ty |pg||
nt|vugraphzzh: everything for you :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: with a 5/5 open 1@D going for a thin openner |pg||
nt|andyv:  should have a lot of bidding here|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 1@H= 5 card nice intervention  with 4@S on the side|pg||
mb|d|nt|jameslee 2: 2@C shows a 5 card 11 +|pg||
nt|bg: god result for Hauge in open room|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sommer:  minor slam NS now..but 4@h makes too|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: not very well if no one bids them, of course|pg||
nt|bg: good|pg||
mb|5D|nt|andersk: D|pg||
nt|rnmalik: x here by W, would demand @S lead, is it not?|pg||
nt|andersk: find my major|pg||
nt|andyv:  with vul, NS may do well by sacrificing in 7@c if EW get to 6@h|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4@H / 5@C  end contract|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: from here will see :)|pg||
nt|chick: worst danger is pushing NS to 6|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: K@C finesse adn not play for drop makes |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 5@C|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 5!@H= -1|pg||
mb|d|nt|disa: most experts play dbl either shorter majo or spades now if it's spades rdbl by N should show doubt|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I'd lead a @h now since I hold @sJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzzh: Helness alert the dbl|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rnmalik: may be, I play for @S only.:)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 5@H X = -1 = 200|pg||
nt|sommer:  the 4@H bid doesnt look like a stiff @CK|pg||
nt|andyv:  if vul, N's pass would be forcing... not sure how NS play pass here|pg||
nt|sommer:  sacrifice now....|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: yes ty Fcarioca is wright with finesse can make 6@C ty  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: actually the double ask for weakes major out|pg||
nt|dburn: still, I'm not sure 4@h is down yet|pg||
nt|dburn: though Helness has done well to avoid leading a top spade|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|dburn: however, he may have wasted some of the potential of his heart spots|pg||
pc|h2|nt|andyv:  6@c the insurance bid:)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: @D = discards a @S losser in S|pg||
nt|kskov: now he needs to get the clubs right for a push|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andyv:  finessing a slight favortie over 1-1 split|pg||
nt|caitlin: @C break here is a killer|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kskov: think he will do that|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jameslee 2: lets see he could get it correct :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  favorite|pg||
nt|dburn: still, the strong temptation will be for declarer to rely on one of two spade finesses|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|dburn: but he is going about it the right way so far...|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|bvdahl: you expect pd to hold a rock solid suit, and not as much of a chance that the suit is @s when you hold @sJ|pg||
nt|sommer:  quite obvious to bid 6@C, yes|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|bg: this points out fallacy of takeout double when holding a good biddable suit|pg||
pc|dK|nt|disa: should make 10 tricks|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: ther he goes |pg||
pc|dA|nt|andyv:  looking into the stars for a clue|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jameslee 2: go it correct yes :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  wd|pg||
nt|andersk: @H Q|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|dburn: ..two diamond ruffs, five hearts, two clubs and a spade, but...|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|pc|hQ|nt|dburn: that spade suit was just too much of a temptation|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|sharkey: yes|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jbgood: not sure about the upgrade with that hand - too much concentrated in the short suits|pg||

nt|andyv:  interesting that passing 5@c was the big winner...and, yes, S could infer the W was void in clubs to be doing all that bidding.|pg||
