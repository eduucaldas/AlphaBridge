mb|3C|nt|andersk: NS wont bid 3 NT now|pg||

mb|p|nt|disa: in 5C S goes on the heart|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Hi Polv|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Polv|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: W has the last call :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: We saw a 13p 1 NT opening privious round|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bvdahl: no, because when you play @h's towards KQx, you will either avoid 1 @h loser or 2 @s loosers|pg||
