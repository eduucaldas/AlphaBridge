nt|athene: hi good morning all :)|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|milton_se: fit jump, it seems|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@s is a nice contract on EW|pg||
nt|idc: Sime & Matheson remain in this room from the first half, playing 15-17 and 5 card majors, basically natural|pg||
nt|Walddk7: quelle Cronier, Elisabeth?  |pg||
mb|3C|nt|paulg:  Jones/Jones play Acol, Sime/Matheson play 5-card majors, strong notrump|pg||
nt|justin c: 3NT = strong 4M opening|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: sry chacting up|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: 4@h is where you want to be|pg||
nt|justin c: but not so easy to figure that out|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2@C = 11+ nat|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: Just caught up. will enter final result:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and hello Geoff |pg||
nt|toobad: afternoon Geoff|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: definitely the hot seat........like a sauna in here|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: Burns asking questions of 2nt|pg||
nt|athos: Philippe|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Mci|pg||
mb|3H|nt|yo_yo: err  is that right?|pg||
nt|sybarra: in Philly,  I was in the "freezer room"   ....players arrived with coats on,  enjoy the heat |pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: Good afternoon all|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hello Mike and David|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good afternoon Roland |pg||
nt|Walddk5: Our operator is Valerie Mathers|pg||
nt|dagold: 2N-3@s-4@s?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: Hi all, will try to keep up!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South possibly close to 3@s over 1NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but 2@S should be forcong, so no real hurry|pg||
nt|dagold: if natural he hass it. but some play that as a splinter|pg||
nt|athos: Bénédicte joue avec Sylvie Willard de l autre côté|pg||
mb|3N|nt|milton_se: trumps 3-2, no drama|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 5@C cheaper than 4@H|pg||
nt|ralfwil: not if NS can find their @s ruff|pg||
nt|idc: Joined by SHields & Denning playing a strong club system, also with a 15-17 NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  i think Sime will bid 4@s here, which will give Daffyd Jones an interesting problem|pg||
nt|ralfwil: can W find 4@d?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: but this can go down|pg||
nt|athene: would 4nt be general takeout now?|pg||
nt|athene: having limited his hand with 4@H |pg||
nt|athene: it can't really be blackwood|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Bonjour à Marshall|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Contrat solide|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sybarra: Northern Ireland needs more "swingy" bds |pg||
nt|idc: Good morning Bill, and everyone|pg||
nt|athene: hi|pg||
nt|paulg:  best defence will take this down 3 ... and they are on the road to that|pg||
nt|idc: Harder once East opened 1NT, not that I disagree with his choice|pg||
nt|chilloncan: salut a tout le monde|pg||
pc|s8|nt|pfbr: swingy in their direction :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes indeed|pg||
pc|sK|nt|toobad: good evening all|pg||
nt|rmb1: Hi John|pg||
nt|ralfwil: This is a disadvantage keeping a 5-card major when opening 1nt|pg||
nt|idc: A start like: 1@s 2@d 4@d would get the job done a lot more easily|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|rmb1: Sorry 2@C = clubs INV+ or other GF, 2@D relay|pg||
nt|justin c: i should have more faith|pg||
nt|mikeirl: S attack best|pg||
nt|justin c: imagined that N would try harder to play in @C|pg||
nt|toobad: this should be off a trick in each suit|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|justin c: knows he is being forced if @H trumps, but the short hand taking the tap in @C|pg||
nt|mrt2000: don't think so|pg||
nt|athene: yes, very easy to get the two diamond ruffs|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rodal f: Seems as a flatty. 120 tr|pg||
nt|rodal f: 10 tr|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed, but the necessity of making one more trick for game may have influenced his thinking|pg||
nt|rmb1: Trumps 3-3 makes this easy in practice but not before some agonising|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes!|pg||
nt|dagold: so this should be pretty simple, probably 2 overtricks|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugraphzxy: Jones asking system|pg||
nt|toobad: Hi Robin|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|athene: the only big hurdle was finding the opening lead|pg||
nt|chilloncan: en france on ne reve pas de consider d'imaginer un baraage de 2P avec la main E. pays tranquille:)|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h7|nt|rmb1: North doesn't need @HA for opening bid.  But declarer has got it right|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|d3|nt|hawe45:  Oui - mais il etait en deuxieme position|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: it's not totally trivial because sometimes with that sort of holding you have to attack one of your suits and use the @DA to get in to cash them|pg||

nt|athos: ichiers/directs-webradio.html|pg||
pc|hK|nt|idc: Not very friendly to be doubling the first contract of the day|pg||
nt|athene: cashing the @DA at trick 1 does hold some risk of giving away a vital tempo, setting up a side suit for declarer|pg||
nt|idc: But at least it will blow the sleep out of declarer's eyes|pg||
nt|athene: oops|pg||
nt|paulg:  the other danger of cashing the @dA is that partner will not read it|pg||
pc|h5|nt|idc: Though I confess I've been known to try a psychic 1NT with the South hand opposite a passed partner  *blush*|pg||

nt|yo_yo: i guess it's quick run through|pg||
nt|mikeirl: assume there was more to the bidding than recorded :)|pg||
nt|steveray: saves time opening with the best contract|pg||
nt|rmb1: both pairs play strong NT and 5 card majors|pg||
nt|rmb1: Thats one way of retaining trump control :)|pg||
nt|justin c: temporarily, anyway|pg||
nt|sybarra: at least your fingers move|pg||
nt|toobad: 6c here, but hard to bid|pg||
nt|athene: south wasn't in on the plot?|pg||
nt|paulg:  good result for Scotland|pg||
nt|athene: no way north is leading a random @DA there, with both other side suits known to be held|pg||
nt|athene: definitely south's fault i think|pg||
nt|chilloncan: a) je ne critiquais pas    b) 2e position n;est pas la meme chose apres une ouverture qu'apres un Passe|pg||

nt|athene: west has a lot more club support than you normally have when partner opens 4|pg||
nt|athene: but the rest of his hand says defend...|pg||
nt|paulg:  Sime planning to double 4@s or take the save?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW play quite unusual methods over 1NT|pg||
nt|chilloncan: pass?|pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2@D=4+@s|pg||
nt|hawe45:  OK...|pg||
mb|2D|nt|rmb1: Have to avoid losing two spades in 4@H but defence may establish @CQJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: sry just catching up|pg||
nt|mikeirl: ok|pg||
nt|steveray: hard to see this making|pg||
nt|rmb1: Yes.  3NT is harder|pg||
nt|sybarra: S may enter the bidding this round|pg||
nt|roswolf: is this live?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Feel NS are in trouble|pg||
nt|mikeirl: yes. D lead shoul beat |pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's the end of 3NT then|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i would like the see the bidding, i cant understand why they arent in 4@H|pg||
nt|steveray: assuming East opened 1@C South should not take the @S finesse|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@c "natural", ostensibly 5+ clubs and a major or 6+ clubs with enough to open the bidding|pg||
nt|mrt2000: oh boy ...................|pg||
nt|toobad: a bit frisky by S at the vulnerability..|pg||
nt|athene: neither, i would think|pg||
nt|idc: will sime dbl?|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose he might double|pg||
nt|idc: continuing from last set, where first 4 hands (at both tables) were all dbld contracts|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I prefer 2@c from W in this situaton|pg||
nt|idc: East has added a point, now West may add a point or two and ... it may end in tears|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@s=4@S, minimum or medium hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|toobad: 2nt now??|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2NT now?|pg||
nt|rmb1: y :)|pg||
nt|justin c: might raise this|pg||
nt|justin c: if he decides S void in @C|pg||
nt|roswolf: should raise it i think|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hello Geoffrey, Justin and Ed|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi roland|pg||
nt|justin c: hi|pg||
nt|Walddk5: and John of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: but being in third position at favourable is enough to open the bidding nowadays|pg||
nt|mrt2000: trouble here|pg||
nt|idc: North wondering if it is time to unsheath the axe|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rmb1: 2@C = nat, limited (6+ or 5C+4M)|pg||
nt|sybarra: havent gotten to card yet, is is some form of flannery?  (I may get killed for mentioning that word) |pg||
nt|toobad: a @H lead ducked by S woud have been really unpleasant for declarer|pg||
nt|toobad: short and sweet|pg||
nt|sybarra: and a discussion every partnership needs to have,  is 2 @D forcing by passed hand?  (I think not,  cue bid only force) |pg||
nt|idc: Beimg Aceless on this sort of auction is a minus|pg||
nt|chilloncan: meme dans un pays tranquille on risque un petit son avec la main Ouest:)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|milton_se: won't be happy |pg||
nt|pfbr: :(|pg||
nt|mrt2000: happier than if doubled!!|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mrt2000: N must have seen his partner's overcalls before|pg||
nt|toobad: 3c from Ian is v tame|pg||
nt|roswolf: the club holding is bad and he is missing 2 aces but south must hld enough|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|rodal f: E? Who have the rest of the pints?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi all:) Could have been a interestin 6@D if opp was 1-3 at @D|pg||
nt|rmb1: Difficult for North to act with all but one of his points in opponents suits|pg||
nt|dburn: awkward for South - best is probably not to shift to spades, but it looks an obvious defence to follow|pg||
nt|idc: and holding KJx in partner's suit an even bigger minus for doubling|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with open cards W can take a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|idc: I suspect he wants to take a number of @d ruffs in hand, shorten trumps|pg||
nt|idc: not that he has many entries to dummy but North may be forced into helping him|pg||
nt|Walddk7: http://bridgetopics.com/news/2010/dec/helgeness-and-fantunes-immigrate-monaco|pg||
nt|chilloncan: E a un quasi-supermax pour l'enchere de 2K, mais surtout a ces couleurs 3K serait une ecaggeration qui ne le tentait guere|pg||
nt|chilloncan: je demande mille pardon d'avance pour mes 3000 fautes inevitables de frappe:(|pg||
pc|cT|nt|paulg:  i disagree with Sime's strategy here|pg||
pc|c3|nt|paulg:  either bid 5@c on the first round or pass/double 4M|pg||
nt|idc: Puts more pressure on opponents to bid 5@c straightaway, yes|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rodal f: Second best|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yes Ruff and play a @h to dummy, ruff a @d, take @hA and exit with @cA and a @cx|pg||
nt|roswolf: he has raised well done|pg||
nt|justin c: i see 11|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|nt|vugraphzxa: N thinking...|pg||
nt|mrt2000: on that lead, this may only go 1 off|pg||
nt|milton_se: he might have feared that 4S was playable|pg||
nt|Walddk7: http://bridge.silvertexter.eu/results/1O3.TXT for running scores|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|pg||
nt|sybarra: and down we go |pg||
nt|idc: North may stretch to bid over 5@c with some shape|pg||
nt|idc: Easy for me to say that - North holding @cKQ so that South cannot easily get on lead isn't easy for declarer to know|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|nt|milton_se: 2C overcall doesn't contain five spades very often ...|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|s8|pg||
pc|hT|nt|paulg:  yes, i think 5@c immediately is likely to be best|pg||
nt|athene: south will try to cater for 5 spades and @DK with partner|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: as well as just the two aces cashing|pg||
nt|athene: so he lays down the @DA first to see what partner has to say about that|pg||
nt|idc: or if North passes, a second dbl from South is a bit undefined as to how takeout-ish it is|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h6|pg||
pc|c4|pc|d8|nt|milton_se: East may still think it's making :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|idc: -1 was possible but -2 seems likely now|pg||
nt|diumraid: *** Live Overall Scores - CAMROSE *** http://bridge.silvertexter.eu  then "browse results" then 1o3.txt  *****|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he followed it - but declarer didn't have any diamond losers to ruff in dummy|pg||
pc|h3|nt|dburn: and this has helped him keep control of the hand|pg||
nt|dburn: to the extent that if he can guess hearts, he will actually make|pg||
nt|rmb1: or discard a heart and ensure -1|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mrt2000: not now  :)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|sybarra: 2 @H was both majors,  5-10 pts |pg||
nt|ralfwil: it was a mistake from W not to ruff @dK|pg||
nt|idc: Hmm, if he plays a @c now I wonder if it matters what North does - would North ruffing cost a trick?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|rmb1: Just +2|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|toobad: 3 off|pg||

mb|3D|nt|vugraphzxa: hai all|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1@H=1S|pg||
nt|idc: 5-4-2-2 is close enough to balanced and the 5-level is awfully high already|pg||
nt|dagold: 2@d showing hearts|pg||
nt|hawe45:  6 @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: @CK lead|pg||
nt|milton_se: possible to make -- but I wouldn't like to be here :)|pg||
nt|idc: The N-S 1@d is < 16 hcp, bal or unbalanced with either minor|pg||
mb|3S|nt|paulg:  although Sime could hardly be worse and you'd expect to make 5@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Interesting. Need @H lead for stop a 6er|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr wrong|pg||
nt|rodal f: Have one chance more|pg||
mb|4D|nt|dburn: he might - the cards are fairly well disposed|pg||
nt|toobad: started with 12 finished with 10|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 5422 with a trump trick is not at all a hard decision in my view|pg||
nt|idc: Looking at North's hand on opening lead, there must be a case for a @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: 2@S=force|pg||
nt|insia1: will they go to slam ?|pg||
nt|rmb1: 4@C allowing partner to judge what to do over 4@S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @dA as well as @hJ on side  in 6@c|pg||
nt|milton_se: there|pg||
nt|sybarra: anderson showing good judgement, as much as he would like to be in red game|pg||
nt|idc: 2@d is I think a relay for a game-forcing North hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: 3@d alerted by shields but not denning|pg||
nt|roswolf: the e/w system has a lot of relays and transfers|pg||
mb|4H|nt|justin c: can subsequently promote @S10|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 3@D showed a @H suit here|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2NT = 16+ BAL|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@d=hearts, 10+hcp, not 5332 shape |pg||
nt|dagold: might just get home in this but should be 1 down really|pg||
nt|chilloncan: sur la 2, Zimmerman a bien evalue sa main de facon plus aggressive que Philippe, et en a paye une amende de 5 IMPs|pg||
mb|p|nt|steveray: but 5@H is cold on 2 finesses|pg||
nt|rmb1: And NS judged to give up quietly ?|pg||
nt|justin c: if dec ducks trick 1, needs @h underlead later|pg||
nt|justin c: bit easier from where we are sitting|pg||
mb|4N|nt|rodal f: 6@C to come|pg||
nt|toobad: 6c is a great contract|pg||
nt|idc: Oh, South would be on lead on this auction of course|pg||
nt|idc: I supose a @s from South would also do|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: And the @C blowed away after the invit 3@D|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 10 or 11 tricks here|pg||
nt|roswolf: should make since he shouldnt get the trumps wrong|pg||
nt|warrens:  @H shift or he can make it with an endplay|pg||
nt|athos: j ai une CC (qui n'eest peut etre plus à jour) pour fantoni nunes|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 3T = ?|pg||
nt|athos: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008MindSportGamesBeijing/Open/Italy/fantoni-nunes.pdf|pg||
mb|5C|nt|rodal f: Hi Meddy:)|pg||
nt|steveray: North needs partner to play a club before the D@s are set up|pg||
nt|steveray: Diamonds that is|pg||
nt|dburn: one of these days, the English will lead trumps when declarer actually has some diamond losers to ruff in dummy|pg||
nt|justin c: lol|pg||
nt|dburn: still, no great matter against a part score|pg||
nt|rmb1: Less good opposite 3442|pg||
nt|idc: "relay" isn't quite the right term (he said, wearing his pedants hat) but we know what the CC means|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  well done|pg||
nt|athos: 1@c 3@c = 5@c 5x+ FM|pg||
nt|athos: en admettant que cette CC de 2008 est tjs valide|pg||
mb|5D|nt|idc: Can't complain to the dealing machine so far; these first few hands fun|pg||
nt|athene: declarer trying to get something going - set up a spade is almost impossible but you might set up a black-suit squeeze if the defence are very sleepy|pg||
nt|idc: Quite a bit of work to do here|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: well done erichsen|pg||
nt|justin c: if i understood the system card, E knew West with 6@D or @D and M|pg||
nt|justin c: so marked with @H once dec followed to trick 1|pg||
nt|chilloncan: CC Monegasque risque d'etre legerement differente|pg||
mb|6S|nt|yo_yo: but will south lead @C?|pg||
nt|steveray: might the @D be a singleton?|pg||
nt|mikeirl: odds on to|pg||
nt|rmb1: North can afford to be passive, but this is the most direct approach.  Hopefully 4@C bid will reap its rewards now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he might take his partner for a singleton @D?|pg||
nt|rmb1: Declarer would not allow @DK to win if he had the ace|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hopefully selway will work that out|pg||
nt|justin c: is the West hand not worth a strong @C opening?|pg||
nt|justin c: seen worse|pg||
nt|justin c: maybe they dont get to game even then|pg||
mb|p|nt|insia1: good bid|pg||
nt|rodal f: Make S hand as main and nwxt|pg||
nt|rodal f: Coffe|pg||
nt|steveray: might expect the finesse to win|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he did |pg||
nt|paulg:  ruffing with the @d9 only tells the opponents that the @d8 might be an entry .. does not matter here, but careless talk can often cost|pg||
nt|idc: West has led the unbid suit (assuming as I suspect that 3@d is natural), and looks good for defence|pg||

nt|sybarra: click on the partnership, to see the convention card|pg||
nt|egezzer: West is John Greenwood,Shirley?|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe club lead ...after alert, which may have been "could be 2" |pg||
nt|idc: I should warn specs that comparisons may take some time to trickle through - other room still on their first board|pg||
mb|p|nt|pfbr: david greenwood|pg||
nt|idc: and since they start with 15 & 16, they won't reach Bd 1 for a while|pg||
nt|paulg:  Walker and Short then, not the Outreds, in the other room|pg||
pc|c5|nt|dburn: the strong variety of 1@c has a higher lower bound for Carrot players than for Precision players|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No swing - chelem dans la salle ouverte aussi, je pense - 4 @S se joue plus vite|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|insia1: I think he will drop @C, after finess @D|pg||
nt|idc: indeed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: can take the heart finesse twice - 3@h 1@d 5@c?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|pfbr: (JTR) on bbo|pg||
nt|rmb1: Like scores at http://bridge.silvertexter.eu/results/1O3.TXT|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|toobad: +4 after the lead|pg||
nt|idc: Tough hands this type: neither declarer & dummy nor the defenders' hands have any communications between them|pg||
pc|s2|nt|roswolf: this is -1|pg||
nt|warrens:  hoping to endplay E if he has Kxx of @C's and 2 @h's (not really possible, but he can dream)|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|nt|rmb1: Temptation with 2-suiters is to open 1suit nat if possible to get your suits over quickly|pg||
nt|egezzer: Oh. Thank you Anita|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Just what we would expect from the winners of the Premier league|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|mc|11|nt|dagold: indeed he can. Sorry, distracted here|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: sorry, 4 cards left to play, declarer has won last 4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: why not @CJ? |pg||
nt|mdgraham: not that it matters with 3-2 clubs|pg||
nt|dagold: to keep the entry to the hearts?|pg||

nt|rmb1: open room started at board 15, so we will see comparisons when they complete board 1, etc.|pg||
nt|dburn: not quite sure why he made only three|pg||
nt|dburn: perhaps to reassure his partner that they had not missed a game|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: sorry bad light some cards incorrect|pg||
nt|toobad: that always feels bad, even when it isnt|pg||
nt|athene: east might open 1@C in third seat here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, solid plus |pg||
nt|roswolf: a good start for the english|pg||
nt|chilloncan: mais one se serait attendu chez cette paire qu'ils aient les moyens de decouvrir la qualite trouee de leur atout|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mikeirl: they're just starting Board 1 no|pg||
nt|mikeirl: *now|pg||
nt|athene: looks reasonable, if not exactly mandatory|pg||
nt|paulg:  nice hand for South but these strong 4441s often tricky to bid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@d=0+@D|pg||
mb|d|nt|rodal f: A coffe board to come it seems|pg||
nt|idc: Wales also opened 1NT on Bd 17, so no slam bid in other room either: 1 IMP to Scotland|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: par looks like 4M-1 over 4@C=|pg||
nt|mikeirl: perhapsS |pg||
nt|steveray: S might try 3NT|pg||
nt|mikeirl: perhaps S will bid 3nt|pg||
nt|rmb1: OK. So 4@C= is par because 4MX-1 is 200|pg||
nt|mikeirl: snap!|pg||
nt|steveray: or will ask for a @S stop|pg||
nt|rmb1: Will NS get into the auction on this one? |pg||
nt|mrt2000: David must be getting bored  .......  :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: only -1 in 5@c on board 1. Defence must have sipped|pg||
nt|sybarra: one of our fellow commentators with great analysis and even greater sense of humor (imo)|pg||
nt|pfbr: mine too :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @D= multi|pg||
nt|athene: they're easier when opps bid your singleton :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: ok, east didn't oblige :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|rodal f: I would have opened at Ws hand. 1@S 110 by 100 times|pg||
nt|dburn: well, one of them will|pg||
nt|dburn: probably the one with the spades|pg||
nt|dburn: ah - the support double!|pg||
nt|dburn: now what on Earth, I wonder, is East supposed to do with that?|pg||
nt|rmb1: Support XX from North ?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry slipped...|pg||
nt|egezzer: I fully agree with you. And excellent player actually|pg||
nt|paulg:  Matheson would want a better suit, or worse hand, to open 1@c|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt on ew with that nice @c situation|pg||
mb|2S|nt|toobad: on board 17 Wales have been allowed to play in 3nt where the Jones found the good 4S save against it|pg||
nt|athene: east must be a bit worried about the hearts now|pg||
nt|athene: that might stop him balancing|pg||
nt|idc: I like 1@s but here it may end the bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: that is a bad idea|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Hedy Gray |pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Shirley |pg||
nt|paulg:  perhaps not that tricky to bid, although you'd prefer to be in 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt pass 3nt would get the job done|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and 1@s is, amazingly, natural|pg||
nt|dagold: sometimes 3-cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: :) 100 by 100|pg||
nt|steveray: non scientific|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2@D = Ms constructive|pg||

nt|hedyg: where is Anderson going?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: David smiling and asking questions|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3@h from W?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: Yes|pg||
nt|idc: 3@h West, 3NT East, then West thinks for a while and ..?|pg||

nt|idc: Tough spot for West now|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2@D game force I precume|pg||
nt|rmb1: On  1 NS's decision to play in 4@H rather than 5@C was worth an IMP to England|pg||
nt|sybarra: hopefully anderson "hits the deck" |pg||
nt|sybarra: (aka passes)|pg||
nt|justin c: @C lead and @H switch was needed here|pg||
nt|chilloncan: vraisemblablement|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hedyg: he can make this|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@d GF relay|pg||
pc|h9|nt|dburn: it ought to have been worth more than that - 5@c was down off the top|pg||
nt|athene: yes, a pity that the one time in a hundred years a real blue club 2@D comes up, and the person holding the hand isn't playing blue club :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: As W I had used a straight forward 3@d instead of 1@s|pg||
nt|dagold: the lucky spade lie see's this home|pg||
nt|dagold: needed a heart lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South just knew North would lead one of those|pg||
nt|dagold: if declarer takes the 4th heart, north can switch to a club to defeat 3N|pg||
nt|justin c: @h lead seems normal enough tho|pg||
nt|roswolf: for running scores see http://bridge.silvertexter.eu/results/1O3.TXT|pg||
pc|h2|nt|idc: Though I could have been worse: he might be in 4@s with AKX opposite xxxx :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and easy for E to bid 3nt|pg||
nt|idc: No one likes to jump rebid their suit these days - seems to have got devalued by people doing it on 15 counts|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|rodal f: The X from S could have costed 800|pg||
nt|rmb1: Not that you want to be in 4@H, even if you pick up @HK|pg||
nt|hawe45:  A la grammaire danoise, je suis imbattable|pg||
pc|d3|nt|toobad: i'd rather have a shot at 3nt|pg||
nt|othered1: lead may have given the positin away|pg||
nt|roswolf: england currently hold the lead but many boards to go|pg||
nt|warrens:  he knows that West has at least 2 high clubs, but all 3 or HH10x?|pg||
nt|justin c: wonder what N will make of this?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mikeirl: good lead|pg||
nt|toobad: thinks all his cards are working, if David short in H game has chances|pg||
pc|d8|nt|idc: In Bridge World this month I saw someone (Zia?) playing 1@c - 1M - 3@d as forcing good club suit - interesting treatment|pg||
nt|idc: Not that it would have helped on this auction|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 10 tricks again, I think|pg||
nt|warrens:  if he thinks that East has the @H K, he should get it right|pg||
nt|warrens:  :)|pg||
nt|othered1: North obviously has been there before :)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|dagold: a heart lead no good for the defence of course due to declarer's heart spots|pg||
pc|s2|nt|idc: If dummy had another entry, declarer could try crossing & taking early @d finesse to test it out|pg||
nt|idc: but here that's a bit all-or-nothing|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|Walddk7: http://bridge.silvertexter.eu/results/1O3.TXT for running scores|pg||

nt|chilloncan: concours quotidien?|pg||

nt|pfbr: might be some imps if they find 6@d :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: or 6 clubs|pg||
nt|mrt2000: Greetings all, sorry I'm late|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I think 2@c=4+@H, and 2@H shows three|pg||
mb|2S|nt|milton_se: brakes|pg||
nt|idc: Hey, we have the beginnings of partnership harmony here!|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikeirl: unusual lead of Q@H - wud normally be asking to unblock the J|pg||
nt|sybarra: but I think they stop in game |pg||
nt|hedyg: so much for 3NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: "we" zoomed passed that|pg||
nt|toobad: NI have bid the club slam on board 19|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: East asking questions|pg||
nt|idc: Declarer ruffed @dK at trick one (better than line here)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: assuming that EW revert to "standard system" after a 1NT rebid|pg||
nt|athos: en gazzilli, sur le relais à 2@d, normalement l ouvreur indique la main mini avec 2@s |pg||
nt|athos: donc les autres encheres sont reservées pour les mains fortes (2@c vient de 4@c ou de 17+ ou d'une main reguliere forte) pour les zones, faudrait leur demander|pg||
mb|3H|nt|dburn: not that unusual - plenty of pairs play that the king asks for count or unblock, the queen or ace for attitude|pg||
mb|p|nt|pfbr: yes|pg||
nt|egezzer: indeed|pg||
nt|toobad: cant see more than 5 being bid|pg||
nt|pfbr: i'm just optimistic :)|pg||
nt|egezzer: :)|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S will surely be found by some EW pairs|pg||
nt|paulg:  4@s would be a fair save even when you get the spades wrong, so chances of a welsh pickup|pg||
nt|athene: even with the horrible misfit in the side suits (three club losers, @DKQ wasted) it is ok|pg||
nt|athene: when opps have ten hearts and you have ten spades it just can't be wrong to bid 4@S|pg||
nt|paulg:  bidding 1@s is fine when this is their hand and you need to suggest a save|pg||
nt|mrt2000: Hi Geoff and Mike|pg||
nt|roswolf: a practical bid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@H may be four if mimimum|pg||
nt|roswolf: but unsuccessful|pg||
mb|4H|nt|toobad: about the weather??|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: this wont long to play |pg||
nt|toobad: 50 up.......... not a time for punting!!|pg||
nt|rmb1: The computer says only @S4 to the 10 at trick two would defeat 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: written in braille:(|pg||
nt|idc: And then you remember me asking if it was a mistake for North to ruff 3rd round of @c?|pg||
nt|warrens:  ok, after 2 rounds of @D and a @C shift, draw trump, ruff out the last club, then a @H to the 10 or Ace and a @H?|pg||
nt|chilloncan: pas 100% avec le "sert a rien"....X indique l'entame desiree et en meme temps augmente (quoique legerement)  la chance que la dame de P fasse une leveee|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: waht did 2@s mean?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@s Art game try |pg||
nt|roswolf: show a stop!?|pg||
nt|dagold: Hi Geoffrey|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is a true dodo contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  if partner has the strong hand then it could go wrong|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi David:)|pg||
nt|dagold: very odd lead|pg||
nt|mrt2000: why??|pg||
nt|roswolf: will declarer play on hearts ?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: probably|pg||
nt|justin c: assuming they cash 2@D and exit in @C|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|milton_se: but NS really should be in 4 -- not this time though|pg||
nt|idc: Looks like it was :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|justin c: not every day you see a 1600 |pg||
nt|rmb1: card shows Q from KQxx, K from KQ10 and stronger|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure we should have seen one today either - three down looks a bit excessive|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think we say "next" |pg||
nt|rmb1: Declarer still has to play it right|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rmb1: Now declarer need to play on @Cs|pg||
nt|paulg:  but i do prefer to bid my six-card majors|pg||
nt|dagold: because low doubletons are not the usual attack vs NTx|pg||
nt|justin c: what is his best move in the @H suit|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|hawe45:  DÂ´accord, jÂ´ai oubliÃ©, que 2 @D etait artificiel|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: i think west could even consider 4@S over 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: if he was forced to pass first time|pg||
nt|idc: Looks like IMPs for Scotlan on Bd 1 - Walker/Short in 5@h which should make|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h6|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d3|pc|dQ|nt|mrt2000: after this bidding I disagree|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|dburn: ten more to England when Erichsen and Selway bid a not particularly good 4@s on 19|pg||
nt|rmb1: And another 10 to England on  19, making 10 tricks when they needed to in 4@S|pg||
nt|idc: North had to either lead trumps or give dummy the established @dQ for a heart pitch in declarer's hand|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sybarra: from here we can make it,  probably not easy at the table|pg||
nt|rmb1: For instance, he needed to play @H finesse|pg||
nt|roswolf: now off good switch|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|sK|nt|dagold: RHO has shown a balanced hand LHO has shown 4@h|pg||
nt|dagold: that says lets play for a ruff?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Surely North overtook there - very lazy if not|pg||
pc|s4|nt|hedyg: playing to make his contract giving A and Q @c freely|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: YES THEY DID OOPS|pg||
pc|c3|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|rmb1: The open room auction on  19 was 1C-(1H)-2D-(3H)-P-(P)-6NT wow!|pg||
nt|toobad: wd|pg||
nt|chilloncan: on vient de citer le surnom "swan" pour les 7411....le meme joueur anglais qui a forge ce  terme l'a fait dans le context du dicton qu'il a etabli :  "SWANS SHOULD PLAY IN THE LONG ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: SUIT"  (la longuere 7e doit etre atout malgre un fit possible dans la 2e couleur)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|vugraphzxa: N thinking..|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|d5|pc|d7|pg||
nt|athos: (pour les anglophobes, swan = cygne)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|toobad: must have got a h lead then?|pg||
nt|warrens:  @H to the 10 should win 75% of the time (jack onside or 9/k with RHO and the right guess)|pg||

nt|dagold: 16 imps to england on board 4|pg||
nt|dagold: they made game in both rooms|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the other room liggins+whittaker have had 2 huge boards|pg||
nt|warrens:  loses to KJx or Kxx in North|pg||

mb|d|nt|mrt2000: another 3NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: multi  (strong bid coming) |pg||
nt|toobad: another 3nt but EW this time|pg||
nt|idc: You can follow the other room of a match using the 'Movie' facility in BBO|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mdgraham: 1NT denies a four-card major|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: We welcome Paul. Hi:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Why 4@D?|pg||
nt|rmb1: 3NT won't make for NS here either|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Selway has 2 nice cards but will pass probably|pg||
nt|steveray: pass looks right NV|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @S  was David's guess  that pard's suit was spades if the weak hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c not described on the CC probably just meaning gf|pg||
nt|hedyg: t/o double purely showing shape, not force|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok opposite a PH pd who is not supposed to hang you|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks a mere partscore|pg||
mb|3H|nt|pitnor: hi :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzxa: ya|pg||
nt|pfbr: hmm 2@s is a preempt in @hs i think|pg||
nt|ralfwil: another 3nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: will west punt 3nt|pg||
mb|4S|nt|idc: An uneventful 3NT it seems|pg||
nt|justin c: 12 imps to england for playing 5@D rather than 6@D brd 18|pg||
mb|d|nt|rodal f: 2@D might better and u have space to find info|pg||
nt|sybarra: also saying,  I have a better hand in hts, and prepared to play at least 3 @H  (if weak version)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: Lindsay asking 2 c cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitnor: no dobl from e|pg||
nt|steveray: thinks it is @C+@H??|pg||
nt|yo_yo: does he think 4@C is a 2 suited hand?|pg||
nt|rmb1: Does South think it is non-leaping michaels?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: brb|pg||
nt|athene: east might think he is facing a 2-suiter, now, and bid 4@D rather than 3nt|pg||
nt|dagold: east limited|pg||
nt|mrt2000: and will get what he deserves if he does|pg||
nt|athos: 2@c = 10-13 avec 5@c+. Toutes les ouvertures au palier de 2 suivent ce schéma. avec 8-9 ça doit etre libre |pg||
mb|p|nt|pitnor: seems like 8 tricks |pg||
nt|yo_yo: i think he does|pg||
nt|hedyg: A@S lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: should be rapidly off|pg||
nt|dagold: Crouch is max so raises anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: only 50s|pg||
nt|steveray: else he thought it was Gerber|pg||
nt|steveray: just joking|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2NT = GF raise of M (at least by unpassed hand)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|yo_yo: i bet you dont even play Gerber Steve!|pg||
nt|sybarra: round about way of explaining here |pg||
nt|athene: if west really did have 5-6 reds, then east's hand would be very good for things like 6@D|pg||
nt|athene: with the black aces and diamond fit|pg||
nt|paulg:  the West hand is interesting ... many now use 2@c with a gf balanced hand so that 2@d promises five|pg||
nt|paulg:  however, bidding your second weakest suit is not always ideal|pg||
nt|athene: yes, that is much the best i think - garozzo advocated that for a long time with artificial continuations over 2@C|pg||
nt|athene: people are generally starting to catch up with him|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a bit aggressive, this|pg||
nt|roswolf: THIS DOES HAVE CHANCES|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Pour moi, 2 @S sur 2 @C suffit|pg||
pc|h2|nt|pitnor: d3-3|pg||
nt|sybarra: they can beat it |pg||
nt|paulg:  a bit to do here|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might have a restricted choice dilemma in diamonds at some point|pg||
nt|idc: Matheson will spend some time but all the cards lie well for him|pg||
nt|athene: (cash ace and king, dropping a big one from north, and then you have to decide whether to finesse the nine)|pg||
nt|paulg:  not sure he'll have the entries to worry about it|pg||
nt|idc: True, and at that point he may well know North has 4 @s, making 4-2 @d a little more likely|pg||
nt|mrt2000: will make though, with @S 3-3|pg||
pc|h6|nt|idc: or an eventful 6NT but that's not really likely :)|pg||
nt|dagold: even with this, the best lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: and the club pips are favorable for declarer|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: win this trick and go for spades seems normal|pg||
nt|chilloncan: pas d'accord... Qxx a P au mort suffirait peut-etre largement pour 4P et rare serait le Cronier ou autre qui ira a 4P qu'avec cela|pg||
pc|sK|nt|idc: Say he wins this, spade finesse & duck, or immediate duck - later wins, test spades and then has to guess @d|pg||
pc|sA|nt|steveray: not often - I only get weak hands|pg||
nt|justin c: 4@S off in top tricks|pg||
pc|s7|nt|toobad: 6d has chances on a non H lead|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|d9|nt|rmb1:  20 flat in 3@S-1.  McGann bid 3@S a couple of rounds earlier than Liggins|pg||
nt|hedyg: actually safety= ruff this and play A@D|pg||
nt|idc: Best for defence probably @c switch now|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|yo_yo: I'm the only one in Manchester who likes Gerber|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but not here |pg||
nt|steveray: nothing wrong with it|pg||
nt|athene: many people would lead a spade to the queen but even if the suit lies as well as it possibly can, you have to lose one, so you might as well take the deep finesse|pg||
nt|dagold: NI managed to stop in 2N on board 5 to gain 6 imps|pg||
nt|dagold: West judged well|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is straightforward now|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|rmb1: West and South know something went wrong, but what about East|pg||
nt|steveray: so how many down?|pg||
nt|idc: if they continue @h, declarer can set up a long spade to the heartless North|pg||
nt|athene: you don't especially need two fast spades|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sybarra: agree,  |pg||
nt|hedyg: :) sry Geoff|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Mais lÂ´alternativw - nous avons vu - est dÂ´insister sur 4 @S - avec une couleur miserable|pg||

pc|c2|nt|rodal f: Sign of from W wich still can be at 0HP|pg||
nt|sybarra: its "on the way"|pg||
nt|roswolf: rehi|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rmb1: 2@H is nat, GF|pg||
nt|dagold: all this for a flat board!|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|steveray: N/S will be frustrated about the club position|pg||
nt|steveray: whilst west will be worried about them|pg||
nt|rmb1: Because of @C blockage declarer can just knockout @DAK but playing on @H may look better|pg||

nt|hedyg: do we know what 4@D is?|pg||
nt|justin c: East picking his longer M...|pg||
nt|athos: pénible le rebid d'Ouest, il est au top de son jeu. il faudrait pouvoir 'couper' les zones du répondant dans son rebid |pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pc|cA|nt|toobad: well stopped and David will get the QC right now with no pressure|pg||
nt|hedyg: or 3NT for that matter|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure the cc goes that far....I am looking |pg||
nt|hedyg: it doesnt|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: Peter = Goodman|pg||
nt|toobad: i think 3nt was a singleton D|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes ty Geoff|pg||
nt|othered1: geting an early  trump on the track will make this unpleasant for EW, too|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d9|pc|dK|nt|mikeirl: np now|pg||
nt|roswolf: the vampires have a chance to feast on the blod of some englishmen|pg||
nt|justin c: whose side you on :)|pg||
nt|othered1: auction should make defense rather precise|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|athene: @HA, club ruff, heart|pg||
nt|ralfwil: -2!|pg||
pc|d3|nt|paulg:  at least he will get a ruff|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if this makes, that will, yet again, make two disappointed EW pairs|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ralfwil: But didn´t S distroy his communications by winning on dummy?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|toobad: bingo|pg||
nt|roswolf: might be -3 on a trump back|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|milton_se: had to take the lead in hand|pg||
pc|c8|nt|milton_se: but got help|pg||
pc|h3|pc|dA|pc|cT|pg||
nt|rodal f: So. So fare EW have lost one grand, one slam and one 4@H + NS one slam.|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: Revoke of a @h on the last @s so -1|pg||
pc|d7|nt|dagold: so Liggy played for penalties at the wo level which is highly questionable. Anderson had to bid 3@c to get to game|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and some more ammunition for those who like to say that take-out doubles should be taken out|pg||
pc|d5|nt|paulg:  with his natural heart trick|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: the ruff costs a trick with the trumps as they are - he could have made more but of course this is normal play|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|h5|nt|insia1: Liliek will say "come to papa" for 7th trick|pg||

nt|steveray: did north really discard 2 hearts?|pg||
nt|rmb1: Seems odd but true|pg||
nt|egezzer: http://www.wbu.org.uk/ There is a site of the WBU(Welsh Bridge Union)|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 nt might have been making |pg||
nt|hedyg: nicely played|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: Its like LeMans.. cant they play slow... ever|pg||
nt|rmb1: Same result in open room on  20 but NS got closer to 3NT, at least North bid NT :)|pg||
nt|toobad: 6 h??|pg||
nt|athene: ace and another heart, and draw trumps then finesse clubs the other way, would have been 170|pg||
nt|roswolf: a boring push|pg||
nt|dagold: yes just another dull hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes they got appropriate punishment|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Et demai au handball... ? Les Bleus? - ou les miennes|pg||
mb|1H|nt|rmb1: And another 10 to England on  21.  South did not make a negative double and NS settled for 2NT+1|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|paulg:  Wales have drawn level after a more conservative 4@d pre-empt from Walker on board 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: @H and@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: now this is a bidding test for e/w played by east 6@D is very good|pg||
mb|1S|nt|steveray: can E/W make 4@S|pg||
nt|rmb1: Have OR only played 3 boards or have we lost touch with them?|pg||
nt|mikeirl: ghestem|pg||
nt|toobad: even the bad break doesnt beat this|pg||
nt|rmb1: 3@D 3@S 4@C now?|pg||
nt|toobad: 4c i hope|pg||
nt|rmb1: Many can only splinter in opponents suit after an overcall|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 4@H now?|pg||
nt|dagold: well it's ok|pg||
nt|dagold: not sure about very good|pg||
nt|roswolf: ston club start and a frivolous overcall|pg||
nt|mdgraham: may be a two-suiter|pg||
nt|dagold: 1@h may have shown the majors, or perhaps spades|pg||
nt|mrt2000: it is!!!|pg||
nt|mrt2000: @H and @S|pg||
nt|justin c: 2@H = @S and minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: so, seems ok over a strong club|pg||
nt|roswolf: well even trump break is very good in Roland's book|pg||
mb|1N|nt|yo_yo: 3@C  is ghestem   2 highest suits|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1@C = 11-13 BAL or 17+ (any)|pg||
nt|dburn: the two-way nature of the 1@c opening hurt a little - South can't make a negative double with a five count facing what might be a balanced 11|pg||
nt|justin c: East raising now?|pg||
nt|rmb1: how far?|pg||
nt|rmb1: If so, 4@D fit would work|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt is diamonds i guess|pg||
nt|chick: Hello Ralf and Ian :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If W shows his @c and @h E can see and value his @hAQ and @cKQx|pg||
nt|idc: I was chatting to someone who works as an operator on BBO last night|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Cornelia! wlc|pg||
nt|justin c: so 2@S a good @H raise of some sort|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: So EW a natural bidding system. @S=4+ as @H=4+|pg||
nt|mikeirl: dbl now|pg||
nt|dagold: 1@s showed clubs i guess?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitnor: d and s sup i guess|pg||
nt|steveray: open playing board 2|pg||
nt|rmb1: I see the result is in from  2 now.|pg||
nt|rmb1: Is West supposed to pass this?|pg||
nt|steveray: west starts with balanced rubbish and ends having a big decision to make|pg||
nt|mikeirl: miss defence to allow 3@cx to make|pg||
nt|rmb1: Nobody it seems got close to 4@H on  2 |pg||
nt|dburn: well, he hasn't shown anything and he has quite a lot|pg||
nt|ralfwil: rebid 1nt on N?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes!|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 3NT yet again !!|pg||
nt|idc: and she was pointing out how helples they are when a revoke happens, since software doesn't allow them to enter it, heh|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitnor: some inv|pg||
nt|athene: if south can now bid 3@H natural, north may go 3@S to highlight the club weakness|pg||
nt|athene: and then NS have a bit of a problem|pg||
nt|roswolf: 11S SHOWS A CLUB POSITIVE!?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: well done Ian and Willie|pg||
nt|dagold: clubs and diamonds about the same|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1@S|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mrt2000: 2@C asking, I presume|pg||
nt|sybarra: n/s probably have serveral kinds of raises  |pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @S being weaker, than the cue, etc |pg||
nt|hedyg: the other table is even faster|pg||
nt|athene: they won't like 3nt since they have told opps to lead clubs|pg||
nt|idc: Hi Cornelia!|pg||
pc|c3|nt|pitnor: disiplin is ok after that 1 s bid:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Standard lead seems to be?|pg||
nt|mikeirl: surely we're waiting on W|pg||
nt|toobad: another 3nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: but we dont get paid|pg||
nt|hedyg: no, we dont either|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe they get paid by the number of cards they play in lifetime :) |pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|rodal f: @S|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: y|pg||
nt|toobad: not even for undos Geoff?|pg||
nt|hedyg: rofl|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: as Sabine said... i love this game|pg||
nt|rmb1: 3NT? |pg||
nt|athene: but of course 3nt is where you want to be|pg||
nt|athene: south now wants to know how many clubs his partner has|pg||
nt|othered1: interesting decision for south|pg||
nt|toobad: the hand that David got the Jc right in 3nt ,,,,,,,,,,, at other table same defence... Lindsay won 10c and went back to hearts|pg||
nt|justin c: unappealing lead for E here|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|paulg:  4@h is where you want to be|pg||
nt|ralfwil: That´s a point Ian!|pg||
nt|othered1: trump might work out best and he found it|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mrt2000: could be a swing to NI|pg||
nt|athene: if north is 4-3-4-2 then 5@D is better than 3n|pg||
nt|warrens:  3 rounds of trump followed by @d's should do the trick|pg||
pc|h7|nt|pitnor: std carding too|pg||
nt|steveray: looks easy +300|pg||
nt|chick: same happens on a lead out of turn, the operator has to try and compensate|pg||
nt|idc: but I guess allowing it might cause chaos in the software at some point; I can see why it is best to leave it alone|pg||
nt|ralfwil: win with @sA aand play @dK|pg||
pc|hT|nt|insia1: Liliek keringat dingin lagi|pg||
nt|athene: but if north has three clubs of course you want to play 3n (or 4@H)|pg||
nt|idc: I think I'd try 3NT over 3@s - don't think it should promise stop|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|paulg:  and North may bid it now if 3@h promised 4|pg||
pc|c6|nt|hedyg: he loves to lead declarers suits, this time definitely best lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: well he didnt lead clubs this time |pg||
nt|hedyg: no|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: Goodman thinking|pg||
nt|sybarra: not clear to me that declarer can survive this one|pg||
nt|hedyg: with @d finesse on 9 tricks are there|pg||
nt|idc: I think at matchpoints West might have competed further but sensible to pass 2@d at teams|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the overcall may have been, well, a bit light, but combined with the pre-empt, made exploration difficult|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|paulg:  perhaps this sequence normally shows six diamonds|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
pc|c5|nt|steveray: with game doubtful|pg||

pc|c9|pc|s8|pc|cK|pg||
nt|diumraid: ** CAMROSE LIVE RESULTS ** http://bridge.silvertexter.eu  then browse results then 1o3.txt|pg||
nt|paulg:  many would use Stayman and then bid 3@d over 2@s to show diamonds and hearts|pg||
nt|athene: everyone's great grandmother bids stayman with south and then 3nt over 2@S|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Les Bleus :(|pg||
pc|s9|nt|idc: Just as well since the 3rd hand opening bid was on the stinky side|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|pc|s4|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rmb1: Has to knockout @DA before drawing all the trumps|pg||

pc|hK|nt|dagold: that was a high quality low spade shift|pg||
nt|dagold: trying to cash two spades|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|dagold: switching to the king should be bare King|pg||
nt|dagold: and partner should over take with the Ace|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mrt2000: don't think that's right|pg||
pc|d6|nt|rodal f: Enterance problems for the @C|pg||

mb|p|nt|toobad: EW|pg||

nt|ralfwil: another 3nt....|pg||
nt|roswolf: take out double is cool here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 5+@H+4m|pg||
nt|justin c: 7@D is the most fun|pg||
nt|roswolf: this will reach the stratosphere|pg||
nt|othered1: depends on how far EW push it.|pg||
nt|othered1: 7@D by south doubled and down?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|toobad: 2s or 3c|pg||
mb|2D|nt|hedyg: if you want to watch other tables as well: http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
nt|roswolf: 6@C should be reached but...........|pg||
mb|2H|nt|rmb1: On  21, NS made 3NT after a small diamond opening lead to @D10 |pg||
nt|athene: aggressive 3@H makes it very easy for south now|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzxa: akhmad said that 1@s must be 4cd, if he had 5cd @s he would bid 1nt|pg||
nt|steveray: on board 3 Ireland were pushed to 5@H - but it made for 8 imps|pg||
nt|rmb1: Presumably West thinking|pg||
nt|justin c: 800 odd on offer here|pg||
nt|dburn: wondering how short his partner is in diamonds|pg||
nt|sybarra: may play it here,  |pg||
nt|idc: South worth a slam try I feel, but presumably North will decline to cooperate being (sub) minimum|pg||
nt|athene: there is a case for starting hands like that south (game force, balanced) with 2@C rather than 1@S|pg||
nt|athene: depends on your subsequent methods but it can be easier if you set up the game force first|pg||
nt|paulg:  he may not get the chance to decline|pg||
nt|athene: of course you have to be playing 2@C as GF :)|pg||
nt|athene: south must drive to slam after 3@H|pg||
nt|athene: surely?|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@H does prevent south from making that bid|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rmb1: 3@D = 4414|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: or 4441 or similar 5440s|pg||
nt|paulg:  6@h is not a great contract, needing a finesse and 3-2 hearts|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose no heart honour is a bit of a worry|pg||
nt|idc: I wouldn't drive, but I'd make a couple of tries|pg||
nt|dagold: i assume 3@h showed a stop|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt looks favorite now|pg||
nt|dagold: 3N shows the diamond stop I guess|pg||
nt|dagold: since that seems|pg||
nt|dagold: to be what norht is worried about|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: light double by W showing minors|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: sry no hesitation|pg||
mb|p|nt|milton_se: important lead|pg||
nt|mrt2000: this can go off|pg||
nt|sybarra: arriving undoubled .... |pg||
nt|mrt2000: oh dear|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks like EW pushed just enough to keep NS from all but the grossest investigation|pg||
nt|roswolf: there may also be a good red sac in 6@Hx BUT the irish have wimped out|pg||
pc|h4|nt|pitnor: as the card lays 3 n is ok but probably 4s ....-1|pg||
nt|mrt2000: not now ....................|pg||
nt|milton_se: not this way|pg||
nt|ralfwil: will make now!|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@s was the limit|pg||
pc|h9|nt|idc: Hmm, maybe that would be wet of me ... wouldn't blame anyone for just blasting|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 1P peux scandaliser certains spectateurs, et je ne suis guere persuade non plus de son charme...quand les adveaux tinnent les cours (on s'y attends avec la main S), 1SA n;est guere ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: plus obstruteur que 1P|pg||
pc|hT|nt|dburn: and electing to try for slam in spades|pg||
nt|rmb1: 5@H by West op?|pg||
nt|toobad: no defence to these slams|pg||
nt|rmb1: Efficiently bid,  but I bet East thinks the singleton isnt the A and West has more in hearts/clubs|pg||
nt|toobad: indeed....... he'll fret about the H finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: Burns would make a gd croupier|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|rodal f: Surpricing but good decision          this time for NS|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1@C = 3+, 1NT may be limited to 14, 2@D looks artificial and then we are guessing :)|pg||
nt|chick: a good lead that doesn't give anything away, although N was kinda forced into it|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@C will not be a success|pg||
pc|s2|nt|pitnor: y...need to guess dia ...|pg||
nt|mrt2000: one off quickly, I suspect|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no indeed - easy for East to cash out|pg||
nt|roswolf: is east up to cashing out?|pg||
nt|othered1: I think the entire problem lies with their defensive bidding over 2@C.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|yo_yo: 2@D  new minor forcing|pg||
nt|steveray: N/S will reach 3NT and can make it with a good guess|pg||
nt|toobad: too dangerous to double at imps|pg||
nt|toobad: has he a fluffy tail??|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: you might not need the diamond finesse|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|yo_yo: leading from Jxxx isnt popular but what's the alternative?|pg||
nt|rmb1: @D lead requires declarer to drop @CQ|pg||
nt|idc: Not sure the threats work for a squeeze|pg||
nt|paulg:  i will be pleasantly surprised if Short/Walker bid this|pg||
nt|athene: @SA lead (ok unlikely) or perhaps lead a spade to the queen and then duck spades and ruff down west's short ace|pg||
nt|roswolf: a true test of something|pg||
nt|justin c: safety play @D here (@DK and low to @D9)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mikeirl: I favour defense on D lead|pg||
nt|steveray: looks 50/50 to me|pg||
nt|athene: or lead the @S6 from hand and east flies in with his ace, scared you have a singleton|pg||
nt|idc: Ahh, missed the @sA dropping|pg||
nt|athene: so many luscious possibilities :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|steveray: clear the @Hs|pg||
nt|hedyg: cannot double|pg||
nt|chick: declarer can easily find his 9th trick in hearts|pg||
pc|h6|nt|rmb1: On  22 East did not open but stil played in 2@S -1|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|sT|nt|steveray: then cash an AK befor finessing in the other black suit|pg||
nt|milton_se: reasonable choice though, since North i more likely to have QS|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rodal f: Hard to find, but @HJ is best def|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|pg||
nt|chilloncan: SORRY je voulais dire "1SA peut scandaliser..."|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mdgraham: particularly if on the @dK West can deny six |pg||
nt|dagold: if 3! showed a stop, south should bid 3N|pg||
nt|roswolf: well done the test is passed|pg||
pc|c6|nt|rodal f: Did. WD|pg||
pc|cA|nt|justin c: perhaps East's pass over 5@D was encouraging West to bid on here|pg||
nt|idc: Gives defenders a chance to signal for @d but no big deal I guess|pg||
nt|dagold: 3@h|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|idc: May have been right to play a @s immediately though, entries a bit sticky to dummy|pg||
nt|athene: he's a bit short of entries to try the spade to the queen line, so i think @S6 from hand is coming|pg||
nt|dagold: if it asked it was the wrong bid|pg||
nt|dagold: so something to discuss for NS|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: but you are better to try that really early, before east knows the trumps are solid|pg||
nt|athene: he is more likely to go in with his ace if there is the possibility his partner has a trump trick|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|c7|pg||
nt|rodal f: Still. Non vul u don'nt earn as much as u do at vul.    As long as 3@S seemed invitational|pg||
nt|rmb1: On  4 it looks as if NS found their @S stop for 3NT and still lost the first five @Hs|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|steveray: the club finesse looks to be wrong now|pg||
nt|rmb1: Black suit squeeze for +1 :) If you don't get deflected into putting in @CJ|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c3|pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: well, he can still make on a black suit squeeze on east, unless west returns a club now|pg||
nt|idc: Good in fact: gets us on to next hand more quickly :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|idc: This line isn't unreasonable: some small squeeze chances with @d finesse in reserve but fails as cards lie|pg||
nt|athene: @SK, spade ruff to isolate the threat, cash the @DAK, run the trumps|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|mc|9|nt|athene: ok, now dead|pg||
nt|warrens:  if North's 3@S showed spade values and denied @H values, South could have jumped to 6@C|pg||

nt|mrt2000: that could be expensive|pg||

nt|chick: in fact, I don't see any reason not to take the heart finesse for an overtrick|pg||
nt|chilloncan: et "tiennent les coeurs".  j'ai un clavier peu gerable|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  as a spec suggested, quite a lot more play than I suggested|pg||
nt|roswolf: another positional slam this time for n/s|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzxa: @h last board here, ty for all viewers, hope u all enjoyed @h|pg||
nt|mrt2000: although S will get very busy in @S|pg||
nt|milton_se: and an excellent 6S save|pg||
mb|1D|nt|paulg:  but a likely gain for Scotland|pg||
nt|idc: The Welsh lead up to a healthy 11 IMPs now but may well drop after the last two boards we have seen here|pg||
nt|athene: north has about a 2nt bid now but many play that as a spade raise|pg||
nt|paulg:  Daffyd Jones is getting quite an early morning workout with all these hands to bid in the South seat|pg||
nt|paulg:  though leaving his Dad to play the really difficult ones must help|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: Last board at the segment. TKX Paul:) Might joy the next one?|pg||

nt|rodal f: TKX also to spec for inputs and TKX to the exelant vug operator:)|pg||
nt|pfbr: eh?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: tis the truth|pg||
nt|rmb1: NS play 4 card majors but open minor before major, so missed their @H fit|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: well, this is going to be less difficult to play|pg||
nt|paulg:  I'm told board 6 will probably be flat and not 3 imps to Wales|pg||

nt|athene: will east start with the @DA? or queen?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 3NT likely here|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: But if E opened 1@H   S would pass and W bid 2@H for pass around I belive|pg||
mb|2S|nt|justin c: 2@h a good 3 card raise|pg||

mb|p|nt|pitnor: if u get a dia lead u might guess right in 7 s :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: cu all tomorrow or later today |pg||
nt|rmb1: Ah well. they have found it in the play.  No enough if declarer picks up the stiff minor kings|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 6@D|pg||
nt|athos: cela va dependre de la convention mais il est possible que 1SA dénie 3@s |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: bd 23 they made 4 sp in the other room |pg||
nt|justin c: irish dec played @H to the @H10, but then misguessed on @H return|pg||
nt|othered1: This will be a lucky make.|pg||
nt|warrens:  couldn't guess right on the @H return|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitnor: else u play for squezze|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Semble tout normal, les encheres, qÂ´on fais - sont part de nÃ´tre systeme...|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mrt2000: this is bizarre!!|pg||
nt|roswolf: or even 6nt|pg||
pc|c2|nt|milton_se: do they play 5-cards Ms?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: might have checked for a 5-3 spade fit, but 3NT should have enough high cards |pg||
nt|chilloncan: je sais que le system francais est peu tolerant des telles infidelites, mais a mon avis l'ouverture pragmatique avec la main de Ouest est 1C|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jaapfr: how to find the rocksolid 5@C and not the impossible 3nt?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Just need the doubble hook in @S for 9|pg||

nt|mrt2000: missed the target though !!   lol|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kuter: 2@d seems check back 3 suits @s.|pg||
nt|athene: he can't conveniently come to hand to finesse the @C9, even if he wanted to|pg||
nt|idc: N-S CC says overcalls agressive at 1-level, so perhaps 3NT was ... a tad optimistic|pg||
nt|justin c: sry, u right, nothing he could do after playing to @H10|pg||
pc|d6|pg||

nt|rmb1: Could not afford @H finesse to be wrong|pg||
nt|egezzer: Camrose Live Results : http://bridge.silvertexter.eu  |pg||
nt|paulg:  many of them also play in the BBO InterCity League|pg||
nt|roswolf: this seems fairly quiet|pg||
mb|1C|nt|toobad: 4H looks handy|pg||
nt|rmb1: If West opens 1NT he might play there|pg||
mb|d|nt|justin c: had 10 there|pg||
nt|athene: how many diamonds now?|pg||
nt|athene: 3, 4 or 5?|pg||
nt|paulg:  3@d|pg||
nt|athene: 5 looks too many; 3 looks a bit wet|pg||
nt|idc: South's reward for disciplined pass is not going to please him I suspect - 3@d or even more?|pg||
nt|athene: 4 is the goldilocks bid|pg||
mb|1D|nt|steveray: the 1NT opening will get them to @Hs|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks a straightforward game for n/s|pg||
mb|p|nt|steveray: with poor results|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that bid will annoy Carroll :)|pg||
nt|athene: yes south should obviously have opened 2@S to keep his partner from getting ideas|pg||
nt|chick: XX by N to show values|pg||
nt|idc: After North redbls, be interesting to see East's action|pg||
nt|idc: pass looks right: let partner choose for now since you have the higher suits|pg||
nt|mrt2000: do wish players wouldn't make those sort of takeout X's|pg||
nt|justin c: (S bidding 2@S)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rmb1: EW got there (@Hs) first :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: E might have bid 4@d with a singleton or void|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: Goodman pondering|pg||
nt|paulg:  why bid 4@d when three wins the pot|pg||
nt|chick: modern style is to pass with the E hand, but I really hate that ... I think W has already said he doesn't know what suit to bid, so E should ALWAYS tell him when possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: forcing NT, I believe|pg||
nt|athene: when you have a hand like that south, it's pretty rare that you will make more tricks in hearts than in spades, even if partner has a heart fit|pg||
nt|idc: I expect Dbl from East would have been takeout - Matheson a little fixed with his actual hand|pg||
nt|idc: N-S playing strong @c, so 1@s more understandable since limited to 16 - I expect some other will preempt|pg||
nt|dagold: your opps or partner's? normal for me|pg||
nt|othered1: is that multi or just a strong balanced hand?|pg||
nt|athos: encore Texas|pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: west can reopen with a good hand and doubleton diamond|pg||
nt|paulg:  true Bill, but partner would not expect such playing strength from a weak two|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'd rather open 1@s than 2@s|pg||
nt|justin c: multi|pg||
nt|roswolf: much better|pg||
mb|p|nt|steveray: is this double penalty?|pg||
nt|steveray: does South know?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i think so, after South has described his hand|pg||
nt|mrt2000: sorry, seems it showed @D|pg||
nt|dagold: but I would respond 1N as south|pg||
nt|roswolf: agree but they do |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: agree with 1nt too|pg||
nt|dagold: 13 points out side spades and 4@h. could be making 4@h. I love opps who pass 1@s with that|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: corrected on movie|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rodal f: Power at E? Why not use 2NT at the road?|pg||
nt|chick: I'm afraid I would always open S hand 1@S, 29 zarpoints, only need 26 to open|pg||
nt|idc: Note the 3@s bid made immediately: normal is to jump with great shape (sub)minimums and pass then jump with full value openings|pg||
nt|chilloncan: un dossier minable de donnes dans ce segment....on ne s'aventure qu'assez rarement au dela du palier de 2:(|pg||

nt|dburn: 11 IMPs to Ireland when Erichsen and Selway tried a slam that was not likely to make given the bidding|pg||
nt|ralfwil: trumph lead from S?|pg||
nt|toobad: the c position saves this, i think|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|pg||
nt|dburn: and sure enough, the bloke who bid a lot of spades had the king of them, so the finesse lost|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 11 tricks now|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sybarra: is this the way you would start this play?  |pg||
nt|toobad: no, but has he caught a fish?|pg||

nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
pc|s4|nt|milton_se: this won't be easy|pg||
nt|mrt2000: if 4@H is making, S is going to have a bid|pg||
pc|s5|nt|yo_yo: maybe Erichsen didnt see the first X|pg||
nt|athene: when you have to launch KJ109xxx(x) from hand, you normally lead the king, because the only chance to escape for one loser is to snare a singleton queen, but here even that would ...|pg||
nt|athene: not help north, as he would still lose two trumps to the A87xx|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|rmb1: West able to double 3@H and 4@H for penalties |pg||
nt|rmb1: and he wasn't on opening lead to lead one :)|pg||

nt|rmb1: How about 4NT to play|pg||
nt|justin c: what could possibly go wrong :)|pg||
nt|mrt2000: it'll make though, I think|pg||

pc|d3|nt|steveray: why did south not discard clubs on the diamonds|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i was just wondering that |pg||
nt|rmb1: In OR on  6, 4@C-1.  So 4@H-4 NV was not too costly|pg||

nt|dagold: he has hit well|pg||
nt|mrt2000: I think  :)|pg||
nt|dagold: but the club preemption may help EW|pg||
nt|roswolf: there is a danger that they bid the grand|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 4@C enough from Willie?|pg||

nt|mrt2000: the grand is cold, surely?|pg||

nt|sybarra: and 3 nt on a non spade lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: how does W know about the ht suit |pg||
nt|paulg:  especially with 3 small trumps, I've noticed this weekend|pg||
nt|idc: Well, the grandmas did use an artificial gameforcing relay but after 4 rounds of bidding they forgot how they'd started and just plumped for 3NT|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rmb1: North will have another go|pg||
nt|athene: hahahaha|pg||
nt|dagold: now west has enourmous cards|pg||
nt|dagold: wow|pg||
nt|mrt2000: let EW pick the bones out of this now!|pg||
nt|dagold: was he worried about his spade King?|pg||
nt|dagold: East must have the something in spades though|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe 5@C was not necessarily extreme shortage|pg||
pc|c8|nt|rmb1: 1H = nat 8+, may have m suit canape (as here)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: only 2@s from E???|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: y|pg||
nt|milton_se: anyone more than me who would open 4S?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: did well to stop|pg||
nt|idc: It's a good system|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|dburn: active lead better than passive one on this occasion|pg||
nt|dburn: not only has that blown the club suit, it's scrambled communications to cash the diamonds|pg||
nt|milton_se: 4S making|pg||
nt|idc: I guess 2@c was a transfer and 2@s patterning out perhaps|pg||
nt|dagold: and west would be declarer|pg||
nt|roswolf: east going for gold|pg||
nt|dagold: well it must be a singleton at least I would think|pg||
nt|justin c: might have bid more here|pg||
pc|cK|nt|toobad: 3h is nat i presume|pg||
nt|sybarra: simple rebid works|pg||
nt|rmb1: Norths Pass after X and 4@C is forcing|pg||
nt|dagold: so weset very big here|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 5NT = what?|pg||

nt|ralfwil: Yes bertil, but also at least 3@s from E|pg||
nt|toobad: thank god for Robin|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mikeirl: easy 10 tricks here|pg||

nt|pfbr: yes negative 0-4|pg||
nt|toobad: exactly|pg||
nt|rmb1: Am I frozen?|pg||
nt|chick: are they playing transfer advances?  maybe 1N was the transfer|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: 1NT wasn't alerted|pg||
nt|idc: 1NT semi-forcing|pg||
nt|mrt2000: guessed wrong!!|pg||
nt|justin c: 4@H not too bad|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|steveray: not a great lead|pg||
nt|toobad: less than 2 controls, i thought|pg||
nt|idc: I wonder what the difference between the actual sequence and East bidding 3@c a round earlier is?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: hope they bid the grand in the other room|pg||
nt|mrt2000: NI need all the help they can get|pg||
nt|roswolf: wimping out i think - 5nt was clearly showing interest in the grand and west had golden cars in the AKQ|pg||
pc|s5|nt|justin c: tho off on actual layout|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|rmb1: South did not think @DK was enough for 5 level (or higher)|pg||
nt|toobad: would you blame him|pg||
nt|rmb1: no|pg||
pc|hK|nt|idc: It would be nice to have a way to stop in 3@c - like this hand for example|pg||
pc|h5|nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
pc|h2|nt|dburn: still, declarer cunningly attacking diamonds himself|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|sK|nt|paulg:  you don't really mind going down in this sort of contract, as you know it will be flat|pg||
nt|athene: yes, unless your teammate in the north seat decides not to lead a club |pg||
nt|dagold: reaching the grand is ultra tough. I do feel that west hasnt really bid his cards though. surely a small slam over 5@c was in order|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rmb1: @D was surprising |pg||
pc|s8|pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: then declarer can find the trump break and take the diamond finesse for a club pitch|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|dburn: to stop the opponents from doing so if he loses, say, a spade finesse|pg||
nt|paulg:  it's when you've done well to bid a thin slam and the bad trump break kills it|pg||
nt|idc: At least it is easy to play now: shut your eyes and pray for @cJT doubelton |pg||
pc|hT|nt|hawe45:  Plus vite comme ceal|pg||

nt|vugraphzxy: bbo|pg||
nt|rmb1: we are here (now)|pg||
nt|toobad: ty Geoff|pg||
nt|rmb1: If North plays spade and West plays diamonds the defence will get 7 tricks for -1|pg||
nt|idc: Common is to play 3@h here as a value raise and immediate raises as more preemptive|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might end in tears if e/w are too aggressive|pg||
nt|othered1: 1@S looks normal and tends to imply a true @C suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1@S looks bold|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: and 27 is very good for Ireland also|pg||
nt|justin c: West has a good hand here, but nothing obvious to do|pg||
nt|othered1: if you're goiong to act to begin with . . .|pg||
mb|p|nt|steveray: hmm, difficult to deal with when they should be in spades|pg||
nt|milton_se: why not pass?|pg||
nt|hedyg: the double by N looks like a Zia double except surely has a special meaning here|pg||
pc|cT|nt|hedyg: maybe they play reversed doubles, i.e. X= i have NO @S honour and pass= i have 1|pg||
nt|toobad: dont lead spades|pg||
nt|athene: if north had chosen 1@D then south would probably have rebid 1nt|pg||
nt|athene: 1@D - 1@H; 1@S - 1NT|pg||
nt|idc: Short rebid 2@h only on Bd 9 so they finished in 4@h rather than slam as here - so more IMPs to come for Scots|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess double just shows extras, ij the modern style, or perhaps some kind of support, as east rebid a mediocre 5-bagger|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: i suppose you set off on diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: hoping, some day, to ruff one in dummy|pg||
nt|idc: But Welsh have potential gain later on so still too close to call|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's the end of dummy |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|othered1: I wonder if west is allowing for east's hand?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|paulg:  over the past few years, Scotland has beaten Wales but finished below them in the Camrose|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rodal f: And the lead gave 140. Next|pg||
nt|roswolf: what is this !?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1NT = 6-12 (semi-forcing).  2@C rebid would be INV+ with spades or GF.  Difficult to get to @S part score|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they did well keeping low, easy to get excited with 6/5 distribution|pg||
nt|steveray: yes, have to open one, then pass the raise - unlikely, better off where they are|pg||
nt|yo_yo: does Garvey know he won the trick?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: your lead partner!|pg||
nt|steveray: guess he'd rather not have, Selway didn't want to win, as he didn't know what to do next either:)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: correct decision to pass  if ew takes their 4 tricks|pg||
pc|cK|nt|justin c: this, geoffrey, is a minus score|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hedyg: duck?|pg||
nt|toobad: has to|pg||
nt|ralfwil: ????|pg||

nt|vugraphzxy: @h was continued|pg||
pc|c8|nt|hedyg: wd|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|hedyg: so this will drift 1 off|pg||
nt|hedyg: same on a @s lead|pg||
nt|othered1: Anyone understand north's double?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mrt2000: NS lost their way now !|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|justin c: i understand souths|pg||
nt|roswolf: a big minus - the vampires start to gather|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
pc|hT|nt|toobad: will play c first |pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: of course declarer wants to lose diamonds to east|pg||
nt|athene: as trump leads from east are more welcome|pg||
nt|athene: but he can't lose them both to east|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rodal f: Lost the @S ruff|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|hedyg: cashing out|pg||
pc|c9|nt|justin c: 3NT always makeable on this, but not the greatest contract|pg||
pc|c4|pc|d5|pc|s4|pg||
pc|c6|nt|toobad: exactly|pg||
nt|athene: maybe it was right to ruff a heart early - then you elope with both small clubs in hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: south will be disappointed at that|pg||
nt|justin c: playing for N to hold @SQ for the double|pg||
pc|c5|pc|sT|nt|idc: My last partner had me persuaded that 4-4-4-1 shapes are for defending|pg||
nt|athene: of course if you do that you give up any chance of making anything of the spades|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|idc: he preferred passing anything fewer than 14 hcp or so|pg||
nt|paulg:  pass them all then Ian?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s5|pc|d6|nt|dburn: and indeed board 27 was worth ten more to Ireland|pg||
nt|justin c: @C break, and @DQ right, and need to play W for the @SQ|pg||
nt|dburn: so we might have been doing a lot of running in order to stay still|pg||
nt|mikeirl: that discard can't be right?|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 4441 is often good for defending - the trick is persuading your opponents to bid|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|pc|s3|pc|sA|pg||
mc|7|nt|athene: i know a lot of people will pass specifically 1-4-4-4 (singleton spade) with anything under a lot of hcp|pg||

mb|p|nt|rmb1: not very flat, not necessarily brilliant|pg||
nt|mrt2000: YES !!!|pg||
nt|pfbr: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: fished swiftly out it was|pg||
nt|othered1: double here would have been very dangerous|pg||
nt|othered1: I wouldn't like to defend 3@SXX|pg||
mb|4N|nt|idc: perhaps @h9 then @h5 might have been better suit preference for clubs but not trivial to suggest that suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzxy: Will fix 13 later|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok ty|pg||
nt|idc: For preference I'd mini-splinter the East hand with 3@c, but 3@h otherwise|pg||
nt|paulg:  Matheson a big fan, trying to persuade Sime ... not on their card but I know they've been practising it over major openings|pg||
nt|dburn: but never mind - you guys could get a job in the publishing industry writing blurbs|pg||
nt|justin c: dont know what all this means, but probably playing 3NT|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 3H = chelemotrope, car la sequence est FdeM|pg||
mb|6H|nt|athene: declarer doesn't know both red suits are breaking|pg||
nt|roswolf: david you of all people should be rooting for the vampires|pg||
nt|mrt2000: does it pay well?|pg||
nt|roswolf: ;0|pg||
nt|mdgraham: depends how many bodices are ripped, I believe|pg||
nt|dburn: might have been more if the defence had attacked hearts, mind|pg||
mb|p|nt|toobad: okedoke|pg||
nt|idc: 10 then 9 suggests diamonds, 10 then 5 neutral, maybe that will be East's explanation|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: @H better from W?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Make them play NT as good as u can|pg||
nt|rodal f: Now @D is to late|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: @H?     Sorry ment @D|pg||
nt|athene: so he is thinking about 4-2 diamonds and 4-1 trumps|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Entame: 2 de @C...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  et en toute vitesse...|pg||
nt|athos: 6@h ? pas content de son enchere de 4@h ?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|chilloncan: dans le contexte d'avoir deja dit 4C (signoff), E a un super-maximum|pg||
pc|d8|nt|roswolf: especially made of irish linen|pg||
nt|roswolf: careful cover by declarer|pg||
nt|justin c: has an inkling on the auction :)|pg||

pc|dK|nt|milton_se: you don't seem very neutral, Paul :)|pg||

nt|diumraid: *** Live Overall Scores - CAMROSE *** http://bridge.silvertexter.eu  then "browse results" then 1o3.txt  *****|pg||
nt|athene: north knows the diamonds are running so just playing trumps to stop the club ruffs isn't going to work|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|nt|steveray: lead has helped declarer, why not stiff @s?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pg||
nt|hedyg: there goes the other @s loser|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this is -2|pg||

nt|dburn: it is - strange-looking play by declarer|pg||
pc|h2|nt|idc: Ireland & England beginning to pull away from opponents in the other 2 matches|pg||
nt|idc: now lying 1st & 2nd, so normal service resumed : http://bridge.silvertexter.eu/results/1O3.TXT|pg||
nt|chick: or maybe E just didn't think hard about what the signal might mean|pg||
pc|d6|nt|steveray: no guarantee of a trick with Qxx trumps|pg||
nt|athene: but basically nothing is going to work :)|pg||

pc|hT|nt|dagold: on board 12|pg||
nt|mrt2000: think so David?   lol|pg||
nt|dagold: NS didn't bid clubs at either table|pg||

nt|hedyg: there was no way to avoid that though|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|pc|s3|pc|sK|pg||

pc|c3|pg||
nt|rodal f: But still 100EW for=|pg||

nt|mrt2000: difficult to be dispassionate when commentating on two very good friends!   :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Geoff :)|pg||
nt|idc: Now we have reached the last 2 bds of the set, that the Open room played earlier|pg||
nt|mrt2000: remain impartial please geoff  :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: i am on the vampires side|pg||
nt|dburn: but this is a decent Irish result|pg||
nt|othered1: that was inattentive by east, as he had a full count on the hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikeirl: 3nt makesas  H 4-4|pg||
nt|athene: south lightner doubled and got his spade ruff but didn't then underlead for a second ruff|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looking at the scorecard, EW have some solid-looking scores in their column |pg||
nt|roswolf: yes probably fatigue|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Well payed at OR. I see 8 as the minimum|pg||
nt|idc: Now that we have reached last 2 boards, we see the scores from other room who played them earlier|pg||
nt|roswolf: true but let us wait and see|pg||
nt|othered1: But it is late and their session hasn't exactly been inspiring|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Meilleure manche: 3 SA|pg||
mb|1H|nt|idc: Note that against 4@h dbld, Short led @s3 for Walker to ruff, but then Walker cashed @cA when he needed to underlead @c honours|pg||
mb|3D|nt|jaapfr: imo b15 and 16 well for Timah A so pk Liliek not to win this|pg||
nt|rmb1: Ireland retake the lead by bidding and making 3NT+1 on  29|pg||
nt|dburn: North deciding that he has a three-card limit raise in hearts rather than a spade suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: last 2 hands here for this set |pg||
mb|d|nt|mdgraham: double for the red suits? |pg||
nt|roswolf: when will n/s enter the auction?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 2NT maybe|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps never|pg||
nt|mrt2000: likely never now|pg||
nt|roswolf: west may pass!?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: or raise @S|pg||
nt|dburn: he is allowed to pass systemically, yes|pg||
mb|r|nt|rmb1: Another guess the outcome?|pg||
nt|idc: Not like Outreds to miss a 22 count 3NT but well judged this time :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: do you all open on S? not for me in vul|pg||
nt|chick: never|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|rodal f: A @H lead give 9|pg||
nt|idc: I used to playing 14-16 NT, since these sequences showed 11-13, but having them show 11-14 is too much, so would pass playing 15-17|pg||
nt|othered1: Actually it has, but it's not likely they see a need for every imp that's not nailed down.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|chick: 24 zarpoints, need 26 to open|pg||
nt|roswolf: spades were never bid in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: 1@S walsh style, does not deny longer @D with < GF.  |pg||
nt|athene: he can put the @C9 on this perhaps to get one ruff |pg||
nt|justin c: would have thought such a scientific pair could show minors over 1NT here|pg||
mb|p|nt|toobad: screaming for a h lead here|pg||
nt|hedyg: what good was bidding 2@D if you are going to bid 3NT no matter what?|pg||
nt|idc: the dbl was good in that it helped North to get off to right lead, but bad when contract made anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|steveray: why on earth 1@s?|pg||
nt|sybarra: thanks to our terrific operator,    great job! |pg||
nt|ralfwil: bad 11 points ....|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|rmb1: That lead should ensure +2|pg||
nt|toobad: thats my boy!!|pg||
nt|hedyg: small= encouraging|pg||
nt|athene: depends on their agreements|pg||
pc|c2|nt|steveray: oh yuk|pg||
nt|chick: and N is getting carried away because he thinks his partner has something|pg||
nt|idc: Trying to think of how I'd play dbl here - think I'd like a little more defence to clubs|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @d lead is needed here|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 1 off|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Maybe 2|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good lead|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hedyg: no?|pg||
nt|justin c: this looks like East just transferred to @C, and hoped that was the right thing to do|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|steveray: might as well bid 3NT now:)|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2NT relay (?)|pg||
nt|mikeirl: yes|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: and thx to my fellow commentators. |pg||
nt|toobad: has just got worse for Ni|pg||
nt|mrt2000: yes indeed|pg||
nt|dburn: well, the defenders can take the first five|pg||
nt|mrt2000: for a flat board|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@c  here is either 10-15, 6+@C or 5-9, 4+@C, 5M; 2@S is NF opposite the 5-9 type|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Nahh|pg||
nt|Walddk5: a gain for NI for sure|pg||
pc|h3|nt|steveray: sad when you can't bid a lovely 6 bagger like that|pg||
nt|idc: a pretty close dbl - looks like a trump switch needed now|pg||
nt|mrt2000: sorry, yes|pg||
nt|Walddk5: PLus in both rooms|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|pg||
nt|yo_yo: should just make this, lose 2@H and 2@S|pg||

pc|h2|pc|d2|nt|toobad: thx all|pg||
nt|toobad: tell me that is an undo Geoff|pg||
nt|roswolf: for a change|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|vugraphzxy: no|pg||
nt|idc: Interesting choice of @s3 lead rather than @s2 in other room|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|idc: declarer will make 4 trumps, 2 @s and I guess only 1 red winner (not enough time to develop 2)|pg||
nt|mrt2000: geoff ..................................|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|nt|idc: With a @d in the bag, East now has time to set about hearts|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ralfwil: but may not lose 2@c tricks|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|yo_yo: silly to bid  3NT and watch them cash 5@H tricks |pg||
pc|hK|nt|sybarra: we will be back in 7:10 am Los Angeles, 10:10 am New York, 16.10 Paris, 3:10 pm London|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: N+E didnt see spade bid|pg||
pc|d5|nt|diumraid: For Live Overall Scores - http://bridge.silvertexter.eu then "browse" results then 1o3.txt|pg||
nt|hedyg: CC says reverse attitude|pg||
pc|s3|nt|idc: perhaps neutral as to suit preference for a return>?|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|steveray: Not uggesting they should bid 3NT, 3@d is the contract|pg||
nt|rmb1: "silly" is relative,  Some would say declarer Axxx/xxx instead of KQJxxx/Ax was silly |pg||
nt|sybarra: or just about 1 hours |pg||
nt|paulg:  perhaps @s2 should be led when you have a ace or king of clubs|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d8|nt|egezzer: thx Shirley|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|paulg:  or singleton|pg||
pc|sT|nt|idc: agree|pg||
nt|paulg:  i can imagine taking a lot of time to decide what to do, and still not knowing what is best|pg||
nt|athene: he is just trying to work out if there is any way he can make with the @DK wrong|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think there is, though|pg||
nt|athene: he can't quite manage to throw one diamond on the @SK and crossruff enough tricks|pg||
nt|idc: While there's a lull in the action: the second half of the current round of matches continues in 40 mins: 12:20 local time|pg||
nt|athene: maybe it's interesting - suppose you go club ruff, @SK throwing diamond, spade ruff, diamond towards dummy|pg||
nt|athene: now if north has the @DK he can rise and play his trump but then the @DQ is good|pg||
nt|paulg:  he will eventually just lead the diamond|pg||
nt|athene: no, it still just needs the diamond right|pg||
nt|athene: because if south could win the @DK he would just play a club forcing dummy and promoting a trick for the @HJ|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|idc: needs to guess hearts now|pg||

nt|justin c: (like old precision 2@D)|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: A new X?|pg||
nt|hedyg: obviously a misunderstanding|pg||

nt|Walddk5: Oh, I did not foresee 3@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: well north has offerred his head|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I think there is a safety play in the spade suit - run the 10|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|hedyg: last board of this match now|pg||
nt|hedyg: thanks Geoff, great job :)|pg||
nt|athene: you build a trick for the @SJ to throw a club from dummy, maybe|pg||
nt|idc: I wondered if West might come under pressure but on some lines they have @cQ exit to recover with|pg||
pc|s7|nt|steveray: but this is not penalty - or is it?|pg||
nt|justin c: kibs predicting 5@C|pg||

nt|toobad: ditto|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|mikeirl: A more effective|pg||
nt|justin c: correctly :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  yes, although West comes under pressure on the trumps anyhow|pg||
nt|idc: And another hassle for declarer is what to pitch from dummy now|pg||
nt|chick: a @D|pg||
nt|idc: That's all there is but means you cannot finish @d ending in dummy|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no! I vote for a @s|pg||
nt|chick: keep the black suit options open and decide later what to pitch on the long diamond|pg||
nt|idc: but really I'm probably kidding myself if I think it has much play anyway|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 2 off, I hope|pg||
nt|Walddk5: If you want to get in with that North hand, get in right away|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: yes, west has to guard all three side-suits, so he is in for a rough time|pg||
nt|athene: it's easy for declarer to place the high cards here :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  sime/matheson more forward in the bidding than their team mates, who would pass the West hand|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rmb1: He might make this one.  We may even get to see the play|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: lol|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
nt|rodal f: I understand N. At OR S was in with 3@H over 2@S|pg||
nt|golfsquash: going down|pg||
nt|rmb1: Just ruff 3 @D in dummy|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|nt|roswolf: it looks like the english team has won the first half of this event - the second half is played in Wales on the first weekend in March|pg||
pc|h7|nt|toobad: our thanks to all the specs for your comments|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|rmb1: Not enough entries now|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: you are more inclined to pass the west hand at this vulnerability if playing a weak notrump i suppose|pg||
nt|chick: this is kinda useless given that he has no spade to lead toward the 10, but I guess so is everything else :)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|toobad: should be a swing to the good guys |pg||
pc|h6|pc|s4|pg||
nt|rmb1: On  11 West bid @H before North could, so NS stayed out of trouble and defended 3D-2 +9 to Ireland|pg||

mc|8|nt|chilloncan: c'est peut-etre vrai en france, je ne sais pas, mais dans plusieurs pays "inevrsee" est devenue normale |pg||
nt|athos: je pense à un match de meckwell sur des selections ou la bermuda. preference inversée c'est si commun que ça aux usa ?§ |pg||
nt|chilloncan: if you are tired enough, you just dont notice the small cards, and it may not matter which way the opponents are playing  their defensive signals|pg||
nt|athos: if they play the same signals than you are it s easier|pg||
nt|athos: on m indique qu à la donne 14, le contrat a ete ramené à 4+2 dans l autre salle|pg||
nt|chilloncan: ok mais ce que je dis c'est que il y a une difference entre malinterpeter les cartes vues, et meme pas enregistrer les cartes jouees|pg||
