nt|vugraphzys: hello all-monitor|pg||
nt|henryb:  The question on this hand is the 1NT range for N-S. If N opens 1N she will probably play in 1N or 2N|pg||
nt|nicksan: Not too sure about E/W i'm afraid, but N/S are a pair on the Chinese ladies team I believe|pg||
nt|henryb:  Eat is a famous Japanese commonily known as Ace-King-Ten|pg||
nt|henryb:  East|pg||
nt|nicksan: Terence Reese would turn in his grave at the though of opening the North hand...|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|henryb:  no, but Roth would|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|henryb:  South opposite 11-13 properly passes her 11: with 14-16 North would have opened 1N|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h3|nt|henryb:  that is quite a balance by Okuno|pg||

nt|sybarra: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest.html  website for the event  |pg||
nt|dburn: in that case 3NT down one will pick up a few IMPs - whether deservedly so is left as an exercise for the reader|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: EW play Big Club with 1N=14-16|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: I think it was 11 tricks|pg||
nt|petergill: Scoring is IMPs, so overtricks are not vital|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|sybarra: East name is Kurokawa,   we can not fit everything on screen |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|lestergold: par here is of course 5@sx for 300 to N/S|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mdgraham: two clubs to take - can NS find the diamond ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: now that 5@c is not an option|pg||
nt|lestergold: very good score for e/w therefore|pg||
nt|chessmaste: It is 100% not IMPs - every trick is vital|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: oh -- this isn't Sun Ming's partner from recent world championships??|pg||
pc|h6|nt|dburn: not a good hand for the "take out partner's takeout doubles" school, I guess|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hT|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|petergill: Sorry, my mistake|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry 6@s can go 3 off still a save against 5@h|pg||
pc|c8|nt|lestergold: 5@s i meant |pg||
nt|mdgraham: no need for the diamond ruff, in fact - South has two natural diamond tricks|pg||
nt|dburn: this won't make, and neither would 3@d doubled have done|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|pg||
nt|dburn: still, while I don't have as much sympathy for South's decision as Kaplan would have done, I still have quite a lot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the EW pair in the other room bid 1N-3@D//3N   that really won't make|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: 2 diamond ruffs are availble|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: presumably Senior could have made immediate takeout noise [via 3@D?] so suspect delayed DBL is flawed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure that helps find PASS|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe, but he might have wanted to wait and see whether West was going to pass 3@d before acting over it - an immediate 3@d for takeout was not without risk|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sA|pc|sQ|pc|s6|pg||
pc|d6|nt|petergill: Who thinks that North should or might bid 3@H over 2@S?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a good partner would have balanced with 3@H - so he could go down instead of partner|pg||
pc|d2|nt|panja: hi all|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c5|pc|cT|pc|c4|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Prakash|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|panja: Hi Mike|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lestergold: i thionk a 7 card suit needs to be shown |pg||
nt|mdgraham: with Jxx of clubs in support of partner it's not unreasonable |pg||
nt|lestergold: well 4s-1 will be worth plenty of mps|pg||
nt|lestergold: exactly|pg||
nt|panja: how about a dbl of 3@S from South?|pg||
nt|lestergold: risky with only doubleton @h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: +50 worth 12/66 for NS|pg||
nt|petergill: A bit risky, with only Kx in the unbid major|pg||
nt|othered1: I'd be afraid of 4@H by partner on a less auspicious suit if I doubled|pg||
nt|chessmaste: I don't want to quibble but  they did need the diamond ruff to beat 4@S|pg||
nt|petergill: If not 3@H by N over 2@S, then 3@C by North - must support with trump support|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Win the trump switch, take a second round, heart to the ace, ruff a heart, play  a diamond|pg||
nt|panja: right.. so the question is, how risky is 3@H by North?|pg||
nt|lestergold: then at l;east South could double 4@s it being mps|pg||
nt|chessmaste: If South wins he is endplayed. If he ducks you play a heart and pitch a diamond to endplay North. |pg||
nt|lestergold: the question is how risky is it not to bid 3@h |pg||
nt|panja: when EW haven't found a fit....3@H is quite risky, mitigated by a fallback to 4@C though|pg||
nt|petergill: Mark's point - that 4@s was cold after Trick 3 - is excellent|pg||
nt|othered1: At matchpoints, sometimes my partners overcall with fewer playing tricks than south holds.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and you won't always be able to cash two clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: but he has overcalled vulnerable and you have support for his suit and 5 playing tricks in ur own suit|pg||
nt|chessmaste: South knew North held three clubs and did not play the jack on the second round - a small inference perhaps that he had no interest in hearts  |pg||
nt|petergill: The sequence of play recommended by Mark (chessmaster) is logical and leads to 10 tricks in 4@S |pg||

nt|nicksan: The Cinese ladies are well known for bidding the spots off most hands. It makes them very difficult to play against.|pg||

nt|panja: it is not so great|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 4@Sx-2 was a very common result  |pg||
nt|lestergold: e/wcurrently lying 15th|pg||
nt|sybarra: acording to NEC schedule and team list , East is WANG HONG   Sun Ming reg part |pg||
mb|3H|nt|chessmaste: An old chestnut here - Transfer or Stayman|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|petergill: Previous hand: When South discards on the 3rd round of @h's, North is known to have 7 hearts, 3 clubs and thus only one diamond, so discarding a @D on that trick is good play. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: team lineups available at  http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest11/nec.html   then use link for "NEC Cup Teams & Players"|pg||
mb|4H|nt|panja: and now, 4@S is cold with no wastage in N hand opposite @C stiff..but they didn't seem to have a way to spot it|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 30 point pack as it happens for n/s with the lack of wasted in clubs|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: and 4@s looks pretty cold|pg||
nt|petergill: If South invites with 3@S over 2@S, should North accept, with his useful-looking minimum?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: in previous years the web site had partnership convention cards, but i haven't found any for 2011 :(|pg||

pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h9|pg||
pc|d4|nt|dburn: well, it may limit the overtricks - it would have hurt a slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder why Senior tried slam investigation with 3N instead of 3@S|pg||
pc|dA|pc|h3|pc|d7|pg||
nt|panja: not at MP, not at IMP fresh..so I guess through 3@S would not be a possible route|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|pc|c8|pc|cA|pg||
nt|chessmaste: North's hand is better than it looks - all the honours in long suits. |pg||
nt|dburn: some pairs use 3NT as short spades in this kind of sequence|pg||
mc|11|nt|ahollan1: seems both would have eventually focused on @D concern|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|nicksan: One way of making ten tricks is to take diamond ruffs in the West hand and then squeeze North in the black suits.  |pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h8|pc|h5|pc|hA|pg||
nt|henryb:  So if N was going to make, E-W did the right thing|pg||

pc|sA|nt|lestergold: a question  of how many tricks can declarer scramble here|pg||
nt|panja: seven, I shd think|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: efficacy of 5@H sacrifice depens on whether Kyoko picks up trump suit|pg||
nt|dburn: this has a chance, if declarer plays spades in approved fashion|pg||
nt|sybarra: and not what do you do when you see the J of @S?|pg||
nt|sybarra: *now |pg||
nt|ahollan1: does duck 1st @D create problem for declarer?|pg||
nt|dburn: well, the books tell you to finesse on the next round - but that complicates matters a little|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|panja: @CA, @DA, ruff a @D, @SA, ruff another @D..and get off with a @C|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Seven? I reckon six is more likely|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d5|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s4|pc|h3|nt|panja: oh..but @D will be overruffed|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure if duck @D beats 4@S -- but winning @DA makes things much easier for declarer|pg||
nt|sybarra: is the restricted choice %?|pg||
nt|dburn: still, declarer may be able to use diamonds as substitute trumps|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: strong no trumpers will probably play this hand in 3@c|pg||
nt|panja: disc a @H then on the next @D|pg||
pc|d9|nt|dburn: very much so - almost 2-1 in favour of finessing|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|dburn: but maybe declarer actually had to go after clubs|pg||
nt|dburn: and that was a very tough thing to do|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since East controls 4th round of @D -- seems like @H or small @C beats |pg||
pc|h4|pc|c5|pc|d7|pg||
nt|sybarra: 10?|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: other room in 10@H   same auction but Akio Kurok balanced with East hand|pg||
nt|dburn: I don't think anything works from here - she had to set up dummy, not her own hand, and that was well against the odds|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s2|pc|dT|pg||
pc|c8|nt|chessmaste: Either king from South now - but not the ace of hearts!|pg||

nt|sybarra: suprised no sac from Brian?  likely to "see" no hts in pards hand |pg||
pc|s5|nt|petergill: 690 on club lead (unless Andrew Robson can sneak a heart past the ace)  or 720 on heart lead|pg||
pc|s9|nt|panja: unlikely North will duck a @H now...|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|hT|pg||
nt|lestergold: by notm leading a heart n/s should earn a top|pg||
nt|panja: seeing all the @D in Dummy..and knowing @S finesse is working|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Diamond to the queen, spade to the queen, low heart|pg||
nt|lestergold: after the next two tricks North will know not to duck a heart|pg||
nt|lestergold: he should be able then to virtually count declarer for 13 tricks if the heart is ducked|pg||
pc|hA|nt|chessmaste: Its not Mike Lawrence|pg||
nt|panja: a low Heart right away will lead to a duck..but which West will want to do that after the Club lead?|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|sT|pg||
nt|lestergold: no way hose|pg||
nt|petergill: 690 would give EW about 75% of the matchpoints|pg||

nt|lestergold: n/s|pg||
nt|panja: also...either of @D or @S might have been ducked...so an early play of @H is unlikely..|pg||
nt|petergill: No, I mean EW|pg||
nt|petergill: Lots of 680's|pg||
nt|ahollan1: minor suit holdings are ugly for offense|pg||

nt|petergill: Tony Forrester (Eng) and David Herman (USA) have taken the lead in the event. |pg||
nt|lestergold: too strong for an immediate 1@s must tell partner whose hand it is|pg||
pc|c6|nt|othered1: redouble then @S bid is forcing and I'm not sure south will  have enough control later|pg||
pc|c2|nt|panja: well, if 3S x Xx makes, it is only 0% score..as against the 5-8% you got just now on a wrong lead|pg||
