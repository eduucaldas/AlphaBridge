nt|granguru: 5NT is a safety place|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|andyv:  and they may get there|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|nt|granguru: but if 1NT isa weak one they probably will stop before that|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|granguru: chances are that no 2 aces are off|pg||

pc|s3|nt|andyv:  male science|pg||
nt|granguru: the hand can be made|pg||
nt|nicksan: 14-16 apparently. That tells us that South just overbid...|pg||

nt|mdgraham: apparently the other table has a different board 15|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Mike!|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2@c looks like asking for trouble|pg||
nt|othered1: might it have been a transfer bid, just a weak raise in @D?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|sybarra: welcome to Al Hollander |pg||
pc|s7|pc|s6|pg||
nt|lestergold: I doubt it|pg||
nt|dburn: well, after finding the spades blocked, declarer needs to apply some tehcnique to the club suit|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: South probably needed to use 2@C checkback to invite because common treatment to use 2N as Puppet to 3@C|pg||
pc|d4|nt|fcarioca: This should've been a dull board...|pg||
nt|sybarra: Neduk team:  David Bakhshi, David Gold, Louk Verhees, Ricco van Prooijen|pg||

nt|andyv:  have to sneak 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|granguru: the same hand was played by the late Osvaldo Vergara against Benaim of Venezuela in 1978 South American Champioship|pg||
mb|1D|nt|granguru: right 1 adds only to 11|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|3H!|nt|granguru: they are already onthe road for 6@H..and probably they will look for 7@H|pg||
nt|chilloncan: evening squires|pg||
nt|nicksan: Stopping in 3 NT in Cr on board 1|pg||

mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|mb|6H|nt|chilloncan: so we have the identical first names against the identical last nam,es|pg||

nt|sybarra: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest.html  website for the event  |pg||
nt|dburn: in that case 3NT down one will pick up a few IMPs - whether deservedly so is left as an exercise for the reader|pg||
nt|sybarra: Hackett   Paul Hackett, Justin Hackett, Tom Hanlon, Hugh McGann|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: EW play Big Club with 1N=14-16|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: I think it was 11 tricks|pg||
nt|petergill: Scoring is IMPs, so overtricks are not vital|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|2N|nt|sybarra: East name is Kurokawa,   we can not fit everything on screen |pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|sfoxa:  hello Shirley, Fernando and spectators. happy to join you.|pg||
mb|p|nt|fcarioca: Hi Sveta|pg||
mb|3H|nt|lestergold: par here is of course 5@sx for 300 to N/S|pg||
nt|dburn: still, here is a slam with the necessary complement of aces, trumps, winners and the like|pg||
nt|fcarioca: The bold @s overcall might slow down W|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: two clubs to take - can NS find the diamond ruff|pg||
nt|dburn: nothing short of an avalanche has ever been known to slow down Tom Hanlon, and it would need to be a fairly major avalanche at that|pg||
mb|4N|nt|mdgraham: now that 5@c is not an option|pg||
nt|lestergold: very good score for e/w therefore|pg||
nt|chessmaste: It is 100% not IMPs - every trick is vital|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|ahollan1: oh -- this isn't Sun Ming's partner from recent world championships??|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: not a good hand for the "take out partner's takeout doubles" school, I guess|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: Sorry, my mistake|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry 6@s can go 3 off still a save against 5@h|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: 5@s i meant |pg||
nt|mdgraham: no need for the diamond ruff, in fact - South has two natural diamond tricks|pg||
nt|dburn: this won't make, and neither would 3@d doubled have done|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s6|nt|dburn: still, while I don't have as much sympathy for South's decision as Kaplan would have done, I still have quite a lot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the EW pair in the other room bid 1N-3@D//3N   that really won't make|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2 diamond ruffs are availble|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: presumably Senior could have made immediate takeout noise [via 3@D?] so suspect delayed DBL is flawed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure that helps find PASS|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe, but he might have wanted to wait and see whether West was going to pass 3@d before acting over it - an immediate 3@d for takeout was not without risk|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|petergill: Who thinks that North should or might bid 3@H over 2@S?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a good partner would have balanced with 3@H - so he could go down instead of partner|pg||
mc|12|nt|panja: hi all|pg||
pg||

nt|granguru: Paul is the father|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|nicksan: I better predict a normal 3 NT, just because the players like to prove me wrong...|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h5|nt|chilloncan: custom notwithstanding, the dinosaur in me wi nces at a 1S response on 4 small holdi ng an otherwise excellent hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  hand looks more like a direct 3N bid than 1@s and then 3N|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|chilloncan: it may have the merit of stopping a spade lead, but for any slam purposes it could easily be a first foot put wrong|pg||
nt|nicksan: East will play diamonds and make in comfort|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|nt|andyv:  that's what the specs think... I think it just adds confusion to auction... you don't ever want to play 4@s with that hand even if pd has 4 spades|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|pc|h4|nt|chilloncan: i wouldnt go that far, but with a good hand it seldom pays to strut your zilch before your stuff|pg||
nt|andyv:  of course if you don't want to think out of the box, you will bid 1@s |pg||
nt|chilloncan: T/ Reese of checkered past had many solid aphorisms, one of which was: don;t make your first bid in a terrible suit on a potential slam hand|pg||
nt|nicksan: What;s the alternative?|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|c2|nt|chilloncan: why, 2S of course:0 LOL|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|cT|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
pc|d7|nt|chilloncan: a quantitiative NT bid seems fine if available. |pg||
pc|s6|pc|d4|pc|dK|pg||
nt|chilloncan: if playing forcing club with limited opening suit bids (other than 1C), then the downside of 1S is diminished somewhat|pg||

nt|panja: it is not so great|pg||
nt|fcarioca: An easy 3NT EW now|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|mdgraham: 4@Sx-2 was a very common result  |pg||
nt|lestergold: e/wcurrently lying 15th|pg||
nt|sybarra: acording to NEC schedule and team list , East is WANG HONG   Sun Ming reg part |pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: An old chestnut here - Transfer or Stayman|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|bg: sb 3nt plus 1|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I am a 1 nt bidder with the singleton ht|pg||
nt|sybarra: ugh|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D guarantees unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|dburn: nor would I be, but it isn't natural|pg||
nt|bg: gets the nt in wrong hand may make 1 lees trick with spade lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|sybarra: maybe transfer  I am told |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: Previous hand: When South discards on the 3rd round of @h's, North is known to have 7 hearts, 3 clubs and thus only one diamond, so discarding a @D on that trick is good play. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: team lineups available at  http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest11/nec.html   then use link for "NEC Cup Teams & Players"|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: and now, 4@S is cold with no wastage in N hand opposite @C stiff..but they didn't seem to have a way to spot it|pg||
nt|sybarra: we are still looking for system cards |pg||
nt|fcarioca: Yes, since 1@D guarantees an unbalanced hand, 1NT must be transfer to @C|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: 30 point pack as it happens for n/s with the lack of wasted in clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from 2010 Camrose Convention Card   1N=1NT shows clubs, 2@C=diamonds, 2@H=shows 4+ diamonds and 4 hearts 10-14|pg||
nt|ahollan1: URL to their CC  http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2010/ccards/hanlon-mcgann.pdf|pg||
nt|fcarioca: It became dangerous now, declarer must play on @C, not @d....|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|nt|lestergold: and 4@s looks pretty cold|pg||
nt|petergill: If South invites with 3@S over 2@S, should North accept, with his useful-looking minimum?|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in previous years the web site had partnership convention cards, but i haven't found any for 2011 :(|pg||
nt|sybarra: this lead wont hurt declarer|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|dburn: well, it may limit the overtricks - it would have hurt a slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder why Senior tried slam investigation with 3N instead of 3@S|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|pc|d8|nt|panja: not at MP, not at IMP fresh..so I guess through 3@S would not be a possible route|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|nt|dburn: not sure about that - this is OK|pg||
pc|h5|nt|chessmaste: North's hand is better than it looks - all the honours in long suits. |pg||
nt|dburn: some pairs use 3NT as short spades in this kind of sequence|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems both would have eventually focused on @D concern|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|d7|nt|lestergold: defence have attacked @ds in time|pg||
nt|panja: only because of South's stiff @C..had South held a stiff @D instead...it might not be so good|pg||

nt|nicksan: Do they play with screens, anyone?|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|chilloncan: E might bid 5D instead of 4, but there is a certain upsiode in 4D -- sometimes they end in the wrong suit. the big gamble bid is 4C. dangerous but could be huge winner -- kids, ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: dont try this at home|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|andyv:  make sure you have sympathetic teammates if you do|pg||
nt|nicksan: Now, Justin may raise...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 5D = i forgot to open 4D?|pg||
nt|granguru: 5@H is a dangerous contract |pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chilloncan: you need very strong partnership understandings about wha sorts of hands can bid 4D in order to bid 5D. but these two Davids have played together many times before|pg||
nt|andyv:  why pass 4@d dbl if you are planning to play 5@d... do you really think the opps will let you play 4@d?|pg||
nt|andyv:  If W was intending to bid 5@d (as he did), then he should do it before N can describe his hand|pg||
pc|h6|nt|granguru: agree|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|nicksan: Meanwhile, the players have produced absolute par at the table...well done!|pg||

mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: 1@H limited by failure to open 1@C|pg||

nt|Walddk4: TGR's Bridge Club is located in central London, near Marble Arch. TGR is short for The Great Rose, named after the late and great Great Britain player, Irving Rose|pg||
nt|fcarioca: Great defensive bidding here, not allowing NS to find their game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Paul Hackett in 5@S North -- David Gold only bid 4@D with East hand|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lestergold: a question  of how many tricks can declarer scramble here|pg||
nt|panja: seven, I shd think|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: efficacy of 5@H sacrifice depens on whether Kyoko picks up trump suit|pg||
nt|dburn: this has a chance, if declarer plays spades in approved fashion|pg||
nt|sybarra: and not what do you do when you see the J of @S?|pg||
nt|sybarra: *now |pg||
nt|ahollan1: does duck 1st @D create problem for declarer?|pg||
nt|dburn: well, the books tell you to finesse on the next round - but that complicates matters a little|pg||
nt|bg: -500 vs 650 pick up a few imps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php   lets u keep an eye on the other table|pg||
nt|dburn: don't blame him|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|panja: @CA, @DA, ruff a @D, @SA, ruff another @D..and get off with a @C|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Seven? I reckon six is more likely|pg||
nt|sybarra: "just checking"  |pg||
nt|fcarioca: I agrre with you, David, 5@d was not standard...|pg||
nt|sybarra: for lurkers in trumps|pg||

pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c7|nt|panja: oh..but @D will be overruffed|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure if duck @D beats 4@S -- but winning @DA makes things much easier for declarer|pg||
nt|sybarra: is the restricted choice %?|pg||
nt|dburn: still, declarer may be able to use diamonds as substitute trumps|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: strong no trumpers will probably play this hand in 3@c|pg||
nt|panja: disc a @H then on the next @D|pg||
pc|h5|nt|dburn: very much so - almost 2-1 in favour of finessing|pg||

nt|granguru: there is always more difficult to find @C slams than other suits ones|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|nicksan: Actually, 7 is the easier contract to play. In 6, on a heart lead, you have to guess which finesse to take, obvious now after the overcall of course|pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: +50 worth 48/66 for NS|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 4@H looks like pass/correct so probably 2@D=@D & @H/@S  [like dont]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=10-16 HCP, 6+@C or 5@C & 4@H/@S|pg||
nt|dburn: I guess if they would lead a heart, you might as well be in seven|pg||
nt|fcarioca: true|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: so you can see there that 50 to NS was very good for NS on Bd 5|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 2@C Transfer|pg||
nt|lestergold: with both missing ks favourably placed 12 tricks are likely for e/w in either spades or no tgrumps the no trumps of course outscoring|pg||
mb|3N|nt|panja: this dbl risks a @C lead away from @CAx...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: four 720's already!|pg||

nt|lestergold: one way or the other|pg||
nt|fcarioca: oh welll|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: it is hard to believe that 3@C does justice to a hand with 7-solid winners|pg||
nt|tejjyid: good hand for unusual 3NT really; West can then make a good decision|pg||
nt|fcarioca: 4NT by E for anyone?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: *gambling|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure that he could have done much about it - 2NT would show a maximum, but would run horrible risk of wrong-siding|pg||
nt|dburn: sure, he might have bid on over 3NT, but that would be mildly anarchic|pg||
nt|ahollan1: IMO -- part of the problem is including 5@C & 4@H/@S in the opening bid|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe the old ways are the best - 3NT-6@c|pg||
nt|fcarioca: It seems like there was an avalanche there...|pg||
nt|sybarra: going the wrong direction maybe|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|h6|pg||
nt|panja: 2@C should have been artificial..marked..looks like a Drury|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Not quite, but North must not duck a heart at any point|pg||
nt|sybarra: suprised no sac from Brian?  likely to "see" no hts in pards hand |pg||
nt|ahollan1: spec asked, so i'll mention  3N opening = normal 4@C/@D preempt  [i.e. NOT Gambling]|pg||
pc|s2|nt|petergill: 690 on club lead (unless Andrew Robson can sneak a heart past the ace)  or 720 on heart lead|pg||
pc|s9|nt|panja: unlikely North will duck a @H now...|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|lestergold: by notm leading a heart n/s should earn a top|pg||
nt|panja: seeing all the @D in Dummy..and knowing @S finesse is working|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Diamond to the queen, spade to the queen, low heart|pg||
nt|lestergold: after the next two tricks North will know not to duck a heart|pg||
nt|lestergold: he should be able then to virtually count declarer for 13 tricks if the heart is ducked|pg||
pc|c9|nt|chessmaste: Its not Mike Lawrence|pg||
nt|panja: a low Heart right away will lead to a duck..but which West will want to do that after the Club lead?|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|lestergold: no way hose|pg||
nt|petergill: 690 would give EW about 75% of the matchpoints|pg||
nt|lestergold: u mean n/w i think|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s|pg||
nt|panja: also...either of @D or @S might have been ducked...so an early play of @H is unlikely..|pg||
nt|petergill: No, I mean EW|pg||
nt|petergill: Lots of 680's|pg||
nt|ahollan1: minor suit holdings are ugly for offense|pg||
nt|sybarra: true,  and little defense for a ht slam also|pg||

nt|mdgraham: just what South expected....comes back to him at the 7-level|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|sybarra: afraid I would have been more pedestrian about it |pg||
nt|dburn: or might, I suppose, bid 2NT, which seems to have had the effect of a minor avalanche|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: But East could not see a 2nd trick, hence no Lightner Dbl|pg||
mb|5H|nt|lestergold: Robson has to double and take his plus now|pg||
nt|othered1: north now knows of @C duplication because of south's pass showing first round @C control|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh opted for a forcing pass shopwing club control|pg||
nt|petergill: South's Pass of 7@C should show 1st round club control, which South has. |pg||
nt|fcarioca: But 5 @H or @S ????|pg||
nt|dburn: but only temporarily - East lurking in the bushes|pg||
nt|dburn: poker now, not bridge - and Hanlon is a pretty good poker player; not sure about Verhees|pg||
nt|fcarioca: Interesting hand, nobody knows who is saving|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room just finished playing  21 [our 3@D+1]     3@S North -100   6 imps to NEDUK|pg||
nt|fcarioca: Everybody ashamed of earlier bids !:|pg||
nt|dburn: well, West seems to have what he bid (though McGann may be ashamed of that on general principles)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: It's useful to have bids other than 4@S to express an opinion about the 5 level|pg||
mb|d!|nt|lestergold: alfrey does not like that as he also has a club control|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: pass possibly requested double|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: there's a 5@sxx-3 - 1600 EW|pg||
nt|panja: at IMPS, 7@C is a clear bid....you don't want to risk -1430..at MPs, 7@C bid will probably get you close to Top or Bottom|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS +500 is 54/66 at the moment|pg||
nt|sybarra: headed to 3 nt here|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think Meckwell have something like this; then 4@S says "I'm bidding this without expectation"|pg||
nt|fcarioca: Incredible NS decisions, very good|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-15 HCP, 0+@D    i believe 2@D=Game Force, 5+@D|pg||
nt|dburn: opinion updated - Verhees obviously very good poker player|pg||
nt|fcarioca: LOL|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bg: the x double may even get him a heart trick|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|pg||
nt|fcarioca: exactly|pg||
nt|dburn: odd sort of decision now for McGann - should he finesse in hearts, hoping that 4@s was making?|pg||
nt|sybarra: k was for count? |pg||
nt|fcarioca: I think he MUST finesse, cause otherwise 4@s would not make, making the board already a bad one...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very common to use King for Count at high level  where need to cashout is so important   and lead of unsupported Ace more common|pg||
nt|fcarioca: He must justify the save...|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lestergold: i do not see why east bid 7@c he has a definite trick if partner can be encouraged to lead a club and pard i pretty likely to have a trci kin defence with a vul 4N bid|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hK|pc|h2|nt|lestergold: as u say this is mps and odds are that 6@s is overboard and its odds u play with not worry about 1430 etc|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|dburn: unclear - he could assume that the bidding at the other table will be 1@s-2@h-4@s-5@h etc|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: this hand more interesting at a different form of scoring|pg||
nt|sybarra: like BAM or MP |pg||
pc|s3|nt|chessmaste: You mean a diamond lead, not a club|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes of  ocurse|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry|pg||

nt|andyv:  5N simply asks for 2 of top 3 in suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  simple enough|pg||

mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: 2@H=weak 4+@H & 4+@S|pg||

mb|5D|nt|fcarioca: After finding the missing @SQ, they will stop at 6|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|nt|ahollan1: not Flannery like at all -- can 44/55 or longer in Either suit  and always a weak hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: in other parts of Europe, they use 2 @C as weak both majors |pg||
nt|sybarra: can be any shape in the majors|pg||
nt|dburn: not 2@c often - either 2@d or 2@h for that purpose|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: interesting, tempo-losing lead|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@c can be weak with both majors as part of a Multi structure, but that is mostly confined to Iceland|pg||
nt|dburn: so was I - declarer has 14 tricks in notrump against any lead|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: hehe  that's right  5@D 7@C 2@S 1@H     15 tricks !!|pg||
nt|dburn: and 15 on a spade lead, I suppose|pg||
pc|hT|nt|petergill: Andrew Robson's unexpected @S lead is based on the idea that East lacks spades and has heart stops, I guess|pg||
nt|dburn: this is an OK slam, though - Roland would scorn it; far too good for him|pg||
nt|fcarioca: Thos hand wont take 30 seconds...|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Roland would bid the grand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a convention that seems to be on the rise -- after partner preempts  Key Card responses are  0/1 no Q/1+Q/2 no Q/2+Q|pg||
pc|hA|nt|fcarioca: Yes, I meant Roland's grand...|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|dQ|pc|d2|pg||

mb|1C!|nt|sybarra: shall we just bid 4 nt?|pg||
nt|sybarra: get on with it?|pg||
nt|fcarioca: An old fashioned 2@D would work well here|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: I think NS play Polish Club|pg||

nt|fcarioca: me too|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|lestergold: they have had many good results together but this event is n ot one of them sadly with a field bristling with many of the great names in the bridge world this is not latogether ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: unexpected|pg||
mb|3D|nt|petergill: 3@S seems to be a request to play 3NT from partner's side|pg||
nt|lestergold: and this will be very unfortunate for e/w not likely to find the winning lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: so this is transfer maybe?|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@s is an old-fashioned 2@d|pg||
nt|fcarioca: dunno|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: and i suspect many mps fo0r n/s|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sybarra: landing in 2 @S here |pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  8  3N South after no bidding from EW |pg||
nt|sybarra: or is S more ambitious?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kyoko won't stop|pg||
nt|dburn: no - 2@s is strong, balanced or with one minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D is limited 8-13 HCP  so    2@S=a) 19-21 BAL  b) FG, 1-suit @C/@D|pg||
mb|4D|nt|lestergold: for a start not all pairs will even play in game and of course west on lead a @s defeats it our of hand|pg||
nt|petergill: In the Betting Market at http://2011pairsprices.yolasite.com/, Gold - Dunn were a 44-1 chance and NS 133-1. |pg||
nt|sybarra: come on mr. avalanche,  go for it!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N was forced|pg||
nt|fcarioca: well, at least 6@d they'll reach now|pg||
nt|sybarra: n/s might feel they sat the wrong direction in tems of cards,  just glad they are not playng rubber bridge|pg||
nt|dburn: sure, but this may be another example of the five-or-seven business|pg||
nt|dburn: though I guess 6NT by East (or six diamonds) is actually cold|pg||
nt|fcarioca: Isn't 7@d cold?|pg||
nt|dburn: yes, but only with the spade finesse|pg||
nt|fcarioca: hooking the @s K, of course|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|ahollan1: unless you meant 4@S  Shirl :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: dashing into 4 @S might hand been better |pg||
nt|fcarioca: Again, after @h lead, they might be at 7 as well...|pg||
nt|dburn: played by West on a heart lead, you would rather be in seven than five, and you would not want to be in six|pg||
nt|sybarra: does W cue the hts? or pass?|pg||
nt|fcarioca: Never passing|pg||
nt|sybarra: or just bid 6 @D?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: pass is the disciplined bid|pg||
nt|dburn: well, East's bidding has been a bit more discouraging than I would have thought|pg||
nt|sybarra: he is in the dark|pg||
nt|fcarioca: @H cue looking for @s cue seems right|pg||
nt|tejjyid: East has failed to cue, they can eaily miss 2 @S tricks |pg||
nt|dburn: 2NT was more or less forced, but 4@s over 4@d was possible|pg||
nt|sybarra: but if no spade cue, he is overboard|pg||
mb|p|mb|6D|nt|ahollan1: why blast -- AAK makes great slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: NS is Jacek Sikora and Jon Vos|pg||
nt|othered1: Weak NT openers may push the board, but I don't like EW's position in spite of that|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: ok the simple way out|pg||
nt|fcarioca: Without the @s cue, he could stop at 5NT, hoping for the @SJ at E|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i like David's idea of 4@D-4@S  of course we really don't know what 3N showed [just guessing any 11-13 BAL]|pg||
nt|dburn: still, if East didn't have anything at all in spades, he might have bid 4@h - after all, he must have something|pg||
nt|sybarra: 24 in 6 @S was a push|pg||
pc|s4|nt|dburn: so West has decided to play East for some spread-out minimum, which is what East has got|pg||
nt|fcarioca: I swear I would've led a spade also...|pg||
nt|dburn: but he probably should have opted for 6NT in that case, and not six diamonds|pg||
nt|fcarioca: This hand will lats 15 seconds...|pg||
nt|fcarioca: *last|pg||
nt|dburn: well, that spade lead will save the overtrick|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think 10 of @H's from the tenace looks better doesnt it?  (not that is matters)|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|sybarra: true, and why miss 7 if pard had a real (rock crusher) opening bi|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other table will start with Precision 2@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: *bid|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|fcarioca: Going up with the Ace seems right|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: right   South hand can't be assessed using HCP -- it has 4 losers and opener can easily cover 3 of them even after minimum 2@C rebid|pg||

nt|ahollan1: @C lead on this auction sure seems strange|pg||
nt|sybarra: I always call it that "damned doubleton lead" |pg||
nt|sybarra: often tunnels the defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe if NOT holding @HA|pg||
nt|bigtrain: @C lead turns out to be a winner if E then cashes the @DA and plays a heart...  declarer can only come to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahhh  if East cashed @DA then shifted to @H -- defense can prevail|pg||

nt|ahollan1: hard to accept "good save" when their counterparts score +660 in 3N   but it is better than double game swing|pg||
nt|dburn: besides which, if Verhees had passed he would have led the queen of hearts, and nothing could have saved Hanlon then|pg||

nt|panja: about 20% NS pairs should be in game on this one?|pg||
nt|petergill: So far about 3 or 4 NS's in game|pg||
nt|lestergold: 9 tricks certainly pretty guiaranteed on the lead|pg||
nt|othered1: quite pyshy game, so percent about right|pg||
nt|othered1: pushy|pg||
nt|petergill: and a few large penalties when NS chose to penalize the t/o doubler|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 180 is average|pg||
nt|panja: right..I thought a redbl by S, instead of 1@S? anyone for that?|pg||
nt|petergill: Tony Forrester (Eng) and David Herman (USA) have taken the lead in the event. |pg||
nt|lestergold: too strong for an immediate 1@s must tell partner whose hand it is|pg||
pc|c4|nt|othered1: redouble then @S bid is forcing and I'm not sure south will  have enough control later|pg||
pc|c5|nt|panja: well, if 3S x Xx makes, it is only 0% score..as against the 5-8% you got just now on a wrong lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: yyes peter a great risk at imps but at mps the greater risk is that paertner will not lead a spade if u dont so i am inclined to agree with PraKASH|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Declarer will make a lot of tricks on this one|pg||

nt|andyv:  amazing how different the hand would have been if E had opened 2@s|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|chilloncan: and bear in mind that E was a passed hand, which significantly redices likelihood of his having six sapdes unless he also has 4 hearts. so the odds favoring 2H ovber X are ...|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: neither of them have hand to take control and bid safely at 5 level|pg||

nt|nicksan: Paul not cuebidding his hearts should slow Justin down|pg||
nt|andyv:  nice brakes|pg||

nt|chilloncan: too many hearts to get rid of, i like the mortons fork|pg||

mb|1H!|nt|ahollan1: colour me skeptical about 13 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Previous hand: With both E and W being passed hands, perhaps looking for vulnerable penalties on the S hand was a good idea. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H opening includes 5@S & 5@H   could also be 4@H & 5+@C/@D|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 17+ bal|pg||
nt|fcarioca: Not very friendly @s game here...|pg||
nt|sybarra: one more hand after this for this set |pg||
mb|2H!|nt|lestergold: combined 33 e/w the field will play this in 6N|pg||
nt|petergill: prev bd: Rdbl then bid spades would be by a passed hand, hence not forcing|pg||
nt|panja: 6Nt might not be easy to make here..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=0-7|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S!|nt|lestergold: but the 12th trick in 6N looks elusive|pg||
nt|othered1: I'll stand corrected on redouble -- looks good in this context|pg||
nt|panja: althought I see a possibility of 12th trick..on run of 3@H and 4@C..S might have to bare his @DJ|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D looks like a "mini-multi", one long major, very weak hand|pg||
nt|petergill: Rdbl looks like a psyche|pg||
nt|lestergold: prssure play and good card reading may be needed to bring in 6N my feeling is that it will fail at most tables|pg||
nt|petergill: 4NT quantitative|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=Game Force Relay  2@H=5+@S|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|sybarra: I think we have all been in worse games however|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: and 5@D, s howing aces to accept?|pg||
nt|panja: seems like that|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if you do want to accept a 4NT try, not a bad idea to show aces....just in case|pg||
nt|petergill: Thomas Charlsen came 2nd in this event last year. |pg||
nt|lestergold: most will  play this from west hand as not everyone bids with two js on south at equal vul|pg||
nt|othered1: I play that if 4N is 100 percent clearly quantitative|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: a make only double dummy if at all..E is far more likely to play S for @DK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think 3@D non-forcing but VERY encouraging -- and denies 4@H/@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: will make them all|pg||
nt|fcarioca: But it will make|pg||
nt|sybarra: after next hand,  we have about 1+ hour break |pg||

pc|d3|nt|mdgraham: first result is in - 6N-1 |pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: right Shirl -- THIS 13 tricks i'll believe |pg||
nt|dburn: surprised at the actual lead - would have led a club myself, but probably not much difference|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i assume 3@H showed exactly 5=5=2=1  that would explain non-@C lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: probably the only other choice is @S4  [yuk]|pg||
nt|fcarioca: Your @c lead could mud the waters, declarer could try @d discards...|pg||
pc|dA|nt|dburn: not sure about that - 3@d forcing in most versions of Precision I know|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|dburn: well, it might explain it - with a stiff spade, though, you could just lead a long suit and hope to tap declarer|pg||

nt|ahollan1: oh  we started with board 17|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: can't really tell -  from earlier hand, it might be that there is no way to show single suit @H at 2-level|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: blast or science??|pg||
nt|sybarra: pard passed,  do I need science with S hand?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that sounds like a vote for 4@H  --  how about you David?|pg||
nt|dburn: 6@h in the Roland category, but I guess you could make it|pg||
nt|dburn: would open only 1@h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm positive that i don't know|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if @S instead of @H -- definitely 1@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if Namyats factors in ... i'm just more uncertain|pg||
nt|dburn: would not open at the four level with three first-round controls - could work well, though|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4 losers opposite passed hand AND worry about 4th round of @D|pg||
nt|sybarra: not seeing the N hand,  you open 1 ht and bidding returns to you at 4 sp? |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm waffling as quickly as i can|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: in the other room -- South opened Precision 1@C -- that's a no brainer|pg||
nt|dburn: if the next hand is going to bid 4@s, I would regret not opening 4@h, certainly|pg||
nt|sybarra: well that was not in our mix|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: regular partnership of oesmond and Chadha who often do very well in these sort of events but not this time|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 14 board sets -- but  not 1-28|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok  then 2 more I guess |pg||
pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: 1@D could have been 4@D & 5+@C or @S|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s5|nt|dburn: but even if 3NT shows a good four of a major bid, I am not sure I would open that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N looks like Kantar -- solid Major|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|petergill: Gad Chadha and Graham Orsmond are in 27th place out of 68|pg||
nt|petergill: Well bid to 4@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in balanced hand 1@D=2+@D|pg||
nt|fcarioca: @dA first or small first?|pg||

nt|lestergold: not all chopped liver|pg||

pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: @S lead looks normal -- and shows why Kyoko transfers to North|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ahollan1: or maybe 4@C said  transfer to your suit   ala Multi|pg||
nt|sybarra: little does he know |pg||
nt|sybarra: easy from here to call small  but at table ..... |pg||
nt|fcarioca: true|pg||
nt|sybarra: if @D behave  |pg||
nt|fcarioca: If E plays a @s now, it can be doomed|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @S uncomfortable for declarer - how does he get back to dummy to play @D?|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: the fourth club needs gto be taken care off presumably spades will be set up|pg||

mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|chilloncan: EW have standards for their preempts apparently:)|pg||
nt|rv: I like to play 2@h followed by 3@h by North as Inv (NF)|pg||
nt|chilloncan: in my eyes E closer to 3C than W is to a 1S overcall|pg||
nt|disa: interesting bidding problem for S|pg||
nt|rv: atleast LS for NS here|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|nicksan: 3 @S surely?|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 3S an easy start but he is surely going to have to bid again|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|rv: I presume South's 3@h is NF, I like Jason's choice of 3@s, another option is 4@c splinter which is not everyone's choice with stiff @CA|pg||
nt|disa: which can only get 4H since S has all the controls|pg||
nt|rv: South will press the button here with RKC|pg||
nt|chilloncan: exactly, and that was why u said it was a problem, the problem  is the bidding plan, not just the first call over 2H|pg||
nt|nicksan: he needs something in diamonds, i would expect 5 @C now|pg||
nt|disa: i like RKC here|pg||
nt|nicksan: Blackwood will do nothing as he has all the side aces and partner must have a heart suit|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i think 4N here if u r able to find out afterward that N has D king|pg||
nt|rv: Jason will expect Paul to hold stiff @S, even some @d fillers like T9 enough, I think he will bid 4n and/or blast to slam|pg||
nt|chilloncan: the problem is the grand|pg||
nt|rv: he may discount GS after Paul didn't cue on 3@s, once Paul bid 2@h Jason was never going to stop short of 6 in my opinion|pg||
nt|nicksan: If he gets 5 @D over 5 @C he can bid 5 NT to ask for K,Q of trumps|pg||
nt|chilloncan: K 7 times in hearts and Kx of Ds makes a grand|pg||
nt|chilloncan: and N might even have more:)|pg||
nt|rv: Jason can still try 4n, then check for @DK and sign off in LS|pg||
nt|disa: if he bids blackwood and followes it up with Q ask N might show the Q and no Ks|pg||
nt|rv: sry South is Justin Hackett|pg||
nt|nicksan: It's Justin actually  lol|pg||
nt|chilloncan: shouldnt N just respond 5H to 4N?|pg||
nt|chilloncan: asorry|pg||
nt|chilloncan: erase|pg||
nt|disa: undo|pg||
nt|chilloncan: brain haywire|pg||
nt|andyv:  squeek|pg||
nt|chilloncan: ty:)|pg||
nt|rv: yes, he should show @HQ with 7th @h, with 6@hs he should deny @HQ if he doesn't have it|pg||
nt|andyv:  nice to have a brain|pg||
nt|nicksan: Perhaps I'm a pessimist, but I always find partner has 3 small diamonds if I bid like that|pg||
nt|chilloncan: change partner|pg||
nt|nicksan: They all do|pg||
nt|andyv:  k@s is a huge card in this auction|pg||
nt|rv: I am betting on Justin just bidding 6@h w/o trying for grand:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  we can put money on this?|pg||
nt|disa: well he more than makes up for it with sK|pg||
nt|chilloncan: if you are going to signoff in 6H u need to do it fast so u have an alibi|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|disa: he will try 4 7|pg||
nt|rv: not anymore for 7|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chilloncan: sure, he has just been thinking about hopw|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: wow|pg||

pc|c7|pc|c3|pg||
nt|disa: wow are you sure that's justin?|pg||
nt|chilloncan: so if pd had denied a keycard we have to assume he would have signed off|pg||

nt|granguru: another 150 honors lost..:)|pg||
mc|12|nt|andyv:  I was told earlier that it was Jason when i said Justin.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: so pd has:    x   xxxxxxx  Kx   xxx    which is not even a 2H bid or even close, and 6H is on 32 hearts but they would have played 5H|pg||

nt|petergill: Ew silent for now, might miss the 4@s save|pg||
nt|ahollan1: outside of my notes now   i thought 2@H=Nat, Game Force|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lestergold: personally i think Chadha should have barraged witgh 3@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: East might have bid a weak 3@S bid over 2@H, if systemically available|pg||
nt|sybarra: are we blasting? or 4 nt now perhaps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D would have been the response without interference|pg||

pc|c5|nt|petergill: and West might have doubled 3@S, to suggest a 4@s save|pg||
nt|sybarra: and down off the top  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: for only our 2nd push of the set|pg||
