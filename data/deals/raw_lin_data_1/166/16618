nt|marcsmith: that way you get to defend 3@C (afrer 1@S-P-2@S-X-P-3@C-AP)|pg||
nt|peachy: It is a matter of style, my bid would have been 2S|pg||
nt|marcsmith: seems clear to me -- just seems technically better|pg||
nt|peachy: Even if N wanted to bid 2C (different cards mind you) he might think twice bidding over 2S rather than 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: bad hand with fit wants to get the auction as high as possible as quickly as possible|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bidding anything that sounds remotely passable just seems too high risk|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lest we forget -- full credit to Sartaj for muddying the water with 2@C|pg||
mb|7H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: unless it was operator error and Antoff bid 2@C :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|peachy: If our operator is not too busy, he will likely show us alerts etc.  But as someone said "the operator jos is like being a long-tailed cat in a small room full of rocking chairs" |pg||

nt|ahollan1: play will be much faster than the bidding|pg||
mc|13|nt|peachy: Tell that to the Constructive Raise crowd:)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1N=15-17|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|marcsmith: you can't bid 1@S -- that would show an unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|marcsmith: it's the problem with 5-card majors|pg||

nt|tejjyid: these 5-5 isfits are ugly to bid and play|pg||

nt|ahollan1: like multi  |pg||
nt|peachy: is it what MultiLandy is|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H!|nt|peachy: At IMPs, vulnerable games should be aggressively bid, partly because it yields IMPs and prtly because if it doesnt yield IMPs, then it will be a push (down both tables)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H = pass/correct|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: much easier after a 1@S opening of course|pg||
nt|marcsmith: the French bid 1@S on these balanced hands, but it's virtually unplayable IMHO|pg||

nt|ahollan1: there is an outside chance that Simpson holds @CK and @DK  [2 controls]|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|marcsmith: can make 12 by crossing to the @C10, cashing @HA and taking spade finesse|pg||

nt|peachy: Hello everybody|pg||
nt|marcsmith: this looks like a chance for NS to get into trouble -- no fit and bad breaks usually a recipe for disaster|pg||
mb|1C|an| |nt|marcsmith: hmmm -- not long any strong two i ever saw|pg||
nt|peachy: strong has changed meaning|pg||
nt|marcsmith: not enough tho|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: oh, okay, corected :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: big 1@C|pg||
mb|1S|an| |mb|p|nt|marcsmith: intermediate at best i'd say|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=3 controls [A=2 K=1]  denies solid 6+ suit|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|marcsmith: hard for EW to punish it tho|pg||
nt|marcsmith: the @S 10 is a useful card too|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|peachy: 2D multi|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at this point, we're all guessing|pg||
nt|peachy: it is a race, who is going to be declarer :)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|tejjyid: East has good shape - but a lot of losers opposite a weak raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C must resemble Stayman but not promise a 4 card major|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since Sartaj didn't inject 2@H bid -- 3N might just fetch   but we can see that 5@D is cold on any lead|pg||
nt|peachy: Perhaps. However, E is so poor that he might try to hit partner's suit which logically is best effort at heart|pg||
mb|4D|nt|marcsmith: that removes the entry to the @DK before declarer can use it too|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: declarer will likely get the spade suit right , ie. no point finessing|pg||
nt|peachy: the likelihood of length in hearts with partner is greater than likelihood of length in spades|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|peachy: the likelihood of S having the Q is greater|pg||
nt|tejjyid: he won't go many down, i'm sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S looks like risky bid, but they're on same wavelength  [@D agreed]|pg||
nt|peachy: smooth sailing to the best contract here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not in my world!!    if using 1st/2nd round cues up the line   4@S said no @H control, so 5@C says I CONTROL @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: otherwise just signoff knowing 2+@H losers|pg||
nt|peachy: Your logic holds water, Al|pg||
nt|peachy: I overlooked that, Simpson might thnk N has singleton H, might he?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on the other hand -- a psychic cue with that agreement may stop @H lead against slam|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|marcsmith: @SK was better|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i'm terrible at those tactical calls|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|tejjyid: but any is too many|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and Simpson thought as I about @H control|pg||
nt|peachy: I'm chicken, I try to be honest|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as me?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: where's a grammarian when i really need one?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|peachy: Okay, so "IF" 5C was tactical bluff, THEN we will get to see if it worked|pg||
nt|peachy: hardly possible w W on lead|pg||

nt|peachy:  Lastly, thanks to Al Hollander for his expertise and for the homework he has done on the player's systems; I know kibitzers|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: EW should be able to find out about the lack of aces in time to stop in game, but 5@H is too high if the defence can find their club ruff|pg||
nt|peachy: appreciate it a lot, I know I do!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Tom -- please thank the PLAYERS|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|marcsmith: i have to say i'd have opened the south hand but perhaps they don't have a weak 2@D available|pg||
mb|3N|nt|marcsmith: south here certainly wants a diamond lead rather than a spade tho, so he can set up the club ruff in time|pg||
nt|peachy: for bringing, I meant, sry all|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h7|nt|marcsmith: i've been asked about opening a weak two with a 4-ard major|pg||
pc|hT|nt|peachy: Ishmael is in the hot seat now|pg||
nt|marcsmith: the theory is that when you pre-empt you're guessing the hand belongs to the opponens, which is why you should be much more aggressive in 1st seat that second -- the odds are ...|pg||
nt|marcsmith: double that the opps rather than pard has the good hand|pg||
nt|marcsmith: given that you're guessing it's the opponents hand, say you open 2@S with a singleton heart, the opps are likely to be able to get into the auction when they belong in 4@H|pg||
nt|marcsmith: when you have say a 6-4-2-1 shape with four hearts, and they belong in game in a minor, it will be harder for them to get in because they don;t have hearts to double with|pg||
nt|raghavan: still thinking?? |pg||
nt|marcsmith: club seems clear -- partner needs either rounded suit ace|pg||
pc|hA|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|nt|raghavan: Seems to be more frequent pre empt hands esp Spade|pg||
nt|peachy: Last hand up, next segment begins 45 minutes from now|pg||
