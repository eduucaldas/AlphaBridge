mb|p|nt|hawe45:  - ah, I didÂ´nt see the 9 of @H, important card |pg||
mb|2D!|nt|tejjyid: West adopts the iew that passing with a weak balanced hand is better than trying to fluke a partscore|pg||

nt|tejjyid: 8 easy tricks is a good start; usuallythe defence will provide one along the way|pg||

pc|d2|nt|bg: it was 16+|pg||

nt|othered1: ty operator|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: in the other room West raised to 5@C|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 3N made on 1 for 6 imps|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sybarra: goofy little hand |pg||
nt|lestergold: after A@c could be interesting if PO tries to sneak a spade he may may make|pg||
nt|othered1: in the OR, it was east who thought his hand worth initial action and opened 1@C, cheating his partner out of the chance to be first to bid.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sunsamvar: i might be tempted to do so too.|pg||
nt|xenya: makes sense, considering the vulnerability |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: with the west hand... 7 points in partners preemt might not produce a single trick|pg||
nt|xenya: putting maximum pressure on NS|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|bg: same result in other room on board 1|pg||
nt|othered1: the overcall does give west some useful information|pg||
nt|fabsayc: are you prepared to bid 7 if opponents reach slam, because that often happens with these extreme preempts|pg||

mb|p|nt|othered1: I don't hate 2@C rebid, but I think it would be nice to have methods that didn't require me to balckwood on north hand, though maybe it will work out.  7th @C, as yet unbid, is key ...|pg||
nt|othered1: and north can't count it.|pg||

nt|lestergold: sorry i used to be a teahcer its just habit|pg||
nt|chilloncan: mike is telling you to comment on the Go stand, in the corner|pg||
nt|tejjyid: NOrth has shown an appreciation of the "soft" nature of his 16 count, but 'm not sure whathe can do about it|pg||
nt|chilloncan: mirrored shapes and marginal game values dont mix well|pg||
nt|lestergold: well if he bids it will west lead his fourth best from hismlongest and strongest the only lead to give 3N|pg||
nt|lestergold: and that was a few decades ago|pg||

mb|3N|nt|hawe45:  Another good move from Hac-Hac|pg||

mb|p|nt|othered1: That's an effort you'd see in many duplicate clubs.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|xenya: the auction in the other room was completely different -- S chose to preempt in 1st seat|pg||
nt|xenya: 6@S is essentially on a heart finesse|pg||
nt|jcwla: I am not convinced by this.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Rule of 11 tells W the whole story.|pg||
nt|xenya: anyway, NS were lucky to remain oblivious of their spade fit|pg||
pc|h3|nt|saverio: not easy to get to slam after 2@h/3@c/4@h...  a lot of space wasted and no more room to investigate|pg||
nt|tejjyid: OH, thy're certainly getting to game|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like 4@d is systematic|pg||
nt|chilloncan: the double by W makes S hand worse, and NS not vul. but most wiould bid game even if appreciating the negative factors|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I guess, that's why it took so long to find.  |pg||
nt|chilloncan: 6 LTC + 8.5 LTC means larginal for game even apart from the mirror|pg||
nt|tejjyid: South *might* have passed 2@S NV< but once not, no way to stop|pg||
nt|bobh1: actually no way to misdefend|pg||
nt|chilloncan: it is a difficult double dummy problem i ndeed to imagine a scenario where EW could let it make|pg||
nt|lestergold: well North was very max for his 2@s and south was sub min for 2N|pg||
nt|tejjyid: If they routinely make single raises with 16 HCP, South is pretty much compelled to try will 9+|pg||

nt|sybarra: glad you can keep this score|pg||
nt|bg: some players use 3 club rebid to show extra length plus a partial heart fit|pg||

mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: the auction has died in a mere 3@H OR so a plus for Bulgaria|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: this is pushing it|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: nice jump overcall in the balancing position by Zhan|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@S in last seat tends to show a decent hand -- just what S has|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the other option of dbling and then bidding @Ss will show more points and defence|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|xenya: what's your prediction on this one, Martin?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I the good old days, North had "taken the money against 2 @C D!"|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I only see two losers in 5 @D? But how many tricks...|pg||
nt|saverio: after the 2@h opening in the earlier board we can understand why N opened 1@h here     though it is not my style since i prefer sounds openings and overcalls....:)|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i dont really agree with the double by W, but the position is a very awkward one|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: 1 off guaranteed club guess needed to avoid 2 light|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I used to play cheapest NT was a void based T/O|pg||
nt|sybarra: some sort of drury by N |pg||
nt|tejjyid: and on that lead, it won't be too hard|pg||
nt|othered1: west's pass, compared to an earlier board, must mean he looks at the vulnerability before bidding|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|othered1: and I guess east is making a game try|pg||
nt|xenya: tough hand for NS|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5@D is down after 2 rounds of clubs|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: if South has soft values in the majors 3 nt may be right.. but i guess he will bid 5@D|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|othered1: well done, so far|pg||
nt|chilloncan: club just helps declarer|pg||

mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: the big flat use a lot of space nt|pg||
nt|othered1: south, perhaps feeling too good for a 1N overcall (if available naturally), tried a simple 1@D and gets a bid out of partner.  Now what?|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|bg: sry it was 2 clubs x by E down 1 -100|pg||
nt|othered1: so far very normal.  Now north's hand says do something @H focused, like raise or support double|pg||

mb|p|nt|saverio: puppet action here    |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 3@D = a 4 card but no 5 card major|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sybarra: N likely hitting the deck quickly here|pg||
nt|sybarra: or not?|pg||
nt|chilloncan: good bid by E, but this should end it|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: so was W bid a psyche? or systemic|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: wow. apparently 2N was forcing|pg||
nt|tejjyid: a simple & descriptive bid...|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, and now W could bid 3N -- i'm surprised he didn't|pg||
nt|jcwla: Considering this suit leaves a lot to be desired, W should feel comfortable in thinking JT shores it up nicely when in fact it's little better than 32.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|saverio: but the seems not to have a bid showing both M so they could have wronsided the contract if they happened to have @h and not @s fit....|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: well said Jordan|pg||
pc|cK|nt|xenya: the 4@S bid is routine -- E doesn't need much from partner for game to be good |pg||
nt|chilloncan: looks good for W|pg||
nt|sybarra: how did they make 4 @S?  not sure I see enough tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: as cards lie|pg||
nt|sybarra: I see,  @H lead and hopped ace|pg||
nt|chilloncan: club ruffs out third, and they may have led D ace|pg||
nt|lestergold: surely only lose 1 trick in each side suit|pg||
nt|othered1: That doesn't come up all that often on defensive bidding, and I might think it showed a different hand with longer, better @D and a bit less outside.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bg: many players do not like to doubles with voids and a weakness in defensive cards  probably best here just to overcall 1 heart|pg||
nt|saverio: wrongsided*|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it probably gets bid with your hand type more often - 19-20 balanced usually goes through a X|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|nt|dburn: not sure I'd have responded to 1@d at all with the North cards, let alone responded 1@h. But Kokish is very big in Japan, so that a 1@d overcall has a range of about 9 to about 29|pg||
pc|h2|nt|othered1:  a little wild and wooly, but I'll take defending 4@S on these hands.|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: with 2 sure trump losers Tanaka has the choice of the @S or @D fin|pg||
pc|dT|nt|hawe45:  Oups|pg||
nt|saverio: over 3@d it is a normal agreement to play 4@c both M with slam interest and 4@d w/out.....|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kiwibridge: Korbachev has made his 5@D another 12 imp blow|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sybarra: well hopefully there is a real explanation, I am getting several from kibs|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|tejjyid: reasonable to raise to 2@D|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: good @D shift by Zhan forcing declarer to take the choice now..|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sunsamvar: South had a tough choice at trick 2|pg||
pc|d8|nt|dburn: meanwhile, though, how will he make it?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I can't imagine introuding the @H suit though|pg||
pc|d2|nt|othered1: eventually, the auction will let declarer get the @D position right|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|xenya: also, the defence may go wrong...|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: a spec points out that Tanaka shd have pld a @S to the 10 on the second trick... true i think|pg||
pc|hA|nt|dburn: I guess that with this vile layout (diamonds 4-1, all the hearts wrong) he won't|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|sybarra: now what?|pg||
nt|othered1: 4N would have been a very descriptive bid, if quantitative.  Not sure what 5@H would mean in that context.  Perhaps a choice of game, perhaps responding to blackwood, which some do ...|pg||

pc|d7|nt|sybarra: these teams are ranked  1 (Neduk) and  2  ;Taipei W |pg||

nt|othered1: easy game, as cards lie.  but north is trying to figure out how to avoid @C loser on the lead.  Playing east for J.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 3S by S could not have been a slam try and almost surely not a probe for 3N. so that means it was simply establishing ownership of the hand, to set up a forcing pas situation. N ...|pg||

nt|chilloncan: in here i mean|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chilloncan: yes, hand short in their suit must act, even if a bit under strength|pg||
nt|tejjyid: needs an iron will to pass|pg||
nt|sharkey: East Passed the x in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: but maybe he was just trying to minimise his losses|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i wd have played the @Hq trying to pin the 10 or 8... but the lack of entries to dummy wd had led to him laying down the Ace|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: meanwhile we have a thin vul game here.|pg||
nt|xenya: i really don't see where N found the 4@H bid|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: he has to hope for all minor suit honours with Li|pg||
nt|dburn: would rather bid 2@s than have it go 2@h-pass-4@h-pass-pass-headache|pg||
nt|lestergold: south likes it too much to double|pg||
pc|sA|nt|pelu: IN OR NS fast in 4@S and now west i playing 5@h|pg||
nt|ritong: a bit high|pg||
nt|ritong: as was 4@s|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - but where did S find the Double?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sybarra: right   too much to X |pg||
nt|tejjyid: drawing to a close - KISS started slowly but picked up momentum after a while|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bg: 12 boards played this is only third part score! |pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|tejjyid: which is a bit like life really....|pg||
nt|tejjyid: from the long dealy, you can assume PO won the 1st trick|pg||
nt|tejjyid: *elay|pg||
nt|tejjyid: *delay|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ritong: difficult lead for north|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|nt|pelu: 4. best - very easy :)|pg||
nt|ritong: bakhshi can see that contract is cold with @hs 3/2, so he has to work out something if this is not the case|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he wasn't sure the auction would end if he doubled - maybe he would get to double 4@s|pg||
nt|chilloncan: absolutely|pg||
nt|lestergold: or maybe they wopuil;d play in clubs which is rather hard tol double|pg||
nt|sybarra: but I would have bid 3 hts on the get go with S hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: As we see this is a make with S having Kx in @C......|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: noone wants to play a suit.. so trumps may be continued :0|pg||
nt|sharkey: Bridge is easy when we get to look at all four hands :)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|c5|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 3H could be good news bad news...might kep them out, but might turn plus into minus|pg||
pc|cT|nt|othered1: The name of the game at IMPs today is "bid them up"|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|pc|cK|pg||
nt|xenya: well. S has support in all the unbid suits -- sort of|pg||
nt|chilloncan: always hard to know what to do with those|pg||
nt|lestergold: i vote for 3@h|pg||
nt|xenya: as E is short of entries |pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|nt|dburn: in which position?|pg||
nt|lestergold: and let opps get on with it...|pg||
nt|lestergold: south raising to 3@h|pg||
nt|xenya: the correct line is not clear however|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sharkey: @CKx may be the "only chance"|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|sybarra: pard did open red, with 2 hts,   he cant be totally broke|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h9|pc|hT|pc|h7|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 2 rounds @H then try to ruff a @S|pg||
nt|tejjyid: thanks all for coming|pg||
nt|tejjyid: thanks operator & NEC|pg||
pc|c8|nt|pelu: 5@Hs was down 2 so a +board for NEDUK|pg||
nt|othered1: even fewer part scores in the OR|pg||
nt|xenya: to finesse clubs twice |pg||
pc|s5|nt|ritong: for this reason, i would have played a @c at trick 2|pg||
pc|d7|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i was taught that to dbl 1@S you need a bit more :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kiwibridge: We'd like to thank our great operator Murakami, Saverio Hans and James for their commentaries, Akito Omasa of the JCBL and NEC for their great sponsorship|pg||
pc|s7|pc|h5|pc|s9|pg||
pc|s3|pc|dA|nt|xenya: declarer's play makes sense -- he goes down only if S does have Kx in clubs|pg||
pc|h3|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: when you have 2 honours in front of you, cover is the rule..|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: so i guess Li shd have put up the @Ck|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d5|pc|d4|pc|d8|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed not, but if it turns out that the opponents don't have much distribution, chilloncan is right - you might just go -100 instead of +110 for no reason|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kiwibridge: BBO and Roland Wald and especially the audience for their great feedback|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ritong: say south has @c Axx, he is cooked|pg||
mc|7|nt|kiwibridge: 4 more rounds of swiss tomorrow, I'll be here for the last 2|pg||

pc|h8|nt|petergill: SARA often vaults into the Finals most years in the NEC Cup, by playing a top line-up in the last few rounds of the Swiss |pg||
nt|andyv:  again he does have a @s suit that belongs in Vegas|pg||
