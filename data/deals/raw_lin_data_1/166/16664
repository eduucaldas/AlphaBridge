nt|alok_daga: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzys: hello all|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Good morning everybody|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Hi every one   enjoy a new session of NEC cup|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Most of the Oz Two team were on the team that won the recent Australian National Open Teams|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So they are in form ...|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: and face tough opposition from Chinese team from Beijing|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|d|nt|lebridgeur: 4 @s   in the contract to reach EW|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: is|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Nope|pg||
mb|2H|nt|cuttysark: This North hand is a difficult opener - a really terrible 7card suit he has downgraded to a weak 2|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
mb|2S|nt|alok_daga: 2dmn as multi,is it allowed here?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|lebridgeur: Now   it is East hands|pg||
nt|bjacobs: East seems to have a fairly good hand in support of spades ... did he really pass over 2@D?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think it must be :) - and why not?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|alok_daga: well,ACBL,WBF all have imposed some restrictions|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Some defend the Multi by passing with a strong hand - not a method I understand too well|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: No rectified!|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lebridgeur: Wd|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lebridgeur: for  a push|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's an unplayable method to pass with a strong hand if your LHO is also allowed to pass ... few top pairs defend it that way|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Anyway, he made a normal double - often played as 13-16 balanced, or any strong hand|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: the good trump break will be a nice surprise|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Perhaps South tries @DA here, hoping partner is void in that suit|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h9|pc|hA|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: strange in my opinion why South did not play for a single @c lead ?|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|h8|pc|hT|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I guess @DA asked for an attitude signal - with a club ruff he would discourage|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Because then, probably West is void in diamonds|pg||

nt|dburn: well, after finding the spades blocked, declarer needs to apply some tehcnique to the club suit|pg||

pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: South probably needed to use 2@C checkback to invite because common treatment to use 2N as Puppet to 3@C|pg||

mb|1N|an|13-15 BAL|nt|pelu: 6@D is a fair slam - need @DJ to dropor @HK onside|pg||
nt|alok_daga: a mundane 3nt or something exciting?|pg||

mb|p|nt|alok_daga: a 6dmnds on a 6 1 fit hardly %with hrt K also not there|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|cuttysark: But it still makes with a diamond loser if the heart finesse succeeds - must be better than 50%|pg||

mb|p|mb|4C!|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|cuttysark: Gussing that 3@H is a transfer showing a singleton spade|pg||

nt|sybarra: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest.html  website for the event  |pg||
nt|dburn: in that case 3NT down one will pick up a few IMPs - whether deservedly so is left as an exercise for the reader|pg||
nt|sybarra: Hackett   Paul Hackett, Justin Hackett, Tom Hanlon, Hugh McGann|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: playing boards 17 to 30 must be a vulnerability thing|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Tony made short work of that|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ahollan1: EW play Big Club with 1N=14-16|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: I think it was 11 tricks|pg||
nt|petergill: Scoring is IMPs, so overtricks are not vital|pg||

mb|p|nt|fcarioca: Hi Sveta|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thx Frank|pg||
mb|2S!|an|4414|nt|lestergold: par here is of course 5@sx for 300 to N/S|pg||
nt|dburn: still, here is a slam with the necessary complement of aces, trumps, winners and the like|pg||
nt|fcarioca: The bold @s overcall might slow down W|pg||
nt|frankaus: http://www.abf.com.au/events/playoffs/2010/OpenWom/Hans-Nunn.pdf|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: two clubs to take - can NS find the diamond ruff|pg||
nt|dburn: nothing short of an avalanche has ever been known to slow down Tom Hanlon, and it would need to be a fairly major avalanche at that|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mdgraham: now that 5@c is not an option|pg||
nt|lestergold: very good score for e/w therefore|pg||
nt|chessmaste: It is 100% not IMPs - every trick is vital|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: is this 2/1 with transfer response to the possible short 1@C|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: or is it strong club|pg||
nt|jcwla: Looks more prec-y to me.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  or they are playing a polish club system with xfers|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: oh -- this isn't Sun Ming's partner from recent world championships??|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: shame they missed 6@C|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: unforunately the - made it not a link, can you try again|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  This is a pretty good slam - needing only to hold red suit losers to one|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: not a good hand for the "take out partner's takeout doubles" school, I guess|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  popularity of transfers increases, yes|pg||
mb|3N|nt|nigel_k:  Neither suit behaves though|pg||
nt|hawe45:  6 @C is a winner, I think...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 5 card majors variable nt funny 2C opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Sorry, my mistake|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry 6@s can go 3 off still a save against 5@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 5@s i meant |pg||
nt|mdgraham: no need for the diamond ruff, in fact - South has two natural diamond tricks|pg||
nt|dburn: this won't make, and neither would 3@d doubled have done|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: EW play some real interesting stuff and its rare that the are not on the same page of the system notes|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  That's right, with clubs 3-3 you can make 6@c|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: could be a great set|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  West has lost interest because he doesn't know partner's singleton diamond is the king and can't see 12 tricks otherwise|pg||
pc|s2|nt|dburn: still, while I don't have as much sympathy for South's decision as Kaplan would have done, I still have quite a lot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the EW pair in the other room bid 1N-3@D//3N   that really won't make|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi Sveta.|pg||
nt|frankaus: looks likew ther bare 9|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: 2 diamond ruffs are availble|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: presumably Senior could have made immediate takeout noise [via 3@D?] so suspect delayed DBL is flawed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure that helps find PASS|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe, but he might have wanted to wait and see whether West was going to pass 3@d before acting over it - an immediate 3@d for takeout was not without risk|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sfoxa:  hello to all, nice to join you at this event|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  in prec, W would have bid 1nt - game forcing|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not in mine always 1@S|pg||
nt|andyv:  wonder why j@d was led over a @h lead|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kiwibridge: ?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|petergill: Who thinks that North should or might bid 3@H over 2@S?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a good partner would have balanced with 3@H - so he could go down instead of partner|pg||
pc|d2|nt|panja: hi all|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|jcwla: Perhaps a more std auction might be 1@C-1@S-2NT-3@C-3@D-3NT showing slam interest in opener's minor (@C), then E would be encouraged to go on.  Or 1@C-1@S-2NT-3@D(major ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: checkback)-3NT-4@C as a natural slam try.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: regardless of methods 6@C is about 110%|pg||

nt|alok_daga: another slam auction |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: So it was an excellent slam|pg||

mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: A good test of their methods |pg||
nt|alok_daga: 4dmnds=dmnd+spades?|pg||
nt|vugraphzys: S alerts 3C,but N didnt|pg||
nt|pelu: 2NT - 3@C for sure not naturel :)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I am sure 3@C is not natural :)|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 4 @d   is forcing @d  suit but could be with either major |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Some play that 3@H here shows 4+ - South may be wondering whether to bid his diamonds or check up on how many hearts partner has|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It was all rather trivial in the CR, as South opened.  Here, it's a more difficult auction|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Or it may be possible that North could still have 4 spades|pg||
nt|pelu: 6@D, 6@h and 6!nt all make|pg||
nt|cuttysark: So id does not matter what he does as long as he makes some sort of slam try :)|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|lebridgeur: light opening in South   11   including 3 Jacks|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Strange.... as a passed han South could surely afford a try|pg||

mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|sybarra: maybe transfer  I am told |pg||
mb|2H|nt|frankaus: pd opens 1st  seat have 21 green V red do i think its a psych?|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Previous hand: When South discards on the 3rd round of @h's, North is known to have 7 hearts, 3 clubs and thus only one diamond, so discarding a @D on that trick is good play. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: team lineups available at  http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest11/nec.html   then use link for "NEC Cup Teams & Players"|pg||
mb|2N|nt|panja: and now, 4@S is cold with no wastage in N hand opposite @C stiff..but they didn't seem to have a way to spot it|pg||
nt|sybarra: we are still looking for system cards |pg||
nt|fcarioca: Yes, since 1@D guarantees an unbalanced hand, 1NT must be transfer to @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 30 point pack as it happens for n/s with the lack of wasted in clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from 2010 Camrose Convention Card   1N=1NT shows clubs, 2@C=diamonds, 2@H=shows 4+ diamonds and 4 hearts 10-14|pg||
nt|ahollan1: URL to their CC  http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2010/ccards/hanlon-mcgann.pdf|pg||
nt|fcarioca: It became dangerous now, declarer must play on @C, not @d....|pg||
nt|andyv:  W planning to bid 5@d?|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|lestergold: and 4@s looks pretty cold|pg||
nt|petergill: If South invites with 3@S over 2@S, should North accept, with his useful-looking minimum?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hmm...this seemed to stop suddenly, I thought the 3@D rebid would get them there given E's beautiful complementary holding - whereas as you noted Andy 3@C might have stopped them.|pg||
mb|4D|nt|ahollan1: in previous years the web site had partnership convention cards, but i haven't found any for 2011 :(|pg||
nt|sybarra: this lead wont hurt declarer|pg||
nt|jcwla: Assuming of course 3@D here shows a suit and 3@C in the hypothetical other auction would have been a stiff.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: unleading Aces not for me|pg||
nt|andyv:  in either case, the 2 hands did not coordinate well together|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  Presumably they will discover a key card is missing at some point|pg||
nt|frankaus: depens on who my pd is :)|pg||
mb|4N!|mb|p|mb|5C!|mb|p|mb|6D|nt|dburn: well, it may limit the overtricks - it would have hurt a slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder why Senior tried slam investigation with 3N instead of 3@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|panja: not at MP, not at IMP fresh..so I guess through 3@S would not be a possible route|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kiwibridge: many stops every suit = 6N|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Lucky 10 imp gain for Australia on board 18|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|dburn: not sure about that - this is OK|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|chessmaste: North's hand is better than it looks - all the honours in long suits. |pg||

pc|sQ|pc|sJ|pg||

pc|c5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure if duck @D beats 4@S -- but winning @DA makes things much easier for declarer|pg||
nt|sybarra: is the restricted choice %?|pg||
nt|dburn: still, declarer may be able to use diamonds as substitute trumps|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: strong no trumpers will probably play this hand in 3@c|pg||
nt|panja: disc a @H then on the next @D|pg||

pc|h3|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  West has to lead a low diamond at some point or there is no guess|pg||
pc|c3|nt|dburn: but maybe declarer actually had to go after clubs|pg||
nt|dburn: and that was a very tough thing to do|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since East controls 4th round of @D -- seems like @H or small @C beats |pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|nt|andyv:  next|pg||

pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: other room in 10@H   same auction but Akio Kurok balanced with East hand|pg||

nt|alok_daga: true|pg||

nt|fcarioca: Easy 6 in a minor... But is 7 well bid?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mdgraham: +50 worth 48/66 for NS|pg||
mb|d!|nt|ahollan1: David - do you know how Brian likes to play 2@D?   is it @D & @H/@S or  @S + @C/@D [aspro]|pg||
nt|sybarra: sophisticated austion here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@H looks like pass/correct so probably 2@D=@D & @H/@S  [like dont]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=10-16 HCP, 6+@C or 5@C & 4@H/@S|pg||
nt|dburn: I guess if they would lead a heart, you might as well be in seven|pg||
nt|fcarioca: true|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it seemed to be making operator can you check please?|pg||
nt|jcwla: All for X over 1@S or anyone like 1NT?|pg||
mb|r|nt|petergill: so you can see there that 50 to NS was very good for NS on Bd 5|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 2@C Transfer|pg||
nt|lestergold: with both missing ks favourably placed 12 tricks are likely for e/w in either spades or no tgrumps the no trumps of course outscoring|pg||
mb|2D|nt|panja: this dbl risks a @C lead away from @CAx...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: four 720's already!|pg||
nt|lestergold: not surprising|pg||
nt|panja: on a small @H lead against 3Nt..|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes A@h gord to bed if not led|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  if you have to show 3-card fit - why shouldn't you?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|lestergold: i mean if not played on first hearty|pg||
nt|lestergold: one way or the other|pg||
nt|fcarioca: oh welll|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: it is hard to believe that 3@C does justice to a hand with 7-solid winners|pg||
nt|tejjyid: good hand for unusual 3NT really; West can then make a good decision|pg||
nt|fcarioca: 4NT by E for anyone?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: *gambling|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure that he could have done much about it - 2NT would show a maximum, but would run horrible risk of wrong-siding|pg||
nt|dburn: sure, he might have bid on over 3NT, but that would be mildly anarchic|pg||
nt|ahollan1: IMO -- part of the problem is including 5@C & 4@H/@S in the opening bid|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe the old ways are the best - 3NT-6@c|pg||
nt|fcarioca: It seems like there was an avalanche there...|pg||
nt|sybarra: going the wrong direction maybe|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I do prefer to play nt with E hand, too, but my first responsibility is to obey the system|pg||
nt|andyv:  this auction seems to be going counter to modern bidding where the idea is to give as little info as possible|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, the question is whether X is "mandatory" even if you do play the X as three-card, or are there hand types where it's not required.|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS can just about tell that W is a 1-4-4-4 pattern already|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think it's mandatory but do be ready for your list of excuses to partner|pg||
nt|jcwla: Here there may be another reason to prefer X in that if pd happens to scrape up NT with a combining card likely better from their side.|pg||
nt|andyv:  the A10 would argue that either side is ok in NT if W has a card in the @s suit|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  exactly. if partner denies to repeat (weak) 5-card-suit and you finishi in nt game instead of suit one|pg||
nt|andyv:  meanwhile, 3@c seems to have stumped N|pg||
nt|jcwla: In any case there can't be much more to this auction, can there?|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|panja: 2@C should have been artificial..marked..looks like a Drury|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Not quite, but North must not duck a heart at any point|pg||
nt|sybarra: suprised no sac from Brian?  likely to "see" no hts in pards hand |pg||
nt|ahollan1: spec asked, so i'll mention  3N opening = normal 4@C/@D preempt  [i.e. NOT Gambling]|pg||
nt|andyv:  he should be able to infer from bidding that the 3 level is too high|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it's unfathomable why they haven't updated the rd 2 results yet :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 690 on club lead (unless Andrew Robson can sneak a heart past the ace)  or 720 on heart lead|pg||
nt|jcwla: Invited to click here for results: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest11/nec.html  |pg||
nt|andyv:  lucky for the declarer that the @h suit sits as well as possible|pg||
pc|h4|nt|panja: unlikely North will duck a @H now...|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|nt|lestergold: by notm leading a heart n/s should earn a top|pg||
nt|panja: seeing all the @D in Dummy..and knowing @S finesse is working|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Diamond to the queen, spade to the queen, low heart|pg||
nt|lestergold: after the next two tricks North will know not to duck a heart|pg||
nt|lestergold: he should be able then to virtually count declarer for 13 tricks if the heart is ducked|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes I have refreshed it many many times|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Its not Mike Lawrence|pg||
nt|panja: a low Heart right away will lead to a duck..but which West will want to do that after the Club lead?|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|lestergold: no way hose|pg||
nt|petergill: 690 would give EW about 75% of the matchpoints|pg||
nt|lestergold: u mean n/w i think|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s|pg||
nt|panja: also...either of @D or @S might have been ducked...so an early play of @H is unlikely..|pg||
nt|petergill: No, I mean EW|pg||
nt|petergill: Lots of 680's|pg||
nt|ahollan1: minor suit holdings are ugly for offense|pg||
nt|sybarra: true,  and little defense for a ht slam also|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and 5-over-5 is a no-no according to Ed Manfield|pg||
nt|sybarra: there is, however Brian doesnt know that |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|petergill: and some 650's|pg||

nt|lestergold: 4!n puts the pressure on its nop a guiessing game at hiogh level|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 6@S not unreasonable on the North hand now - you can throw science out the window after the 4NT bid|pg||
nt|bg: ok seems system still lacks something to show E hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S limited by failure to open 1@C,  could be 4@S with longer @C/@D|pg||
nt|dburn: close for North now - might bid 4@c if that showed a fit, or might just bid 4@s to take up room|pg||

nt|Walddk4: total 47,140 GBP paid back of the 51,150|pg||
nt|panja: 7@C is a 50% bid now....|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually  1@S could be 4@S & 5+@H  [i didn't study the system because forgot NS would be playing it this week :( ]|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: i thionk it must say i can ruff something|pg||
nt|mdgraham: just what South expected....comes back to him at the 7-level|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|sybarra: afraid I would have been more pedestrian about it |pg||
nt|dburn: or might, I suppose, bid 2NT, which seems to have had the effect of a minor avalanche|pg||
mb|1H|nt|petergill: But East could not see a 2nd trick, hence no Lightner Dbl|pg||
mb|d!|nt|lestergold: Robson has to double and take his plus now|pg||
nt|othered1: north now knows of @C duplication because of south's pass showing first round @C control|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh opted for a forcing pass shopwing club control|pg||
nt|petergill: South's Pass of 7@C should show 1st round club control, which South has. |pg||
nt|fcarioca: But 5 @H or @S ????|pg||
nt|dburn: but only temporarily - East lurking in the bushes|pg||
nt|dburn: poker now, not bridge - and Hanlon is a pretty good poker player; not sure about Verhees|pg||
nt|fcarioca: Interesting hand, nobody knows who is saving|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room just finished playing  21 [our 3@D+1]     3@S North -100   6 imps to NEDUK|pg||
nt|fcarioca: Everybody ashamed of earlier bids !:|pg||
nt|dburn: well, West seems to have what he bid (though McGann may be ashamed of that on general principles)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: It's useful to have bids other than 4@S to express an opinion about the 5 level|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2@S made on board  operator can we get that corrected please|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 5|pg||
nt|frankaus: S may regret the reopening|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: alfrey does not like that as he also has a club control|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mdgraham: pass possibly requested double|pg||
nt|andyv:  already up Gary|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: now they my reac 4@S|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I doubt they will reach 4@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: there's a 5@sxx-3 - 1600 EW|pg||
nt|panja: at IMPS, 7@C is a clear bid....you don't want to risk -1430..at MPs, 7@C bid will probably get you close to Top or Bottom|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS +500 is 54/66 at the moment|pg||
nt|sybarra: headed to 3 nt here|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think Meckwell have something like this; then 4@S says "I'm bidding this without expectation"|pg||
nt|fcarioca: Incredible NS decisions, very good|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: excellent just done :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Maybe 2 @S...|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-15 HCP, 0+@D    i believe 2@D=Game Force, 5+@D|pg||
nt|dburn: opinion updated - Verhees obviously very good poker player|pg||
nt|fcarioca: LOL|pg||
nt|andyv:  good brakes on this hand|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bg: the x double may even get him a heart trick|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  South not giving up|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: E should raise now|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|fcarioca: exactly|pg||
nt|dburn: odd sort of decision now for McGann - should he finesse in hearts, hoping that 4@s was making?|pg||
nt|sybarra: k was for count? |pg||
nt|fcarioca: I think he MUST finesse, cause otherwise 4@s would not make, making the board already a bad one...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very common to use King for Count at high level  where need to cashout is so important   and lead of unsupported Ace more common|pg||
nt|fcarioca: He must justify the save...|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: i do not see why east bid 7@c he has a definite trick if partner can be encouraged to lead a club and pard i pretty likely to have a trci kin defence with a vul 4N bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  East: 3 @C|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kiwibridge: yes even better|pg||
nt|frankaus: red light shining|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sfoxa:  but even this will cost S -200 or -300 all in all|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: as u say this is mps and odds are that 6@s is overboard and its odds u play with not worry about 1430 etc|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|dburn: unclear - he could assume that the bidding at the other table will be 1@s-2@h-4@s-5@h etc|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: this hand more interesting at a different form of scoring|pg||
nt|sybarra: like BAM or MP |pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|chessmaste: You mean a diamond lead, not a club|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes of  ocurse|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry|pg||
nt|mdgraham: defence to 6@s could be cute - @hA lead and J by East |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: should have riased 1 to 2 at least|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  To get 200 the defence have to lead hearts to avoid the endplay|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: point is that there is no such thing as insurance at mps|pg||

pc|c4|pg||

mb|3C|nt|fcarioca: After finding the missing @SQ, they will stop at 6|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: not Flannery like at all -- can 44/55 or longer in Either suit  and always a weak hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: in other parts of Europe, they use 2 @C as weak both majors |pg||
nt|sybarra: can be any shape in the majors|pg||
nt|dburn: not 2@c often - either 2@d or 2@h for that purpose|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: @C lead :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: interesting, tempo-losing lead|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@c can be weak with both majors as part of a Multi structure, but that is mostly confined to Iceland|pg||

nt|dburn: and 15 on a spade lead, I suppose|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|petergill: Andrew Robson's unexpected @S lead is based on the idea that East lacks spades and has heart stops, I guess|pg||
nt|dburn: this is an OK slam, though - Roland would scorn it; far too good for him|pg||
nt|fcarioca: Thos hand wont take 30 seconds...|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Roland would bid the grand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a convention that seems to be on the rise -- after partner preempts  Key Card responses are  0/1 no Q/1+Q/2 no Q/2+Q|pg||

nt|petergill: -400 is 37 for NS and 29 for EW|pg||
nt|panja: could have made 10 tricks with an endplay in @H, S was unlikely to hold @DK..|pg||

nt|fcarioca: Another Roland's grand...|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: this 1@C=11-13 balanced variety     but it is Forcing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope -- Hanlon's 1@C|pg||
mb|2N|nt|sybarra: shall we just bid 4 nt?|pg||
nt|sybarra: get on with it?|pg||
nt|fcarioca: An old fashioned 2@D would work well here|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: I think NS play Polish Club|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Usually the best defence in that situation would be to discard down to singleton king of spades, but East had too many spades for that to work|pg||
mb|3C|nt|sybarra: doubt the play that |pg||
nt|fcarioca: me too|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this won't go far|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|jcwla: X|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: they have had many good results together but this event is n ot one of them sadly with a field bristling with many of the great names in the bridge world this is not latogether ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: unexpected|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|petergill: 3@S seems to be a request to play 3NT from partner's side|pg||
nt|lestergold: and this will be very unfortunate for e/w not likely to find the winning lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: so this is transfer maybe?|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@s is an old-fashioned 2@d|pg||
nt|fcarioca: dunno|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: and i suspect many mps fo0r n/s|pg||
nt|andyv:  your predictions are better than mine, Gary|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Lead against 6 @S???|pg||
mb|4N|nt|sybarra: landing in 2 @S here |pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  8  3N South after no bidding from EW |pg||
nt|sybarra: or is S more ambitious?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kyoko won't stop|pg||
nt|dburn: no - 2@s is strong, balanced or with one minor|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D is limited 8-13 HCP  so    2@S=a) 19-21 BAL  b) FG, 1-suit @C/@D|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: A@D|pg||
mb|5H!|nt|lestergold: for a start not all pairs will even play in game and of course west on lead a @s defeats it our of hand|pg||
nt|petergill: In the Betting Market at http://2011pairsprices.yolasite.com/, Gold - Dunn were a 44-1 chance and NS 133-1. |pg||
nt|sybarra: come on mr. avalanche,  go for it!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N was forced|pg||
nt|fcarioca: well, at least 6@d they'll reach now|pg||
nt|sybarra: n/s might feel they sat the wrong direction in tems of cards,  just glad they are not playng rubber bridge|pg||
nt|dburn: sure, but this may be another example of the five-or-seven business|pg||
nt|dburn: though I guess 6NT by East (or six diamonds) is actually cold|pg||
nt|fcarioca: Isn't 7@d cold?|pg||
nt|dburn: yes, but only with the spade finesse|pg||
nt|fcarioca: hooking the @s K, of course|pg||
nt|jcwla: And mine...W seems ripe for a reopening X.|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|nt|ahollan1: unless you meant 4@S  Shirl :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: dashing into 4 @S might hand been better |pg||
nt|fcarioca: Again, after @h lead, they might be at 7 as well...|pg||
nt|dburn: played by West on a heart lead, you would rather be in seven than five, and you would not want to be in six|pg||
nt|sybarra: does W cue the hts? or pass?|pg||
nt|fcarioca: Never passing|pg||
nt|sybarra: or just bid 6 @D?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: pass is the disciplined bid|pg||
nt|dburn: well, East's bidding has been a bit more discouraging than I would have thought|pg||
nt|sybarra: he is in the dark|pg||
nt|fcarioca: @H cue looking for @s cue seems right|pg||
nt|tejjyid: East has failed to cue, they can eaily miss 2 @S tricks |pg||
nt|dburn: 2NT was more or less forced, but 4@s over 4@d was possible|pg||
nt|sybarra: but if no spade cue, he is overboard|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: why blast -- AAK makes great slam|pg||
nt|jcwla: E could bid 3@C to show five - then we have competed reasonably and que sera sera.|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: NS is Jacek Sikora and Jon Vos|pg||
nt|othered1: Weak NT openers may push the board, but I don't like EW's position in spite of that|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hawe45:  WELL done|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sybarra: ok the simple way out|pg||
nt|fcarioca: Without the @s cue, he could stop at 5NT, hoping for the @SJ at E|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i like David's idea of 4@D-4@S  of course we really don't know what 3N showed [just guessing any 11-13 BAL]|pg||
nt|dburn: still, if East didn't have anything at all in spades, he might have bid 4@h - after all, he must have something|pg||
nt|sybarra: 24 in 6 @S was a push|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think the vul kept EW quiet.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|dburn: so West has decided to play East for some spread-out minimum, which is what East has got|pg||
nt|fcarioca: I swear I would've led a spade also...|pg||
nt|dburn: but he probably should have opted for 6NT in that case, and not six diamonds|pg||
nt|fcarioca: This hand will lats 15 seconds...|pg||
nt|fcarioca: *last|pg||
nt|dburn: well, that spade lead will save the overtrick|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think 10 of @H's from the tenace looks better doesnt it?  (not that is matters)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sybarra: true, and why miss 7 if pard had a real (rock crusher) opening bi|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other table will start with Precision 2@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: *bid|pg||
pc|d6|nt|fcarioca: Going up with the Ace seems right|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: right   South hand can't be assessed using HCP -- it has 4 losers and opener can easily cover 3 of them even after minimum 2@C rebid|pg||
nt|jcwla: Unfortunately NS aren't not playing an 8-card fit at the 2 level just b/c we're vul.  If you'll pardon the dbl neg.|pg||

pc|sA|nt|lestergold: and delighted to i am sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @C lead on this auction sure seems strange|pg||
nt|sybarra: I always call it that "damned doubleton lead" |pg||
nt|sybarra: often tunnels the defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe if NOT holding @HA|pg||
nt|bigtrain: @C lead turns out to be a winner if E then cashes the @DA and plays a heart...  declarer can only come to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahhh  if East cashed @DA then shifted to @H -- defense can prevail|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thx Walter!!|pg||

mb|4C|mb|p|nt|alok_daga: as Bill aptly put it bad 2 worse|pg||

nt|pelu: 2@D or 2@S sh be the bid|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|lebridgeur: to prevent that   I play   transfer splinter   1 @s  4 @d   for shortness in @h   and 3 Nt for short @c   of course an Allzheimer  convention !|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, whatever you say about the N/S auction here, it's a model of excellence compared to the CR|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 1M-3NT-Pass is the modern equivalent of 1S-4H pass - and not just by Seniors!|pg||

nt|mdgraham: marginal - can't tell that a spade lead is going to be best |pg||

nt|fcarioca: Very good decisions EW here...|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes at imps its a serious risk not at mps|pg||
nt|petergill: NS play Polish Club|pg||

pc|sT|nt|chessmaste: Nasty lead for East|pg||
nt|lestergold: all leads help declarer one way or teh other|pg||
nt|panja: y, but NS seem to have lost a lot in the bidding|pg||
nt|petergill: Previous Board: Rdbl and make 3@SXX whenever North has four spades - perhaps Dbl of 3@S is easier to find in hindsight?|pg||
nt|chessmaste: A low spade was probably best, but not easy to find|pg||
pc|s8|nt|andyv:  I know you would have, Jordan|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: 3@D is Game Force|pg||
nt|dburn: well, maybe - I would not back even Hanlon to get spades right if Verhees had passed|pg||
nt|fcarioca: sure|pg||
nt|sybarra: what does Verhees lead v 4 sp X?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hard to accept "good save" when their counterparts score +660 in 3N   but it is better than double game swing|pg||
nt|dburn: besides which, if Verhees had passed he would have led the queen of hearts, and nothing could have saved Hanlon then|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Shirley asks good questino -- after @D lead, does defense prevail??|pg||
nt|fcarioca: Anybody backing N's double?|pg||

nt|panja: about 20% NS pairs should be in game on this one?|pg||
nt|petergill: So far about 3 or 4 NS's in game|pg||
nt|lestergold: 9 tricks certainly pretty guiaranteed on the lead|pg||
nt|othered1: quite pyshy game, so percent about right|pg||
nt|othered1: pushy|pg||
nt|petergill: and a few large penalties when NS chose to penalize the t/o doubler|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 180 is average|pg||
nt|panja: right..I thought a redbl by S, instead of 1@S? anyone for that?|pg||
nt|petergill: Tony Forrester (Eng) and David Herman (USA) have taken the lead in the event. |pg||
nt|lestergold: too strong for an immediate 1@s must tell partner whose hand it is|pg||
nt|jcwla: Thanks for nothing, pd.|pg||
nt|andyv:  but, pd is a passed hand... no reason to believe 1@s may not go for a number|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No - they  will NEVER forget it|pg||
pc|d8|nt|othered1: redouble then @S bid is forcing and I'm not sure south will  have enough control later|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: splinter|pg||
pc|dA|nt|panja: well, if 3S x Xx makes, it is only 0% score..as against the 5-8% you got just now on a wrong lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: yyes peter a great risk at imps but at mps the greater risk is that paertner will not lead a spade if u dont so i am inclined to agree with PraKASH|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Declarer will make a lot of tricks on this one|pg||

nt|cuttysark: It is only human to produce a couple of errors in 15 boards - you just hope they wil not produce the sort of double figure swings we have seen here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: I suspect South had a long think about how to proceed, decided to sig off - and passed. That's how it usually works|pg||

nt|andyv:  this can't be good ... S needed to play K@d and let N over take, play 2nd @d and finally trump coup|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: colour me skeptical about 13 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Previous hand: With both E and W being passed hands, perhaps looking for vulnerable penalties on the S hand was a good idea. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H opening includes 5@S & 5@H   could also be 4@H & 5+@C/@D|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: wow the hopeless 3N made 2 overtricks to give all stars 12 imps|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 17+ bal|pg||
nt|fcarioca: Not very friendly @s game here...|pg||

nt|andyv:  3N has been the saving grace of the Bulgarian team|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes, after @s lead|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lestergold: combined 33 e/w the field will play this in 6N|pg||
nt|petergill: prev bd: Rdbl then bid spades would be by a passed hand, hence not forcing|pg||
nt|panja: 6Nt might not be easy to make here..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=0-7|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|lestergold: but the 12th trick in 6N looks elusive|pg||
nt|othered1: I'll stand corrected on redouble -- looks good in this context|pg||
nt|panja: althought I see a possibility of 12th trick..on run of 3@H and 4@C..S might have to bare his @DJ|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D looks like a "mini-multi", one long major, very weak hand|pg||
nt|petergill: Rdbl looks like a psyche|pg||
nt|lestergold: prssure play and good card reading may be needed to bring in 6N my feeling is that it will fail at most tables|pg||
nt|petergill: 4NT quantitative|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  They are playing pretty fast. Great job by the operator to keep up.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=Game Force Relay  2@H=5+@S|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|sybarra: I think we have all been in worse games however|pg||
nt|sybarra: we may hear 3 nt from N|pg||
nt|fcarioca: I meant the lay of the cards...|pg||
nt|andyv:  only 8 tricks in NT|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Vugraph operator is the toughest job in bridge - even harder than being dummy opposite a beginner|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|othered1: and 5@D, s howing aces to accept?|pg||
nt|panja: seems like that|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if you do want to accept a 4NT try, not a bad idea to show aces....just in case|pg||
nt|petergill: Thomas Charlsen came 2nd in this event last year. |pg||
nt|lestergold: most will  play this from west hand as not everyone bids with two js on south at equal vul|pg||
nt|othered1: I play that if 4N is 100 percent clearly quantitative|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: a make only double dummy if at all..E is far more likely to play S for @DK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think 3@D non-forcing but VERY encouraging -- and denies 4@H/@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: will make them all|pg||
nt|fcarioca: But it will make|pg||

nt|fcarioca: Played by N even easier|pg||
nt|fcarioca: No @h lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@s should go down 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: first result is in - 6N-1 |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: right Shirl -- THIS 13 tricks i'll believe |pg||
nt|dburn: surprised at the actual lead - would have led a club myself, but probably not much difference|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i assume 3@H showed exactly 5=5=2=1  that would explain non-@C lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: probably the only other choice is @S4  [yuk]|pg||
nt|fcarioca: Your @c lead could mud the waters, declarer could try @d discards...|pg||
pc|sT|nt|dburn: not sure about that - 3@d forcing in most versions of Precision I know|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  After South's very light opening they did well to reach the best game|pg||
pc|sK|nt|dburn: well, it might explain it - with a stiff spade, though, you could just lead a long suit and hope to tap declarer|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: as will !5C man overboard|pg||
nt|andyv:  this may have a play without @d lead|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  It only needs hearts 4-2 and has some chances even if not|pg||
pc|s4|nt|fcarioca: Now I guess there's no losing line|pg||

nt|andyv:  S helping EW avoid the 4-4 @s fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D could have been 4@D & 5+@C or @S|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|dburn: but even if 3NT shows a good four of a major bid, I am not sure I would open that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N looks like Kantar -- solid Major|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: many thanks Sveta Jordan and Andy and our great operator, to Akito Omasa from the JCBL and our spnsor NEC, BBO and Roland Wald and all you great kibitzers|pg||
mb|2D|nt|petergill: Gad Chadha and Graham Orsmond are in 27th place out of 68|pg||
nt|petergill: Well bid to 4@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in balanced hand 1@D=2+@D|pg||
nt|fcarioca: @dA first or small first?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  ty Gary and ty all who joined us for a very entertaining match.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: after our next board there is a very short break and we'll be back with round 4 in 40 minutes from now|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: 4@H south in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: not all chopped liver|pg||
nt|petergill: NS in 11th place|pg||
nt|jcwla: Thx Andy, Gary, Sveta, Roland and all.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: We'd like to thank Murakami our excellent operator, Frank, Nigel and Hans great commentary, the JCBL and BBO for enabling this broadcast, NEC for their great sponsorship, and you ...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the fans for your great feedback|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: two more gruelling days of this swiss to go|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: @S lead looks normal -- and shows why Kyoko transfers to North|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: or maybe 4@C said  transfer to your suit   ala Multi|pg||
nt|sybarra: little does he know |pg||
nt|sybarra: easy from here to call small  but at table ..... |pg||
nt|fcarioca: true|pg||
nt|sybarra: if @D behave  |pg||
nt|fcarioca: If E plays a @s now, it can be doomed|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: @S uncomfortable for declarer - how does he get back to dummy to play @D?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest11/nec.html for results, and don't forget to check the fabulous daily bulletins they really are extraordinary|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kiwibridge: great tight match which probably see both teams plummet in the standing order|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: the fourth club needs gto be taken care off presumably spades will be set up|pg||
nt|fcarioca: I dont thonk declarer will make it|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: well done -- duck seems safest even if East does win @SQ|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  tnx to all - enjoyed great party|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 13 to Trinergy on the failing slam|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Strange auction from North but seems to have worked|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d8|nt|fcarioca: Now @h are open too|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: always tough when 1 plays 2|pg||
nt|jcwla: So often new players will cover that @HJ there - newer players, before you cover that honor, ask what could declarer possibly gain if I don't?  Here: nothing.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: sadly the round results are still very slow in coming through|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cJ|nt|dburn: even four wasn't cold, though admittedly would have been a bit unlucky not to make|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: NOW he's got it -- set up @H - but they split kindly|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: needs the majors to behave well and they do|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|lestergold: not everone will reach tis game|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the result from 26 should put Oz back in the lead|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|pc|s7|pc|sT|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  28 is a possible pickup for Australia as well|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed, they still many to play|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|nigel_k:  We have played 13 hands in just over an hour so will finish before seeing all the comparisons|pg||

nt|mdgraham: Almost the end now, so time for a few words of thanks: to our excellent operator Dorota Krzyzaniak, to the TGR Bridge Club and organiser Marilyn Malinowska, and tournament director ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Slawek Latala. Tomas Brenning was responsible for the excellent scoring. |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it was 15 for the blunder|pg||
mb|1C|nt|sybarra: so I think this is last hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: too late hee for me to count|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=strong, 16+ unbal, 18+ bal|pg||
nt|sybarra: and another roland grand |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and a @H game for EW to finish|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: didnt we also make 6?|pg||
nt|fcarioca: That's not a Roland, there are 2 @d pitches on the @ss...|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|mdgraham: Thanks also to Peter Gill (Australia), Prakash Paranjape, Mark Horton, and Mike Gold (England), and Ed Shapiro (USA), for commentary. I am Mike Graham (England). Also thanks to all ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: spectators for some useful and perceptive comments. Restart is at 13:30 pm local time. |pg||
nt|petergill: so the Norwegians will move into the top ten after Bd 13|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another big 1@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and negative 1@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: right way too good|pg||
nt|fcarioca: That´s a good one|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=@S|pg||
nt|andyv:  only one thing wrong with 6@h..... the W hand|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: pass or correct I presume|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and N has a problem|pg||
nt|andyv:  all problems start with a dbl|pg||
nt|jcwla: Wow, interesting.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sybarra: last hand (we think) |pg||
nt|andyv:  that's stalling for time|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes pass it to pard|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lestergold: e/w have a good save in @s here against n/s heart contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and 2nd round scheduled to begin in about 35 minutes|pg||
nt|sybarra: we thank our excellent operator Murakami, :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we don't know which match will be on vugraph next set|pg||
nt|sybarra: 7:20 pm Los Angeles, 10:20 pm New York, 04.20 Tuesday Paris, 3:20 am Tuesday London, 2:20 pm Tuesday Sydney is schedule|pg||
nt|andyv:  so 2@s was polish style|pg||
mb|4S|nt|kiwibridge: 2@H described as weak|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 5@h is cold but 5@sx only costs 300|pg||
nt|petergill: Ew silent for now, might miss the 4@s save|pg||
nt|ahollan1: outside of my notes now   i thought 2@H=Nat, Game Force|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: personally i think Chadha should have barraged witgh 3@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: East might have bid a weak 3@S bid over 2@H, if systemically available|pg||
nt|sybarra: are we blasting? or 4 nt now perhaps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D would have been the response without interference|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  one more trap for N - this time partner can pass his dbl|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2 suiter @S and minor gazilli?|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like it|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  sometimes it wouldn't be good decision|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: good guess me thx operator :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|dburn: good lead at the other table|pg||
nt|dburn: might be found at this one also, of course|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jcwla: Then the double creates its own problems.  N has had nice sequence and S will surely bid 4@H here, there it is.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: surely m ust be|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|fcarioca: It seems like the @s overcall turn grand hopes at S...|pg||
nt|fcarioca: *turned down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good shot -- and nice having South declarer|pg||
pc|s8|nt|petergill: and West might have doubled 3@S, to suggest a 4@s save|pg||
nt|sybarra: and down off the top  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: for only our 2nd push of the set|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and the axe, we call them weak tartans in NZ but they do work|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  S is aware of @h behind him|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lestergold: im sxurp[rised because Chadha is not known for his shyness at the table|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|fcarioca: Bye all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H to King?|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx again to all |pg||
