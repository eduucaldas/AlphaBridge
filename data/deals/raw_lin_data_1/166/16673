nt|fabsayc: hi to all the new commentators|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: prediction 2-NS will get too high|pg||
mb|1D|mb|d|nt|othered1: What's east's 1@C?|pg||
nt|othered1: From south's 2@C bid, I might infer it's a big @C|pg||
nt|bg: not sure but is normal start for a 2nnt rebid|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2H|nt|fabsayc: might even land in wrong suit|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I can tell you the McGann in the OR is indeed in 3N and looks like making so it could be 1st blood to Hackett|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3H|nt|kiwibridge: 6@D ? asks a kibitzer|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - on this board?...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes|pg||
nt|saverio: NS could take 11 tricks in 5@d here     another "not easy to find" game  |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'd prefer 2@C over the X|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|saverio: 6@d should be off on a @s lead  even if it is a though lead|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|bg: it was 16+|pg||
nt|othered1: looks like a normal big @C auction, with 2@S showing a limited positive response.|pg||
nt|othered1: ty operator|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: in the other room West raised to 5@C|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 3N made on 1 for 6 imps|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: i might be tempted to do so too.|pg||
nt|xenya: makes sense, considering the vulnerability |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: with the west hand... 7 points in partners preemt might not produce a single trick|pg||
nt|xenya: putting maximum pressure on NS|pg||
mb|5D|nt|bg: same result in other room on board 1|pg||
nt|othered1: the overcall does give west some useful information|pg||
nt|fabsayc: are you prepared to bid 7 if opponents reach slam, because that often happens with these extreme preempts|pg||
nt|xenya: spades behave, in a sense, so declarer can get out for -1|pg||
nt|saverio: do you agree on S 3NT?    |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|saverio: wd by N to move from 3NT anyway|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|kiwibridge: indeed the stiff A@H didn't look that great|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|pc|dA|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hawe45:  MY partner(s) doÂ´nt open 3 @C|pg||
nt|saverio: i think i'd pass 3NT as N   (i'd expect something like AQ for that bid)|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: me either but then that is the crux of how high to preempt|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||

nt|odysseus69: is 4H too much now? is it a splinter?|pg||
mb|d|mb|r|nt|pelu: Hackett i Cr open in S with 2@H!! -  and NS in 5@HX - is S Justin or Jason?|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: North still there - now they will go to 5H at least|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Justin I think Peter|pg||

nt|bg: 13 tricks on top here|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: these weak 2 suiters do crowd the auction|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: The longer north keeps this off of a quantitative NT track, the better for NS.|pg||
nt|othered1: it's possible north has no *descriptive* forcing bid at this point|pg||
nt|super nova: I prefer 5@c by Ohno|pg||
nt|super nova: Since it says I also have @D support|pg||
mb|5H|mb|d|nt|bg: would you rebid three clubs here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bg: Taipei + 620 in other room|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Bedst to be said about 5 @H: even 4 @H is no winner...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Papa was there|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: I don't hate 2@C rebid, but I think it would be nice to have methods that didn't require me to balckwood on north hand, though maybe it will work out.  7th @C, as yet unbid, is key ...|pg||
nt|othered1: and north can't count it.|pg||
nt|bg: the seventh club is the elusive trick not to mention dia Q|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Another good move from Hac-Hac|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 6@C has good chances |pg||
pc|s8|nt|saverio: true but here we need to give credit to 2@h opening|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kiwibridge: Bulgaria are 2nd and Hackett are 6th at this time|pg||
pc|sK|nt|othered1: That's an effort you'd see in many duplicate clubs.|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|xenya: the auction in the other room was completely different -- S chose to preempt in 1st seat|pg||
pc|dK|nt|saverio: not easy to get to slam after 2@h/3@c/4@h...  a lot of space wasted and no more room to investigate|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|pc|d7|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s6|nt|kiwibridge: a smelly lead not a good idea to finesse|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s2|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|pc|dA|nt|fabsayc: 4@H may have been intended to push opponents to a phantom, but west did not get the plot, a lot to be said for bidding 2s with east hand|pg||

nt|odysseus69: very unlucky contract - dont know whether bidding was good or lucky- could North have had stronger hearts and weaker iamonds|pg||

nt|sybarra: glad you can keep this score|pg||
nt|bg: some players use 3 club rebid to show extra length plus a partial heart fit|pg||
nt|othered1: I can contrive an auction where south would be asking and might be able to find both red kings.  But everything has to go right|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|hawe45:  Difficult now - how find 5 @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: the auction has died in a mere 3@H OR so a plus for Bulgaria|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|sybarra: quite some interesting teams |pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: That's a 16-19 rebid|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: this is pushing it|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|xenya: what's your prediction on this one, Martin?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I the good old days, North had "taken the money against 2 @C D!"|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I only see two losers in 5 @D? But how many tricks...|pg||
nt|saverio: after the 2@h opening in the earlier board we can understand why N opened 1@h here     though it is not my style since i prefer sounds openings and overcalls....:)|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|othered1: and I guess east is making a game try|pg||
nt|xenya: tough hand for NS|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5@D is down after 2 rounds of clubs|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: if South has soft values in the majors 3 nt may be right.. but i guess he will bid 5@D|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: and the @Da ofcourse|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: the -500 cost 12 imps|pg||
nt|saverio: if def wont play 1 round of trump i think 5@d can be made    so they need E to win @h and shift to @d    which is not easy at all|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c5|nt|othered1: all east needs to do is guess everything right but that lead is gonna prevail|pg||

pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|c7|pc|s5|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Even the @D 2 would do |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: west has to perforce continue @C after seeing the major holding in dummy|pg||
