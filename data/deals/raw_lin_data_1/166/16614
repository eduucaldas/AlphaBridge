nt|andersk: id 3 NT now|pg||
mb|2S|nt|andersk: NS wont bid 3 NT now|pg||
mb|p|nt|kskov: 8 tricks in spades seems to be the limit, 10 tricks in minors EW|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 2@D =  11 + invitational to game in @S|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sarkar_suk: in 5 @C @SJ will play a vital role:)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: support @S|pg||
nt|sommer:  hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|disa: are N-S playing a weak NT?|pg||
nt|andersk: Yes thats correct|pg||
mb|4S|nt|andyv:  good discipline by S not to get carried away with his 6 card suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|disa: in 5C S goes on the heart|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Hi Polv|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Polv|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: N goes even S denided to go to Game|pg||
nt|andyv:  N however has no such problem|pg||
nt|kskov: difficult to double this, ew might end up in a phantom save|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: W has the last call :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: We saw a 13p 1 NT opening privious round|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: no, because when you play @h's towards KQx, you will either avoid 1 @h loser or 2 @s loosers|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: prudently passed out|pg||
nt|kskov: well, he bid 4@d, so he probably felt he had done enough|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|d3|nt|sarkar_suk: they r playing precession probably :)|pg||

nt|georgia19: evening Mike|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sarkar_suk: cold contract now :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 2 down for 200 for E-W|pg||
pc|d9|nt|bvdahl: was always cold|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sarkar_suk: correct|pg||
nt|sommer:  200 seems ok|pg||

mc|10|nt|jameslee 2: comes round for finesse or will claim -2 |pg||
nt|andyv:  hard for EW to calculate what 4@s dbld would do... if it only makes 4 and there's reason to believe you can set it 2, then risk is worth it|pg||

mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|petepunt: need to guess @C right , |pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|nicksan: Or, assuming a heart lead, eliminate and play Ace and another diamond for a finesse - North would be endplayed|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petepunt: enough entries to lead @C twice to A10x ?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jbgood: and return a small club - 8 or 10?|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: would be a nice call !|pg||

nt|disa: you have 2 diamond losers|pg||
nt|andersk: @C 8 in North prevents the squeeze|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: today there are much more hands openning NT |pg||
mb|2N|nt|lestergold: 6@s will surely be bid however there is duplication here and may be hard to avoid loss of two minor suit tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|jameslee 2: not only 4.3.3.3  / 4.4.3.2 / 5.3.3.2   but also 6.3.2.2  / 5.4.2.2|pg||

mb|4N|mb|p|nt|jameslee 2: playing with a 4/2 trumps :(|pg||
nt|georgia19: it's hard for us to say how they SHOULD play, when we can see that it fails...|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@s c9mbined 32 9 card fit and all the controls etc and yet its not a very good contract|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|bvdahl: and it woun't e difficult discards since declearer must play 3 x @h's before trying for a squeeze|pg||

nt|georgia19: has he shown 5 keys + trumpQ?|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|nt|lestergold: it will be intyeresting to see what one of the world's very greatest card players makes of it|pg||

mb|p|nt|georgia19: predict the lead?|pg||

nt|georgia19: an easy grand slam to make|pg||
nt|dburn: but even if the defence hadn't given him an entry with @s10, he could have put South in with the fourth spade to take a red-suit finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: sure the interest is in tyhe bidding|pg||
nt|georgia19: good hand for splinters and key card blackwood|pg||
nt|dburn: if North can show his singleton club, then Blackwood and a king-ask ought to do the rest|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lestergold: one of those hands where it is easy to identify possesion of fit and controls but counting 13 tricks in the bidding is not always sttraightforward|pg||
mb|p|nt|jameslee 2: just a 1@S call without no more bids |pg||

mb|4N|mb|p|nt|andersk: I would snap pass, and hope EW balances:)|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|jameslee 2: defence try  to incomunicate so he does K@H |pg||
nt|kareno: Love to know what 3nt meant.  Perhaps some undisclosed singleton?  Spade singleton?|pg||
nt|georgia19: if South doesn't know about the singleton he will stop in 6|pg||
mb|6H|nt|bvdahl: yes, I am always wondering why people don't do it more often with 8 HCP's against strong NT's and 11 like here....|pg||
nt|bvdahl: Perticularly these days when players seems eager to balance in all positions|pg||
nt|andersk: Since North have 4432 and 4 card spades, I have to agree with 2 club|pg||
nt|bvdahl: sure, but in general...|pg||
nt|andersk: we probably make 8 tricks or better in NT|pg||
nt|disa: well the way meckstroth explaines it with 11 you always go because the other table playing 15-17 will invite and now 13 is a max and even if you only have 23 points they still have ...|pg||
nt|disa: to beat you|pg||
nt|bvdahl: maybe I have played too much poker, and like to get my check raises in at the brigdge table as well :)|pg||
nt|andersk: cheek raises in bridge is common:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|disa: i know them well|pg||

nt|lestergold: as i feared |pg||
pc|s3|nt|jameslee 2: let,s dummy brake comunications |pg||

pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|georgia19: 1@H - 4@C would make it easy|pg||

pc|cA|nt|andersk: had to run the Q|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|georgia19: maybe just a cue bid|pg||
nt|kareno: A little heavy for a splinter as I play.  |pg||
nt|dburn: and North did bid 4@s, above game on his own|pg||
nt|lestergold: problem is we do not know esactly what some of their bids meant|pg||
mc|13|nt|dburn: nor did they, by the look of things - good chance for Hauge there|pg||
nt|vugraphzzh: N told E that 3nt was spade|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe they invert 3@s and 3NT, so that 3@s is "serious" and 3NT is a spade cue bid|pg||
nt|dburn: but it's all speculation|pg||
nt|kareno: Are these KO matches?  Round Robin?|pg||

pc|h5|pc|d4|nt|dburn: however, he may have wasted some of the potential of his heart spots|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|andyv:  6@c the insurance bid:)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: @D = discards a @S losser in S|pg||
nt|kskov: now he needs to get the clubs right for a push|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d6|nt|andyv:  finessing a slight favortie over 1-1 split|pg||
nt|caitlin: @C break here is a killer|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kskov: think he will do that|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: lets see he could get it correct :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  favorite|pg||
nt|dburn: still, the strong temptation will be for declarer to rely on one of two spade finesses|pg||
pc|hT|nt|dburn: but he is going about it the right way so far...|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s7|pc|h4|pg||
nt|bvdahl: you expect pd to hold a rock solid suit, and not as much of a chance that the suit is @s when you hold @sJ|pg||
nt|sommer:  quite obvious to bid 6@C, yes|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s6|nt|disa: should make 10 tricks|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: ther he goes |pg||
pc|s2|nt|andyv:  looking into the stars for a clue|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: go it correct yes :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  wd|pg||
pc|h6|nt|dburn: ..two diamond ruffs, five hearts, two clubs and a spade, but...|pg||
pc|h7|pc|s4|pc|h8|pg||
nt|dburn: that spade suit was just too much of a temptation|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sommer:  the 4 and 5@H doesnt include stiff K|pg||

pc|sT|pc|c2|pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|pc|sJ|nt|caitlin: so much for split honours|pg||
nt|dburn: especially since Helness didn't lead one - the chance that he would turn up with @sKQ was probably a lot less than the usual 24%|pg||

nt|vugraphzzh: last board and then is lunchbreak|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting that passing 5@c was the big winner...and, yes, S could infer the W was void in clubs to be doing all that bidding.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: have to go ty specs had a nice time , Andy,Polv,Kenneth,Rolan see you soon , & specs  stay with all this fantastic  Commentators   bye all :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzzh: 14:45 gmt|pg||
mb|p|pc|s6|nt|dburn: botn North-Souths able to get diamonds into the auction because West transferred|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|dburn: not that East-West would have enjoyed the play in 2@h a lot - they had clubs, but no one ever bids clubs|pg||

nt|sommer:  a quiet overtrick seems to be the end here|pg||
