nt|mrdct: hi everyone|pg||
nt|sybarra: DelMonte know as "ish" |pg||
mb|1C!|nt|marcsmith: looks like a dull 4S for EW although 12 tricks can be made with the favourable diamond position|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|mrdct: EW play a variant of the fantunes system|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: hi all e/w are playing fantunes|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: 1@C = multi-purpose|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: and our mates at the other table (in 2nd half) said "all they did was open 1 @C everyhand" |pg||

pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|peachy: We'll get settled here shortly, welcome back everybody.  http://www.summerfestivalofbridge.com/index.php|pg||
pc|c4|nt|marcsmith: if they got to 6, declarer would have a 50-50 guess -- whether to play for DJ singleton with north or DK singleton with south|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|marcsmith: my guess is 1 IMP to BROWN|pg||
nt|mrdct: EW play a weak 1NT opening, so the 1NT rebid is usually strong|pg||
nt|caitlin: @D transfer to @Hs|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mrdct: good start for EW as 3NT looks to be a superior contract to 4@s|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|mrdct: although both appear to make comfortably today|pg||
pc|s4|nt|marcsmith: at the other table they played from West and north led his singleton, solving declarer's problems in the suit|pg||
nt|marcsmith: draw trumps and play ace and another diamond looks like a normal line here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow, i just noticed the running total   last time i checked it was only a 4 imp difference|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|pc|s6|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mrdct: 11 tricks should roll home now as declarer will never have to touch @C|pg||

nt|ahollan1: you can spy on the other tables via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
mb|3H|nt|marcsmith: EW can make 2C NS a couple of either major |pg||
nt|nickf: can we have player names please|pg||
nt|janm:  Sorry to be a little late - I just got a new computer and it isn't playing well with the Windows BBO client|pg||
nt|sybarra: this was such a close match for so long, the Milne team needs to regroup |pg||
nt|ahollan1: both the semi-final and final rounds are 64 board matches played in 4 16-board segments|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: Klinger won the South-West Pacific Teams which finished a couple of hours ago and is the top qualifier to the National Open Teams finals|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Im trying to find them out|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: EW have the majority of HCP but  shapes run wild|pg||
mb|d|nt|mrdct: this match is from the top section of the draw, whereby the loser gets a second chance|pg||
nt|mrdct: EW could be in trouble here but vulnerability is on their side|pg||
nt|ahollan1: favorable vulnerability = bid 'em up!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm:  I'll try not to get too confused using the web version :)|pg||
nt|janm:  In the other room, East bid 3@s over the takeout DBL of 2@s - here, with East passing, we may see NS declare.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: And West too is yet another refugee from Sauron's Middle Earth|pg||
mb|3N|nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: 3NT for NS is touch and go|pg||
nt|janm:  I'm guessing that 2NT is some sort of Lebensohl, asking his partner to bid 3@c and showing a non-constructive hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Andrew specs and vug boss:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Rodal  |pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: heart lead a spade switch is best for the defence -- not obvious to find tho|pg||
nt|rodal f: Shirly:)@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: only has 8 obvious tricks but the defence could falter and present a @s trick for delcarer before getting to their 5 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Milne placed 2nd in this event last year  and with a couple changes to the team 2nd in the Spring NOT|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Ed,  I am off to check the other rooms,  enjoy all |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: can Thompson find the double hook in @C for the make??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at this vul  3@H probably forced because 2@H would only show 5 card suit  [that actually IS the agreement for Hans-Nunn]|pg||
pc|cA|nt|janm:  Most of us play Lebensohl after a T/O DBL of a weak 2 bid, but not everyone does in this auction - in fact, maybe here S is playing Lebensohl and N isn't|pg||
pc|c3|nt|janm:  Although N certainly has a good hand and good support for clubs and spade stoppers, so maybe he bid 3NT on the theory that 9 tricks would be as easy in NT as in clubs|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|nickf: Can we have the player names please?|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|hJ|nt|mrdct: if delcarer plays on @s himself it will need to be a low @s to the 9|pg||
nt|mrdct: although actually low to Q will also work if he drops the J on the 2nd round of @s|pg||
nt|rodal f: Seems as 9 will come by the  auto|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|c4|nt|janm:  On this hand, I think he's going to be wrong - with no club spots so that West doesn't even have to hold off to have the clubs stopped (although surely he will duck here) - there isn't much of a source of tricks in NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other room Prescott opened 2@D multi -- Ish Del'Monte is playing 2@HX in West|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mrdct: what he doesn't want to do is cash @d first as that could very easily set up the 5th defensive trick|pg||
nt|mrdct: choosing to win is hand looks like he's planning to go after @s immediately|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d2|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|rodal f: 3-1-3-2|pg||
nt|rodal f: Safe two tricks at @C now. Next.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: r they negotiating a claim?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can be|pg||
pc|d4|nt|marcsmith: the south hand is going to get mangled when declarer runs the clubs|pg||
nt|janm:  I'll make my first (and probably wrong) prediction and bet on 5 tricks for declarer - 2 spades, 1 each in the red suits and 1 club|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mrdct: in great shape to make this now|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: you can spy on the other vugraph tables using http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|janm:  So the Milne team will be plus at both tables here, to increase their lead|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
nt|marcsmith: has to throw one spade and one heart|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you were here last set, i must correct bad info i gave|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: the matches are 32 boards  so this is the final segment of the match|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|rodal f: Interesting. Need a endplay at @H now|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: the winner here moves on to the Semi-Final, the loser gets a 2nd chance  [but i think the other match is win or go home]|pg||
pc|s2|nt|marcsmith: if South throws S9 defence can still prevail|pg||
nt|mrdct: cashing out now|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h6|pg||
nt|peachy: normal line of a second spade finesse|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d5|nt|tejjyid: entry problems now|pg||
nt|raghavan: good defense - removing entry before Club 9 becomes the 9th trick|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  for BBO-TV. |pg||

nt|ahollan1: nicely done|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: there are only a few of us in the room so if there's something special you want to discuss -- just holler|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so NS win imps if 2@HX -500   lose if -800   and just think - they could have defended 3@HX|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: multi  (wk in one major) and N is sure which it is|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mrdct: Alex Smirnov is a regular on the german open team and the welland team in US nationals|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i believe 2@D=artifiicial game force|pg||
nt|rodal f: NT not the best idea EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm:  Will our West be able to restrain himself from bidding 3NT with all those spade stoppers and not much else? No|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: he has been a regular visitor to the main australian summer events in recent years - particularly Youth Week|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H = 4+ hcp, no good suit|pg||
nt|tejjyid: tough fro East 3@C an underbid, but what is better?|pg||
nt|rodal f: I was wrong. @D blocked when W have the NT|pg||
pc|dT|nt|nickf: -------------------------------------------------->   Can you please put the player names in?|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|mrdct: south worth a raise now given that he passed 1st round|pg||
nt|mrdct: north has quite a good hand with some game prospects even opposite a very weak hand|pg||
nt|janm:  Now we'll get to see whether NS can do as well here as in the other room. Looks as if they need to get clubs going, but they do have all those aces, so should manage the club shift when it becomes obvious that spades are pretty hopeless|pg||
nt|sybarra: nervous about the stiff @D for sure|pg||
nt|rodal f: The best Andrew is to have it nice at home:) Just home now after a week seminar.|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s2|nt|marcsmith: a heart lead or switch forces declarer to guess the clubs, but he can afford a wrong guess on a spade continuation|pg||
nt|mrdct: but he will anticipate that communication will likely be a problem|pg||
nt|mrdct: even more so with dummy a 4333|pg||
nt|janm:  Which red suit do you attack first?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: the players in the NOT [national open teams]  qualified for the event via a 14-round swiss event called the SWPT|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Klinger won that event after gaining the lead in round 3 or 4 [and never looked back]|pg||
nt|peachy: E wants a diamond lead, I assume|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: back to back 5@D contracts   you won't see that often -- especially in non-imp games|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|marcsmith: now he has to guess the clubs again|pg||
nt|peachy: this is a challenging hand to make, but not impossible|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|nt|mrdct: at the risk of some differing views, i would say that EW have been quite easily the top pair in Victoria for the past 5 years or so|pg||
nt|janm:  I guess hearts, since then perhaps it won't be clear to the defenders which minor they want to play. Maybe heart to the ten, ducked, second heart won, now will N know to shift to clubs? |pg||
nt|raghavan: since South has checks in both Majors( whatever is 2D), North might have tried DJ - |pg||
pc|d9|nt|janm:  Even if he doesn't though, S can hold up the diamond ace and declarer only has 4 hearts, 1 spade and 1 diamond before he has to give up a black ace.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Whar's best? @C 2-2 + Qdrop single or play N for QXX. Not best I've seen.|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|peachy: But I believe Justin would make it.  Has to avoid giving too many natural spade tricks to the opponents|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pc|h5|pc|h7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow -- i just noticed that the other room played 10@D on last hand -- so 4 imps to Bloom|pg||
nt|peachy: good technique|pg||
nt|peachy: develop side suit first|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS carding   standard count/attitude  odd/even 1st discard|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't have a convention card for EW :(|pg||
pc|c3|nt|timb: As a commentator, I'm not a fan of the 3@H but I can't imagine not bidding 3@H at the table|pg||
nt|timb: it's also known as being a "result merchant" :)|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|timb: Edgtton has done well! North cannot have @CK and he has nine tricks|pg||
nt|janm:  Oops - now declarer is home - 2 spades, 4 hearts, 4 diamonds and a club, as long as he goes for broke and puts up the cliub K|pg||

mb|5D|nt|ahollan1: in the other match, through 18 of 32 boards,  Milne 65  Tishler 41|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: that team of youngsters [Milne] did very well in 2010    don't quote me, but i think 2nd in both this NOT [after winning the qualifying] and the Spring NOT|pg||

nt|marcsmith: 4@S is certainly a strange contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not vul Hans would open 2@S -- but this hand will pass|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree u there.|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think the 10 was right,  maybe E not thinking it out?|pg||
nt|peachy: yes, spade lead just kills 3NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'll just show this once|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=ART, F, multi-purpose    a) 11-16, 5+@C or 5@C & 2nd suit  b) 15-20 BAL [or 4441 singleton honor]  c) 17-20(21) any|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|marcsmith: 5@D is clearly where you want to play|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|rodal f: Up to partnership. I like Q best|pg||
mb|d|nt|mrdct: 3NT for NS here with @c 2-2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=(11)12-14 and includes some unexpected shapes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmm  i thought Bilski was supposed to bid 2@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my notes say  1N=0-5 HCP, (4+3+) @C & @D, not 4+@H/@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Noble will just compete in @C now, won't he?|pg||
mb|r|nt|ahollan1: 3rd/4th seat  NS play 1N=good14 to bad 17|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D = @S and @C/@D  [ASPRO]|pg||
nt|peachy: It seems a bit inconvenient to rush the weak hand to be declarer if NT is the strain, however, there might be benefits in the method that I canot decipher|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told at the table Barry Noble explained 1N same as I did|pg||
mb|2H|nt|janm:  Bridge is a funny game, isn't it - if North had a club singleton, instead of a diamond singleton, his splinter would be encouraging for S, but here, it's going to turn S off, yet it's really the same, since N has only 3 clubs and they can go on |pg||
nt|janm:  the diamond KQ leaving him with a club stiff |pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: presumably 1@S shows four spades and a negative double would deny four|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N looks like either transfer or lebensohl|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or  transfer lebensohl|pg||
nt|ahollan1: either way   i think Thompson is supposed to bid 3@C unless holding a really strong hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmmm maybe they play 2@D=@S & another  [including @H]|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|peachy: I don't know what NS 1NT vul opening range is, but I assume 10-12. Kibitzer says "gutsy"|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: 2@H likely now from South|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: bit too good for 3@C|pg||
nt|janm:  Of course N wouldn't have enough to splinter if he weren't a passed hand. |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Gosney in 1N West|pg||
nt|peachy: Pretty sure that West will again|pg||
pc|sK|nt|marcsmith: now 3@D from north and another game try with 4@C by south seems sensibel|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Klinger led the 14 round Qualifying Event [South-West Pacific Teams] from Round 3 or 4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another possible double partscore swing -- but both will be close|pg||
nt|peachy: whoa, so much for sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: contract as expected -- even if via different auction|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: the defenders from 2010, McManus just barely made it into the NOT in the final match of the SWPT|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mrdct: this looks like the road to 3NT|pg||
nt|peachy: could be 12-14 with an upgrade to 12 due to good spots|pg||
nt|raghavan: may end in +2 with C lead|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|mrdct: or not|pg||
nt|mrdct: 5@c a maker also |pg||
nt|peachy: tricky lead but declarer has no other hope than K now|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok specs, all saying q was best,  I thought after winning ace, a spade back and covered by queen was enough|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: but they were knocked out last night in the NOT Round of 20|pg||
pc|s8|nt|peachy: South cnnot go wrong nearly whatever he returns|pg||
nt|peachy: but understandably he wants to weigh the options at this time|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|mrdct: first imps for milne as klinger-mullamphy got too high on the earlier @s partscore hand where andy hung delayed his raise|pg||
nt|janm:  Good lead, but it's not going to matter|pg||
nt|othered1: Ew will be doing much of declarer's work here|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: both Jacks will win tricks!!|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D3-3 should be enough for Hans|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|pc|h2|nt|peachy: North could have ducked this, to assure two club tricks. Perha[s he thought S had a singleton|pg||
nt|peachy: but if so, the trick was coming back laster in clubs|pg||
nt|peachy: *later|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|marcsmith: one option is to play two top trumps then three rounds of clubs |pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if defense hadn't gotten busy -- i was going to ask which finesse Noble would take with his one entry to dummy|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|nt|marcsmith: think you are probably down if trumps split 4-1 anyway|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice @C play --- give Jacobs a chance to fly Ace|pg||
nt|janm:  Oh, sorry - I didn't wee the heart A played - this will only make 5, for another IMP to the leaders|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|janm:  Probably claiming again|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|mrdct: if i remember the format correctly the winner of this match stays in the top bracket and can afford to lose their next match but still stay in the event|pg||
nt|mrdct: smirnov has losing options here|pg||
nt|mrdct: he could invent a layout where @C are 3-1 and the remaining @S are with the 3 - i whcih case he needs to pitch the losing @d now|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|nt|marcsmith: now he would go down if clubs aren't 3-3|pg||
nt|raghavan: If Spade K is held up ? |pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if Thompson could/should DBL 2@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course - there really was no passive defense available|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mrdct: i have to "go dark" for a little bit as dinner is just about ready|pg||

pc|d5|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c4|pc|s5|pg||

nt|timb: 's trumps|pg||

mb|p|mb|3H|nt|timb: 6@S is cold without the heart guess; if East takes @DA, declarer has five minor suit tricks|pg||

nt|janm:  With all these claims, why is the other table 2 boards ahead? :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: whatever|pg||
nt|othered1: trump might have worked|pg||
nt|peachy: Plus in both rooms for Noble team|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: another forcing, multi-purpose 1@C    [unlike Polish Club, NS play weak NT throughout]|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|ahollan1: Milne v Tishler is also close in the early goings   15-12|pg||
nt|janm:  2@d probably multi, although a few pairs like to play it as a weak 2@h bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D because  1st/2nd seat 1N is weak|pg||
nt|janm:  N will suspect his partner has hearts, but will probably find out before settling for 3NT|pg||
nt|janm:  Or maybe not after the 2@s overcall|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|p|nt|marcsmith: slam in either major looks like an easy make -- not so easy to bid perhaps tho|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=9-11 HCP|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=6+ HCP, any shape   [all other responses = 0-5]|pg||
mb|2N|nt|marcsmith: a diamond lead might beat 6@S but 6@H is solid|pg||
nt|janm:  Probably S could have a bit less for a vul vs not weak 2 bid, but N probably thinks he has 9 tricks in his own hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: the problem with 6@S is that you have to ruff a club. If North then ducks the first round of trumps, declarer may be tempted to repeat the finesse|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmm  i thought EW played 15-17 NT throughout |pg||
nt|ahollan1: blast 3N?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=18-20   possibly 4441 with singleton honor|pg||
nt|peachy: this is no the 17-19 bal variant, I assume|pg||
nt|peachy: bow*|pg||
nt|peachy: *now|pg||
nt|othered1: 6@S looks pretty good and can avoid the @H guess|pg||
nt|ahollan1: transfers apply -- but i'm not sure if they have mechanism to show slam force 5-5|pg||
nt|othered1: 6N also|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|sybarra: a big key was not to block the suit with q10x |pg||
nt|sybarra: we might play it here in 2 1C |pg||
nt|sybarra: *2 @C |pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: did Bill Jacobs think the hand was too good  ...  or have they changed System since the 2009 Team Playoff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the 1N response with 11 HCP and 3 quick tricks suggests system change|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: ahhh I'm told they now play the Fantunes system  that exlains sooooo much|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in that case, 1@C was a one round force, usually 14+ HCP|pg||
nt|sybarra: was chancey to bid 2 @H although it would have worked here|pg||
nt|othered1: though NT could require @HQ guess either way|pg||
mb|3S|nt|janm:  And he does, with the A of hearts for 10|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|rodal f: A correct but sadly pass from E, and a nice lead.|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: this again will be a challenge when diamond development and entries make it a tangle|pg||
nt|janm:  At matchpoints, declarer would probably take the spade finesse for 5, but here he'll probably settle for his safe 10 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: reverse red suits in W |pg||
nt|ahollan1: single dummy  6N is riskier -- seeing location of @DA  makes it ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: I expect defenders will prevail|pg||
nt|othered1: no, 6N gives you a 2-way play for @HQ at worst|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: regardless @D position|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh my|pg||
nt|peachy: good thing about this is that it is a sure plus :(|pg||
nt|othered1: Where did the wheels come off?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Smirnov playing 6@S North|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|marcsmith: North has to duck the first round of trumps, then I don't think declarer can make 12 tricks|pg||
nt|othered1: That's best, I think|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: @SA looks like weaker lead than @SK  -- that's typical of current treatment, but in the olden days Ace was the strong lead [for unblock or count]|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|pg||
pc|cK|nt|marcsmith: now it's easy|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: both pairs use  upside-down count & attitude|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so @S6 was encouraging in @S|pg||
nt|rodal f: If u have 6@H at 1NT one round force OK. But by 5 cards after 9+black cards at W. Nope|pg||
pc|c9|nt|peachy: Diamond ace lead there so he should have no trouble|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||
nt|peachy: It was maybe 1 or two down, now certainly -3|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: nice position for Jacobs -- his lead didn't matter, Nunn only had 8 quick tricks|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: me thinks Down 1|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: It is, Ill change it in a sec|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|peachy: Means the match is getting a little closer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe Bilski supposed to make stronger noise than 4@H with such good @S??   if not, Noble PASS hard to understand|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|nt|peachy: if they switch to clubs as here|pg||
pc|d7|nt|peachy: well, unblocking wasnt done, difficult to see, I dont really blame E|pg||

pc|cT|pc|h4|pc|dJ|pc|d2|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: that goes back to the issue about how to show game force vs slam interest vs slam force with 5@S & 5@H|pg||
pc|s2|nt|marcsmith: removes the entry from the hearts if South holds Jxxx|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c4|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sQ|mc|11|nt|ahollan1: it is issue all partnerships should address over  2N family bids  |pg||

nt|ahollan1: thanks Tom|pg||
nt|janm:  Wrong again! I guess he had enough faith in West's overcall to play him for either the diamond A or the spade Q or both|pg||
nt|janm:  NS need to start winning more than 1 IMP a board to get back into this match, though.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no -- essentially same as after 2N opening with 19-20|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N is the system opening for Thompson|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: all systems have their flaws,  often you land on feet in that one |pg||
nt|othered1: As so often happens, 2N killed another slam.  I know that's dismissed as Culbertsonian bias, but it still happens with more frequency than you'd expect at high levels.|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|sybarra: and W opened a dog of a hand |pg||
nt|ahollan1: which is range meckwell & rm lite players use in 1st/2nd seat  [and 3rd not vul]|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N = (11)12-14  and conventionally covers some distributions that would surprise many|pg||
nt|tez: operation time:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: n/s close to making 3 nt|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|ahollan1: random decision for who declares 4@S  seems if East declares, no @H lead so extra overtricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: strong 1N variety of 1@C this time|pg||
nt|peachy: Methods after 2NT opening are notoriously shaky for most partnerships|pg||
nt|peachy: you are quite right about that AL|pg||
mb|1S|nt|tez: if they play weak nt i belive you must bid |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Thompson's other option was a limited 2@D opening which is unbal, but that's an ugly @D suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@d the only positive response|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rodal f: If I do, it end with a swim:)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|janm:  Reynolds must agree with me that they need to start getting some IMPs, and making a somewhat aggressive vul 2@s bid (presumably spades + a minor) is his way to try to do it|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: but with a transfer [seems normal]   North has natural @H lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what a random 2 imps that would be|pg||
nt|rodal f: What NT do EW use at vul?|pg||
nt|sybarra: carry on to 4 @S now|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: in 1st seat, Tony Nunn had to either PASS or try 3@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmmm   in the other room declarer WAS East -- auction must have pin-pointed @H lead|pg||
nt|timb: This looks like 11 to Milne, putting the match almost out of reach for Markey|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm:  Unfortunately, unless he can make this (which would be a real miracle), his attempt had backfired.|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: Play in 4S making +1|pg||
nt|sybarra: pls dont tell me you want to open 1 nt with W?|pg||
nt|sybarra: on that pattern???|pg||

mb|p|nt|tez: if theu play weak nt..dbl is 14+ 2@c majors..others transfer..we play this way|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: EW are playing 2/1 so 15-17 NT |pg||
nt|ahollan1: since Bilski has already revealed some points, not sure if this is a lebensohl type situation or not|pg||
pc|dK|nt|vugrapha2: and alex (N) says good luck|pg||
nt|timb: South has to ruff two hearts and lose a trump trick or make five trumps and lose a heart|pg||

pc|d5|nt|peachy: I don't know what EW NT range is, it could even be 15-17 with an upgrade here, or 12-14|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as expected  4@H north in the other room|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|peachy: In this auction, 3C showed diamonds I was told|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: pretty random about which hand benefits as declarer here,  West has easy @D lead which is best for defense, East on a guess unless partner decided to DBL 2@D transfer response|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Just having a quick break here |pg||
nt|rodal f: Nope Shirley. System on for it.|pg||
nt|sybarra: on this hand yes,  as you get to spades but some you do not |pg||
nt|rodal f: As it is for 5@S@H and 6@D@C at 1NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: only because pard has you covered|pg||
nt|rodal f: System on as I said. But must be on.|pg||
nt|raghavan: Bd 2 here 3NT went 1 down. Open making. with same C lead - Open room after winning with Cj, a club  was played back developing 9th trick|pg||
nt|raghavan: He had 2 entries to develop club trick|pg||
nt|rodal f: And lost one by @S play when he might climed. Safe teamplay u told as I did at beginning.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|peachy: defenders did well not to open up the clubs for declarer|pg||
nt|timb: Still down one is 6imps and 43 is a good buffer over 9 boards|pg||
nt|timb: low @S to @SA, @C9 throwing a heart & a trump finesses sees South emerge for down one|pg||
nt|janm:  I think he still has the heart/spade problem - he can't pull trumps and end in dummy to use the clubs and if he ruffs the heart, he'll have a spade loser|pg||
nt|timb: @C10 is a distraction|pg||

pc|s7|pc|s5|pc|h6|pc|s3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some pairs agree that 3rd/4th seat always treat the 1N opening as strong|pg||
nt|timb: Peter probably thinks clubs are 2=4|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|janm:  Ah, with clubs 3-3, he can cross to the spade A and pitch the heart and then take the spade finesse - does that risk -3 if the clubs don't split or the spade is off?|pg||

nt|janm:  South thinking now might be the time to bid those @ds?|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: This confirms (to me) that EW Nt OPENING RANGE IS 15-17|pg||

nt|rodal f: @H lead for -1 but didn't exspect it.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1-under as Limit Raise is very common practise these days|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: Hinge was able to open 2@D with the South hand so 3N North easily reached|pg||
nt|tez: 2@d is artificial|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=4+@H, 0-11 HCP|pg||
nt|janm:  Or they might bid more hearts :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|tez: 2@h=weak hand no @s support|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe a transfer??|pg||
nt|janm:  Doubling would be more successful, but I'm sure there are hands where 5@d is down only 1 and 5@h makes|pg||
nt|janm:  East has a maximum in HCPs, but there are so many "quacks" that he knows he doesn't really have a good hand for play in a suit - still, his side has 9 hearts and the opponents probably have a bunch of diamonds. Perhaps he should DBL to say that |pg||

pc|dT|pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|janm:  I guess he decided that S really thought he was making 5@d and his partner might have nothing for the transfer, so better not to risk DBLing and either having them make or maybe having his partner bid 5@h and go down|pg||

nt|janm:  I was so intrigued by the auction, I lost track of the play, but obviously 3NT was better than 4@h :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: 2@H = (9)10-13 HCP, unbal|pg||
nt|janm:  Still a lot of coming back for the Markey team, but that was a good start|pg||
nt|rodal f: Was a restrikted choice but N helped by pitch @D4|pg||
nt|raghavan: but clubs A and K will defeat|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm:  I guess 2@s is natural, not a 2-suiter - didn't he open 2@d with a weak 2@h bid earlier? This 2@s bid is far from a thing of beauty, but he still needs to swing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS do play Namyats   so 4@S weaker than 4@D       but Bilski only opens 3@S :(|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: regardless of result, i think being in 4@H was better than stopping in 3|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|c7|nt|mrdct: the @d layout looks bad for declarer but the @HK doubleton may help - the play will be interesting|pg||
pc|d4|pg||

nt|ahollan1: IF Bloom does open, will it be 1@H or 2@H [weak with @H & @C/@D]|pg||
nt|janm:  1 @d, 2@ss, at least 1 @h and a couple of clubs - down something like 3 or maybe even 4? Another nice pickup for Markey|pg||
nt|janm:  Is a diamond or a spade here best? From the spade 8, Reynolds knows that his partner has either one or 2 spades (surely he'd have led the 7 from J87), probably 2, since he didn't lead a spade to start. He also knows that there isn't anything to |pg||

pc|hQ|pc|hJ|nt|mrdct: def will cash 2 top @c and switch to @d i think|pg||
pc|h5|nt|peachy: declarer on thin ice, spades do not break (as is the odds) and now has two diamond losers during which defenders open up the hearts|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if he decides to PASS  then what?   1@C-P-1@S-P//??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unfortunately this table is ahead of all other vugraph rooms, so there is nothing to compare|pg||
nt|janm:  gain from tapping declarer with a diamond, and in fact declarer could choose to pitch on the diamond. Surely he'll cash the spade A and then lead a red suit - if the hearts were different it might be productive to lead them through|pg||
pc|hK|pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|h7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there's also a group that says  if you have a 5-card major, you open it  -- so their auction would start  1@H-1@S//2@C-??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems NS in trouble unless the defend against East's 2@H :)|pg||

pc|sT|nt|rodal f: Well:)|pg||
pc|h8|pc|s6|nt|janm:  That's an alternative, but now North is sort of endplayed - doesn't want to lead a red suit, and although a club won't do any harm, it won't do any serious good. Still, they're now up to 3 club tricks, and will still probably get the heart K, |pg||

nt|othered1: Looks like NS's methods had their head's on the -600 block, but are going to go plus.  You decide if the risk was worth it.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rodal f: NS normaly sold by AKQ after there fight|pg||
nt|raghavan: clubs are favourably divided |pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|s8|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: on  10, Bloom did PASS the Jacobs hand -- Hinge opened 1@C  and buys the contract at 4@C!!!|pg||
nt|janm:  Usually when the auction goes like this, I think that the responder to the weak 2 should have raised immediately, so the other side couldn't find out what they had before deciding whether to bid over 3@h, but on this hand, Smirnov has such|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: will he try to turn this into a NT hand now?   i.e. play trump|pg||
pc|h5|nt|janm:  a good hand that it was reasonable for him to think they might buy the contract in 2@h, and of course he preferred that to 3|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|rodal f: Next.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|pc|d2|pc|d9|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|sA|nt|janm:  Good play by Appleton putting up the spade K - if declarer had the 10, it would have been necessary to prevent him from losing a finesse and then taking another one and cashing dummy's spades. |pg||
nt|janm:  Edgtton wondering if Appleton is really doing this with KQ of spades|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hung-Smirnov play 4@S after east pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too many choices!!!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: much more intersting at another form of scoring [where overtrick matters]|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|pc|sQ|pc|hT|pg||

nt|marcsmith: morning all|pg||
nt|janm:  And the @s K play got a reward even though his partner had the 10|pg||
nt|othered1: or maybe the double deserves some more consideration.  |pg||
pc|c6|nt|janm:  So a push even though we're a level lower here|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: now @DA, @C10, @H and if trump 3-3 overtrick|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Moysian fits can be fun|pg||
nt|marcsmith: looks like a dull 4@S NS here|pg||
nt|sybarra: much needed boost I think |pg||
nt|ahollan1: their are 2 very distinct groups  --  those that like artificial runnouts  and those that despise them|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm sure they're both right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or maybe both wrong|pg||
mb|1C|nt|peachy: tell me when you find out, I'm in the undecided group|pg||
mb|3C|nt|marcsmith: something like 3@C should now show a sound diamond raise or better|pg||
nt|marcsmith: 3@S would be non-forcing and 3@H a forcing 3@S bid|pg||
nt|marcsmith: EW may think 5@D will be cheap but it should be 800 as there is no entry to take the @D hook|pg||
nt|sybarra: at least have to feel good about it |pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: Mullamphy is playing 3@S North|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: they obviously play 3@C and 3@H the other way around, which not efficient in this particular auction|pg||
nt|tez: 1@s 1nt 2@c 2@s all pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: West too weak for 1N and not distributional enough for 10-13 HCP 2@H opener  [needs 6@H or 2nd suit]|pg||
nt|othered1: Since weak NT is my preferred natural structure, I've had a bunch of experience with both approaches.  The real disasters occur with the artificial runouts, though sometimes they ...|pg||
nt|othered1: can be useful.  At matchpoints, maybe artificial works, but at IMPs, they can be match losers.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marcsmith: 2 aces and a spade ruff beats 5@D|pg||
nt|mrdct: http://www.abf.com.au/events/not/|pg||
nt|ahollan1: fairly common agreement for (1m)-3m to be natural    make sure you and partner know your agreement before trying it at the table|pg||
nt|peachy: that is a bold 3C, vulnerable, and hit rough seas this time|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: and it was imps! |pg||
nt|raghavan: In open room did not reach even 5C|pg||
nt|othered1: Or maybe we don't handle them right  . . . |pg||
pc|sA|nt|marcsmith: lack of communication for the defenders means that 3N cannot be defeated tho|pg||
nt|peachy: West wisely stayed out of the sac|pg||
nt|marcsmith: not sure about the HJ lead|pg||
nt|marcsmith: likely to give away a trick -- generally Jx Jxx Jxxx Qx are terrible holdings to lead|pg||
nt|marcsmith: much prefer @CA here in the hope you can score fast tricks and maybe a ruff|pg||
nt|marcsmith: also, if leading Jx or Qx it is usually right to lead the low one|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3rd slam by 3 boards.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: i bet Jacobs was tempted to bid 3@H|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|marcsmith: let's see if declarer knows his safety plays -- should start with SA|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|nt|rodal f: B11 ended 3@C at OR.|pg||
nt|sybarra: and the k of clubs on side again |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW don't have any direct way to show a Weak 2-bid  they either PASS or open 3-level|pg||
nt|marcsmith: only danger to contract is East having no spades|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: so Jacobs probably assumed Thompson had what others would open 2@H [or multi 2@D]|pg||
nt|peachy: I hpe my partners don't do it ofte, I dont anticipate doubleton if low is led|pg||
nt|raghavan: Club 9 is there!|pg||
nt|raghavan: with west|pg||
nt|raghavan: so hope K x with E|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some have begun to use (1@C)-2@C as natural   and (1@C)-2@D as Michaels|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mrdct: hard to find the killing @d lead|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: most tricks i can see for Hans translates to down 1|pg||
nt|raghavan: good lead for defense|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|nt|mrdct: although it's equally hard for delcarer to come to 9 tricks as north get's 2 chances to lead a @d through|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sybarra: now can he find the ht shift |pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|hK|nt|marcsmith: actually, Qx of trumps is often a good lead -- you're playing for the suit to be Qx xxxx Jx AK10xx |pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: then (1@C)-3@C can either be  Strong Michaels or ASK for stopper or  something else I guess|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|rodal f: Nice lead but still. It was on. Understand Mike|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: [i saw a bunch of lines for down more]|pg||
nt|marcsmith: you lead low to partner's jack and then declarer finesses on the second round to your queen|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cJ|nt|raghavan: to go 1 down only declarer should lose 1 D - let us see how|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still must guess @D correctly for 9th trick|pg||
nt|raghavan: 2 down is costly as EW would make 2 or3 Spades only|pg||
nt|peachy: With the advent of ever more artificial systems for both 1C and 1D openings, there are not many options than to define cuebid of them natural|pg||
nt|othered1: or just be preemptive|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: after the singleton @C lead -- no inferences exist about @H honors -- so no inferences about @D either|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahhh     just claim down 1    let opp figure it out|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I believe Adam is the youngest player in the match, and the one with the least experience  ---  maybe Noble was trying to put pressure on his screenmate|pg||

nt|marcsmith: NS likely to go down in a game here|pg||
nt|marcsmith: perhaps 3N by North will make if they don't mark the heart lead in the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: set up by a good presure 3@d bid by west where some may have made a simple 1-level overcall|pg||
nt|ahollan1: winner of this match advances to Semi-Final, loser gets to play again|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm:  Yes, it's the leading team that seems to have a good result here - EW bid a slam off a cashing AK and NS cashed them (and doubled as well).|pg||
nt|bebechira: was a good double by Milne as well... :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NEC Cup starts in Feb  and BBO schedule is already posted|pg||
mb|2C|nt|peachy: NT by N is unlikely to get a heart lead|pg||
nt|marcsmith: anyone have any idea what 2@S is?|pg||
nt|rodal f: A new spot but 3NT is on as 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: exiciting match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is some form of magic that is based upon the results of the 14-match Swiss Qualifying into the NOT, then results from last nite Round of 20 matches|pg||
nt|tez: nack n nack|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think the other match now on vugraph is in lose & go home mode|pg||
nt|ahollan1: forcing 1@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same 2@C response??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or 2N|pg||
nt|janm:  Was it? How did he know that South and not East had the @c K?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I'll have to check about dates for Yeh Bros|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ahollan1: because @C don't run?|pg||
nt|marcsmith: surely not the systemic action on this???|pg||
nt|mrdct: yes he correctly diagnosed that with no @c cue by east at worst his @CAQ was sitting over dummy's K|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i think 2N= a) 7-9 3@S or b) 5-9 4@S|pg||
mb|4H|nt|peachy: This is another of their 3-9 two suiters, blacks this time|pg||
nt|marcsmith: hardly what I'd call a -suiter|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: lol... it was a good double for Milne team|pg||
nt|sybarra: W really pushing with his 8 count|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems like a very silly auction to me|pg||
mb|5D|nt|ahollan1: 2@S = limit raise, exactly 3@H|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Actually, According to their score books, the 4H made|pg||
nt|janm:  And E couldn't have had a stiff club and decided to cue bid the A of diamonds first?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Second X=negative|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what did Whibley expect his passed hand partner to respond?|pg||
mb|d|nt|marcsmith: surely not sound either|pg||
nt|peachy: Yes systemic, we have knowledgeable kib|pg||
nt|peachy: I suppose this says "I have a 4H opener, just better than a 4H opener"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems to put way too much pressure on partner to try to figure out == why didn't he open 4@H or rebid 2/3@H == and what am i supposed to do now??|pg||
mb|5H|nt|ahollan1: i initially forgot East was passed hand :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good-o 4@H on time makes more sense|pg||
nt|marcsmith: bizarre|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: 2NT likely inquiry|pg||
nt|mrdct: he was screenmates with east so i'm sure he asked him whether or not he'd cue a stiff @C in preference to a @d control|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: as pointed out - after pull last trump - unblock @C honor when Nunn flies Ace  |pg||
nt|marcsmith: think I'd rather open 1@S|pg||
nt|mrdct: and it's always more useful to get that info from the actual person holding the hand|pg||
nt|peachy: The Double probably helps the declaring side from going to slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: nice stop here for ew|pg||
nt|rodal f: If @H lead direct for @D hook.|pg||
nt|raghavan: May have problem in 4 S if West plays Heart twice and get a ruff |pg||
nt|raghavan: But not so happened|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mrdct: thin values, no fit, no source of tricks = no game|pg||
nt|marcsmith: 3@H presumably maximum with clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: I suspect the 1st X was negative  |pg||
nt|peachy: The infamous Board 12 has not been scored, maybe it was so wild that computers rejected it ;)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|nt|bebechira: lool..here we go|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D10 may make it easier for Hans to find @C shift|pg||
nt|tez: @c now|pg||
nt|tez: declarer has aqjx in @d|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i suppose @DK will get @C shift too, but it is harder after that Trick 1 play|pg||
nt|tez: @d 1t won|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes --- i'm just saying @DT makes @C shift much easier than @DK|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|nt|mrdct: this auction is slightly curious as this time it seems east has denied @C control but east makes a slam try anyway|pg||
nt|mrdct: sry west|pg||
nt|bebechira: the kiddies are home now....i think|pg||
nt|mrdct: west denied|pg||
nt|rodal f: 0-1-3-5|pg||
pc|cA|nt|janm:  And that will pretty much end the match - congratulations to the Milne team|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|marcsmith: Wet obviously should have doubled 3@H|pg||
nt|marcsmith: West that is|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|nt|peachy: the method gained them 5 IMPs in this match, here is another gain|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2 boards left|pg||
nt|mrdct: so Bloom, Milne and Noble into the semis with the other semifinalist to come from the match not on BBO|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|sybarra: this and one more in this quarter |pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: it will be interesting to see if defense is different at other tables when @DK is played at trick 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=(11)12-14  covers many shapes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: last year there was a big discussion on BBO Forum [or r.g.b] about whether or not to use conventional runout after Weak 1N - DBL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the conclusion matched the arguments about 1M-1N  forcing vs semi-force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: each camp is absolutely sure their treatment is right and the other treatment is wrong|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and vice versa :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: are we really waiting for Jacobs' bid?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one runout scheme uses RDBL to force bid of 2@C   the other would bid 2@C as Natural [totally new concept]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: winner gets to rest the rest of the evening -- qualifying into semi-final|pg||
nt|ahollan1: loser plays 32 more boards in the Quarter Final|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S forcing, usually 14+ HCP|pg||
nt|mrdct: hopefully the operator can keep the room open to report the result of that match as it could be sometime before it is published on the website|pg||
nt|janm:  And it's way past my bedtime, so goodnight all :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|peachy: in my book, leading from xxx is typically the worst, J10x not really so|pg||
nt|mrdct: thx jan|pg||
nt|rodal f: The junior Del'Monte pressed last b. Else normaly a spot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S limited by failure to open 1@C     1N forcing|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: in this seat, some play RDBL=2 suit |pg||
nt|marcsmith: yet another dull game for NS|pg||
nt|marcsmith: i'd much rather lead from xxx than from Jxx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=RELAY  a) 5-7(8), 3+@S  b) any 9+ HCP|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: ahh  there ya go|pg||
nt|marcsmith: South was remiss there -- 3@H redoubled is where i'd like to play this deal|pg||
nt|raghavan: Spade has to get declarer 2 tricks let us see how |pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry about that too|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Perfect cards at E for force by 11HP?:) Y|pg||
nt|sybarra: just have to not get tapped too many times|pg||
nt|raghavan: should find H and  not finess for Club Q|pg||
nt|raghavan: HQ|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: and there's the flaw with the initial PASS  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=a) 7-9 3@S or b) 5-9 4@S|pg||
nt|peachy: I once read (I'd swear it was a Mike Lawrence book) that leading from xxx has the same effect on your defense as a sleeping pill would have on your attention span|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: Klinger was down 17-31 to Yezerski at the half|pg||
nt|mrdct: it would be somewhat of an upset if Yezerski held-on given that Klinger won the swiss qualifying|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: sorry  maybe "flaw" is too harsh|pg||
nt|raghavan: trying for extra club trick|pg||
nt|raghavan: Spade K is his 9th |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ish going down in 6@H on board 14|pg||
pc|h8|nt|marcsmith: you have to make the oppo pay for making stupid lead-directing doubles|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: Tony Nunn out for blood with his half trick|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: not sure how he avoids 2 @S losers, 1 @D, and how to handle clubs?  one loser looks to be there|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes but Club A and k falls CQ|pg||
nt|rodal f: Playable but will Liam find the road?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mrdct: these lead directing doubles can have the side effect of putting the brakes on the opps when they were just about to overbid to slam|pg||
nt|raghavan: avoid finesse|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: this has been quite a match|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|mrdct: which may have been the case on back-to-back boards|pg||
nt|raghavan: too late|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: seems to me both pairs at our table have played very well|pg||
nt|peachy: All that means is that the young Milne team holds the lead at the beginning of the last/4th segment.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: looking at all hands  this is tough|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and i should say the played well in both sets|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mrdct: as it happens a @c lead is much much better|pg||
pc|h5|nt|marcsmith: 3@H-XX would make 9 or 10 for a nice little gain|pg||
nt|sybarra: that solved that problem|pg||
nt|raghavan: well done|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: @C ruff gains extra trump trick, but loses @H      i think|pg||
nt|raghavan: play S and pray - given|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: @S shift -- just didn't occur to me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D8 still looming large|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if Sartaj just plugs away with major suit cards he eventually score all 3 trump tricks for down 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but surely @HK most likely to establish an extra trick if partner holds any more points|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Thompson still has 1N opener without @HQ |pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s8|nt|ahollan1: i think   @SA  @HA @DJ @CK   yep that's enough for 1N|pg||
nt|raghavan: This session is a big gain for Noble getting 42 against 11|pg||
