nt|yuval10: NS continue to get all the points, and now it's slam time|pg||
nt|rv: N-S cold for @c slam here|pg||
nt|vugraphzwb: He can X but with 5 @C's he might be tempted to bid|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|rv: I presume Birman's 4@s does promise some shape, with semibal hand he would have passed double|pg||
mb|5H|nt|yuval10: 6@s from N will makes as well|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: well bid by Dror Padon|pg||
nt|rv: will Bar Tarnovski underlead his @h or is he thinking of a 7@h save here?|pg||
nt|vugraphzwb: if he passes he might well underlead|pg||
nt|vugraphzwb: although his stiff spade |pg||
nt|vugraphzwb: maybe partner has J10xx |pg||
nt|vugraphzwb: and he just has to cash his trick and wait|pg||
nt|rv: yes stiff @s is a deterrent to both taking save or underleading|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: if Hershpang was passed hand, I am sure Tarnovski might have even pre-empted 5@h on 1@c|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|h8|pc|h2|pg||
nt|rv: Bar saved OT by not underleading though he will still lose the board here|pg||
nt|rv: very well bid by N-S though|pg||
nt|rv: another interesting bidding question, what would 4n be by South on 4@h by Tranovski, is it 2 places to play or a mild slam try in @cs?|pg||

nt|othered1: This might be an exercise in slam bidding.|pg||
nt|rv: I will definitely suggest a mild slam try|pg||
nt|othered1: yes, as mildly as I can|pg||
nt|vugraphzwb: NS at the other room bid the slam, which can luckily be made but declarer finnessed in @D's which was reasonable|pg||
nt|rv: 1n-2@d-2@h-4@h maybe|pg||
nt|vugraphzwb: but the roof failed when west won with his Jxx |pg||
nt|vugraphzwb: *fell|pg||
nt|othered1: A method where north shows a solid suit and interest in slam at least opposite a perfect hand would work well here.|pg||
nt|rv: this sequence shows mild slam try with 6@hs and w/o any stiff in my methods|pg||
nt|othered1: That transfer auction is pretty standard, assuming you'd be able to bid game with a 4-level transfer to just stop there.|pg||
nt|othered1: But even then it's the solid suit that's the key and opener with bad trumps, perhaps xx, may have trouble pushing on.|pg||
nt|rv: yes you can play either Texas (4@d for @h, 4@h for @s) or SA Texas transfer (4@c for @h, 4@d for @s) at 4 level w/o any slam interest|pg||
nt|rv: Ed is possibly suggesting North has a max even for mild slam try|pg||
nt|othered1: On the NS hands alone, 6@H isn't terrible and is pretty good without @S lead.|pg||
nt|rv: if North does employ the suggested mild slam try sequence, will the panel move with South hand?|pg||
nt|othered1: But on a @S lead, you may have to play @D for 4 tricks and will very likely go wrong, losing a finesse to @DJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzwb: Good question, I think south hand is not that good, only 1 ace, soft values, 10@D is a good card|pg||
nt|rv: South has 3 trumps with doubleton which is a plus, lacking top control in both minors which is minus|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: I think it's close but wouldn't move if I had to do so above game.|pg||
nt|rv: tough decision, well judged by Dror Padon in my opinion|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|othered1: It's close enough that it would be clear if south held @HQxx and no @SJ.|pg||

nt|baldfriede: W does not know whether declarer holds 9 or 8 of @d|pg||
nt|april7: S has only 1 @D card, so since E gave the 10, E must hgave the 9 so discard the K is ok|pg||
