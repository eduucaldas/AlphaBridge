nt|yo_yo: here's one pic : http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=14233|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it was a good idea, just in case partner took it into his head to lead something else |pg||
pc|h5|nt|rmb1: Less likely to make 11 in 4@S (so much for predictions)|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@S as a final contract?|pg||
nt|rmb1: This is the second 16-board stanza of 4 in the semi-final, finals tomorrow|pg||
nt|ady: good lay of the cards for 4@S|pg||
mc|8|nt|patricck: Welcome everyone|pg||
nt|neobas: I must admit I have heard of the NS players but not the EW players|pg||
nt|patricck: I believe 1NT is the best bid on the North hand, tho I know it is't to everyone's taste|pg||
nt|april7: hello everybody and good afternoon|pg||

nt|vugraphzyj: N signaled with the 9@s... and gave a trick away...|pg||
nt|sybarra: that hand may get some discussion .....|pg||
nt|rmb1: so we are in for an exciting day!|pg||
nt|roswolf: i have been doing bbo commentary for a long time and that was truly unbelievable|pg||
nt|xenya: action here|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps|pg||
nt|rodal f: A bit more interesting board.|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: hi all|pg||
nt|xenya: hi Csaba|pg||
nt|peachy: This is the first board of the 4th segment|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but South could have reopened with 2@d - or even 2@h|pg||
nt|peachy: 49 was...|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|vugraphzvx: im ready with the names :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: here EW might go go overboard but perhaps they will stay in a good 3NT contract|pg||
nt|sybarra: in the recap |pg||
nt|rmb1: 1@C strong artificial (I guess)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Csaba, so not Hanna:)|pg||
mb|1S!|an|GF|nt|ady: nothing much here    |pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: no :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: 6@C is a possible contrACT|pg||
nt|peachy: Looks like EW play prevision|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|patricck: 6@C is a lucky contract, but not 6@D|pg||
nt|ady: need to stop around 1NT|pg||
nt|peachy: precision|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: indeed think west should pass here|pg||
nt|neobas: I don't like the 3NT rebid tbh|pg||
nt|neobas: I usually play it as solid diamonds and a bit too much to open a Gambling 3NT|pg||
nt|april7: no W is thinking about a 6 @C contract and will have the luck to make it if he decides to do it|pg||
nt|neobas: Anyone for 3@D?|pg||
nt|roswolf: but 4@C may be ok provided they could stop in 4NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: is North worth a positive (if 1@c is strong)?|pg||
nt|ady: west may compete|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not easy to find a @D lead from W if 5@S|pg||
mb|2C!|an|stayman|nt|patricck: 3@D is the more normal rebid...  I don't think 3NT is such an ugly choice tho|pg||
nt|rmb1: I can't find convention cards on line: I think this is a picture of East http://www.bridzs.hu/node/184/52|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is sane so far|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: AH AH|pg||
nt|neobas: "My @C are more solid than your @D"|pg||
nt|roswolf: now a major cue?|pg||
nt|neobas: :)|pg||
nt|april7: now 4 @D and then 6@C perhaps|pg||
mb|2S|nt|roswolf: 1nt?|pg||
nt|xenya: even 4@S goes down here on an inspired @D lead...|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: Signaling Rule  2:  Never signal with a trick.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|roswolf: now e/w should get to 6@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: and   1 is?|pg||
nt|panja: 1@S pass might be the best spot...|pg||
nt|roswolf: we shall see|pg||
nt|panja: would have been difficult to make 7 tricks in 1Nt|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this looks like a normal pass for South now|pg||
nt|ady: cam ,ake 9 tricks in hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: Another auction you do not see that often (with opener passing 1S)|pg||
nt|rmb1: In the other match, 1@C was an little as an ordinary 16, so North is probably not worth a positive|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Easyer if E doubble|pg||
nt|xenya: now... -- no, almost impossible to find...|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: Lakatos is thinking|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: must avoid 6NT|pg||
nt|patricck: 6@C can be beaten on a @H lead as long as when the Q@S is run on the first round of the suit South ducks|pg||
nt|april7: W should ofcourse pull trumps before giving up a @S|pg||
nt|roswolf: that would be tough i think|pg||
nt|april7: 6NT possible except on @H lead,but S will lead @H ofcourse|pg||
nt|patricck: sorry, stupid of me, diamonds don't need to be set up in clubs|pg||
nt|chick: Signaling Rule  1:  Every card is a signal (whether you mean it or not)|pg||
nt|peachy: well, I take it back, I really dont know|pg||
nt|chick: prevision is good too :)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mdgraham: you come across lots of new things on BBO|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and 1@d-1@S=GF is sure new to a lot of us|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rodal f: Well. @H10 give a signal. Might it'll come|pg||
nt|xenya: great!|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rodal f: Yes. Well done|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|april7: well done!|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm that was cool|pg||
nt|neobas: NS will dislike the lucky slam this early|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: yes they will feel luck isnt with them|pg||
pc|s5|nt|yo_yo: new to me, yes|pg||
pc|sT|pc|h6|pg||
nt|april7: 3NT by E shouldn't be with a singleton @C from W's point of view ofcourse|pg||
nt|roswolf: possibly|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|chick: kinda depends on what 1@D means|pg||
nt|mdgraham: probably 13 cards, some of them high ones |pg||
nt|peachy: kib says 'short diamonds, may have both majors'|pg||
nt|chick: cute :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: EW plays precision|pg||
nt|sundiszno: hi all from the site|pg||
nt|peachy: He said already earlier, but I remember from earlier sessions (IFRC) that EW played precision|pg||

nt|beno b: here again leading partner's suit is a losing option|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ady: did well to find 3NT in CR|pg||

nt|jcwla: 20/20 hand|pg||
nt|xenya: incidentally, E could bid 5@D instead of 5@H, making things easier for partner |pg||
nt|sundiszno: we had some technical problems with the dealing machine, especially it is broken, so we dealt this set by hand|pg||
nt|sundiszno: if there'll be a misdeal, you won't be able to follow that, sorry for the inconvenience|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jcwla: Would you call over 1@D with E?|pg||

nt|sundiszno: hungarian style :)|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|d|nt|roswolf: the colours have dampenes west's ardour|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Hasan A Zaidi|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3NT best|pg||
nt|yo_yo: maybe 3@H isnt forcing so he has to go thro 2NT?|pg||
nt|peachy: Maybe 2S is just a weak two, I dont|pg||
nt|peachy: know|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ady: south balance with suitable shape   only 8 hcp   but passed in first seat|pg||
mb|p|nt|famus: hello everyone|pg||

nt|xenya: NS cam make 6@D on this layout|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Hasan|pg||
nt|xenya: what about 3N? |pg||
pc|c6|nt|panja: looks like S downgraded his hand...10 with 4333..|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah that explains the bidding which is remarkably sane|pg||
nt|xenya: again, good lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: The same help @DKX as needed in 6@D, but need to find @HQXXX in 6|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|chick: not me|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ady: needed a club lead and heart return|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|roswolf: i cant wait to see the next e/w effort!?:(:)|pg||
nt|peachy: Q was the right play, to guarantee entry to hearts, which on rare occ could break 5-0|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vugraphzyj: IMPS |pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|nt|panja: this will just make I guess..it needs backward @H finesse to make 9 tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmmph-  wanton waste of the @D7|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|april7: otherwise losing 2 @S if K is singleton with W|pg||
nt|panja: strictly...pinning @HT...rather than backward finesse|pg||
nt|roswolf: would be cool play though|pg||
pc|d3|nt|neobas: NS were actually on the Israel U26 squad that took the gold medal in Philadelphia last October|pg||
pc|d4|nt|famus: this lead wud be a killer--as long as W unblocks|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|panja: @D4 on last trick was a bad play..and @D continuation here is worse|pg||
nt|peachy: due to good spadespots + Q, declarer can go after the overtrick without jepardizing contract|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|famus: didnt come to that|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
pc|hA|pc|d2|nt|xenya: if S plays a small @D from hand, E should throw th 8, giving declarer a losing choice -- play for 108 in the E hand|pg||

pc|hK|pc|c2|nt|rmb1: I don't think there will be a late enty to dummy to cash @D7 at the end :)|pg||

nt|rmb1: Some one on BBF recommended leaving @D7 in dummy with no interest in the beer card, but hoping the defence would think you were interested|pg||
nt|xenya: two healthy results for GAMAX|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: (with a passed partner besides) :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yeah all the factors point to passing - but change one of them and I would have a grudging admiration.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: here's a Roland slam|pg||
nt|ady: as they lay a sllam is on for east west   can actually make 13 tricks with diamond position|pg||
nt|famus: fight for a partial spot here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rodal f: 19HP EW for best spot|pg||
nt|peachy: rhis hand looks dull to me|pg||

nt|peachy: Max|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: missunderstanding?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: must be natural 2@C, not drury|pg||
mb|2H|nt|patricck: you would want to play 3NT here...a ot of work to make 5@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: may not have been my choice|pg||
nt|roswolf: and 3@C probably denies a fit|pg||
nt|panja: good scheme|pg||
nt|rmb1: Is East worth one try?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one would think so - but maybe 4@C would be natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: Difficult/dangerous/fearless for South to bid 10xxxxx at the 3-level VUL|pg||
nt|peachy: good guess Kath :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: it also depends on what 2NT-4@h means. This sequence may suggest slam-try vlaues  |pg||
mb|p|pc|s2|nt|april7: if 2@D is nonforcing; S should cue the @C|pg||
nt|peachy: Breathtaking bravery vulnerable|pg||
nt|yo_yo: looks like Dumbovich has converted a plus score to a minus|pg||
pc|s6|nt|panja: the thought itself is dangerous|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ady: I used to play a direct raise to 4@S after 2NT was this kind of hand  but  the west hand would not have gone any further |pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|peachy: Maybe W didn't double because his partner opened in third seat, potentially dogpoo|pg||
nt|mdgraham: interesting turn of phrase... |pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|pc|cK|nt|rodal f: Why did S want to be in? @C from N would been best|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|rmb1: There is room to play this sequence, or 4 level transfer, or direct 4@S as a mild slam try|pg||
nt|yo_yo: we are struggling with south's name, we cant abbreviate it|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rmb1: Less so if partner can flash @HAKx|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agree with West, though. Why double opposite a third-hand opener and possibly struggle to get 200? Not worth it   |pg||
pc|dT|nt|chick: Spell it "south" :)|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|patricck: I guess it depends how fast and loose you play the 1 level overcall...  |pg||
nt|roswolf: a spec says "not supporting with North is ridiculous" i agree|pg||
nt|april7: but  still forcing or not,that is the question!!!|pg||
nt|roswolf: true but you must bid the full value of your hand|pg||
nt|neobas: I like to play it as nf, can always cuebid with good hands|pg||
nt|april7: so, cue!!|pg||
nt|roswolf: agree|pg||
nt|patricck: The 6@C slam was worth 10 Imps to team 1|pg||
nt|mdgraham: useful to have a distinction between 2NT-3@h (xfer)-3@s-4@s and 2NT-4@h-4@S|pg||

nt|chick: a club lead won't help much, they need to find the spade sac|pg||
mb|r!|nt|roswolf: true in modern style and with junior elan|pg||

nt|roswolf: play may be tricky|pg||
nt|peachy: as we are not getting comparisons, you can spy on the other table via this link, watch both tables simultanously                                http://www.bridge...|pg||
nt|peachy: base.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: not other table|pg||
nt|chick: E is being timid, but I think I'd bid 4@H ... double then cuebid normally shows about 20 pts|pg||
nt|rmb1: and a bit more work if clubs 4-0|pg||
nt|ady: some open the east hand   |pg||
nt|mdgraham: North deciding discretion is the better part of valour - can they find their 5/5 spade fit? |pg||

mb|2D!|nt|roswolf: south offerring an alternative|pg||
nt|rmb1: as long as 3@D isn't invitational|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|roswolf: n/s have performed very solidly thus far - no doubt now the commentators curse will strike|pg||

pc|cK|pg||
nt|panja: well..East opened 1@D..|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair point robin|pg||

nt|famus: a @d ruff ought to see this home|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||

pc|dT|pc|d6|pc|d3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|roswolf: probably phoney|pg||
nt|panja: East opened 1@C...and it is supposed to be natural...|pg||
nt|rmb1: But 1@C only shows four in the sleepy back-waters of Acolland (e.g. Devon and Sussex)|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|nt|peachy: As opener, I would have passed Rdbl, but ithe XX was alerted so they may have a specific agreement on it|pg||

pc|dA|nt|panja: trump lead should be the norm here..|pg||
nt|rmb1: Previous stanza (different team) 1NT=12-16, 2@C GF relay|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North could simply ask for aces over the 1NT opening, whatever their methods are for that |pg||
nt|ady: north hand seems right for a direct ace asking bid and then appropriate level in diamonds|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|peachy: great pass by North, but it didnt help much that E wusely upgraded, they have better contract available as we all see, tough at the table|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|patricck: NS can make 4@S with the A@C onside and the Q@S probably being picked up, but it was never very likely they could bid it|pg||
nt|roswolf: as north i would have thought i must invite here -any idea about the range of 2@H?|pg||
nt|neobas: 6-10 probably|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok then not to invite|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps not the best choice, 2@D|pg||
nt|famus: very conservative|pg||
pc|h2|pc|dK|nt|chick: assuming 3@H is showing a stopper, 4@C looks right for S|pg||

nt|sybarra: or 6 @C |pg||
nt|chick: all the kibs are voting for 5@D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, NS have presumably paid their entry fee, so they will want to make as many bids as possible|pg||

nt|sybarra: I like 5 @S as suggested by a spec |pg||
nt|jcwla: It is hard to imagine N not going on - a jump like this, right or wrong, should show this type of hand - including worry about @S that N knows is no problemo.|pg||
nt|chick: I think 5@D, N is still not sure how good S's clubs are|pg||
nt|sybarra: more I think about it 5 @S is right |pg||

nt|jcwla: N may fear that has shown better @C than actually has but that ship has sailed.|pg||

nt|rmb1: On  8, EW played in 4@C-4 after East bid 1@S - looks like a misunderstanding.  12IMP to GAMAX and the lead|pg||
nt|xenya: but on the next board (39) EW failed to bid grand -- 12 imps to GAMAX|pg||
nt|famus: 5@s @dA and @hA= -1|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's an easy game to play badly |pg||
nt|peachy: It is typical Precision bidding philosophy: one side asks, the other answers, opposite of natural bidding where hand qualities etc. are often shown instead of asked|pg||
nt|peachy: the match remains tight, the 4th segment started at 116-117, now again only 1 IMP difference|pg||

nt|april7: 4@H ven makable if @C are not opened|pg||
nt|patricck: If North's 2@S said he didn't like spades much then South bought a very lucky hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: south's bid is ill disciplined|pg||

nt|yo_yo: 3@S is often a splinter but obviously not with NS|pg||
nt|peachy: This could be interpreted as splinter, if they have splinter on card|pg||

nt|mdgraham: it does seem a slightly odd treatment, having 3@s here pre-emptive. Maybe 1@s followed by 2@s would be more constructive|pg||
nt|peachy: Dumbovich is an active bidder, we have evidence plenty in this match.  Kibitzer messages are highly disapproving of 3S and I agree|pg||
nt|peachy: Moreover, both opponents are passed hands so there was not much to preempt anyway|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|beno b: 2@C: FG, ask|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d4|nt|beno b: did not investigate since W is limited in 15|pg||
nt|sundiszno: hi all from the site|pg||

pc|dK|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|bobh1: @H shift|pg||

nt|sundiszno: it can happen, that we mis-deal the hand, that case you won't be able to follow it|pg||
nt|sundiszno: hope it won't, sorry for that|pg||
nt|ady: in fact going down      mistake to not play diamond ace at trick 1|pg||
nt|bobh1: on this layout|pg||
nt|bobh1: a guess|pg||
nt|ady: have to say very unlucky for east to pay such a price |pg||
nt|beno b: he lost 2 finesses |pg||
nt|beno b: the other line works only if trumps 32 and  @c 33|pg||

nt|roswolf: dont think so he will cash an ace and then cash out spades|pg||
nt|panja: he should|pg||
nt|rmb1: the luxury of having two aces to cash to look at dummy|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|ady: chance for the leaders  here|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D!|nt|roswolf: now we will see|pg||
nt|roswolf: north may move|pg||
nt|panja: withouth a singleton.. and with AKA..N should not|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 7@H a make played by west     club ruff available if east plays|pg||
mb|1S!|an|GF|mb|p|nt|roswolf: well he has|pg||
nt|rmb1: splinter with stiff ace will not help West value his hand|pg||
nt|rmb1: 4@S is kickback RKCB for @H|pg||
nt|ady: not my cup of tea  1@H from west  15 tricks available in no-trumps here|pg||
nt|rmb1: Gain for Dumbovich on  27 bidding and making 4@H|pg||
mb|1N|nt|peachy: 1S = 11-15, could be sghir (Precision)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: Although North knows South has @D, he can't bid 4@D directly as that may be a forcing relay|pg||
nt|roswolf: now this throws oil on the fire|pg||
nt|rmb1: 5NY showing a void|pg||
nt|rodal f: Belive puppet is on by this type of 1NT opening|pg||

nt|roswolf: a huge result for n/s|pg||
nt|panja: If W wanted to dbl, he should have doubled first time|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: in the OR    west did not open and  north opened 3@S    east doubled and westresponded 4@H passedout|pg||
nt|yo_yo: big loss for Dubovich on 58 when he cashed that A@D|pg||
mb|3N|nt|famus: @d lead wud result in the decision on @h guess|pg||
nt|famus: most likely @sj|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: 11HP=max now at S so a push? The @H quest, but odd for a hook.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hT|nt|yo_yo: why use stayman and then ignfor the 4-4 fit, i wonder|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|nt|rmb1: Surely East should take-out.  If West had a balanced hand he would double 3NT and then 4@D.|pg||

nt|ady: trumping with QS  can only be  right if there is J10 doubleton    so really should have hoped hearts not 5-2 |pg||
nt|beno b: so results of this will be determined later only|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|beno b: potential swing for second to last board|pg||

nt|beno b: this distributional 15 clearly qualifies for a big club|pg||

mb|p|nt|beno b: would be good to know what 2@d is|pg||
nt|ady: e/w must be carefull to bid the right slam    6@H fails |pg||
nt|bobh1: probably majors|pg||
nt|bobh1: N might have throw a 3@C bid in at these colors|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|ady: 6@S    not good as a save for n/s|pg||
nt|beno b: may have opened w 3@c|pg||
nt|bobh1: yes that too|pg||
nt|bobh1: too late now to find the @C sae|pg||
nt|ady: hearts have been bis and supported    strange if south showed both majors with 2@D|pg||
nt|bobh1: save|pg||
nt|bobh1: 2@H is @Ss|pg||
nt|ady: 6@H no chance on a spade lead    but might make without|pg||
nt|beno b: ther may be some doubts among EW about the sequence|pg||
nt|beno b: they are not expereinced partnership|pg||
nt|beno b: Szalay's regular partner is away|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ady: at the moment 6@D looks a long way off|pg||
nt|bobh1: yes neither side has bid its best strain|pg||
nt|beno b: gulyas plays the same sys with his regular but experience matters a lot in a complicated relay system|pg||
nt|ady: if east bids 4@D now   they might reach it|pg||
nt|beno b: this is quite a deal for last board in a SF|pg||
nt|bobh1: if E opened 1@C surely he has to show his @Ds now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|beno b: this is board 64, the other table will play this at the very end|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: have not made this yet|pg||

nt|roswolf: this fine event is brought to BBO vugraph. Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentators, Robin and  Prakash for their company plus wit and perceptive comments and to our specs ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: whose contributions keep us on our toes.|pg||
nt|rmb1: But West has not shown a balanced hand and East should bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s have had a brillant set|pg||

nt|peachy: Especially kudos to all kibitzers who keep us on our toes with great advice and comments|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|yo_yo: not a standard preempt but I like it :)|pg||
nt|peachy: quite a flyer, even favorable vulnerability|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now,  leaping michaels???|pg||
nt|peachy: North-South have shown throught the match that they are active bidders|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no that's if they preempt a major|pg||
nt|peachy: This one sure gives E a problem|pg||
nt|chick: I don't ... yes I know the theory that you are preempting 2 opponents and only 1 partner, but with a Hxx in a major, it's going to cost when partner has that major, like here|pg||
mb|4C!|an|!d+M|nt|roswolf: scheduled restart in 20 mins approx|pg||
nt|peachy: Doing it in second seat with this kind of hand could be hazardous to your score, partner is odds-on to have a good handm there is already one passed opponent....|pg||
nt|yo_yo: in France 4@c = 2suiters red colours  4 @d= 2majors suiters|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H!|an|pass or correct|nt|rmb1: The semifinals continue all day 4x16 boards.  Next stanza at 12:10CET, 11:10GMT in 20+ minutes|pg||
nt|famus: thnks every one---hope the next segment wud create some fire works--good bye all|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's a good system ty mariefrrr|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rmb1: NS's good set had not been helped by team mates in other room|pg||
nt|peachy: so in second seat it is 1:1 while in first it is 2:1|pg||
mb|d|nt|rmb1: Next stanza at 16:00CET 3pm GMT |pg||
nt|chick: yes, even worse|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: they may have overbid this one|pg||
nt|panja: 4@H..hanging partner for showing support..|pg||
nt|ady: a thin 3NT here  assume  north 2@C shows 5 clubs and a 4 card major    or 1 suited clubs?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: as expected, 13 imps to GAMAX on 45|pg||
pc|h3|nt|yo_yo: oh dear South wasnt in on the joke|pg||
pc|h2|nt|roswolf: @D are 3-3 it is not all over yet|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ady: does not  appear to have much chance|pg||
nt|rmb1: -2|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I said earlier, you need an understanding partner if you bid like this|pg||
nt|chick: This will be the final nail in the Dumbovich coffin|pg||
pc|hT|pc|c8|nt|ady: has started well|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pg||
nt|peachy: South of course doesn't know the running score, he might have tried to get a swing, perhaps he would not have doubled early in the match,|pg||
nt|chick: All I can say Kath is that if I ever have the pleasure of playing with you, I hope you are this understanding a partner :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: errr  not always :)|pg||
nt|peachy: 6D would have been making, neither side found it|pg||
nt|chick: the question is, would they have found 6@D without the preempt?|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|dK|pg||
nt|peachy: So my speculation of why this was doubled, could have resulted in them "running to diamonds and then bidding slam|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|nt|roswolf: but is now|pg||
nt|rmb1: Either way there is only 6/7IMP in the match at this stage.  |pg||
mc|12|nt|vugraphzvx: thx all|pg||
nt|chick: a well-deserved -15|pg||
