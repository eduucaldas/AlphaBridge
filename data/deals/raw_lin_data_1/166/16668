nt|ahollan1: 2@C was artificial game force|pg||
nt|alok_daga: early in the day Huang prefers the timid action|pg||
nt|psridhar: looks 2 off and if they crack at other tbl u lose 5 imps|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d4|pg||
pc|s2|nt|psridhar: and 'early' in the day X is a gud strategy if u dont want oppo pushing games and testing your defense in the rest of match, leave alone getting lucky|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to hear the "ugh"  even here when W shows out|pg||
pc|c7|nt|nicksan: "Ugh"followed by a sigh of relief at not being doubled no doubt..|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D!|nt|alok_daga: shud be a likely push in 4spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another catch-all Precision 1@D opener|pg||
nt|psridhar: not easy to find @s fit if N o/c 1nt|pg||
nt|nicksan: Not clear they will find spades if North overcalls 1 NT..|pg||
nt|sybarra: question is what does 1 nt mean |pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: and can N bid it |pg||
nt|ahollan1: many pairs have conventional agreements after RHO overcalls strong NT|pg||
mb|2C!|an|d|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|ahollan1: a common approach is to use same convention as if RHO Opened 1N|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C transfer  then 2@S  should do the trick|pg||
mb|2S|nt|psridhar: the t.o X makes it easy for EW- Huang will get to 1s via trf to @D ( 2@c)|pg||

nt|psridhar: one gud system over 1N overcall is to play Trf advances so that u get another chance to bid -on shapely hands; here i fancy Huang might hv just Xed for cash|pg||

mb|2D!|nt|ahollan1: we'll need to wait for the Closed Room operator to manually enter results before we have any comparisons|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: another easy Major game if they can stay off slam missing 2 key cards|pg||
mb|2H|nt|alok_daga: with 2 key cards missing a likely push |pg||
nt|psridhar: but with @h as trumps only one key missing :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a little better than 50% for slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D!|nt|ahollan1: maybe just 50%|pg||
nt|psridhar: that splinnter will silence W |pg||
mb|d!|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: splinter only makes sense  if 2@D=Game Force Stayman|pg||
pc|s3|nt|psridhar: there is merit in X of splinnter bid to show something other than @d- say lead indicating in lower suit|pg||
nt|alok_daga: 1 of the most effective tools we have in our armoury,splinter|pg||

nt|psridhar: that E hand is a 2@d opg to my knowledge of Precn|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=approx 11-15 HCP, 6+@C or 5@C & 4@H/@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D for me too|pg||
mb|p|nt|nicksan: It's not North thinking here, it's east. The operator puts the bids in as the tray goes through|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: the Original Precision 2@D was only 4414 or 4405|pg||
pc|hK|nt|alok_daga: 2nd cruel misfit cums up,they better off in dmnds|pg||
nt|psridhar: 2@d opg might hv seen NS bid @H or defend @s cont by W undoubled|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and i'm told EW use 2@D as Wagner [Multi] showing weak 2@H/@S opener|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|h7|pg||
nt|nicksan: Looks like down 2 or thereabout|pg||
nt|psridhar: 2@C touch and go -at worst d1 may make -i  am told|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|pc|h8|pc|hA|pg||
nt|psridhar: there are some rather quick analysts in kibs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was wrong about 2@D   they play  2@D=weak 4+@H & 4+@S, not Wagner|pg||
nt|nicksan: i can see declarer making three trumps and three aces, although he may be able to get North to give him a second diamond trick if he finesses|pg||
nt|psridhar: doesnt look like making from here for sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe 4@C   via dummy @C10 to ruff @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @DA, @D ruff, @H to @C10|pg||
nt|nicksan: Right now he's probably considering if there's any merit in finessing in diamonds..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might not even need to start with @D ruff right away|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|pc|cT|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe thinking about what contract is likely after his counterpart opens 1@C|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|pc|s5|pc|c3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: scores are entered in the other room -- but the 2 rooms don't seem to be linked :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what will South bid over a 1@C opening?    1@H or DBL?|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|psridhar: 1@h my choice|pg||

mb|p|nt|psridhar: now if N can 'splinter' in opener's suit...|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@D=4@S & 6/7@D|pg||

mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4S!|mb|p|nt|alok_daga: wd reached|pg||
nt|nicksan: declarer has to be a bit careful in the play - if he simply ruffs spades in the dummy he will find himself with a surprise trump loser. Has to get the hearts going..|pg||
mb|4N!|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar: where did N find out that SS doesnot have KX in @h?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  5   3@CX by North   so same team declares 2@CX and 3@CX   can't be good|pg||
pc|h7|nt|psridhar: if S had KX in @h grand?|pg||
nt|psridhar: may be 4@S crossing 4@H|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|d!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: full credit to Patrick|pg||
nt|nicksan: they may just have to settle for 800 instead..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good question from spec -- why only 2@H from Yang?   maybe he's seen Huang's 3rd seat favoarable openings before :)|pg||
nt|nicksan: If he had, then he wouldn't bid 3 @H now...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would sure like to know about 2N   was it strong balanced or 2 places to play?|pg||
nt|nicksan: The answer may well be "yes" ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the delayed 3@H suggests [to me] that 2N is NOT natural|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N did make on  9  so my running total   NEDUK leads 53-15|pg||

nt|psridhar: will 4@s make him guilty not bidding his @h?|pg||
nt|nicksan: 4 @H is in a bit of trouble here because of the foul trump split. Chances of a ruffing squeeze against South if North misses the diamond shift, or South takes the first Club |pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|psridhar: Verhees at the moment must be imagining they can make 4@H|pg||
