mb|6D|mb|p|nt|othered1: I don't think  you want to be in 7, but if you're there you won't be grasping at straws to find decent lines of play|pg||

nt|othered1: 6@D denying the @CK?|pg||
nt|sybarra: lets hope "we" do not play 6 @D |pg||
nt|othered1: west is a passed hand, so east has some idea of the hand's likely limits.  OTOH is does look like west has been very aggressive here.  Could east be looking for KQxx, xx, KQxxx, ...|pg||
nt|othered1: xx?|pg||
nt|sybarra: these are juniors!  always optimistic and agressive |pg||
mb|7S|mb|p|nt|sybarra: they might use 2 @H as the bust hand over 2 @C |pg||
nt|othered1: with that you'd only need a reasonable trump break and @D 4-2 or 33 or the club finesse on|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and that ugly trump split!  yuk |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: but can be made  |pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: actually with trump split this will be really tough |pg||
nt|othered1: with that lead, east will see easy lines to the grand . . .  until the trump break is disclosed|pg||

pc|s2|nt|othered1: East, of course, has played the suit correctly, now will likely try for north's holding @CK10|pg||
nt|othered1: That's probably more likely than a 3-3 split in @D given information available at this point.|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|pc|h9|pg||

pc|c4|pg||
nt|othered1: This is a decision point for east -- if both club honors aren't on and @D are 3-3, he must ruff @D here, with @S entry to dummy.  But I think that's against the odds here.|pg||
nt|othered1: We can see that there is no legitimate play unless you perhaps win the opening lead and try a low @S to 9, not a realistic play except on this specific lie.|pg||
nt|april7: @D 3-3- is 36% and both honours on are only 25%|pg||
nt|othered1: That's in a vacuum.  Here east has quite a bit of information that might dissuade him from playing for that split.|pg||
