nt|jcmax: Nice, getting into the action! :)|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|beno b: last chance at the beginning|pg||
nt|jcmax: Presumably E's double over 2@D showed a weak NT or something very strong.|pg||
mb|d!|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|bobh1: In the other room N passed|pg||
nt|bobh1: so they had a free run|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcmax: And since E didn't pass W's dbl that doesn't seem to have been penalty. But if it wasn't I don't quite understand, why W didn't just bid his @S suit|pg||
mb|p|pc|c7|pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|c9|pg||
nt|beno b: in case N had spades...|pg||
nt|bobh1: I would want to prempt with the N hand but in the acbl it wouldn't be legal|pg||
nt|beno b: really?|pg||
nt|beno b: what's the minimum requirement for a preempt?|pg||
nt|bobh1: you have to define a 7 hcp range for your weak 2's|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|s5|pc|c8|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bobh1: or else not play any conventional response, such as ogust|pg||
nt|jcmax: Even if it were legal I assure you, you wouldn't want to open a 2@D Multi. Because the opponents would immediately start leaafing through 10 pages of a suggested defence and upset ...|pg||
nt|jcmax: you by not being able to find what they want to bid.|pg||
nt|bobh1: yes its sad|pg||
nt|jcmax: very|pg||
nt|beno b: well, thats against playing multi, I agree|pg||

nt|roswolf: do we know the systems?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Hanna|pg||
nt|panja: hi Hanna|pg||
nt|rmb1: starting out at paved patios between victorian terraces - it would spin from the off |pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||

nt|roswolf: e/w will reach 4@H here|pg||

nt|roswolf: n/s|pg||

nt|sybarra: hello Cornelia,  welcome|pg||
mb|p|nt|neobas: Hey all, welcome to some Israeli junior bridge|pg||
nt|roswolf: the first board is not the place for a psychic adventure|pg||
nt|rmb1: With the first pass being alerted (now withdrawn) I thought we were in for an exciting day|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|pc|c4|nt|rmb1: Less likely to make 11 in 4@S (so much for predictions)|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@S as a final contract?|pg||
nt|rmb1: This is the second 16-board stanza of 4 in the semi-final, finals tomorrow|pg||
nt|ady: good lay of the cards for 4@S|pg||
pc|c7|nt|patricck: Welcome everyone|pg||
nt|neobas: I must admit I have heard of the NS players but not the EW players|pg||
nt|patricck: I believe 1NT is the best bid on the North hand, tho I know it is't to everyone's taste|pg||
nt|april7: hello everybody and good afternoon|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the other semi-fianl wasa 33-33 after 16 boards |pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|s8|nt|Walddk4: http://www.israbridge.com/home/results/2011/jun11-f.pdf  for standings after round 8|pg||
nt|Walddk4: N-S leading by 10 miles|pg||
nt|Walddk4: E-W are young ladies|pg||
nt|neobas: I think it is fair to say the Israeli U21 and U26 teams have good chances of medals at every youth competition so we should see some good bridge here today|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcmax: At the other table E opened 21H getting the auction up high very quickly|pg||
nt|jcmax: Even more surprising not to take a single bid! Maybe 4N now?|pg||
nt|beno b: now it s a wild guess |pg||
nt|bobh1: unenterpristing bidding|pg||
nt|beno b: if you open earlier w 3-4 @h then it is their problem|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|jcmax: Wow! That seem very unilateral bidding 5@H now!|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcmax:  A success I agree, but it would have been so much safer to enter the auction earlier or to at least offer a 2nd suit now|pg||
mb|p|pc|sA|nt|bobh1: unilateral but accurate|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jcmax: Well done by NS not to bid on to 5@S|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s8|pg||
nt|jcmax: And well done by EW at the other table to find the @D ruff. On the @HA lead E played a suit preference @H10 and W duly gave him a ruff|pg||

nt|vugraphzyj: N signaled with the 9@s... and gave a trick away...|pg||
nt|sybarra: that hand may get some discussion .....|pg||
nt|rmb1: so we are in for an exciting day!|pg||
nt|roswolf: i have been doing bbo commentary for a long time and that was truly unbelievable|pg||
nt|xenya: action here|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps|pg||
nt|rodal f: A bit more interesting board.|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: hi all|pg||
nt|xenya: hi Csaba|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphzvx: im ready with the names :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|april7: here EW might go go overboard but perhaps they will stay in a good 3NT contract|pg||
nt|sybarra: in the recap |pg||
nt|rmb1: 1@C strong artificial (I guess)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Csaba, so not Hanna:)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ady: nothing much here    |pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: no :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|april7: 6@C is a possible contrACT|pg||
mb|5H|nt|patricck: 6@C is a lucky contract, but not 6@D|pg||
nt|ady: need to stop around 1NT|pg||
mb|5S|nt|roswolf: indeed think west should pass here|pg||
nt|neobas: I don't like the 3NT rebid tbh|pg||
nt|neobas: I usually play it as solid diamonds and a bit too much to open a Gambling 3NT|pg||
nt|april7: no W is thinking about a 6 @C contract and will have the luck to make it if he decides to do it|pg||
nt|neobas: Anyone for 3@D?|pg||
nt|roswolf: but 4@C may be ok provided they could stop in 4NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: is North worth a positive (if 1@c is strong)?|pg||
nt|ady: west may compete|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not easy to find a @D lead from W if 5@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: 3@D is the more normal rebid...  I don't think 3NT is such an ugly choice tho|pg||
nt|rmb1: I can't find convention cards on line: I think this is a picture of East http://www.bridzs.hu/node/184/52|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is sane so far|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: AH AH|pg||
nt|neobas: "My @C are more solid than your @D"|pg||
nt|roswolf: now a major cue?|pg||
nt|neobas: :)|pg||
nt|april7: now 4 @D and then 6@C perhaps|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 1nt?|pg||
nt|xenya: even 4@S goes down here on an inspired @D lead...|pg||
pc|hA|nt|chick: Signaling Rule  2:  Never signal with a trick.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|roswolf: now e/w should get to 6@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: and   1 is?|pg||
nt|panja: 1@S pass might be the best spot...|pg||
nt|roswolf: we shall see|pg||
nt|panja: would have been difficult to make 7 tricks in 1Nt|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this looks like a normal pass for South now|pg||
nt|ady: cam ,ake 9 tricks in hearts|pg||
pc|hT|nt|rmb1: Another auction you do not see that often (with opener passing 1S)|pg||
nt|rmb1: In the other match, 1@C was an little as an ordinary 16, so North is probably not worth a positive|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|rodal f: Easyer if E doubble|pg||
nt|xenya: now... -- no, almost impossible to find...|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: Lakatos is thinking|pg||
pc|d2|nt|roswolf: must avoid 6NT|pg||
nt|patricck: 6@C can be beaten on a @H lead as long as when the Q@S is run on the first round of the suit South ducks|pg||
nt|april7: W should ofcourse pull trumps before giving up a @S|pg||
nt|roswolf: that would be tough i think|pg||
nt|april7: 6NT possible except on @H lead,but S will lead @H ofcourse|pg||
nt|patricck: sorry, stupid of me, diamonds don't need to be set up in clubs|pg||
nt|chick: Signaling Rule  1:  Every card is a signal (whether you mean it or not)|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s4|nt|rodal f: Well. @H10 give a signal. Might it'll come|pg||
nt|xenya: great!|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|rodal f: Yes. Well done|pg||
pc|hK|nt|april7: well done!|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm that was cool|pg||
nt|neobas: NS will dislike the lucky slam this early|pg||
pc|s5|nt|roswolf: yes they will feel luck isnt with them|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h9|pg||
pc|sA|nt|april7: 3NT by E shouldn't be with a singleton @C from W's point of view ofcourse|pg||
nt|roswolf: possibly|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|s8|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jcwla: Hi all.|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobh1: might be tougher to defend than the auction in the other room|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jcmax: Can anyone work out in percentages what the best line of play in 3NT on a @S lead is? play on @H or @D?|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|jcmax: Clearly NS won the board in the bidding by avoiding the dangerous @S lead|pg||

nt|beno b: you can try @d first|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d6|pc|dK|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dT|pc|dQ|nt|bobh1: making 5|pg||
nt|jcmax: The line of play may depend a bit on whether you think @S are -53 or 4-4|pg||

nt|jcwla: 20/20 hand|pg||
nt|xenya: incidentally, E could bid 5@D instead of 5@H, making things easier for partner |pg||
mb|1H!|an|14+|nt|jcwla: Would you call over 1@D with E?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|an|inv+|mb|p|nt|roswolf: on bd1 in the other room the sane 4@H was reached and earnt 1 imp for royston|pg||
nt|panja: y|pg||
nt|rmb1: I don't like 2@S on 2 aces|pg||
nt|mdgraham: always a question - is two aces to much for a weak two?|pg||
mb|3D|an|GF|mb|p|nt|roswolf: the colours have dampenes west's ardour|pg||
nt|april7: easy 4@S by S with a safety play in @S cashing ace first|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Hasan A Zaidi|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|ady: south balance with suitable shape   only 8 hcp   but passed in first seat|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|nt|roswolf: is this imp pairs or mps?|pg||
nt|panja: NS just have enough for bidding a game..|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rmb1: weak NT and stayman|pg||
nt|rmb1: 14-16 in 3rd|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and succeeds in his mission - push 'em up|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Hasan and well come|pg||
nt|xenya: NS cam make 6@D on this layout|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Hasan|pg||
nt|xenya: what about 3N? |pg||
pc|s3|nt|panja: looks like S downgraded his hand...10 with 4333..|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah that explains the bidding which is remarkably sane|pg||
nt|xenya: again, good lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: The same help @DKX as needed in 6@D, but need to find @HQXXX in 6|pg||
pc|s6|nt|chick: not me|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: needed a club lead and heart return|pg||

nt|roswolf: i cant wait to see the next e/w effort!?:(:)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphzyj: IMPS |pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|nt|panja: this will just make I guess..it needs backward @H finesse to make 9 tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmmph-  wanton waste of the @D7|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|april7: otherwise losing 2 @S if K is singleton with W|pg||
nt|panja: strictly...pinning @HT...rather than backward finesse|pg||
nt|roswolf: would be cool play though|pg||
pc|h8|nt|neobas: NS were actually on the Israel U26 squad that took the gold medal in Philadelphia last October|pg||
pc|hT|nt|famus: this lead wud be a killer--as long as W unblocks|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|panja: @D4 on last trick was a bad play..and @D continuation here is worse|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|famus: didnt come to that|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s9|nt|xenya: if S plays a small @D from hand, E should throw th 8, giving declarer a losing choice -- play for 108 in the E hand|pg||

nt|rmb1: Some one on BBF recommended leaving @D7 in dummy with no interest in the beer card, but hoping the defence would think you were interested|pg||
nt|xenya: two healthy results for GAMAX|pg||

nt|ady: as they lay a sllam is on for east west   can actually make 13 tricks with diamond position|pg||

mb|3C|nt|rodal f: 19HP EW for best spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: "dashing"  3 @C  |pg||
nt|rmb1: 2@S = @C ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: may nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: transfer to @C|pg||
mb|p|pc|s6|nt|april7: missunderstanding?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|patricck: you would want to play 3NT here...a ot of work to make 5@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: may not have been my choice|pg||
nt|roswolf: and 3@C probably denies a fit|pg||
nt|panja: good scheme|pg||
nt|rmb1: Is East worth one try?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one would think so - but maybe 4@C would be natural|pg||
pc|s9|nt|rmb1: Difficult/dangerous/fearless for South to bid 10xxxxx at the 3-level VUL|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it also depends on what 2NT-4@h means. This sequence may suggest slam-try vlaues  |pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|april7: if 2@D is nonforcing; S should cue the @C|pg||
pc|d6|nt|panja: the thought itself is dangerous|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|ady: I used to play a direct raise to 4@S after 2NT was this kind of hand  but  the west hand would not have gone any further |pg||
pc|dT|pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|c5|pg||
nt|rodal f: Why did S want to be in? @C from N would been best|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rmb1: There is room to play this sequence, or 4 level transfer, or direct 4@S as a mild slam try|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rmb1: Less so if partner can flash @HAKx|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s2|nt|patricck: I guess it depends how fast and loose you play the 1 level overcall...  |pg||
nt|roswolf: a spec says "not supporting with North is ridiculous" i agree|pg||
nt|april7: but  still forcing or not,that is the question!!!|pg||
nt|roswolf: true but you must bid the full value of your hand|pg||
nt|neobas: I like to play it as nf, can always cuebid with good hands|pg||

nt|roswolf: agree|pg||
nt|patricck: The 6@C slam was worth 10 Imps to team 1|pg||

nt|ady: another possible slam|pg||
nt|famus: :) well--no further comments on riding Frank--lest we venture into imaginary visions|pg||

nt|xenya: on 34, EW were allowed to play 5@H in the other room -- down one doubled and 5 imps to GAMAX|pg||
mb|1H!|an|14+|nt|mdgraham: +710 is the sort of result that you are slightly worried about|pg||
nt|rmb1: On  17 EW took the money in 3@DX -2 (we do not have the auction) for 2IMP|pg||
nt|ady: 6@C    on aclub finesse|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H!|an|5-8, 3M|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|patricck: Yes, IMP pairs, not teams as I was thinking|pg||

nt|rmb1: XX 3 card raise|pg||

nt|roswolf: rdbl = support showing 3@H?|pg||
nt|famus: will end up in 3@hs max i wud assume|pg||

nt|jcwla: 3@D 3@H 4@H|pg||
mb|2S|nt|panja: now will @S make?|pg||
nt|xenya: the 2@H raise must be very weak -- hence the alert and N's pass|pg||
mb|3C|an|inv|nt|roswolf: NOW THE LAW DECISION?|pg||
nt|panja: will 3@S make rather..?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: true in modern style and with junior elan|pg||
nt|patricck: A couple of nice 10's but no Aces and only 1 King i would have chosen to pass|pg||
nt|april7: going down on @D lead and S from N|pg||
nt|sybarra: Yotam,  this table being compared with Table 1 right |pg||
nt|roswolf: play may be tricky|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sybarra: not other table|pg||
nt|chick: E is being timid, but I think I'd bid 4@H ... double then cuebid normally shows about 20 pts|pg||
nt|rmb1: and a bit more work if clubs 4-0|pg||
nt|ady: some open the east hand   |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: south offerring an alternative|pg||
nt|rmb1: as long as 3@D isn't invitational|pg||
nt|roswolf: north should pass although he may still have a decision over 3@H|pg||
nt|panja: now was the 3@D bid an invitation of some kind or just a preference to @D?|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: I play it as pref as does n/s|pg||
nt|panja: right, as it should be...|pg||
nt|rmb1: routine :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: 3@H*|pg||
nt|panja: because 3@H was an option for invitation as Andras(kib) points out..|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: 2 down on best defence|pg||
nt|ady: leaders may lose  ground here|pg||
nt|famus: no help in @cs--a little in @ds--did that what all of these neant--wonder|pg||
pc|s5|nt|famus: meant|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@D ask for hold I belive. |pg||
pc|sA|nt|roswolf: n/s have performed very solidly thus far - no doubt now the commentators curse will strike|pg||
nt|rmb1: EW have only an eight card fit but maybe do not know about the dounble fit in @C which makes 3@H more attractive|pg||
nt|xenya: accurate prediction, Hasan|pg||
pc|s4|nt|panja: well..East opened 1@D..|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair point robin|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|roswolf: one of my rules when playing against juniors is in defence ALWAYS be prepared that they are MINIMUM for their bidding|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|nt|panja: sorry..1@C|pg||
nt|famus: a @d ruff ought to see this home|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jcwla: Well, I think the value shown by that sequence changes when pd has shown 9-11 or so as here, have to be able to search for best game.|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT on the same finesse as 6@C  on the spade lead|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|pc|s9|nt|roswolf: probably phoney|pg||
nt|panja: East opened 1@C...and it is supposed to be natural...|pg||
nt|rmb1: But 1@C only shows four in the sleepy back-waters of Acolland (e.g. Devon and Sussex)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|s7|pc|h2|nt|april7: S can make 3@D so no swing|pg||

pc|s6|pg||
nt|chick: perhaps, but should E not bid 3@H over the X?|pg||

nt|mdgraham: certainly swing potential in the last two boards|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S!|an|14+|nt|chick: Jordan, what would you play the 3@DX to mean if you were South?|pg||

nt|neobas: I recently started playing 2@H as both Majors and I must say I really do like it|pg||

mb|p|nt|panja: trump lead should be the norm here..|pg||
nt|rmb1: Previous stanza (different team) 1NT=12-16, 2@C GF relay|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North could simply ask for aces over the 1NT opening, whatever their methods are for that |pg||
nt|ady: north hand seems right for a direct ace asking bid and then appropriate level in diamonds|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|patricck: NS can make 4@S with the A@C onside and the Q@S probably being picked up, but it was never very likely they could bid it|pg||
nt|roswolf: as north i would have thought i must invite here -any idea about the range of 2@H?|pg||
nt|neobas: 6-10 probably|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok then not to invite|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps not the best choice, 2@D|pg||
nt|famus: very conservative|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|chick: assuming 3@H is showing a stopper, 4@C looks right for S|pg||

nt|sybarra: or 6 @C |pg||
nt|chick: all the kibs are voting for 5@D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, NS have presumably paid their entry fee, so they will want to make as many bids as possible|pg||

nt|sybarra: or just 5 @D.... |pg||
nt|sybarra: my bet is on 6 @D |pg||
nt|sybarra: I like 5 @S as suggested by a spec |pg||
nt|jcwla: It is hard to imagine N not going on - a jump like this, right or wrong, should show this type of hand - including worry about @S that N knows is no problemo.|pg||
nt|chick: I think 5@D, N is still not sure how good S's clubs are|pg||
nt|sybarra: more I think about it 5 @S is right |pg||
nt|jcwla: And primo @C's.|pg||
nt|jcwla: N may fear that has shown better @C than actually has but that ship has sailed.|pg||
nt|sybarra: N should know 6 level is ok,   dont you think?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Totally.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm - this seems to be over-complicating things|pg||

pc|dA|nt|rmb1: Hope South recognises this is the end of the auction|pg||
nt|mdgraham: This hand is ideal for one of Roland's unfavourite conventions|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rmb1: In open room, NS bid to 3NT on  3 but only -1 for flat.  On  4, NS got in to the auction and reached 4@H-1 for 5IMP (out)|pg||
nt|famus: 3@hs in my opinion wud be more interesting|pg||

nt|ady: certain to bid game I would think|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1N=2D=3D=4D=4H is always a test of partnership understanding|pg||
