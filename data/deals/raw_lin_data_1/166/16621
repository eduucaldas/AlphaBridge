pc|s3|nt|peachy: this is a thin slam, 4H could be RKC or otherwise conventional, alerted|pg||
nt|marcsmith: true|pg||
nt|janm: Declarer has 2 spades and a club to lose and will ahve to do something to avoid a diamond loser as well, so that's an excellent result from the Open Room|pg||

mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: will Simpson open a Forcing 1@C before Antoff can open a Forcing 1@C??|pg||
nt|janm: In the other room, NS cashed their spades and the club ace and North then led a club into declarer, which still wouldn't have been fatal, but North later pitched all of his spades ...|pg||
nt|janm: and South got squeezed in spades and diamonds for the 10th trick. Not gread defense, but well done by declarer to capitalize on it|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: nope|pg||
mb|p|nt|casenjo:  with a lucky lie of the cards, NS makes 6 diamonds....they should be happy to get to 3nt|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: 1@H has a maximum of 16 HCP|pg||
nt|peachy: The hand certainly is play-strong|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Tough bid for North - I think he has to bid 3@s, but he's not happy (too many values, not good enough spades)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: only 2@H in the other room :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: Antoff trap passing?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: that may make it difficult to reach 7@H/@S/NT|pg||
nt|casenjo:  hello Andrew|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|peachy: I hope they are on the same wavelength|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder why Antoff not just taking charge via  something like RKC|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|peachy: this could make on the nose|pg||
nt|marcsmith: not sure that I wouldn't have prefered 2@S on that West hand|pg||
nt|marcsmith: that way you get to defend 3@C (afrer 1@S-P-2@S-X-P-3@C-AP)|pg||
nt|peachy: It is a matter of style, my bid would have been 2S|pg||
nt|marcsmith: seems clear to me -- just seems technically better|pg||
nt|peachy: Even if N wanted to bid 2C (different cards mind you) he might think twice bidding over 2S rather than 1NT|pg||
nt|janm: 6@d would be very optimistic! But you're right that they make it since even if they start diamonds by playing the K they can't rely on restricted choice missing the 8, so will have ...|pg||
nt|janm: to drop the doubleton QJ|pg||
nt|janm: Funny, I thought that 3@h was pretty down the middle - surprising to see the trailing team open only 2, although maybe that was the way East chose to swing|pg||
pc|cA|nt|marcsmith: bad hand with fit wants to get the auction as high as possible as quickly as possible|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bidding anything that sounds remotely passable just seems too high risk|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lest we forget -- full credit to Sartaj for muddying the water with 2@C|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unless it was operator error and Antoff bid 2@C :)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|peachy: If our operator is not too busy, he will likely show us alerts etc.  But as someone said "the operator jos is like being a long-tailed cat in a small room full of rocking chairs" |pg||
nt|peachy: *job|pg||
nt|ahollan1: play will be much faster than the bidding|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|peachy: Tell that to the Constructive Raise crowd:)|pg||
nt|marcsmith: bidding 1NT makes things so much easier for NS|pg||
nt|marcsmith: stupid method -- use the 1NT sequence for the constructive raise if you must|pg||
nt|marcsmith: with a bad hand you want to pre-empt|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d8|pc|d4|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|tejjyid: hi - 2@H very conservative in the modern game|pg||
pc|c4|nt|peachy: 3Nt was better, this requires help from opponents (likely not coming though)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|peachy: When holding long trumps, the textbook approach is to leadd a long suit, hoping to force declarer to shorten his trumps.  That isn't happening here though|pg||
nt|peachy: called "tap"|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s4|pg||
nt|peachy: Well, I'll leave the show in your capable hands Doc and Marc, bhanks and enjoy!|pg||
nt|peachy: Thanks|pg||
nt|marcsmith: the general standard of bidding these days is much higher than it used to be so you have to consider what makes things the most difficult for the opponents|pg||

pc|s5|pc|cT|pc|cK|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||
nt|marcsmith: always better to defend 3@C than 2@C, particularly when the opps can make exactly 8 tricks|pg||
nt|raghavan: Even if CJ scores, C9 will be finessed|pg||
nt|marcsmith: has to lose a trump, so surely it's clear to play a trump to the Q so you can ruff the last spade in dumy|pg||
nt|raghavan: Yes Marc, EW have 8 spades and atleast 18 points - both will make 2 in their suits|pg||
nt|marcsmith: indeed|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but swinging conservatively; sounds like J Edgar Hoover at a nightclub|pg||

nt|janm: :). But it is swinging to do something different from what you think will be done in the other room, isn't it?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|peachy: 2D looks like Multi, but I m guessing|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|tejjyid: sure - but swing to win 5 imps not my idea of much fun |pg||

nt|raghavan: NS in trouble|pg||
nt|raghavan: may bid 3C|pg||
mb|2N|an| |mb|p|nt|peachy: 3Nt is down one off the top on a diamond or spade lead, but 5C should make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that splinter will excite Nunn|pg||
nt|peachy: the classical spot to have a misundetstanding, even among established partnerships|pg||
nt|janm: Trailing by over 50 IMPs isn't my idea of fun :), but you do what you can I guess|pg||
nt|tejjyid: right :)|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marcsmith: dreadful bid by East|pg||
nt|marcsmith: surely XX shows an interest in penalising|pg||
pc|d5|nt|marcsmith: why get in partner''s way?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  2 spades was making 3 or 4, so North did  nice job of balancing|pg||
nt|janm: He has to get the clubs right to make this I think - should he?|pg||
nt|janm: Everyone hates to sell out to 2@s|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think so|pg||
nt|tejjyid: mind you, it's too close for me to calculate the difference|pg||
nt|janm: The only option would be to try to strip the majors and then lead a club toward the JT, hoping for both honors on his right, but with diamonds 3-1, he can't strip the majors and ...|pg||
nt|janm: end up with a trump in dummy, so that won't be possible here|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: 6@C confirming 0@H and 1 key card|pg||
pc|d6|nt|peachy: nicely done|pg||

nt|marcsmith: now corrected :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this too will play quickly|pg||
nt|casenjo:  In the other room, west broke the club suit, so NS will not have a problem|pg||
nt|casenjo:  South has some work to do here|pg||
pc|s6|nt|tejjyid: I'd be in 4@S EW if I were 50 imps down|pg||
nt|janm: Lead Majors and see what the opponents do?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|peachy: scarcity of dummy entries will make this difficult to make|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|raghavan: have EW missed game again in H?|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|peachy: virtusally does not matter almost whatever E next plays|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: well maybe Nunn will concentrate on best way to make 13 tricks without risking 12|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: nope -- maximizing play for 12 tricks|pg||
nt|casenjo:  I agree with Andrew, I don;t think selling out to 3 diamonds is a way to gain imps|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|janm: Good point, Andrew - certainly selling out to 3@d isn't likely to pick up anything and East can guess (hope) that partner has that stiff @d|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|s9|pc|sQ|pg||

nt|ahollan1: EW also play Super Drury -- but i don't know what that is :(|pg||
nt|peachy: let us hope it comes up so we find out|pg||
nt|tejjyid: West played the juniors, so he atthe tail end of 2 weeks pretty solid bridge|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|tejjyid: HI, yes, it's hard work as a solo commentator|pg||
nt|tejjyid: he's a good player but he wouldn't be human if he weren't a bit tired|pg||
nt|casenjo:  I believe 3 diamonds is a forcing raise in diamonds, and 3 clubs would have been checkback|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: another cold slam for EW|pg||
nt|tejjyid: now I'm here you can criticise my bidding & analysis :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it has always been a popular recreation|pg||
nt|peachy: I was just going to say the same heh|pg||
mb|3N|nt|janm: I wonder whether Peake's slow opening bid was because he was considering downgrading this and opening 1NT - it does have a lot of negative factors|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: missed|pg||
nt|marcsmith: hardly a great one, but ....|pg||
nt|marcsmith: basically needs @SK onside and either doubleton king or South to hold four+ diamonds|pg||
nt|marcsmith: plus trumps 3-2 of course|pg||
nt|marcsmith: so hardly textbook|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: NS appear not to be sure of their methods here|pg||
nt|tejjyid: at least one of them has underbid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: btw - Simpson might have tried 2@H instead of DBL|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: I don't think downgrading is a word in PEake's vocabulary|pg||

pc|s8|nt|ahollan1: i doubt that would affect the final contract, but still|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|casenjo:  diamonds was the makeable game, which is where Gosney was headed|pg||

nt|marcsmith: no |pg||
nt|peachy: I did mean the first pass. The second is questionable IMO|pg||
mb|1C|nt|tejjyid: right - if South can have a hand so week that PASS by NOrth iscorrect the 2nd time, why is SOuth bidding at all?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other match, Milne opened Nunn's hand 2@S in 3rd seat    wow|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=15-17|pg||
nt|tejjyid: mind you, if you play with Peake for a while, you probably assume all hands are minimum for the previous auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: you can't bid 1@S -- that would show an unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|marcsmith: it's the problem with 5-card majors|pg||
nt|tejjyid: On with the show...|pg||
nt|tejjyid: these 5-5 isfits are ugly to bid and play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D = @H or @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: like multi  |pg||
nt|peachy: is it what MultiLandy is|pg||
nt|janm: If West bid 4@c over 3@h, East should recognize that the spades are dangerous and get them to 5@d|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|peachy: At IMPs, vulnerable games should be aggressively bid, partly because it yields IMPs and prtly because if it doesnt yield IMPs, then it will be a push (down both tables)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H = pass/correct|pg||
nt|janm: Maybe :)|pg||
nt|casenjo:  yes, 4 clubs is great bid and 4nt is playable spot|pg||
mb|2C|nt|marcsmith: much easier after a 1@S opening of course|pg||
nt|marcsmith: the French bid 1@S on these balanced hands, but it's virtually unplayable IMHO|pg||
nt|raghavan: another slam in horizon??|pg||
nt|marcsmith: on two finesses again|pg||
nt|raghavan: in H|pg||
nt|marcsmith: 6@H or pass|pg||
mb|2H|nt|tejjyid: but this one has som much power that not much can go wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: strong notrump just gets no respect|pg||
nt|peachy: South, despite his 7HCP, reasonably casnnot enter the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Tough choice between 2@c and RDBL for North - he chose to show the offensive nature of his hand|pg||
mb|p|pc|cJ|nt|marcsmith: wow -- 4@H seems really weak|pg||
nt|marcsmith: I'd rather pass and defend even at this vul than just bid game|pg||
nt|peachy: Yes, I was still on the last hand, sry all|pg||
nt|janm: "offensive" - isn't that a great double meaning word? I like offensive hands, but it sounds unlikeable|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: NS use standard count/attitude  but  Odd/Even on 1st discard|pg||
pc|cA|nt|tejjyid: Wonder if 3@c was really natural? I note no alert|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|s7|nt|peachy: There hasve been no alerts, but we'll manage, Unfortunately I am not familiar with either pair's methods|pg||
nt|tejjyid: very useful word...|pg||
pc|sK|nt|tejjyid: I can say that only NS are familiar with their methods...|pg||
pc|s2|nt|peachy: In 2/1,after a GF hss been established, many play that 4th suit is natural. And if turns out "not" then it was lacking clear direction and shows a fragment|pg||

mb|p|nt|tejjyid: I like X - Peake is an agressive & imaginative bidder|pg||
nt|peachy: In a "light opening" style, E might have opened the bidding|pg||

mb|2N|nt|jaapfr: I agree Jan web BBO very tough to deal with:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: good bid by N|pg||

mb|3H|nt|peachy: let's see if he hs still steam to bid, if so, 2NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: I bet he WANTS tobid|pg||
nt|peachy: to offer two places to play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=8+ HCP, 0-2 controls  [A=2 K=1]|pg||
mb|3S|nt|janm: Look how much better this hand is than the one that Peake opened 1@d and rebid 2NT with, even though it's only one more HCP|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: since open 1N=15-17,  this sequence shows 18+|pg||
mb|4C|nt|tejjyid: but oposite a passed partner, there's really not much upside|pg||
nt|ahollan1: guessing 2@S=@C & @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: now 3@H to show shortness??|pg||
nt|tejjyid: & NOrth has an even easier slam try!|pg||
nt|casenjo:  hard values, instead of those QJs he had in he black suits|pg||
nt|janm: I agree, Andrew and it's very hard to play something other than your normal style|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|marcsmith: West going to have to find an awful lot of discards now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if E did start with a very thin 2@D bidding could be different still 3nt NS?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this makes 6@D, but will they get past 3N?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes -- 6@D is terrible because it requires West to hold specifically @DKx|pg||
nt|peachy: That is what Antoff prob thinking too\|pg||
nt|peachy: I mean - whether to go for slam try or not|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there is an outside chance that Simpson holds @CK and @DK  [2 controls]|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|marcsmith: can make 12 by crossing to the @C10, cashing @HA and taking spade finesse|pg||
nt|peachy: North's only good spots are in hearts opposite known singl, so might go conservative|pg||
nt|tejjyid: that's true - I never have any idea what's happeneing at the other table anyway & trying to adjust to it does my head in|pg||
nt|casenjo:  this hand looks like a 2NT opener and the other looked like a 1NT openerm and as Jan pointed out, only 1 point diffrence|pg||
nt|janm: You're way ahead of me, I never know what's happening at my table :)|pg||
nt|casenjo:  I often forget that there is another table|pg||
nt|tejjyid: :)|pg||
nt|janm: Has Grewcock done enough, or should he go beyond game with this hand?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  one less thing to worry about|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|peachy: exactly, and unfavorable, to boot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on the flip side -- @D would be played by South -- so the @SKx is questionable value|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Grewcock has those nice @S|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think jhe should try|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: as it is -- some might have treated south hand as 0-7 HCP and responded 1@D|pg||
nt|janm: To some extent it may depend on whether 4@d was mandatory - for me it would be, since it's below game, so he definitely has extra values. And he agrees and looks to be forcing to ...|pg||
nt|janm: slam|pg||
nt|tejjyid: mind you, I hate the idea that 4NT is BW there|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i don't know if the responses change for a passed hand :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Well, if you don't want to bid BW, you don't have to - surely he could cue bid either minor if he wanted to tell instead of blasting?|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: I want to bid 4NT to say - I have good trumps|pg||
nt|janm: I think he had decided to bid a slam and was just making sure that there weren't 2 keycards off. Could North have much less than this? Maybe not the club Q but that wouldn't matter|pg||
nt|casenjo:  I like 5 clubs and could even tolerate 5 hearts|pg||

nt|casenjo:  South has been ultra conservative this set|pg||

nt|peachy: I would have preferred an unambiguous 3S|pg||
pc|d3|nt|peachy: ortwo ranges, weak OR strong but not intermediate hand|pg||
nt|tejjyid: right. I like 2NT as waiting; asks for fragment or longer/better suit|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Works well on this hand |pg||
nt|peachy: but not knowing their sys, my opinion is based on assumption|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since 2@C is game force, why jump to 3@S??|pg||

mb|1C|nt|ahollan1: making vs +1 = no imp difference  it was 7 vs 9 tricks that mattered|pg||

nt|ahollan1: NS play Big Club with Strong 1N opener|pg||
nt|janm: In the other room, N didn't like selling out to 2@s when he had such a good club suit and West might well have had only 3, but 3@c was not a success - I'll bet that Yezerski will ...|pg||
nt|janm: get away with the immediate 3@c where Hans didn't get away with the delayed bid - How can Peake resist bidding those spades?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N must have said something about 1 or both minors|pg||

nt|peachy: Hello everybody|pg||
nt|marcsmith: this looks like a chance for NS to get into trouble -- no fit and bad breaks usually a recipe for disaster|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: hmmm -- not long any strong two i ever saw|pg||
nt|peachy: strong has changed meaning|pg||
nt|marcsmith: not enough tho|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: oh, okay, corected :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: big 1@C|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|nt|marcsmith: intermediate at best i'd say|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=3 controls [A=2 K=1]  denies solid 6+ suit|pg||
nt|janm: A lot of IMPs this set, with pretty much no change in the score|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|casenjo:  NS could not have picked up 60+, but they could have picked up about 30 if they were perfect|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|marcsmith: hard for EW to punish it tho|pg||
nt|marcsmith: the @S 10 is a useful card too|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|peachy: 2D multi|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at this point, we're all guessing|pg||
nt|peachy: it is a race, who is going to be declarer :)|pg||
nt|janm: 2@s seems like a strange bid to me - not sure what it's supposed to be - fit-showing I guess|pg||
pc|cA|nt|tejjyid: East has good shape - but a lot of losers opposite a weak raise|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: 2@C must resemble Stayman but not promise a 4 card major|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since Sartaj didn't inject 2@H bid -- 3N might just fetch   but we can see that 5@D is cold on any lead|pg||
nt|peachy: Perhaps. However, E is so poor that he might try to hit partner's suit which logically is best effort at heart|pg||
nt|casenjo:  that's the only thing makes sense to me|pg||
pc|c6|nt|marcsmith: that removes the entry to the @DK before declarer can use it too|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|peachy: declarer will likely get the spade suit right , ie. no point finessing|pg||
nt|peachy: the likelihood of length in hearts with partner is greater than likelihood of length in spades|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|d8|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|peachy: the likelihood of S having the Q is greater|pg||
nt|tejjyid: he won't go many down, i'm sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S looks like risky bid, but they're on same wavelength  [@D agreed]|pg||
nt|peachy: smooth sailing to the best contract here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not in my world!!    if using 1st/2nd round cues up the line   4@S said no @H control, so 5@C says I CONTROL @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: otherwise just signoff knowing 2+@H losers|pg||
nt|peachy: Your logic holds water, Al|pg||
nt|peachy: I overlooked that, Simpson might thnk N has singleton H, might he?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on the other hand -- a psychic cue with that agreement may stop @H lead against slam|pg||
nt|janm: It's gotten them a level higher than the other room, let's see if it makes any difference|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sA|nt|marcsmith: @SK was better|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i'm terrible at those tactical calls|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but any is too many|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and Simpson thought as I about @H control|pg||
nt|peachy: I'm chicken, I try to be honest|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as me?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: where's a grammarian when i really need one?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  need to hold it to losing a spade, 2 clubs and 1 heart|pg||
pc|cK|nt|peachy: Okay, so "IF" 5C was tactical bluff, THEN we will get to see if it worked|pg||
nt|peachy: hardly possible w W on lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh yeah --- Hans is on lead, so false cue wasn't ever going to work :)|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c8|pc|h9|nt|peachy: 2 down will still be okay, against air|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cT|pg||
nt|peachy: but even then, I cant see him making|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|nt|marcsmith: yes, but NS likely to get into trouble at the other table too, so -200 may not be so bad|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Yezerski DID need a swing -- just not this kind|pg||
pc|h3|nt|janm: I think after the @d shift that should be possible - pitch the 4th club on the spade and then take the heart finesse|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hJ|nt|marcsmith: why East couldn't play the @H10 after his partner won with the jack earlier is beyond me|pg||
