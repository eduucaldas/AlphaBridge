nt|mrdct: hi everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: looks like a dull 4S for EW although 12 tricks can be made with the favourable diamond position|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mrdct: EW play a variant of the fantunes system|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: hi all e/w are playing fantunes|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|mrdct: 1@h presumedly a transfer to @S|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|peachy: We'll get settled here shortly, welcome back everybody.  http://www.summerfestivalofbridge.com/index.php|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: if they got to 6, declarer would have a 50-50 guess -- whether to play for DJ singleton with north or DK singleton with south|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marcsmith: my guess is 1 IMP to BROWN|pg||
nt|mrdct: EW play a weak 1NT opening, so the 1NT rebid is usually strong|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: good start for EW as 3NT looks to be a superior contract to 4@s|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mrdct: although both appear to make comfortably today|pg||
pc|dA|nt|marcsmith: at the other table they played from West and north led his singleton, solving declarer's problems in the suit|pg||
nt|marcsmith: draw trumps and play ace and another diamond looks like a normal line here|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|pg||

mb|1S|nt|marcsmith: EW can make 2C NS a couple of either major |pg||
nt|nickf: can we have player names please|pg||
nt|janm:  Sorry to be a little late - I just got a new computer and it isn't playing well with the Windows BBO client|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: Klinger won the South-West Pacific Teams which finished a couple of hours ago and is the top qualifier to the National Open Teams finals|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Im trying to find them out|pg||
mb|2S|nt|peachy: EW have the majority of HCP but  shapes run wild|pg||
mb|d|nt|mrdct: this match is from the top section of the draw, whereby the loser gets a second chance|pg||
nt|mrdct: EW could be in trouble here but vulnerability is on their side|pg||
nt|ahollan1: favorable vulnerability = bid 'em up!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm:  I'll try not to get too confused using the web version :)|pg||
nt|janm:  In the other room, East bid 3@s over the takeout DBL of 2@s - here, with East passing, we may see NS declare.|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|mrdct: 3NT for NS is touch and go|pg||
nt|janm:  I'm guessing that 2NT is some sort of Lebensohl, asking his partner to bid 3@c and showing a non-constructive hand|pg||
mb|3N|nt|marcsmith: heart lead a spade switch is best for the defence -- not obvious to find tho|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: only has 8 obvious tricks but the defence could falter and present a @s trick for delcarer before getting to their 5 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: can Thompson find the double hook in @C for the make??|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm:  Most of us play Lebensohl after a T/O DBL of a weak 2 bid, but not everyone does in this auction - in fact, maybe here S is playing Lebensohl and N isn't|pg||
pc|s3|nt|janm:  Although N certainly has a good hand and good support for clubs and spade stoppers, so maybe he bid 3NT on the theory that 9 tricks would be as easy in NT as in clubs|pg||
pc|sA|nt|nickf: Can we have the player names please?|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mrdct: if delcarer plays on @s himself it will need to be a low @s to the 9|pg||
nt|mrdct: although actually low to Q will also work if he drops the J on the 2nd round of @s|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c2|nt|janm:  On this hand, I think he's going to be wrong - with no club spots so that West doesn't even have to hold off to have the clubs stopped (although surely he will duck here) - there isn't much of a source of tricks in NT|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|mrdct: what he doesn't want to do is cash @d first as that could very easily set up the 5th defensive trick|pg||
nt|mrdct: choosing to win is hand looks like he's planning to go after @s immediately|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|c7|pc|c9|pg||
nt|marcsmith: the south hand is going to get mangled when declarer runs the clubs|pg||
nt|janm:  I'll make my first (and probably wrong) prediction and bet on 5 tricks for declarer - 2 spades, 1 each in the red suits and 1 club|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mrdct: in great shape to make this now|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: you can spy on the other vugraph tables using http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|janm:  So the Milne team will be plus at both tables here, to increase their lead|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|marcsmith: has to throw one spade and one heart|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you were here last set, i must correct bad info i gave|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: the matches are 32 boards  so this is the final segment of the match|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: the winner here moves on to the Semi-Final, the loser gets a 2nd chance  [but i think the other match is win or go home]|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|marcsmith: if South throws S9 defence can still prevail|pg||
nt|mrdct: cashing out now|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|c6|pc|d9|pc|d2|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|hT|pg||
nt|janm:  For a moment I thought that EW could hold declarer to 4 tricks, by clearing diamonds and then getting in with the heart A, but there's no entry to the West hand, so I'll go back to 5 for declarere - or maybe not - he's not going to get the heart|pg||

nt|pelu: green against red - many would open 4@s|pg||
nt|chilloncan: and bad choice of spade to ruff with. if he ruffed higher and save smaller...|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|chilloncan: this 3D preempt is better than opening 5NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: other than that i dont see its charm. medocre suit, bad shape, and way too low a ratio of offense to defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: this will be interesting|pg||
mb|p|pc|s4|pc|sJ|pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|chilloncan: also you have a decent dummy for either major|pg||
pc|h4|nt|pelu: strange bidding in OR - same start, but on the X east bid 2@d - and then West 5@D over 4@s|pg||
nt|chilloncan: maybe S thinks he is down 50|pg||
nt|caitlin: with preempt then 3N, not uncommon to lay down an Ace to look at dummy|pg||
pc|h3|nt|frankaus: with n7 in front  - ducking is an unnecessary  risk IMO|pg||

nt|ahollan1: nicely done|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: there are only a few of us in the room so if there's something special you want to discuss -- just holler|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3H|nt|mrdct: Alex Smirnov is a regular on the german open team and the welland team in US nationals|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i believe 2@D=artifiicial game force|pg||
mb|3N|nt|janm:  Will our West be able to restrain himself from bidding 3NT with all those spade stoppers and not much else? No|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: he has been a regular visitor to the main australian summer events in recent years - particularly Youth Week|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H = 4+ hcp, no good suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|nickf: -------------------------------------------------->   Can you please put the player names in?|pg||
mb|p|pc|s6|nt|mrdct: south worth a raise now given that he passed 1st round|pg||
nt|mrdct: north has quite a good hand with some game prospects even opposite a very weak hand|pg||
nt|janm:  Now we'll get to see whether NS can do as well here as in the other room. Looks as if they need to get clubs going, but they do have all those aces, so should manage the club shift when it becomes obvious that spades are pretty hopeless|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|marcsmith: a heart lead or switch forces declarer to guess the clubs, but he can afford a wrong guess on a spade continuation|pg||
nt|mrdct: but he will anticipate that communication will likely be a problem|pg||
nt|mrdct: even more so with dummy a 4333|pg||
nt|janm:  Which red suit do you attack first?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: the players in the NOT [national open teams]  qualified for the event via a 14-round swiss event called the SWPT|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: Klinger won that event after gaining the lead in round 3 or 4 [and never looked back]|pg||
nt|peachy: E wants a diamond lead, I assume|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: back to back 5@D contracts   you won't see that often -- especially in non-imp games|pg||
pc|hA|nt|marcsmith: now he has to guess the clubs again|pg||
nt|peachy: this is a challenging hand to make, but not impossible|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|pg||
nt|mrdct: at the risk of some differing views, i would say that EW have been quite easily the top pair in Victoria for the past 5 years or so|pg||
nt|janm:  I guess hearts, since then perhaps it won't be clear to the defenders which minor they want to play. Maybe heart to the ten, ducked, second heart won, now will N know to shift to clubs? |pg||
pc|s8|nt|janm:  Even if he doesn't though, S can hold up the diamond ace and declarer only has 4 hearts, 1 spade and 1 diamond before he has to give up a black ace.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|peachy: But I believe Justin would make it.  Has to avoid giving too many natural spade tricks to the opponents|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: wow -- i just noticed that the other room played 10@D on last hand -- so 4 imps to Bloom|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|timb: As a commentator, I'm not a fan of the 3@H but I can't imagine not bidding 3@H at the table|pg||
nt|timb: it's also known as being a "result merchant" :)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|cJ|mc|10|nt|timb: Edgtton has done well! North cannot have @CK and he has nine tricks|pg||

mb|4H|nt|mrdct: the milne team are all under 30, indeed a couple of them are under 20 with smirnov the "senior" on the team at age 28|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS play a souped up 2/1 but  Weak NT 1st/2nd seat|pg||

nt|janm:  Here we see a difference in style with the West hand - in the other room, West rebid 1@s and played in spades. Here, W showed his balanced hand and is in hearts - Both will make on this hand - I'm not sure which would survive bad breaks better|pg||

nt|pelu: West are missing 3 keycards ; 2 Aces and @HK - can pd have 2 of them?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: not vul Hans would open 2@S -- but this hand will pass|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marcsmith: 5@D is clearly where you want to play|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|mrdct: 3NT for NS here with @c 2-2|pg||

mb|4D|an|Id like to decide if 4s|nt|ahollan1: 3rd/4th seat  NS play 1N=good14 to bad 17|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D = @S and @C/@D  [ASPRO]|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm:  Bridge is a funny game, isn't it - if North had a club singleton, instead of a diamond singleton, his splinter would be encouraging for S, but here, it's going to turn S off, yet it's really the same, since N has only 3 clubs and they can go on |pg||
nt|janm:  the diamond KQ leaving him with a club stiff |pg||
mb|4H|nt|marcsmith: presumably 1@S shows four spades and a negative double would deny four|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N looks like either transfer or lebensohl|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or  transfer lebensohl|pg||
nt|ahollan1: either way   i think Thompson is supposed to bid 3@C unless holding a really strong hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmmm maybe they play 2@D=@S & another  [including @H]|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|peachy: I don't know what NS 1NT vul opening range is, but I assume 10-12. Kibitzer says "gutsy"|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: 2@H likely now from South|pg||
pc|c8|nt|marcsmith: bit too good for 3@C|pg||
nt|janm:  Of course N wouldn't have enough to splinter if he weren't a passed hand. |pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: Gosney in 1N West|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|marcsmith: now 3@D from north and another game try with 4@C by south seems sensibel|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Klinger led the 14 round Qualifying Event [South-West Pacific Teams] from Round 3 or 4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another possible double partscore swing -- but both will be close|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the defenders from 2010, McManus just barely made it into the NOT in the final match of the SWPT|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mrdct: this looks like the road to 3NT|pg||
nt|peachy: could be 12-14 with an upgrade to 12 due to good spots|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mrdct: or not|pg||
nt|mrdct: 5@c a maker also |pg||
nt|peachy: tricky lead but declarer has no other hope than K now|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but they were knocked out last night in the NOT Round of 20|pg||
pc|d5|nt|peachy: South cnnot go wrong nearly whatever he returns|pg||
nt|peachy: but understandably he wants to weigh the options at this time|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mrdct: first imps for milne as klinger-mullamphy got too high on the earlier @s partscore hand where andy hung delayed his raise|pg||
nt|janm:  Good lead, but it's not going to matter|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|nt|ahollan1: @D3-3 should be enough for Hans|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dK|nt|peachy: North could have ducked this, to assure two club tricks. Perha[s he thought S had a singleton|pg||
nt|peachy: but if so, the trick was coming back laster in clubs|pg||
nt|peachy: *later|pg||

nt|janm:  With all these claims, why is the other table 2 boards ahead? :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|ahollan1: Milne v Tishler is also close in the early goings   15-12|pg||
nt|janm:  2@d probably multi, although a few pairs like to play it as a weak 2@h bid|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: 1@D because  1st/2nd seat 1N is weak|pg||
nt|janm:  N will suspect his partner has hearts, but will probably find out before settling for 3NT|pg||
nt|janm:  Or maybe not after the 2@s overcall|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|marcsmith: slam in either major looks like an easy make -- not so easy to bid perhaps tho|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=9-11 HCP|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: a diamond lead might beat 6@S but 6@H is solid|pg||
nt|janm:  Probably S could have a bit less for a vul vs not weak 2 bid, but N probably thinks he has 9 tricks in his own hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: the problem with 6@S is that you have to ruff a club. If North then ducks the first round of trumps, declarer may be tempted to repeat the finesse|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmm  i thought EW played 15-17 NT throughout |pg||
nt|ahollan1: blast 3N?|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: did Bill Jacobs think the hand was too good  ...  or have they changed System since the 2009 Team Playoff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the 1N response with 11 HCP and 3 quick tricks suggests system change|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahhh I'm told they now play the Fantunes system  that exlains sooooo much|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in that case, 1@C was a one round force, usually 14+ HCP|pg||
pc|d6|nt|janm:  And he does, with the A of hearts for 10|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|pc|d3|pg||
nt|peachy: this again will be a challenge when diamond development and entries make it a tangle|pg||
nt|janm:  At matchpoints, declarer would probably take the spade finesse for 5, but here he'll probably settle for his safe 10 tricks|pg||
mc|11|nt|peachy: I expect defenders will prevail|pg||

nt|ahollan1: thanks Tom|pg||
nt|janm:  Wrong again! I guess he had enough faith in West's overcall to play him for either the diamond A or the spade Q or both|pg||
nt|janm:  NS need to start winning more than 1 IMP a board to get back into this match, though.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: 1N is the system opening for Thompson|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|d|nt|ahollan1: 1N = (11)12-14  and conventionally covers some distributions that would surprise many|pg||
nt|tez: operation time:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: random decision for who declares 4@S  seems if East declares, no @H lead so extra overtricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: if they play weak nt i belive you must bid |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Thompson's other option was a limited 2@D opening which is unbal, but that's an ugly @D suit|pg||
mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|janm:  Reynolds must agree with me that they need to start getting some IMPs, and making a somewhat aggressive vul 2@s bid (presumably spades + a minor) is his way to try to do it|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: but with a transfer [seems normal]   North has natural @H lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what a random 2 imps that would be|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in 1st seat, Tony Nunn had to either PASS or try 3@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmmm   in the other room declarer WAS East -- auction must have pin-pointed @H lead|pg||
nt|timb: This looks like 11 to Milne, putting the match almost out of reach for Markey|pg||
pc|d4|nt|janm:  Unfortunately, unless he can make this (which would be a real miracle), his attempt had backfired.|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|nt|tez: if theu play weak nt..dbl is 14+ 2@c majors..others transfer..we play this way|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: and alex (N) says good luck|pg||
nt|timb: South has to ruff two hearts and lose a trump trick or make five trumps and lose a heart|pg||
nt|timb: West has to play a heart now|pg||
pc|dT|nt|peachy: I don't know what EW NT range is, it could even be 15-17 with an upgrade here, or 12-14|pg||

nt|timb: Still down one is 6imps and 43 is a good buffer over 9 boards|pg||
nt|timb: low @S to @SA, @C9 throwing a heart & a trump finesses sees South emerge for down one|pg||
nt|janm:  I think he still has the heart/spade problem - he can't pull trumps and end in dummy to use the clubs and if he ruffs the heart, he'll have a spade loser|pg||
nt|timb: @C10 is a distraction|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s3|pg||

nt|janm:  Ah, with clubs 3-3, he can cross to the spade A and pitch the heart and then take the spade finesse - does that risk -3 if the clubs don't split or the spade is off?|pg||

nt|janm:  This auction has a very different feel from the one in the other room, where N opened the bidding, so EW might DBL this|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Hinge was able to open 2@D with the South hand so 3N North easily reached|pg||

mb|p|nt|tez: 2@h=weak hand no @s support|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe a transfer??|pg||
nt|janm:  Doubling would be more successful, but I'm sure there are hands where 5@d is down only 1 and 5@h makes|pg||
nt|janm:  East has a maximum in HCPs, but there are so many "quacks" that he knows he doesn't really have a good hand for play in a suit - still, his side has 9 hearts and the opponents probably have a bunch of diamonds. Perhaps he should DBL to say that |pg||

nt|janm:  I was so intrigued by the auction, I lost track of the play, but obviously 3NT was better than 4@h :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: 2@H = (9)10-13 HCP, unbal|pg||
nt|janm:  Still a lot of coming back for the Markey team, but that was a good start|pg||
mb|3H|nt|janm:  I guess 2@s is natural, not a 2-suiter - didn't he open 2@d with a weak 2@h bid earlier? This 2@s bid is far from a thing of beauty, but he still needs to swing|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: regardless of result, i think being in 4@H was better than stopping in 3|pg||

pc|s8|pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|mrdct: the @d layout looks bad for declarer but the @HK doubleton may help - the play will be interesting|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very difficult to predict what will happen at the other table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: IF Bloom does open, will it be 1@H or 2@H [weak with @H & @C/@D]|pg||
nt|janm:  1 @d, 2@ss, at least 1 @h and a couple of clubs - down something like 3 or maybe even 4? Another nice pickup for Markey|pg||
nt|janm:  Is a diamond or a spade here best? From the spade 8, Reynolds knows that his partner has either one or 2 spades (surely he'd have led the 7 from J87), probably 2, since he didn't lead a spade to start. He also knows that there isn't anything to |pg||
pc|sA|pc|sJ|nt|mrdct: def will cash 2 top @c and switch to @d i think|pg||
pc|s7|nt|peachy: declarer on thin ice, spades do not break (as is the odds) and now has two diamond losers during which defenders open up the hearts|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if he decides to PASS  then what?   1@C-P-1@S-P//??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unfortunately this table is ahead of all other vugraph rooms, so there is nothing to compare|pg||
nt|janm:  gain from tapping declarer with a diamond, and in fact declarer could choose to pitch on the diamond. Surely he'll cash the spade A and then lead a red suit - if the hearts were different it might be productive to lead them through|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h3|pc|c6|pc|s9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there's also a group that says  if you have a 5-card major, you open it  -- so their auction would start  1@H-1@S//2@C-??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems NS in trouble unless the defend against East's 2@H :)|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|janm:  That's an alternative, but now North is sort of endplayed - doesn't want to lead a red suit, and although a club won't do any harm, it won't do any serious good. Still, they're now up to 3 club tricks, and will still probably get the heart K, |pg||

nt|ahollan1: Moysian fits can be fun|pg||
nt|marcsmith: looks like a dull 4@S NS here|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|marcsmith: something like 3@C should now show a sound diamond raise or better|pg||
nt|marcsmith: 3@S would be non-forcing and 3@H a forcing 3@S bid|pg||
nt|marcsmith: EW may think 5@D will be cheap but it should be 800 as there is no entry to take the @D hook|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: Mullamphy is playing 3@S North|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: they obviously play 3@C and 3@H the other way around, which not efficient in this particular auction|pg||
nt|tez: 1@s 1nt 2@c 2@s all pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: West too weak for 1N and not distributional enough for 10-13 HCP 2@H opener  [needs 6@H or 2nd suit]|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2S|nt|marcsmith: 2 aces and a spade ruff beats 5@D|pg||
nt|mrdct: http://www.abf.com.au/events/not/|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marcsmith: lack of communication for the defenders means that 3N cannot be defeated tho|pg||
nt|peachy: West wisely stayed out of the sac|pg||
nt|marcsmith: not sure about the HJ lead|pg||
nt|marcsmith: likely to give away a trick -- generally Jx Jxx Jxxx Qx are terrible holdings to lead|pg||
nt|marcsmith: much prefer @CA here in the hope you can score fast tricks and maybe a ruff|pg||
nt|marcsmith: also, if leading Jx or Qx it is usually right to lead the low one|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i bet Jacobs was tempted to bid 3@H|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|marcsmith: let's see if declarer knows his safety plays -- should start with SA|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|pc|d6|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: EW don't have any direct way to show a Weak 2-bid  they either PASS or open 3-level|pg||
nt|marcsmith: only danger to contract is East having no spades|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: so Jacobs probably assumed Thompson had what others would open 2@H [or multi 2@D]|pg||
nt|peachy: I hpe my partners don't do it ofte, I dont anticipate doubleton if low is led|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mrdct: hard to find the killing @d lead|pg||

nt|ahollan1: most tricks i can see for Hans translates to down 1|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|pc|s7|nt|mrdct: although it's equally hard for delcarer to come to 9 tricks as north get's 2 chances to lead a @d through|pg||
pc|sA|pg||

mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: is this a MAX 2@H or min 1@H opener?|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: make that 11 even|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mrdct: 3rd seat might do something creative with souths hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this East hand is the exception to the rule that 1-suit openings show 14+ HCP   it is 12/13 when 5/4 in Majors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but it IS forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: min 1@H -- forcing 1 round|pg||
nt|peachy: There were wilder hands early in the match|pg||
mb|2H|nt|marcsmith: i much prefer a weak diamond raise to 1@S on that West hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm:  4 boards to compare and still 24 IMPs to the leaders, but board 30 looks as if it's good for the trailing team, so the fat lady hasn't started to sing yet.|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C covers a number of hands including a normal raise  [1@H-2@H is weak]|pg||
nt|marcsmith: surely, you know North is going to raise hearts and the only question is whether you have a save, and partner is only likely to find it if you tell him what you have |pg||
nt|marcsmith: ie a weak hand with some diamonds|pg||
nt|janm:  2NT an interesting bid by South|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: 51 imps exchanged so far this set -- translating to a whopping +7 for Bloom|pg||
nt|marcsmith: 1@S is far less likely to hel him|pg||
nt|janm:  Oh, I see that board 30 actually looks good for the winning team - sorry!|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cJ|nt|mrdct: good news for NS is they have found their 4-3 @h fit rather than 3-3 @s fit|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|mrdct: east's @h9 may prove to be a critical card|pg||
nt|marcsmith: having not raised the diamonds, West should lead the Jack here|pg||
nt|marcsmith: leading low is likely to tempt East to try to cash the ace to give you a ruff|pg||
pc|sT|nt|peachy: Even having raised, it might be a good idea as partner might want another suit led thru|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|janm:  I don't think 2NT is going to be any better than 3@d here - and it might be worse, but it's hard to know how the play will go - West might end up having to lead spades to dummy |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|janm:  The spade Q was good news, but the split is definitely bad news|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d6|nt|janm:  2 spades and a heart in dummy, 2 clubs in hand, and not a lot of diamonds - I guess the good news is it isn't doubled|pg||
nt|janm:  2 of @cs looks like suit preference for diamonds over hearts, but Edgtton knows which red suit is better|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: so Rusinow leads against both NT and suits|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry -- i really did try to send that before trick 1 finished|pg||
pc|h5|nt|marcsmith: that's true, but having not raised leading low is particularly dangerous|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|nt|mrdct: dead in the water now|pg||
nt|mrdct: perhaps - east can still go wrong here by the most viable defences seem to be tap declarer with a @d or give p a @s ruff|pg||
nt|mrdct: it can't be right to play a trump, but i guess there are layouts where @c is right|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm about to take another losing finesse    please wait|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|hT|pc|d3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i believe the matches are 4 segments of 15 boards each|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is segment 1 of the day|pg||
nt|marcsmith: can't declarer claim?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|marcsmith: 3@H seems particularly feeble from North -- doesn't everyone play that as pre-emptive?|pg||

pc|dK|pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|d2|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cT|nt|janm:  A and a club will endplay West into giving him to spades in the end, so only down 1 - unless Edgtton pitched the club 10|pg||
pc|h9|pc|c4|pg||
mc|7|nt|janm:  Very hard to know that was right though and this line guaranteed beating the contract which is always the key thing|pg||

mb|p|nt|janm:  Yes, it's the leading team that seems to have a good result here - EW bid a slam off a cashing AK and NS cashed them (and doubled as well).|pg||

nt|marcsmith: anyone have any idea what 2@S is?|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: exiciting match|pg||

nt|ahollan1: or 2N|pg||
nt|janm:  Was it? How did he know that South and not East had the @c K?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: because @C don't run?|pg||
nt|marcsmith: surely not the systemic action on this???|pg||
nt|mrdct: yes he correctly diagnosed that with no @c cue by east at worst his @CAQ was sitting over dummy's K|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i think 2N= a) 7-9 3@S or b) 5-9 4@S|pg||
mb|4D|nt|peachy: This is another of their 3-9 two suiters, blacks this time|pg||
nt|marcsmith: hardly what I'd call a -suiter|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: lol... it was a good double for Milne team|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: 2@S = limit raise, exactly 3@H|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Actually, According to their score books, the 4H made|pg||
nt|janm:  And E couldn't have had a stiff club and decided to cue bid the A of diamonds first?|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: surely not sound either|pg||
nt|peachy: Yes systemic, we have knowledgeable kib|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: i initially forgot East was passed hand :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good-o 4@H on time makes more sense|pg||
nt|marcsmith: bizarre|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: 2NT likely inquiry|pg||
nt|mrdct: he was screenmates with east so i'm sure he asked him whether or not he'd cue a stiff @C in preference to a @d control|pg||
mb|4N|nt|ahollan1: as pointed out - after pull last trump - unblock @C honor when Nunn flies Ace  |pg||
nt|marcsmith: think I'd rather open 1@S|pg||
nt|mrdct: and it's always more useful to get that info from the actual person holding the hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: nice stop here for ew|pg||
mb|5C|nt|mrdct: thin values, no fit, no source of tricks = no game|pg||
nt|marcsmith: 3@H presumably maximum with clubs|pg||
mb|d|mb|5S|nt|bebechira: lool..here we go|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: @D10 may make it easier for Hans to find @C shift|pg||

nt|tez: @d 1t won|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes --- i'm just saying @DT makes @C shift much easier than @DK|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct: this auction is slightly curious as this time it seems east has denied @C control but east makes a slam try anyway|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: it will be interesting to see if defense is different at other tables when @DK is played at trick 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=(11)12-14  covers many shapes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: last year there was a big discussion on BBO Forum [or r.g.b] about whether or not to use conventional runout after Weak 1N - DBL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the conclusion matched the arguments about 1M-1N  forcing vs semi-force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: each camp is absolutely sure their treatment is right and the other treatment is wrong|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and vice versa :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: are we really waiting for Jacobs' bid?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one runout scheme uses RDBL to force bid of 2@C   the other would bid 2@C as Natural [totally new concept]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: winner gets to rest the rest of the evening -- qualifying into semi-final|pg||
nt|ahollan1: loser plays 32 more boards in the Quarter Final|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S forcing, usually 14+ HCP|pg||
nt|mrdct: hopefully the operator can keep the room open to report the result of that match as it could be sometime before it is published on the website|pg||
nt|janm:  And it's way past my bedtime, so goodnight all :)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|peachy: in my book, leading from xxx is typically the worst, J10x not really so|pg||

mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4C|nt|ahollan1: and there's the flaw with the initial PASS  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=a) 7-9 3@S or b) 5-9 4@S|pg||
nt|peachy: I once read (I'd swear it was a Mike Lawrence book) that leading from xxx has the same effect on your defense as a sleeping pill would have on your attention span|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: Klinger was down 17-31 to Yezerski at the half|pg||
nt|mrdct: it would be somewhat of an upset if Yezerski held-on given that Klinger won the swiss qualifying|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: sorry  maybe "flaw" is too harsh|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: you have to make the oppo pay for making stupid lead-directing doubles|pg||
mb|5D|nt|ahollan1: Tony Nunn out for blood with his half trick|pg||
mb|d|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|mrdct: these lead directing doubles can have the side effect of putting the brakes on the opps when they were just about to overbid to slam|pg||
