nt|ahollan1: this is the 2nd set of 4 16-board segments|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mwigor: this hand may well be opened 1NT in both rooms (but i think) its a strong NT in this room and a weak NT in the other room|pg||
nt|frankaus: The Bloom crew is staffed by hardened proffesionals - |pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can keep an eye on the other room via http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
mb|3D|nt|noodle:  seems ok to upgrade a good 14; as we have seen  opening bids are very agressive nowadays|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: both teams are playing 5-handed|pg||
mb|3S|nt|tejjyid: X presume single/suited|pg||
nt|frankaus: Milne crew the next generation of excellence - have been at the top of many international junior events|pg||
nt|tejjyid: interesting problem for East|pg||

nt|kareno: Polish Club?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  1 diamond guarantees 4, therefore 1 club may be as short as 2|pg||
nt|kareno: Okay - 'could be only 2'|pg||
nt|casenjo:  the only holding would be the 4-4-3-2 distribution|pg||
nt|kareno: Thanks, specs.|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|granguru: with the bidding is easier to play S for a stiff @D|pg||

nt|tejjyid: not that it beats the contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the winners of this event will get an invitation and $6000 subsidy to attend the 2011 Yeh Bros Cup this coming April|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|mwigor: in this situation gosney could probably have won the diamond unless he needed martin to switch|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=3+|pg||
mb|2N|nt|noodle:  the imp is not much  but the fact they ended up in a great spot on a tough hand can boost morale early in the match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1st/2nd seat  Hans-Nunn play Weak NT   3rd/4th Strong|pg||
mb|3S|nt|rodal f: Ain't 6.000$ a peace of cake? Is for my workers. OK. Stop now.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Zone 6 is bringing us 2 fun events in the next 2 months    early/mid February  NEC Cup from Yokahama  [vugraph schedule already posted] and the YEH Bros|pg||
mb|4S|nt|tejjyid: although PASS stops partner from taking your hand in any way seiously|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: [most of] Milne team is looking for 3rd straight NOT final|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in 2010 they were 2nd in both this event and the Spring NOT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with a slight change to team for the Spring event|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and Milne-Whibley were semi-finalists in 2009 while still New Zealanders|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: i think i like pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|noodle:  often pass is better when really crappy hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: which, since you have complete rubish, may be a good argument for the PASS|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|rnmalik: Hello all.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S seems like confirmation of the 3@S bid|pg||
pc|h3|pg||

pc|d9|pc|d5|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: in the other room  Peake bid 2@C over 1@S  --  Whibley's 2N seems much clearer|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|s7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and many say that both 2@C and 2@S would be natural over 1@S|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|h6|pg||
pc|c4|nt|othered1: might west have been better off, in practice, by pitching @C on 3rd @H?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|kiwibridge: Ish is X'd in 5@D|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS need to make up ground and may explain their aggressive bidding|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: NS had a discussion about who showed what sort of partial spade stopper when dummy appeared|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what was the conclusion??|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think E showed the best stopper:)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: ish thought the pass by prescott showed about three small|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: it gets tricky when they allow a @S suit with 15 or 16 cards in it|pg||

pc|s5|pg||
nt|andyv:  and what was dbl by N... card showing?|pg||

pc|s3|nt|andyv:  nice pull by W|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: great explanation!!|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: what does 5@D show?       faith|pg||
nt|andyv:  I wonder if that showing faith means he doesn't trust partner's penalty doubles:)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: ish is now complaining that he didn't know 3C was alerted|pg||
nt|tejjyid: West, maybe|pg||
nt|mwigor: they both played in youth week|pg||
nt|noodle:  they show stamina then|pg||
nt|mwigor: but not in the trial for the australian youth team|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I don't like this auction at all|pg||
pc|cA|nt|noodle:  tx specs :)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mwigor: milne-whibley (two of the others in this team) made the australian youth team|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|rnmalik: accepts the transfer:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  seven card suits are hard to describe in middle of auctions|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: whibley shrugged and ish isn't pursing it|pg||
pc|s2|nt|noodle:  hung and smirnov are well known on BBO :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think South snaffled the Youth pairs?|pg||
nt|mwigor: same auction in both rooms|pg||
nt|mwigor: it looks like hung has hit on the best lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: Strange to see that some still give from the Mol. HUM. Pass over 1@S? |pg||

pc|d4|nt|mwigor: the consequence being that he was still on lead after two rounds of @c|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Peake did raise to 2@S   --  but won't get any extra credit if both contracts make|pg||
nt|tejjyid: no, it's a purely academic point on this hand|pg||
nt|tejjyid: commentator's noise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: opposite passed hand, i actually like Whibley's PASS -- partner now KNOWS 3@S support  and  won't go overboard|pg||
pc|s7|nt|noodle:  Silver used to call K from Kx a journalist lead, cause if it works you can end up in the paper (of course here it was the unbid suit)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: won't make much difference though|pg||
nt|mwigor: hung does well trying to kill the diamond suit in dummy|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h6|pc|d5|pg||
nt|noodle:  I don t know if it s standard but when i pass a 1 level response partner can be sure I have a 3rd seat opener and act accordingly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: plus -- what can opponents do that is bad?   if they balance in @C  West knows about the 8-card fit|pg||
pc|sT|pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: if they balance in @H --- East would love to defend|pg||

nt|ahollan1: there was a reason for @C play  -- i just don't know what it was|pg||
nt|frankaus: leads are a huge source of swings|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but with full weight & good shape, why unilateraly preclude game?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  probably S gave count on K@s|pg||

nt|frankaus: 3NT is anothet scycic option but thats fairly transparent|pg||
nt|tejjyid: nice read by Gosney|pg||

mb|p|nt|mwigor: i hold four cards in a suit which partner makes a penalty double of|pg||

nt|mwigor: almost unplayable any other way|pg||

nt|mwigor: although we can see that they can make 650 if they bid on|pg||
nt|mwigor: taking the money in 5@h is a much safer option|pg||
pc|c2|nt|noodle:  agreed  this ia a forcing pass situation double as 2 losers is relatively normal (by arrangement of course)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: S hand doesn't look like 11 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duplicate auctions -- i must admit i would have bid a mere 3@H with East|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|nt|andyv:  not sure what purpose 2@s served...in OR, S bid 3@d (puppet stayman) which makes more sense on this hand|pg||

pc|hT|nt|mwigor: 3NT will fail so long as the defense gets it right|pg||

pc|h2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for most [many?] 2/1 players --  the 1@D response either denies 4+@H/@S or hand is strong enough to invite over a weak NT rebid|pg||
pc|h8|nt|noodle:  also note that south has has the 7@d for mosy hands  very important in junior bridge|pg||

nt|tejjyid: That was the bid I expected here - transfer responses very popular|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i don't think Adam is playing with any regular partners|pg||
nt|noodle:  very restrictive system laws here|pg||
nt|tejjyid: true, it's not a good method for the casual partnership|pg||
nt|noodle:  it is my opinion that such rules deter young people from the game|pg||

nt|tejjyid: Maybe - I think the need for restrictions is overstated but I see the argument|pg||

nt|tejjyid: The problem is it's hard to test in a revenue neutral way|pg||

nt|ahollan1: not sure if DBL was 4+@S or 4/5@S [which is how the Italians play it]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in North America, the standard is  1m-(1@H)-DBL = exactly 4@S|pg||
nt|andyv:  with the alert, I suspect 4/5|pg||

nt|tejjyid: I found that the weak NT solves lot's of bidding problems, but it gves away a lot of information when it ISN"T opened (player is unblanaced) plus it's hard to compete sensibly ...|pg||

pc|h2|pg||
nt|tejjyid: NOrth can try 2NT or 3NT|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: some might use it as Good/Bad  [so 3@C is better hand than 2N]|pg||
nt|noodle:  the method of using pass as 10+ balanced and transfers (starting with redouble) was suggested by Garozzo over a take out double and is gaining popularity|pg||
nt|tejjyid: pragmatic|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|andyv:  could be but then 3@c would be alertable|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2 rounds of @H then @D?    West may not have enough entries  [South can prevent @SJ from being entry]|pg||

nt|tejjyid: OK, so now we can start cue-ing early, or maybe even BW with 4@C|pg||

mb|4C|mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: apparently they use 1C=1+C and 1D=5+D, according to heather|pg||
nt|andyv:  I guess EW don't have any agreements here regarding passing runout bids|pg||
nt|ahollan1: strange not to dbl -- i would assume Whibley's pass was forcing|pg||
mb|4H|nt|tejjyid: (but it's a long standing prejudice)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 4@C was just natural force|pg||

nt|tejjyid: certainly if you can use it at the 4@C level, it's better|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|noodle:  2@D was probably GF checkback|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 4@C as a natural force seems to be wasting space - why not cue 3@D on the way?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Again, West is making the decision and doesn't have enough information|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hopefully 5@C = 1/4 Key Cards|pg||
mb|6C|nt|vugrapha2: pass is low-variance... opposite a passed hand|pg||
nt|tejjyid: lead a @D!|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: The @C QJ are invisble - they bid with filth & East has had no chance to show that he has a good hand|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: scramble 2NT is also sensible... south can't have values after two passes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but a reasonable sequence for 2N to show "2 places to play"|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: ish and whibley are joking about the DQJ behind the screen before thelead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since only one entry to hand -- after @S lead must rely upon @D2-2|pg||
nt|tejjyid: mildly surprising to pick up in that way against a junior team|pg||
pc|h4|nt|andyv:  S is lucky... lack of entries to his hand will prevent him from messing up the @d suit|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 4@S and 5@D are both a mystery to me|pg||

nt|ahollan1: nice save|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is this 11 good enough for 1N?|pg||

pc|c9|nt|andyv:  another no substance hand... Ish hoping his pass would attract some action|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for the specs -- Ish could NOT RDBL to show points   it would show 4+@D  [transfers over 1@C and 1@C-DBL]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: learn more about the hand with PASS|pg||
nt|tejjyid: not often this pair will be in a partscorewith 24|pg||
pc|cT|nt|andyv:  but he could have bid 3N immediately|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: and he probably wouldn't want to double to show points|pg||

pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: impressive stop|pg||
pc|h5|nt|tejjyid: I plyed with a master of 4 card pre-empts, so I was always relieved when he had a 5 card suit|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|andyv:  I agree with his pass at this stage of match... you need to try to create something... otherwise I'd just bid 3N and get it over before opps can communicate.|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: andy that's a terrible pun|pg||
mb|3C|nt|andyv:  I need better wages to hire better writers, Mark|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think this 1@S might be @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: totally illegal, but tons of fun -- in a very casual dup game, we played one system if i was dealer, another if partner dealt  and opponent's card if they dealt|pg||
mb|3D|nt|tejjyid: that is lots of fun - shame that fee-for-al aproach can't be sustained in high level games|pg||
mb|p|nt|noodle:  another oz spade ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i brought that up because  Whibley's 1@C gets alerted byt Edgtton's didn't :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|tejjyid: *free-for-all|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rnmalik: 4@H can go off on @C lead,ruff  and small @D return.|pg||

pc|hT|nt|tejjyid: surprised East idn't play @D first|pg||
nt|tejjyid: he needs a 9th trick even if the @C come home & "steal early"|pg||
nt|mwigor: this will be a disappointing result for the kids - martin may not play again if the match is close|pg||
nt|noodle:  and there is a case for finessing @c after take out double|pg||
pc|dK|nt|tejjyid: a BIG case|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: most of Milne team was 2nd in 2010 NOT and Spring NOT  -- they're going to have to find new gear to break that streak|pg||
nt|tejjyid: HAns will make thesame 10 tricks - actually, maybe a differnet 10 tricks, but it will score the same way|pg||
nt|sybarra: they have another half to go,    |pg||
