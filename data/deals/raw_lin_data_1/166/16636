nt|ahollan1: Milne won 2 of the events in the Junior Tournament that was held in Canberra|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|woozle: Edgtton bids a slightly good 1NT, Hans makes a marginal (but in character) 2C overcall, and Nunn shows a good raise with his peculiar hand|pg||
nt|casenjo:  yes, we have seen a lot of aggressive action|pg||
nt|woozle: Milne's double is takeout, apparently not dissuaded by his bare minimum. Edgtton must be bidding 4H now|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk2: 4@H can go down, though|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: @SA, club to the ace and a spade|pg||
nt|woozle: Well, a heart, spade and club, plus trump promotion potential|pg||

nt|dburn: well, it it still a phanotm - just a different ghost|pg||
nt|woozle: Nunn doesn't fancy taking his chances on defense and settles for 5C, which looks like a quick 300 against a marginal game...a good start for Milne|pg||

nt|woozle: And first in the ANOT...the form team of the last year|pg||

pc|d7|nt|woozle: It might look irrelevant how you play this club suit, but after South shows out it's best to lead the fourth round from the East seat, so that South has four discards to make ...|pg||

nt|woozle: Edgtton has two more discards...if he pitches a diamond, Nunn can set up a heart and need not try the spade finesse|pg||

mb|d|nt|mwigor: this hand may well be opened 1NT in both rooms (but i think) its a strong NT in this room and a weak NT in the other room|pg||

mb|r|nt|noodle:  seems ok to upgrade a good 14; as we have seen  opening bids are very agressive nowadays|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|mwigor: in this situation gosney could probably have won the diamond unless he needed martin to switch|pg||

mb|2H|an|nonforcing|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: earlier in the weak there was a pair playing Raptor, which uses a 1N overcall to show 4@H/@S & 5+ other minor|pg||
nt|casenjo:  looks like they are headed for 2 spades|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe, but Milne might pass again|pg||
nt|woozle: Milne can surely pass 2H...Edgtton would have had two-way checkback available for invitational or better hands|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: The defense start here with six tricks and may find a seventh|pg||
nt|dburn: sometimes partner is 5-5, and sometimes even when he isn't, hearts plays better|pg||
nt|casenjo:  seduced by AK of spades, awfully tough to pass 2 hearts on this one|pg||
nt|dburn: perhaps, but those spades will take tricks whichever suit is trump - those hearts won't|pg||
nt|woozle: 2H more likely to be an eight card fit than 2S|pg||
pc|c8|nt|dburn: still, I guess 2@s is mainstream|pg||
nt|woozle: Hans expresses his creativity with the lead of the club eight...Nunn won't pick it, but it won't matter|pg||
nt|casenjo:  so, he was seduced :)|pg||

nt|casenjo:  oh my, I would hate to think that we have reduced ourselves to believe that McDonalds is the mainsteam, normal, daily meal :(|pg||
nt|dburn: I guess if you've got aces in the minors, you'd be more inclined to pass 2@h and hope partner can scramble|pg||
nt|dburn: but with those minors, maybe better to bid 2@s rather than have the opponents draw trump against 2@h and cash a bunch of clubs|pg||
nt|casenjo:  They had the identical auction in the other room, I still prefer passing 2 hearts and not getting seduce|pg||
nt|ahollan1: why does it matter?    you KNOW only 7@S fit  but MAYBE 8@H   and as already mentioned  @SAK take tricks in either contract|pg||

nt|ahollan1: that's part of why Rodwell invented   1m-2@H as non-invite 5@S & 4+@H|pg||
nt|chilloncan: good evening citizens|pg||
nt|casenjo:  the big plus is that it could EASILY be an 8 card heart fit|pg||
mb|4S|mb|5H|nt|ahollan1: Smirnov overcalled 2@H with East hand|pg||
nt|woozle: I think the 1m-2H gadget is more useful when opener has the 4/6 type and responder isn't strong enough to bid again over the 2m rebid|pg||
nt|woozle: Edgtton's double is probably 4+ spades...any solid info on that?|pg||
nt|chilloncan: in that case it is not that likely to make a serious IMP difference whether you play in the long suit or the 44 fit...indeed the former may be better sometimes|pg||
nt|dburn: well, Milne's 4@s bid seems to be circumstantial evidence at least|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|woozle: Someone asked about 2NT...I'll hazard a guess that it's a mixed heart raise - 6-9, 4 trumps or something like that|pg||
nt|woozle: Edgtton prefers the certain 500 to the speculative 650|pg||

nt|ahollan1: it makes sense that 2nd seat needs a bit more|pg||
nt|woozle: I think that quality pairs playing that a 3H opening doesn't break Burn's law would predate the Law by about 50 years|pg||
