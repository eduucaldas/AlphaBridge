nt|Walddk2: I hope not|pg||
mb|1D|mb|d|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|paulg:  perhaps East bid 1@s|pg||

mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s4|nt|rmb1: are we sure?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Suit is too weak for 2@H, and a pre-empt should not have a void|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 1@S is natural and denies as many as 3 hearts|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: 3@Cis a bit pushy, it feels, since he has few values inthe suits he has shown|pg||
