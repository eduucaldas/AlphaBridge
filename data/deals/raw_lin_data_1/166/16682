mb|2S|nt|hawe45:  - ah, I didÂ´nt see the 9 of @H, important card |pg||
mb|3C|nt|tejjyid: West adopts the iew that passing with a weak balanced hand is better than trying to fluke a partscore|pg||
nt|tejjyid: *view|pg||
nt|sharkey: Good morning - think we have the same weather in Norway Mark :(|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|othered1: Do we know NS's system?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Anyway - a tuff start|pg||
nt|bobh1: EW belong in 3@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: as i play 4@D has to be ace (not king or singleton)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the Hacketts are father Paul and son Justin two fine English players|pg||
mb|p|nt|saverio: 3NT available for EW here   but not easy to get there|pg||
nt|bobh1: apparently the second double is takeout|pg||
nt|tejjyid: a fair treatement if West's 1st pass doesn't show values|pg||
nt|sharkey: this appears to be a coffee hand - 11 tricks|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|nt|bg: seems natural so far:)|pg||

pc|h2|nt|othered1: If something lilke Precision, there would be questions about relative minor suit length, v what a double would show, etc.|pg||

nt|chessmaste: If North's spade had been headed by the @S AK he would probaly have bid 4@C|pg||
nt|sharkey: hi Nigel|pg||
pc|cK|nt|fabsayc: it may have asked about clubs and 5@D denied|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hi all|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I'b be happy ot pass 2@H as East; I've done enough, IMO, with a 4441|pg||
nt|bobh1: yes but its so prime|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I'm not unsympathetic to the raise; but I expect West to be aggressive with say, 5 trumps & a black K|pg||
nt|tejjyid: and bid 3@H over the X|pg||
pc|c8|pc|hT|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Sunil|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|sybarra: Mike you with us also?|pg||

nt|jcwla: Not sure about overbidding as just about everything comes rolling home.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|xenya: neatly done -- from N's perspective slam is on a finesse at worst|pg||

mb|1H|nt|fabsayc: prediction 2-NS will get too high|pg||

nt|xenya: but not on best defence. mind you|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|othered1: What's east's 1@C?|pg||
nt|othered1: From south's 2@C bid, I might infer it's a big @C|pg||
nt|bg: not sure but is normal start for a 2nnt rebid|pg||
nt|bobh1: EW will make a game try...bid 3N and try to make it|pg||
nt|othered1: west apparantly denies 5@S if he passes over 1@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: regardless of strength?|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 3NT is the spot for E/W|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|fabsayc: might even land in wrong suit|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I can tell you the McGann in the OR is indeed in 3N and looks like making so it could be 1st blood to Hackett|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest11/nec.html  for standings and Daily Bulletins (scroll down in the column to the left)|pg||
nt|sharkey: W may invite with 4 NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: and cant really fail a cards lie|pg||
mb|3C|nt|kiwibridge: 6@D ? asks a kibitzer|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - on this board?...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes|pg||
nt|saverio: NS could take 11 tricks in 5@d here     another "not easy to find" game  |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'd prefer 2@C over the X|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 8 easy tricks is a good start; usuallythe defence will provide one along the way|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|saverio: 6@d should be off on a @s lead  even if it is a though lead|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Communications are not very good especially if defenders lead clubs, but 9 tricks shouldn't be a problem|pg||
nt|chessmaste: In their precision style that would be an overbid|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: NS will h ave another chance to take 7 top tricks.|pg||
mb|4N|nt|bg: it was 16+|pg||
nt|othered1: looks like a normal big @C auction, with 2@S showing a limited positive response.|pg||
nt|othered1: ty operator|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: in the other room West raised to 5@C|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 3N made on 1 for 6 imps|pg||
nt|sharkey: Previous match was decided on a misunderstanding of a 4 NT bid|pg||
nt|sharkey: Played 4 NT down 2 instead of 6@S making...|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I think 4NT is too much with no fit and East showing no encouragement|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: goofy little hand |pg||
nt|lestergold: after A@c could be interesting if PO tries to sneak a spade he may may make|pg||
nt|othered1: in the OR, it was east who thought his hand worth initial action and opened 1@C, cheating his partner out of the chance to be first to bid.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: i might be tempted to do so too.|pg||
nt|xenya: makes sense, considering the vulnerability |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: with the west hand... 7 points in partners preemt might not produce a single trick|pg||
nt|xenya: putting maximum pressure on NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|bg: same result in other room on board 1|pg||
nt|othered1: the overcall does give west some useful information|pg||
nt|fabsayc: are you prepared to bid 7 if opponents reach slam, because that often happens with these extreme preempts|pg||
nt|xenya: spades behave, in a sense, so declarer can get out for -1|pg||
nt|saverio: do you agree on S 3NT?    |pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest11/nec.html   for Daily Bulletins (scroll down in the column to the left)|pg||
nt|bobh1: @c lead gives a trick|pg||
nt|othered1: first of EW, that it|pg||
pc|s7|nt|tejjyid: Those bulletins are astounding, the eds/authors do a fantastic job|pg||
nt|lestergold: question of overtricks now|pg||
nt|lestergold: surely no tank here must be odds to play J or T @c|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Well if they play 4NT and South leads a spade it is easy enough to score ten tricks|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jcwla: Will lead @DQ to preserve the opportunity to play S out of @D KT7.  Or won't.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|saverio: wd by N to move from 3NT anyway|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed the stiff A@H didn't look that great|pg||
nt|tejjyid: T1 tank is OK for planning - but tankins at T@@ as well is a bit rough|pg||
nt|tejjyid: T2|pg||
nt|bobh1: he's trying to decide which red suit S has|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
nt|hawe45:  MY partner(s) doÂ´nt open 3 @C|pg||
nt|saverio: i think i'd pass 3NT as N   (i'd expect something like AQ for that bid)|pg||
nt|bobh1: good choice|pg||
nt|bobh1: now 11 tricks?|pg||
nt|bobh1: are available anyway|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|pc|hA|nt|fabsayc: me either but then that is the crux of how high to preempt|pg||
nt|lestergold: north will he hold onto all his 1ds|pg||
nt|lestergold: @d s|pg||
nt|othered1: This shouldn't be too tough to defend, since passed hand east has shown up with AK-K|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: end of defence|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: well |pg||
nt|othered1: north faltered|pg||

pc|h2|nt|kiwibridge: in the end they have reached a good spot as long as no club ruff|pg||

nt|xenya: anyway, NS were lucky to remain oblivious of their spade fit|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|saverio: not easy to get to slam after 2@h/3@c/4@h...  a lot of space wasted and no more room to investigate|pg||
nt|tejjyid: OH, thy're certainly getting to game|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like 4@d is systematic|pg||
nt|chilloncan: the double by W makes S hand worse, and NS not vul. but most wiould bid game even if appreciating the negative factors|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|sharkey: *Catch|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  When you have heart tolerance and clubs and nothing much in their suit, it will usually be best to compete I think|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  It is much harder for North even with quite a good hand unless they have extra shape|pg||
pc|c9|nt|tejjyid: I guess, that's why it took so long to find.  |pg||
nt|chilloncan: 6 LTC + 8.5 LTC means larginal for game even apart from the mirror|pg||
nt|tejjyid: South *might* have passed 2@S NV< but once not, no way to stop|pg||
nt|bobh1: actually no way to misdefend|pg||
nt|chilloncan: it is a difficult double dummy problem i ndeed to imagine a scenario where EW could let it make|pg||
nt|lestergold: well North was very max for his 2@s and south was sub min for 2N|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|h2|pg||
pc|c8|nt|fabsayc: 4@H may have been intended to push opponents to a phantom, but west did not get the plot, a lot to be said for bidding 2s with east hand|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: this is pushing it|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: nice jump overcall in the balancing position by Zhan|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@S in last seat tends to show a decent hand -- just what S has|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the other option of dbling and then bidding @Ss will show more points and defence|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sharkey: Lots of work to do|pg||

nt|xenya: what's your prediction on this one, Martin?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I the good old days, North had "taken the money against 2 @C D!"|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I only see two losers in 5 @D? But how many tricks...|pg||
nt|saverio: after the 2@h opening in the earlier board we can understand why N opened 1@h here     though it is not my style since i prefer sounds openings and overcalls....:)|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i dont really agree with the double by W, but the position is a very awkward one|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I have never played Precision where 2@c can have a major|pg||
nt|chessmaste: In a way both sides are endplayed|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: 1 off guaranteed club guess needed to avoid 2 light|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I used to play cheapest NT was a void based T/O|pg||
nt|sybarra: some sort of drury by N |pg||
nt|tejjyid: and on that lead, it won't be too hard|pg||
nt|othered1: west's pass, compared to an earlier board, must mean he looks at the vulnerability before bidding|pg||
pc|h6|nt|othered1: and I guess east is making a game try|pg||
nt|xenya: tough hand for NS|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5@D is down after 2 rounds of clubs|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: if South has soft values in the majors 3 nt may be right.. but i guess he will bid 5@D|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I worked oncein real life, and this appears to be the 2nd time|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sybarra: well N knows all the spades on his left |pg||

nt|othered1: what would south have tried from J9x?|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: i wd not make such an aggressive lead with only 1 trump..|pg||
pc|h3|nt|othered1: well done, so far|pg||
nt|chilloncan: club just helps declarer|pg||

nt|Walddk4: as was the case on board 1|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|nt|hawe45:  So in fact - bd 19 - the 2 @H opening backfired|pg||
nt|sybarra: been around long enough to have learned |pg||
pc|c7|pc|cT|pg||
nt|tejjyid: West will force declarer, but the location of the @D A means the contract is safe|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Probaly the best exit was the @D J, creating an entry to East's hand|pg||
pc|hK|nt|tejjyid: peopel usually forget to put you to the guess when they have the Q|pg||
pc|h7|nt|hawe45:  Even the @D 2 would do |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: west has to perforce continue @C after seeing the major holding in dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If declarer gets another club he will try to get rid of his clubs on dummy's majors|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But he won't succeed|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sybarra: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest.html|pg||

pc|hQ|pg||
nt|bg: big swing here EW =+ 680|pg||
nt|othered1: might depend on how declarer thinks @S split.  Remember west ddin't overcall|pg||

nt|sharkey: Lots of tricks now|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h9|nt|saverio: E should have play a @d here in order to play again after ruffing third @h by Q   i think it wd set it  (not sure though)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so the 2@H was let down by team mates not reaching game/slam|pg||
nt|saverio: uh ho   now he could be in trouble (if my def lines works :))|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it enabled the good sac to be made, relying on teamies who let the side down|pg||
nt|hawe45:  South might regret having played this @D to the Ace|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: welcome Victor|pg||
nt|saverio: he had all top trumps   (exept the Q)  i think a cross suff plane was better |pg||

mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: the big flat use a lot of space nt|pg||

mb|p|nt|bg: sry it was 2 clubs x by E down 1 -100|pg||
nt|othered1: so far very normal.  Now north's hand says do something @H focused, like raise or support double|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3@H looks like good hand, bad suit, which is apt.|pg||
mb|p|nt|saverio: puppet action here    |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 3@D = a 4 card but no 5 card major|pg||

pc|h3|nt|sybarra: N likely hitting the deck quickly here|pg||

pc|h5|nt|nigel_k:  5@c may have been easier|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: so was W bid a psyche? or systemic|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|chilloncan: wow. apparently 2N was forcing|pg||
nt|tejjyid: a simple & descriptive bid...|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, and now W could bid 3N -- i'm surprised he didn't|pg||
nt|jcwla: Considering this suit leaves a lot to be desired, W should feel comfortable in thinking JT shores it up nicely when in fact it's little better than 32.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|saverio: but the seems not to have a bid showing both M so they could have wronsided the contract if they happened to have @h and not @s fit....|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: well said Jordan|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Still down in 5@C|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yes because of the overruff|pg||
pc|c7|nt|xenya: the 4@S bid is routine -- E doesn't need much from partner for game to be good |pg||
nt|chilloncan: looks good for W|pg||
nt|sybarra: how did they make 4 @S?  not sure I see enough tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: as cards lie|pg||
nt|sybarra: I see,  @H lead and hopped ace|pg||
nt|chilloncan: club ruffs out third, and they may have led D ace|pg||
nt|lestergold: surely only lose 1 trick in each side suit|pg||
nt|othered1: That doesn't come up all that often on defensive bidding, and I might think it showed a different hand with longer, better @D and a bit less outside.|pg||
nt|chessmaste: This will be worse|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bg: many players do not like to doubles with voids and a weakness in defensive cards  probably best here just to overcall 1 heart|pg||
nt|saverio: wrongsided*|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it probably gets bid with your hand type more often - 19-20 balanced usually goes through a X|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sharkey: @S spots certainly coming into play here|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|dburn: not sure I'd have responded to 1@d at all with the North cards, let alone responded 1@h. But Kokish is very big in Japan, so that a 1@d overcall has a range of about 9 to about 29|pg||
pc|s3|nt|othered1:  a little wild and wooly, but I'll take defending 4@S on these hands.|pg||
pc|c8|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|hawe45:  Oups|pg||
nt|saverio: over 3@d it is a normal agreement to play 4@c both M with slam interest and 4@d w/out.....|pg||

pc|s9|nt|sybarra: well hopefully there is a real explanation, I am getting several from kibs|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|tejjyid: reasonable to raise to 2@D|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: good @D shift by Zhan forcing declarer to take the choice now..|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sunsamvar: South had a tough choice at trick 2|pg||
pc|c2|nt|dburn: meanwhile, though, how will he make it?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I can't imagine introuding the @H suit though|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  One heart and five trumps|pg||
pc|sT|nt|othered1: eventually, the auction will let declarer get the @D position right|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|xenya: also, the defence may go wrong...|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: a spec points out that Tanaka shd have pld a @S to the 10 on the second trick... true i think|pg||

pc|h2|nt|sunsamvar: has Zhan mixed a club along with his @Ss|pg||
nt|jcwla: This collection of quacks is not my idea of an opening bid.  The @S bid and rebid are both unilateral shoot-the-moon moves, particularly if 2@D is known to show three.|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Anyway they did well to stop because it looks like 3NT is down on a diamond lead|pg||

nt|lestergold: sas so often the case at these colours non vul opps believe you when you bid vulnerable|pg||
nt|chilloncan: double more attractive if you had a hand where you thought 5C or 4S was likely to make. but N has too much defense to accommodate a possible club save|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sybarra: now what?|pg||
nt|othered1: 4N would have been a very descriptive bid, if quantitative.  Not sure what 5@H would mean in that context.  Perhaps a choice of game, perhaps responding to blackwood, which some do ...|pg||

pc|dA|nt|bg: sb 11 imps to Neduk making score 15-28|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 5H totally undisciplined|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I saw a similar themed bidding problem yesterday... South needs a widr range of bids to help NOrth decidewhat to do over 4@S |pg||
nt|sybarra: unlikely to get @D right imo|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 5@H is wild, given the lack of shape/playing strength|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think N should double 4@S....pass is my second choice|pg||
nt|dburn: what good would that do?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sybarra: these teams are ranked  1 (Neduk) and  2  ;Taipei W |pg||
nt|othered1: south really hasn't had much of a chance to do something with that hand.  North will be very pleased to find the good @S tricks that never got into the auction directly.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: subtle not!|pg||
nt|tejjyid: what harm?|pg||
nt|dburn: only to P-O's reputation|pg||
nt|tejjyid: his reputation is what makes it worthwhile|pg||

pc|h4|nt|othered1: This will be a swing againstthe 450 in the OR|pg||

pc|d8|pg||
nt|othered1: easy game, as cards lie.  but north is trying to figure out how to avoid @C loser on the lead.  Playing east for J.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 3S by S could not have been a slam try and almost surely not a probe for 3N. so that means it was simply establishing ownership of the hand, to set up a forcing pas situation. N ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: has absolutely zero reason to bid 5H. his offense to defense ratio is about as low as it coul be|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lestergold: yes south has shown a raise with high cards|pg||
nt|sybarra: think tonight I should go to casino |pg||

nt|tejjyid: The "good @S raise" needs the @D A|pg||

nt|tejjyid: Ifelt the @D strength offset the general weakness of the hand|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|sybarra: lol,  but there are amongst us|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|othered1: Looks like the big @C forces a 2@C opening on west's hand, a weak spot in bid @C systems.|pg||
nt|othered1: west rightfully treats his hand as a 1-suiter|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|lestergold: part score swing|pg||
nt|chessmaste: All Stars have a 10VP 'cushion', so any win will see them through|pg||
mb|3S|nt|chilloncan: not sure why 2S appeals, with playability in both majors and only suit announced by opps is clubs|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 2D i mean|pg||
nt|dburn: well, look at the result|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5 imps|pg||
nt|dburn: if he'd bid only 1@d, South would maybe have had some chance to bid|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think North has been a little conservative not X'ing on the 2nd round|pg||
nt|othered1: There's a case to bid with both hands.  I double on north's hand either my first or second at bat.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: yes|pg||
nt|tejjyid: also, South might balance - I'm sympatheticto the 1st pass by South, with the soft cards & misfit, but defending 2@D won't be much fun|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: 2N looks reasonable at this point|pg||
mb|4C|nt|othered1: here 4@S looks normal and it will make if you can hold the @C losers to 1|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: at these colours i would have thought 2@d normal|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: and pushed them too high|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: because this time tough to guess trumps|pg||
nt|xenya: in the other room, N overcalled immediately (2@D) -- i like this sequence better|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest11/nec.html|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Quick, grab a coffee|pg||

pc|d4|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|nt|dburn: moreover, the opponents had not announced clubs, otherwise they would be playing in them|pg||
pc|dT|nt|hawe45:  IsÂ´nt 3 @C maybe a winner, so that 3 @H is the right move?|pg||
nt|xenya: well done indeed|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no swing here so 2 to come|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: is the dbl asking for @C lead or @S|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: indeed|pg||
nt|sharkey: Possibilities if E decides to set up @C suit|pg||
nt|sharkey: X may discourage that?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|chilloncan: not saying it can never work. it is always about relative probabilities|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk4: Now he makes is if he goes after clubs|pg||
nt|sharkey: Will he after the x?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Must decide which suit breaks, if any|pg||
nt|xenya: highly imaginative double by N -- particularly if it asked for a spade lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: Likely gifted declarer 1 trick|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think he'll go for @H|pg||
nt|sharkey: My prediction record is not very good :(|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|nt|Walddk4: Now a second chance for the defence|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sT|pg||
nt|chilloncan: if they hadnt announced them, that makes the objective of preempting against hem even less appealing|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed, but the truth is that against nebulous minor openings, it really does pay to pre-empt even on off-kilter hands|pg||
nt|sharkey: The @D6 may deny an Honor with N|pg||
pc|s9|nt|sharkey: If S takes the K and return @D East will be forced to play on @C as no entry to @H even if split 3-3|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sK|pc|h6|pg||
pc|dK|nt|othered1: in south's defense, partner did only overcall and then not act again, he's misfit, and west often has in imperfect 2@D bid over the negative double.  Defending could be only plus.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sharkey: This leaves E a losing option|pg||
pc|d8|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c5|nt|othered1: But I'd have bid at my first turn|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pelu: In OR Patrick Huang in East - in 3. seat - open 1@H - and NS never found the combined @H-stop: 5@C -1|pg||
