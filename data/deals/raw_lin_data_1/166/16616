nt|nigel_k:  I think they are both playing 2/1|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: NS standard...the Kiwis 2/1|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: this is what i was told ....Andy-Alex standard|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 1NT for N-S is a good contract|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|an|alerted|nt|Walddk2: and quite likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  3NT is difficult but not hopeless but 14 opposite 10 usually stops in 1NT|pg||

nt|athene: east shouldn't be tempted to lead a heart - his partner is known to have an opening bid, near enough, and didn't overcall 1@H over 1@C|pg||
pc|s2|nt|nigel_k:  Declarer can't really go down so will be concerned with overtricks|pg||
nt|athene: a club lead would often be appealing on this auction, but Axxx is not the best holding to lead from|pg||

nt|mrdct: hi everyone|pg||
nt|sybarra: DelMonte know as "ish" |pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: looks like a dull 4S for EW although 12 tricks can be made with the favourable diamond position|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: EW play a variant of the fantunes system|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: hi all e/w are playing fantunes|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|peachy: We'll get settled here shortly, welcome back everybody.  http://www.summerfestivalofbridge.com/index.php|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: if they got to 6, declarer would have a 50-50 guess -- whether to play for DJ singleton with north or DK singleton with south|pg||
mb|p|pc|s6|pc|sT|nt|marcsmith: my guess is 1 IMP to BROWN|pg||
nt|mrdct: EW play a weak 1NT opening, so the 1NT rebid is usually strong|pg||
nt|caitlin: @D transfer to @Hs|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mrdct: good start for EW as 3NT looks to be a superior contract to 4@s|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|mrdct: although both appear to make comfortably today|pg||
pc|d2|nt|marcsmith: at the other table they played from West and north led his singleton, solving declarer's problems in the suit|pg||
nt|marcsmith: draw trumps and play ace and another diamond looks like a normal line here|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|dJ|pg||

mb|1C|nt|swanson: Hello from California.|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|athene: if East declared 4H! it might buy EW a bit of time (no spade lead through the AQJ) but they should still go down|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Hi John|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Players' first name in their profiles|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|tomi2: can somebody tell me something about the player in east? everytime there are nationals in USA and i have few time to read the daily builetins, i let my pdf reader search for ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: "Germany". Then Results from Auken, Smirnov etc. are shown as well as results from Bach, who often plays in teams from New Zealand. But those builetins show Germany as his home ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: country|pg||
nt|athene: no-where to put the spade even if the defence never attacked the suit|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I think he is a Kiwi who lives in Germany|pg||
nt|athene: ok, 6-2 heart fit got lost - perhaps intentionally|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Ashley lives half in NZ half in Germany|pg||
nt|swanson: Declerer has a chance if the defense gets sloppy.|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  3NT looks ok double dummy but will need some good guessing|pg||
nt|athene: this could be very interesting|pg||
nt|tomi2: ah ok. just cant remember him from tourneys here|pg||
nt|athene: if declarer goes for the hearts, north gets in twice to play things through|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Hung has the spade 5 out...but not on the table yet|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: asking some stuff from W a the moment|pg||
nt|swanson: Partner didn't double 3@S so the suit wouldn't seem to offer much hope.|pg||
nt|athene: the defence somehow have to manoeuver to get 2 clubs, 2 hearts and the spade|pg||
pc|c3|nt|swanson: I don't understand the purpose of 3@S, actually.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I guess if partner didn't bid 3NT he was going to bid 4@h|pg||
nt|athene: this looks like a good start for the defence, but gib says it isn't good enough|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Since no forcing 3@h available|pg||
nt|athene: this is one of those very tricky hands where it isn't clear who should be attacking which suits|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why would 3@H not be forcing? It's too complicated if it is not|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Ash counting tricks :)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  We can see declarer can just play one round of hearts and North is cut off|pg||
nt|athene: for example if declarer plays a heart to the king and north grabs the ace and plays a spade, declarer may change tack and go for the clubs, making 3 spades, 1 heart, 3 diamonds and ...|pg||
nt|athene: 2 clubs|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||
nt|tomi2: the question what to do over openers 2nd bid is the reason why I prefer non forcing free bids :)|pg||
nt|athene: i.e. declarer might not ever need to lose to north's @HJ|pg||
nt|athene: to get up to his nine tricks|pg||
nt|athene: right|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  If they play diamonds declarer is under some pressure as he still needs to lose the lead three times|pg||
nt|athene: that's what he is going for|pg||
nt|athene: after the @C10 appeared at trick 1, declarer could count two sure club tricks|pg||
nt|athene: the 4-1 heart break actually helps declarer|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Andy in the tank|pg||
nt|athene: if they were 3-2, south could switch to a heart and north duck the king|pg||
nt|Walddk2: New info re Bach. He is of Danish origin. Son of Per Bach, Denmark, who immigrated to New Zealand many many years ago|pg||

nt|swanson: Declerer now ducks two spades and gives up a heart.|pg||
mc|9|nt|nigel_k:  Well played|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Ash claimed 9 after spade king was played|pg||
nt|athene: it looks odd that 8 tricks were claimed in the other room|pg||

mb|1C|an|2+|nt|marcsmith: EW can make 2C NS a couple of either major |pg||
nt|nickf: can we have player names please|pg||
nt|janm:  Sorry to be a little late - I just got a new computer and it isn't playing well with the Windows BBO client|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mrdct: Klinger won the South-West Pacific Teams which finished a couple of hours ago and is the top qualifier to the National Open Teams finals|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Im trying to find them out|pg||
mb|2H|nt|peachy: EW have the majority of HCP but  shapes run wild|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: this match is from the top section of the draw, whereby the loser gets a second chance|pg||
nt|mrdct: EW could be in trouble here but vulnerability is on their side|pg||
nt|ahollan1: favorable vulnerability = bid 'em up!!|pg||
mb|2N|nt|janm:  I'll try not to get too confused using the web version :)|pg||
nt|janm:  In the other room, East bid 3@s over the takeout DBL of 2@s - here, with East passing, we may see NS declare.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: And West too is yet another refugee from Sauron's Middle Earth|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|mrdct: 3NT for NS is touch and go|pg||
nt|janm:  I'm guessing that 2NT is some sort of Lebensohl, asking his partner to bid 3@c and showing a non-constructive hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Andrew specs and vug boss:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Rodal  |pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: heart lead a spade switch is best for the defence -- not obvious to find tho|pg||
nt|rodal f: Shirly:)@H|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mrdct: only has 8 obvious tricks but the defence could falter and present a @s trick for delcarer before getting to their 5 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: can Thompson find the double hook in @C for the make??|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm:  Most of us play Lebensohl after a T/O DBL of a weak 2 bid, but not everyone does in this auction - in fact, maybe here S is playing Lebensohl and N isn't|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm:  Although N certainly has a good hand and good support for clubs and spade stoppers, so maybe he bid 3NT on the theory that 9 tricks would be as easy in NT as in clubs|pg||
pc|c3|nt|nickf: Can we have the player names please?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|mrdct: if delcarer plays on @s himself it will need to be a low @s to the 9|pg||
nt|mrdct: although actually low to Q will also work if he drops the J on the 2nd round of @s|pg||
nt|rodal f: Seems as 9 will come by the  auto|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h7|nt|janm:  On this hand, I think he's going to be wrong - with no club spots so that West doesn't even have to hold off to have the clubs stopped (although surely he will duck here) - there isn't much of a source of tricks in NT|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mrdct: what he doesn't want to do is cash @d first as that could very easily set up the 5th defensive trick|pg||
nt|mrdct: choosing to win is hand looks like he's planning to go after @s immediately|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|nt|rodal f: 3-1-3-2|pg||
nt|rodal f: Safe two tricks at @C now. Next.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: r they negotiating a claim?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can be|pg||
pc|sK|nt|marcsmith: the south hand is going to get mangled when declarer runs the clubs|pg||
nt|janm:  I'll make my first (and probably wrong) prediction and bet on 5 tricks for declarer - 2 spades, 1 each in the red suits and 1 club|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|mrdct: in great shape to make this now|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|nt|ahollan1: you can spy on the other vugraph tables using http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
pc|s4|nt|janm:  So the Milne team will be plus at both tables here, to increase their lead|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|c5|nt|marcsmith: has to throw one spade and one heart|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you were here last set, i must correct bad info i gave|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: the matches are 32 boards  so this is the final segment of the match|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rodal f: Interesting. Need a endplay at @H now|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: the winner here moves on to the Semi-Final, the loser gets a 2nd chance  [but i think the other match is win or go home]|pg||
pc|d2|nt|marcsmith: if South throws S9 defence can still prevail|pg||
nt|mrdct: cashing out now|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|tejjyid: entry problems now|pg||
nt|raghavan: good defense - removing entry before Club 9 becomes the 9th trick|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  for BBO-TV. |pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mrdct: probably a claim going on now|pg||

nt|tomi2: given the play in the movie declarer must have done some revoke or so to lose the contract|pg||
nt|athene: just cash the diamonds ending in hand then play a club, and south is forced to give him entry back to his hand in spades|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|swanson: 3NT seems appropriate by East.|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 3NT looks reasonable|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: asking N about 2h bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pragmatic|pg||
nt|athene: if south finds a killing diamond lead, ok, well done him|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Alex: we do not do anything crazy :)|pg||
nt|swanson: It would take a low diamond out to defeat this one.|pg||
nt|tomi2: lol|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: lol indeed|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|athene: the @DA lead isn't quite good enough - it's a 1-suit squeeze on north!|pg||
nt|athene: if he unblocks, then south leads the @D9 but west covers|pg||
nt|athene: if he doesn't unblock, west ducks the @D9 continuation|pg||
nt|Walddk2: North will lead a spade|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: good result for the kiddies in the closed|pg||
nt|swanson: I would have tried 2@S on the with the North cards, even if forcing.  A heart lead would appear to be a disaster against notrump.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugrapha1: W considered for a while and passed|pg||
nt|athene: well i have found if i open a weak-2major and opps get into 3nt without mentioning or implying the other major, that is what i lead|pg||

nt|Walddk2: The vulnerability would make me do likewise|pg||
mc|11|nt|nigel_k:  I agree 3@c is not enough especially in fourth seat|pg||
nt|athene: yes, but there is a slight difference - in the other room, 3@C wasn't balancing|pg||

nt|ahollan1: nicely done|pg||
mb|2D|an| |mb|p|nt|ahollan1: there are only a few of us in the room so if there's something special you want to discuss -- just holler|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: multi  (wk in one major) and N is sure which it is|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mrdct: Alex Smirnov is a regular on the german open team and the welland team in US nationals|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i believe 2@D=artifiicial game force|pg||
nt|rodal f: NT not the best idea EW|pg||
mb|3N|nt|janm:  Will our West be able to restrain himself from bidding 3NT with all those spade stoppers and not much else? No|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: he has been a regular visitor to the main australian summer events in recent years - particularly Youth Week|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H = 4+ hcp, no good suit|pg||
nt|tejjyid: tough fro East 3@C an underbid, but what is better?|pg||
nt|rodal f: I was wrong. @D blocked when W have the NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|nickf: -------------------------------------------------->   Can you please put the player names in?|pg||
mb|p|pc|s5|nt|mrdct: south worth a raise now given that he passed 1st round|pg||
nt|mrdct: north has quite a good hand with some game prospects even opposite a very weak hand|pg||
nt|janm:  Now we'll get to see whether NS can do as well here as in the other room. Looks as if they need to get clubs going, but they do have all those aces, so should manage the club shift when it becomes obvious that spades are pretty hopeless|pg||
nt|sybarra: nervous about the stiff @D for sure|pg||
nt|rodal f: The best Andrew is to have it nice at home:) Just home now after a week seminar.|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|marcsmith: a heart lead or switch forces declarer to guess the clubs, but he can afford a wrong guess on a spade continuation|pg||
nt|mrdct: but he will anticipate that communication will likely be a problem|pg||
nt|mrdct: even more so with dummy a 4333|pg||
nt|janm:  Which red suit do you attack first?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: the players in the NOT [national open teams]  qualified for the event via a 14-round swiss event called the SWPT|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: Klinger won that event after gaining the lead in round 3 or 4 [and never looked back]|pg||
nt|peachy: E wants a diamond lead, I assume|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: back to back 5@D contracts   you won't see that often -- especially in non-imp games|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|marcsmith: now he has to guess the clubs again|pg||
nt|peachy: this is a challenging hand to make, but not impossible|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|pg||
nt|mrdct: at the risk of some differing views, i would say that EW have been quite easily the top pair in Victoria for the past 5 years or so|pg||
nt|janm:  I guess hearts, since then perhaps it won't be clear to the defenders which minor they want to play. Maybe heart to the ten, ducked, second heart won, now will N know to shift to clubs? |pg||
nt|raghavan: since South has checks in both Majors( whatever is 2D), North might have tried DJ - |pg||
mc|11|nt|janm:  Even if he doesn't though, S can hold up the diamond ace and declarer only has 4 hearts, 1 spade and 1 diamond before he has to give up a black ace.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Whar's best? @C 2-2 + Qdrop single or play N for QXX. Not best I've seen.|pg||
pg||
qx|o4|st||md|2SJ9HKQJ93DK9765C3,SQT5HA872D8CAJ652,SK732H54DAQ43CKQ4,SA864HT6DJT2CT987|sv|b|nt|athene: that isn't a huge difference though since you might argue that east was in the pre-balancing seat there if he had short hearts anyway|pg||
nt|athene: but west's decision is pretty close, so maybe that small factor tipped it|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Milne also didn't know what South's suit was|pg||
mb|1C|an|alerted|nt|swanson: With approximately 8 playing tricks and hearts well under control, asking partner to find a 3NT call after a 3@C balance is not going to be fruitful very often.|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  So his partner could have had hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|an|spades|mb|1S|an|H+D|nt|athene: hung has lots of options now, depending on agreements:- X (hearts), 1NT (sandwich), 1@S (michaels) all possible|pg||
mb|d|an|3 spades|mb|r|nt|tomi2: here I play double as "I would have overcalled 1@H over 1@D" and 1@S as takeout and not michaels|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Don't know if 1@s is Michaels or just takeout|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@H from south would be "I would have overcalled 2@H vuln over 1@S"|pg||
nt|swanson: The only drawback to transfers, in general, is that it gives the opponents maore opitions in the auction.|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: alex explaining 1s=H+D|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: I like a 2@H call here by South.  The suit is too good to initially offer other colors.|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|swanson: (over 1@S)|pg||
mb|2N|nt|athene: the extra space given to the opps helps them if they have discussed things, but gives them more ways to trip over their shoelaces if they haven't|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south shouldn't really like the idea of notrumps with a 5-5|pg||
nt|athene: these hands play better in suits most of the time|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Looks like maybe 3NT is makeable only by South|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|tomi2: my father once played a MP tournament in poland with his partner and they switched the meanings of 1@H and 1@S over partners 1minor opening. They claimed that there was no techical ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: advantage in that method but lots of players were not discussed and this caused many good board for him|pg||
nt|athene: if north plays 3nt, is a small spade killing?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|athene: @S9,10,K say, and now west gets in and plays the queen - the @S86 looks really big|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  Given that partner has three spades and four hearts, East will probably not lead a club|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Walddk2: :)|pg||
nt|athene: i guess this hand was sure to arrive after i said Axxx wasn't an appealing lead against notrumps :)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I did say probably :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|nigel_k:  It is a hard lead problem|pg||
nt|athene: west has to grab the ace and switch to the @SQ|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Alex will make this now|pg||
nt|athene: then he can unblock the ten under the jack, and east has that great @S86 over the 7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What about @CA and a spade switch?|pg||
nt|athene: or maybe unblocking the @S10 will do the same hing|pg||
nt|athene: i mean @CA, switch to @S10|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: it's a difficult position - sometimes you duck this lead so as not to give declarer two club tricks|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: :(|pg||
nt|tomi2: all ducked?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|c7|nt|athene: but with that dummy, it doesn't look as though declarer will need two club tricks|pg||
nt|athene: he is going to have enough tricks in the red suits in the fullness of time|pg||
nt|tomi2: good hand for some agreement about the lead of the 10|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|athene: so you either have to get the clubs going or get the spades going|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|c8|pc|s9|pg||
nt|athene: yes, if the @C10 was ambiguous, that certainly didn't help west |pg||
mc|10|nt|tomi2: i treat 10 9 x ... as start of "sequence of low cards" and lead the 9. so if Partner leads the 10 in this position it must be from an inner sequence and you can set up club tricks|pg||

pc|sA|nt|mrdct: 4@h was surely going to be at least one off and i think this will come up a trick short|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|swanson: I think one of the keys to using coded leads is to falsecard with the lead when you judge it won't hurt partner.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I thought Traian said N-S play std|pg||
nt|athene: it seems to be forcing in standard hung-smirnov|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|tomi2: same auction in two rooms other than 1nt - 3nt... that is very rarely|pg||
nt|athene: a boring 3nt anyway|pg||
nt|tomi2: they play 2/1gf|pg||
nt|athene: there is no suit that the defence can get any tricks from, which tends to give declarer a comfortable time|pg||
pc|c9|nt|tomi2: and since this is not the English open teams most players will have 2NT asforcing here ;)|pg||

nt|rodal f: Agree u there.|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think the 10 was right,  maybe E not thinking it out?|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|marcsmith: 5@D is clearly where you want to play|pg||
mb|2D|an| |nt|rodal f: Up to partnership. I like Q best|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: 3NT for NS here with @c 2-2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=(11)12-14 and includes some unexpected shapes|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: 3rd/4th seat  NS play 1N=good14 to bad 17|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D = @S and @C/@D  [ASPRO]|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm:  Bridge is a funny game, isn't it - if North had a club singleton, instead of a diamond singleton, his splinter would be encouraging for S, but here, it's going to turn S off, yet it's really the same, since N has only 3 clubs and they can go on |pg||
nt|janm:  the diamond KQ leaving him with a club stiff |pg||
mb|2N|nt|marcsmith: presumably 1@S shows four spades and a negative double would deny four|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N looks like either transfer or lebensohl|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or  transfer lebensohl|pg||
nt|ahollan1: either way   i think Thompson is supposed to bid 3@C unless holding a really strong hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmmm maybe they play 2@D=@S & another  [including @H]|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|peachy: I don't know what NS 1NT vul opening range is, but I assume 10-12. Kibitzer says "gutsy"|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: 2@H likely now from South|pg||
mb|3N|nt|marcsmith: bit too good for 3@C|pg||
nt|janm:  Of course N wouldn't have enough to splinter if he weren't a passed hand. |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Gosney in 1N West|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: now 3@D from north and another game try with 4@C by south seems sensibel|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Klinger led the 14 round Qualifying Event [South-West Pacific Teams] from Round 3 or 4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another possible double partscore swing -- but both will be close|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: the defenders from 2010, McManus just barely made it into the NOT in the final match of the SWPT|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mrdct: this looks like the road to 3NT|pg||
nt|peachy: could be 12-14 with an upgrade to 12 due to good spots|pg||
nt|raghavan: may end in +2 with C lead|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mrdct: or not|pg||
nt|mrdct: 5@c a maker also |pg||
nt|peachy: tricky lead but declarer has no other hope than K now|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok specs, all saying q was best,  I thought after winning ace, a spade back and covered by queen was enough|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but they were knocked out last night in the NOT Round of 20|pg||
pc|s2|nt|peachy: South cnnot go wrong nearly whatever he returns|pg||
nt|peachy: but understandably he wants to weigh the options at this time|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mrdct: first imps for milne as klinger-mullamphy got too high on the earlier @s partscore hand where andy hung delayed his raise|pg||
nt|janm:  Good lead, but it's not going to matter|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: @D3-3 should be enough for Hans|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dA|nt|peachy: North could have ducked this, to assure two club tricks. Perha[s he thought S had a singleton|pg||
nt|peachy: but if so, the trick was coming back laster in clubs|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|mrdct: if i remember the format correctly the winner of this match stays in the top bracket and can afford to lose their next match but still stay in the event|pg||
nt|mrdct: smirnov has losing options here|pg||
nt|mrdct: he could invent a layout where @C are 3-1 and the remaining @S are with the 3 - i whcih case he needs to pitch the losing @d now|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: Ash did not hesitate for a second|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I was hoping it would go 1@s-2@h pass when you said that|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: 2h bid came on the table in a flash|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: but even if you play 1nt forcing, it is not usually as a passed hand|pg||
nt|athene: which makes it less likely opener rebids short minors|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||

nt|athene: another interesting point of theory is what you show exactly for a 2@H response as a passed hand|pg||
nt|athene: there is a case for playing that as 5@H 5minor, much like east's hand, i think|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h8|pc|h6|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Walddk2: There is every time you have that hand|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: it depends how strict are your rules for weak-2 openers, of course|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  He didn't open a weak two so maybe hoped partner would pull 2@h sometimes with bad hearts|pg||

nt|janm:  With all these claims, why is the other table 2 boards ahead? :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: whatever|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Milne v Tishler is also close in the early goings   15-12|pg||
nt|janm:  2@d probably multi, although a few pairs like to play it as a weak 2@h bid|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: 1@D because  1st/2nd seat 1N is weak|pg||
nt|janm:  N will suspect his partner has hearts, but will probably find out before settling for 3NT|pg||
nt|janm:  Or maybe not after the 2@s overcall|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|marcsmith: slam in either major looks like an easy make -- not so easy to bid perhaps tho|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=9-11 HCP|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: a diamond lead might beat 6@S but 6@H is solid|pg||
nt|janm:  Probably S could have a bit less for a vul vs not weak 2 bid, but N probably thinks he has 9 tricks in his own hand|pg||
mb|2C|nt|marcsmith: the problem with 6@S is that you have to ruff a club. If North then ducks the first round of trumps, declarer may be tempted to repeat the finesse|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmm  i thought EW played 15-17 NT throughout |pg||
nt|ahollan1: blast 3N?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: a big key was not to block the suit with q10x |pg||
nt|sybarra: we might play it here in 2 1C |pg||
nt|sybarra: *2 @C |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: did Bill Jacobs think the hand was too good  ...  or have they changed System since the 2009 Team Playoff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the 1N response with 11 HCP and 3 quick tricks suggests system change|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: ahhh I'm told they now play the Fantunes system  that exlains sooooo much|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in that case, 1@C was a one round force, usually 14+ HCP|pg||
nt|sybarra: was chancey to bid 2 @H although it would have worked here|pg||
pc|cK|nt|janm:  And he does, with the A of hearts for 10|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
nt|rodal f: A correct but sadly pass from E, and a nice lead.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|peachy: this again will be a challenge when diamond development and entries make it a tangle|pg||
nt|janm:  At matchpoints, declarer would probably take the spade finesse for 5, but here he'll probably settle for his safe 10 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: reverse red suits in W |pg||
pc|dA|nt|peachy: I expect defenders will prevail|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|pg||
nt|marcsmith: North has to duck the first round of trumps, then I don't think declarer can make 12 tricks|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: @SA looks like weaker lead than @SK  -- that's typical of current treatment, but in the olden days Ace was the strong lead [for unblock or count]|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|pc|c2|pg||
nt|marcsmith: now it's easy|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: both pairs use  upside-down count & attitude|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so @S6 was encouraging in @S|pg||
nt|rodal f: If u have 6@H at 1NT one round force OK. But by 5 cards after 9+black cards at W. Nope|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: we will see|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I'm guessing 2@s forces 2NT and 3@c is puppet stayman|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  So he can play spades unless partner has five hearts|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  This is all speculation though|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  And he would have bid 4@s faster if that was the plan|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: half way call from the clock|pg||

mb|3S|nt|janm:  Reynolds must agree with me that they need to start getting some IMPs, and making a somewhat aggressive vul 2@s bid (presumably spades + a minor) is his way to try to do it|pg||

nt|ahollan1: maybe a transfer??|pg||
nt|janm:  Doubling would be more successful, but I'm sure there are hands where 5@d is down only 1 and 5@h makes|pg||
nt|janm:  East has a maximum in HCPs, but there are so many "quacks" that he knows he doesn't really have a good hand for play in a suit - still, his side has 9 hearts and the opponents probably have a bunch of diamonds. Perhaps he should DBL to say that |pg||

nt|janm:  1 @d, 2@ss, at least 1 @h and a couple of clubs - down something like 3 or maybe even 4? Another nice pickup for Markey|pg||
nt|janm:  Is a diamond or a spade here best? From the spade 8, Reynolds knows that his partner has either one or 2 spades (surely he'd have led the 7 from J87), probably 2, since he didn't lead a spade to start. He also knows that there isn't anything to |pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|nt|mrdct: def will cash 2 top @c and switch to @d i think|pg||
pc|dK|nt|peachy: declarer on thin ice, spades do not break (as is the odds) and now has two diamond losers during which defenders open up the hearts|pg||

nt|ahollan1: unfortunately this table is ahead of all other vugraph rooms, so there is nothing to compare|pg||
nt|janm:  gain from tapping declarer with a diamond, and in fact declarer could choose to pitch on the diamond. Surely he'll cash the spade A and then lead a red suit - if the hearts were different it might be productive to lead them through|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pc|h3|pc|cT|pg||

pc|dA|nt|rodal f: Well:)|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|janm:  That's an alternative, but now North is sort of endplayed - doesn't want to lead a red suit, and although a club won't do any harm, it won't do any serious good. Still, they're now up to 3 club tricks, and will still probably get the heart K, |pg||

nt|tez: 1@s 1nt 2@c 2@s all pass|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: and it was imps! |pg||
nt|raghavan: In open room did not reach even 5C|pg||
mb|4N|nt|marcsmith: lack of communication for the defenders means that 3N cannot be defeated tho|pg||
nt|peachy: West wisely stayed out of the sac|pg||
nt|marcsmith: not sure about the HJ lead|pg||
nt|marcsmith: likely to give away a trick -- generally Jx Jxx Jxxx Qx are terrible holdings to lead|pg||
nt|marcsmith: much prefer @CA here in the hope you can score fast tricks and maybe a ruff|pg||
nt|marcsmith: also, if leading Jx or Qx it is usually right to lead the low one|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3rd slam by 3 boards.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i bet Jacobs was tempted to bid 3@H|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: EW don't have any direct way to show a Weak 2-bid  they either PASS or open 3-level|pg||

mb|2S|nt|marcsmith: make that 11 even|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mrdct: 3rd seat might do something creative with souths hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this East hand is the exception to the rule that 1-suit openings show 14+ HCP   it is 12/13 when 5/4 in Majors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but it IS forcing|pg||
nt|rodal f: Spot as max level 3 at bought|pg||

nt|peachy: There were wilder hands early in the match|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: i much prefer a weak diamond raise to 1@S on that West hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm:  4 boards to compare and still 24 IMPs to the leaders, but board 30 looks as if it's good for the trailing team, so the fat lady hasn't started to sing yet.|pg||
nt|rodal f: No X and NS gain 1IMP|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|sT|pc|s5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C covers a number of hands including a normal raise  [1@H-2@H is weak]|pg||
nt|marcsmith: surely, you know North is going to raise hearts and the only question is whether you have a save, and partner is only likely to find it if you tell him what you have |pg||
nt|marcsmith: ie a weak hand with some diamonds|pg||
nt|janm:  2NT an interesting bid by South|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: 51 imps exchanged so far this set -- translating to a whopping +7 for Bloom|pg||
nt|marcsmith: 1@S is far less likely to hel him|pg||
nt|janm:  Oh, I see that board 30 actually looks good for the winning team - sorry!|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|nt|mrdct: good news for NS is they have found their 4-3 @h fit rather than 3-3 @s fit|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|mrdct: east's @h9 may prove to be a critical card|pg||
nt|marcsmith: having not raised the diamonds, West should lead the Jack here|pg||
nt|marcsmith: leading low is likely to tempt East to try to cash the ace to give you a ruff|pg||
pc|c5|nt|peachy: Even having raised, it might be a good idea as partner might want another suit led thru|pg||
pc|c3|nt|janm:  I don't think 2NT is going to be any better than 3@d here - and it might be worse, but it's hard to know how the play will go - West might end up having to lead spades to dummy |pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
nt|raghavan: May cash SA and play D|pg||
pc|c7|nt|janm:  The spade Q was good news, but the split is definitely bad news|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|janm:  2 spades and a heart in dummy, 2 clubs in hand, and not a lot of diamonds - I guess the good news is it isn't doubled|pg||
nt|janm:  2 of @cs looks like suit preference for diamonds over hearts, but Edgtton knows which red suit is better|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: so Rusinow leads against both NT and suits|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry -- i really did try to send that before trick 1 finished|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s4|nt|mrdct: dead in the water now|pg||
nt|mrdct: perhaps - east can still go wrong here by the most viable defences seem to be tap declarer with a @d or give p a @s ruff|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: secont last board...nest set at 12.45 Canberra time|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: next|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|d|nt|athene: north really passed?|pg||
nt|athene: that looks overly demure|pg||
mb|r|nt|vugrapha1: sorry|pg||
nt|tomi2: can somebody translate this into Dortmund - time?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|nigel_k:  The vugraph schedule page shows it in your local time|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: thx all|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: one hour from now|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: this is Dortmund time|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|swanson: We have another 'equal correction' takeout double by North.  I think that is a very sensible treatment.  |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|tomi2: "one hour form now" even works for YOUR timezone :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: woow|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Looks like North expected a better hand from South|pg||
nt|athene: well, we don't know for sure he has been intending to pull clubs to diamonds on these hands :) he has never had to make the decision|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|swanson: The pass seems wild speculation by North. |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  defence can take the first nine tricks and probably will|pg||
nt|athene: interesting what 1nt should say on this auction - i assumed south was going to redouble this anyway|pg||
nt|tomi2: alex likes the gamble, would have expected xx if it were natural, to increase the stakes. 1ntx is no game|pg||
nt|tomi2: but probably xx is s.o.s|pg||
nt|athene: redouble for rescue i mean|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  If it's right to bid 1NT instead of pass then it's right to sit the double|pg||
nt|swanson: West will know that his partner has all the missing high cards after the @S10 return so collecting all 9 defensive tricks should be easy.|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: when you see the dummy ...you know you have the defence right|pg||
nt|athene: east might be worried declarer has the @SK instead of the @SQ - then @S10 back is not so good|pg||
nt|athene: so he might try to cash the rounded suits right now|pg||
nt|swanson: East is nervous about returning a spade should his partner hold the @SQ rather than the @SK.|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: i am afraid the kiddies will not score very well on this board|pg||
nt|tomi2: i think Smirnov shoud run to 2@D. this will not be  doubled and go down 2 or more  so often|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Agree|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|nt|nigel_k:  I assume they are going to play clubs when they run out of other things to do|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|athene: west might be wondering whether his partner has @DJxxx and NO @HK|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: this is real|pg||
nt|athene: when it might be right to duck that trick|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: this is real|pg||
nt|athene: yes, thought so|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: this is real|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt is just hard to defend|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2 boards left|pg||
nt|mrdct: so Bloom, Milne and Noble into the semis with the other semifinalist to come from the match not on BBO|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|sybarra: this and one more in this quarter |pg||
mb|2D|nt|ahollan1: it will be interesting to see if defense is different at other tables when @DK is played at trick 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=(11)12-14  covers many shapes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: last year there was a big discussion on BBO Forum [or r.g.b] about whether or not to use conventional runout after Weak 1N - DBL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the conclusion matched the arguments about 1M-1N  forcing vs semi-force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: each camp is absolutely sure their treatment is right and the other treatment is wrong|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and vice versa :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: are we really waiting for Jacobs' bid?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one runout scheme uses RDBL to force bid of 2@C   the other would bid 2@C as Natural [totally new concept]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: winner gets to rest the rest of the evening -- qualifying into semi-final|pg||
nt|ahollan1: loser plays 32 more boards in the Quarter Final|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S forcing, usually 14+ HCP|pg||
nt|mrdct: hopefully the operator can keep the room open to report the result of that match as it could be sometime before it is published on the website|pg||
nt|janm:  And it's way past my bedtime, so goodnight all :)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|peachy: in my book, leading from xxx is typically the worst, J10x not really so|pg||
nt|mrdct: thx jan|pg||
nt|rodal f: The junior Del'Monte pressed last b. Else normaly a spot|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: in this seat, some play RDBL=2 suit |pg||
nt|marcsmith: yet another dull game for NS|pg||
nt|marcsmith: i'd much rather lead from xxx than from Jxx|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: ahh  there ya go|pg||
nt|marcsmith: South was remiss there -- 3@H redoubled is where i'd like to play this deal|pg||
mb|p|pc|dK|nt|rodal f: Perfect cards at E for force by 11HP?:) Y|pg||
nt|sybarra: just have to not get tapped too many times|pg||
nt|raghavan: should find H and  not finess for Club Q|pg||
nt|raghavan: HQ|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: and there's the flaw with the initial PASS  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=a) 7-9 3@S or b) 5-9 4@S|pg||
nt|peachy: I once read (I'd swear it was a Mike Lawrence book) that leading from xxx has the same effect on your defense as a sleeping pill would have on your attention span|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|mrdct: Klinger was down 17-31 to Yezerski at the half|pg||
nt|mrdct: it would be somewhat of an upset if Yezerski held-on given that Klinger won the swiss qualifying|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: sorry  maybe "flaw" is too harsh|pg||
pc|d8|nt|marcsmith: you have to make the oppo pay for making stupid lead-directing doubles|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: Tony Nunn out for blood with his half trick|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure how he avoids 2 @S losers, 1 @D, and how to handle clubs?  one loser looks to be there|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes but Club A and k falls CQ|pg||
nt|rodal f: Playable but will Liam find the road?|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|nt|mrdct: these lead directing doubles can have the side effect of putting the brakes on the opps when they were just about to overbid to slam|pg||
nt|raghavan: avoid finesse|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this has been quite a match|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mrdct: which may have been the case on back-to-back boards|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: seems to me both pairs at our table have played very well|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: looking at all hands  this is tough|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: and i should say the played well in both sets|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mrdct: as it happens a @c lead is much much better|pg||
pc|sA|nt|marcsmith: 3@H-XX would make 9 or 10 for a nice little gain|pg||
nt|sybarra: that solved that problem|pg||
nt|raghavan: well done|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s9|nt|ahollan1: @C ruff gains extra trump trick, but loses @H      i think|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: @S shift -- just didn't occur to me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D8 still looming large|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if Sartaj just plugs away with major suit cards he eventually score all 3 trump tricks for down 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but surely @HK most likely to establish an extra trick if partner holds any more points|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Thompson still has 1N opener without @HQ |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|h2|pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: i think   @SA  @HA @DJ @CK   yep that's enough for 1N|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|mrdct: or a switch even|pg||

nt|tomi2: again a hand for coded cards in defense|pg||
nt|athene: it is often a very nasty defensive dilemma - partner leads something through declarer|pg||
nt|athene: you have the ace and dummy has Kxx or Qxx|pg||
nt|athene: sorry dummy has Qxx|pg||
nt|athene: let's say you have AJ109|pg||
nt|swanson: Whatever else we know - it is always easier to play when one is looking at all the card.|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: alex is not smiling though|pg||
mb|1C|nt|athene: if partner has nothing in the suit, you want to put the nine in, but if partner has the king, you look silly|pg||
nt|tomi2: i think playing JT9 as 0 or 2 higher from a defender leading into the dummy is more usefull than in the opening lead|pg||
nt|athene: i suspect the @HJ might have been the cause of it|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  If partner has @cK you have six tricks and won't make any more by ducking surely|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|athene: if east had led the @H10 there would have been less reason for west to duck, perhaps|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|athene: but even then, it might have been hard to persuade him to play another heart through dummy at any point|pg||
nt|athene: these things are just never as easy when you can't see all the cards|pg||
nt|swanson: I agree that coded leads for the defense are more important after trick one than on opening lead.|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: but i think partner must hold the king  for his double|pg||
nt|athene: a spectator points out that if the defence had cashed the clubs first, west would know not to duck the heart because it would be the setting trick|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: so, with no diamond stopper, maybe it was east's responsibility to play clubs first to make it more obvious that both suits had to be cashed|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|swanson: At least E-W will not be lacking for topics of discussion after the session.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: it just doesn't seem trivial to me anyway, for sure|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: restart 12.45 in 45 mins from now|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|pc|sK|nt|athene: you might argue that east had to have the @HK for XX, but did he? how about the @DJ and @SQ instead|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|nt|athene: that would give declarer a bit of a silly stopper, i suppose|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sJ|pc|h8|nt|tomi2: then he would raise the spades at some point|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c4|pc|h4|nt|tomi2: and win the opening lead with the queen|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|s4|pc|c8|pc|c3|pc|d5|pg||
nt|athene: he wouldn't put in the @SQ from @SAQx in case declarer wins the @SK and runs six diamonds|pg||
nt|swanson: East simply could not have a redouble and then a double of 1NT with the two rounded kings.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|swanson: without|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I think if partner doesn't have @hK he definitely has @cK at least|pg||
nt|tomi2: west would not lead a small spade from xxxxx|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|nt|nigel_k:  You can win and play clubs to see what partner does|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|tomi2: probably not a spadeat all|pg||

pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: remember  Thompson didn't have a weak bid available in opening seat [even if he wanted one]|pg||
