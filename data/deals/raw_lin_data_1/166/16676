nt|bobh1: hello everyone|pg||
nt|tejjyid: hi Bob, Roland|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Lots of fairly classical precision for system, I believe|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I was hoping to find system cards on the NEC site, but if they are there, I can't track them down|pg||
mb|1N!|an|11-14 HCP|mb|d|nt|fabsayc: no heart 9 is entry|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: results site is http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest11/nec.html|pg||
nt|tejjyid: But Precision is, in a way, *the* Chinese system|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  - ah, I didÂ´nt see the 9 of @H, important card |pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: West adopts the iew that passing with a weak balanced hand is better than trying to fluke a partscore|pg||
nt|tejjyid: *view|pg||
mb|2D|mb|d|nt|othered1: Do we know NS's system?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Anyway - a tuff start|pg||
nt|bobh1: EW belong in 3@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: as i play 4@D has to be ace (not king or singleton)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the Hacketts are father Paul and son Justin two fine English players|pg||
mb|2H|nt|saverio: 3NT available for EW here   but not easy to get there|pg||
nt|bobh1: apparently the second double is takeout|pg||
nt|tejjyid: a fair treatement if West's 1st pass doesn't show values|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|bg: seems natural so far:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Yes North canÂ´t be young, I played in at team with him in 1970...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: welcome Hans|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Thks|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: If something lilke Precision, there would be questions about relative minor suit length, v what a double would show, etc.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont see what 5@C accomplishes but wont do any harm|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|kiwibridge: still young at heart I expect|pg||

nt|tejjyid: I'b be happy ot pass 2@H as East; I've done enough, IMO, with a 4441|pg||
nt|bobh1: yes but its so prime|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I'm not unsympathetic to the raise; but I expect West to be aggressive with say, 5 trumps & a black K|pg||

mb|1D|nt|fabsayc: prediction 2-NS will get too high|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|othered1: What's east's 1@C?|pg||
nt|othered1: From south's 2@C bid, I might infer it's a big @C|pg||
nt|bg: not sure but is normal start for a 2nnt rebid|pg||
nt|bobh1: EW will make a game try...bid 3N and try to make it|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|fabsayc: might even land in wrong suit|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I can tell you the McGann in the OR is indeed in 3N and looks like making so it could be 1st blood to Hackett|pg||

mb|2D!|an|FG|nt|kiwibridge: 6@D ? asks a kibitzer|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - on this board?...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes|pg||
nt|saverio: NS could take 11 tricks in 5@d here     another "not easy to find" game  |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'd prefer 2@C over the X|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 8 easy tricks is a good start; usuallythe defence will provide one along the way|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|saverio: 6@d should be off on a @s lead  even if it is a though lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|bg: it was 16+|pg||
nt|othered1: looks like a normal big @C auction, with 2@S showing a limited positive response.|pg||
nt|othered1: ty operator|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: in the other room West raised to 5@C|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 3N made on 1 for 6 imps|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: i might be tempted to do so too.|pg||
nt|xenya: makes sense, considering the vulnerability |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: with the west hand... 7 points in partners preemt might not produce a single trick|pg||
nt|xenya: putting maximum pressure on NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|bg: same result in other room on board 1|pg||
nt|othered1: the overcall does give west some useful information|pg||
nt|fabsayc: are you prepared to bid 7 if opponents reach slam, because that often happens with these extreme preempts|pg||
nt|xenya: spades behave, in a sense, so declarer can get out for -1|pg||
nt|saverio: do you agree on S 3NT?    |pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest11/nec.html   for Daily Bulletins (scroll down in the column to the left)|pg||
nt|bobh1: @c lead gives a trick|pg||
pc|c6|nt|tejjyid: Those bulletins are astounding, the eds/authors do a fantastic job|pg||
nt|lestergold: question of overtricks now|pg||
nt|lestergold: surely no tank here must be odds to play J or T @c|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|nt|saverio: wd by N to move from 3NT anyway|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed the stiff A@H didn't look that great|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|dQ|pg||

nt|chilloncan: mirrored shapes and marginal game values dont mix well|pg||
nt|lestergold: well if he bids it will west lead his fourth best from hismlongest and strongest the only lead to give 3N|pg||
mb|4D|an|4342  16-17|nt|hawe45:  Another good move from Hac-Hac|pg||

mb|4S|nt|kiwibridge: Bulgaria are 2nd and Hackett are 6th at this time|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: That's an effort you'd see in many duplicate clubs.|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: the auction in the other room was completely different -- S chose to preempt in 1st seat|pg||
mb|p|nt|saverio: not easy to get to slam after 2@h/3@c/4@h...  a lot of space wasted and no more room to investigate|pg||
nt|tejjyid: OH, thy're certainly getting to game|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like 4@d is systematic|pg||
nt|chilloncan: the double by W makes S hand worse, and NS not vul. but most wiould bid game even if appreciating the negative factors|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|nt|tejjyid: I guess, that's why it took so long to find.  |pg||
nt|chilloncan: 6 LTC + 8.5 LTC means larginal for game even apart from the mirror|pg||
nt|tejjyid: South *might* have passed 2@S NV< but once not, no way to stop|pg||
nt|bobh1: actually no way to misdefend|pg||
nt|chilloncan: it is a difficult double dummy problem i ndeed to imagine a scenario where EW could let it make|pg||
nt|lestergold: well North was very max for his 2@s and south was sub min for 2N|pg||
nt|tejjyid: If they routinely make single raises with 16 HCP, South is pretty much compelled to try will 9+|pg||
pc|hT|nt|bobh1: E is thinking hard about finding one|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|sybarra: now what?|pg||
nt|othered1: 4N would have been a very descriptive bid, if quantitative.  Not sure what 5@H would mean in that context.  Perhaps a choice of game, perhaps responding to blackwood, which some do ...|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: i wd have played the @Hq trying to pin the 10 or 8... but the lack of entries to dummy wd had led to him laying down the Ace|pg||
