mb|2D|nt|paulg:  Jones/Jones play Acol, Sime/Matheson play 5-card majors, strong notrump|pg||

nt|vugraphzxy: Hi all, will try to keep up!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South possibly close to 3@s over 1NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but 2@S should be forcong, so no real hurry|pg||
nt|dagold: if natural he hass it. but some play that as a splinter|pg||
nt|athos: Bénédicte joue avec Sylvie Willard de l autre côté|pg||
mb|p|nt|milton_se: trumps 3-2, no drama|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 5@C cheaper than 4@H|pg||
nt|ralfwil: not if NS can find their @s ruff|pg||
nt|idc: Joined by SHields & Denning playing a strong club system, also with a 15-17 NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  i think Sime will bid 4@s here, which will give Daffyd Jones an interesting problem|pg||
nt|ralfwil: can W find 4@d?|pg||
mb|p|pc|dA|nt|ralfwil: but this can go down|pg||
nt|athene: would 4nt be general takeout now?|pg||
nt|athene: having limited his hand with 4@H |pg||

nt|athene: hi|pg||
nt|paulg:  best defence will take this down 3 ... and they are on the road to that|pg||

nt|chilloncan: salut a tout le monde|pg||
pc|dT|nt|pfbr: swingy in their direction :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes indeed|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|toobad: good evening all|pg||
nt|rmb1: Hi John|pg||
nt|ralfwil: This is a disadvantage keeping a 5-card major when opening 1nt|pg||
nt|idc: A start like: 1@s 2@d 4@d would get the job done a lot more easily|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rmb1: Sorry 2@C = clubs INV+ or other GF, 2@D relay|pg||
nt|justin c: i should have more faith|pg||
nt|mikeirl: S attack best|pg||
nt|justin c: imagined that N would try harder to play in @C|pg||
nt|toobad: this should be off a trick in each suit|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|justin c: knows he is being forced if @H trumps, but the short hand taking the tap in @C|pg||
nt|mrt2000: don't think so|pg||
nt|athene: yes, very easy to get the two diamond ruffs|pg||
pc|d7|nt|rodal f: Seems as a flatty. 120 tr|pg||
nt|rodal f: 10 tr|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed, but the necessity of making one more trick for game may have influenced his thinking|pg||
nt|rmb1: Trumps 3-3 makes this easy in practice but not before some agonising|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes!|pg||
nt|dagold: so this should be pretty simple, probably 2 overtricks|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: Jones asking system|pg||
nt|toobad: Hi Robin|pg||
nt|chilloncan: on serait tente de conclure de ces encheres que NS ne jouent pas le 2 faible a K, et que EO joue un SA faible. mais je m'en doutes, tous les deux:)|pg||
nt|chilloncan: surenchere de 2K a probablement aide EO de trouver leur fit C....par contre, une ouverture de 2K aurait bien u compliquer la vie EO|pg||
nt|athos: l ouverture de 1SA avec une majeure 5eme, on le sait n'est pas très commun ici, mais on y arrive, en general avec des mains de 15-16 l autre majeure 3eme et des points un peu ...|pg||
nt|athos: épars. Ici on aurait pu. Le 2@d faible en France, non, on a deux ouvertures forte au palier de 2|pg||
mc|9|nt|athene: the only big hurdle was finding the opening lead|pg||

nt|mikeirl: ok|pg||
nt|steveray: hard to see this making|pg||

nt|yo_yo: that's the end of 3NT then|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i would like the see the bidding, i cant understand why they arent in 4@H|pg||
nt|steveray: assuming East opened 1@C South should not take the @S finesse|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@c "natural", ostensibly 5+ clubs and a major or 6+ clubs with enough to open the bidding|pg||
nt|mrt2000: oh boy ...................|pg||
nt|toobad: a bit frisky by S at the vulnerability..|pg||
nt|athene: neither, i would think|pg||
nt|idc: will sime dbl?|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose he might double|pg||
nt|idc: continuing from last set, where first 4 hands (at both tables) were all dbld contracts|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I prefer 2@c from W in this situaton|pg||
nt|idc: East has added a point, now West may add a point or two and ... it may end in tears|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@s=4@S, minimum or medium hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|toobad: 2nt now??|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2NT now?|pg||
nt|rmb1: y :)|pg||

nt|justin c: hi|pg||

nt|mgchat: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: but being in third position at favourable is enough to open the bidding nowadays|pg||
nt|mrt2000: trouble here|pg||
nt|idc: North wondering if it is time to unsheath the axe|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: 2@C = nat, limited (6+ or 5C+4M)|pg||
nt|sybarra: havent gotten to card yet, is is some form of flannery?  (I may get killed for mentioning that word) |pg||
nt|toobad: a @H lead ducked by S woud have been really unpleasant for declarer|pg||
nt|toobad: short and sweet|pg||
nt|sybarra: and a discussion every partnership needs to have,  is 2 @D forcing by passed hand?  (I think not,  cue bid only force) |pg||
nt|idc: Beimg Aceless on this sort of auction is a minus|pg||
nt|chilloncan: meme dans un pays tranquille on risque un petit son avec la main Ouest:)|pg||
nt|chilloncan: prefere de loin X a 2SA|pg||

nt|mgchat: un 2@h en 3eme )))|pg||
nt|mgchat: Kaffineur ne va pas etre a la fete sur le defilé des @c|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mrt2000: N must have seen his partner's overcalls before|pg||
nt|toobad: 3c from Ian is v tame|pg||
nt|roswolf: the club holding is bad and he is missing 2 aces but south must hld enough|pg||
nt|mgchat: Laffineur|pg||
pc|hT|nt|rodal f: E? Who have the rest of the pints?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi all:) Could have been a interestin 6@D if opp was 1-3 at @D|pg||
nt|rmb1: Difficult for North to act with all but one of his points in opponents suits|pg||
nt|dburn: awkward for South - best is probably not to shift to spades, but it looks an obvious defence to follow|pg||
nt|idc: and holding KJx in partner's suit an even bigger minus for doubling|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with open cards W can take a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|idc: I suspect he wants to take a number of @d ruffs in hand, shorten trumps|pg||
nt|idc: not that he has many entries to dummy but North may be forced into helping him|pg||
nt|Walddk7: http://bridgetopics.com/news/2010/dec/helgeness-and-fantunes-immigrate-monaco|pg||

pc|hA|pg||
nt|paulg:  i disagree with Sime's strategy here|pg||
pc|cK|nt|paulg:  either bid 5@c on the first round or pass/double 4M|pg||
nt|idc: Puts more pressure on opponents to bid 5@c straightaway, yes|pg||
pc|c6|nt|rodal f: Second best|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yes Ruff and play a @h to dummy, ruff a @d, take @hA and exit with @cA and a @cx|pg||

nt|justin c: i see 11|pg||

pc|c2|nt|vugraphzxa: N thinking...|pg||
nt|mrt2000: on that lead, this may only go 1 off|pg||

nt|Walddk7: http://bridge.silvertexter.eu/results/1O3.TXT for running scores|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cA|nt|sybarra: and down we go |pg||
nt|idc: North may stretch to bid over 5@c with some shape|pg||
nt|idc: Easy for me to say that - North holding @cKQ so that South cannot easily get on lead isn't easy for declarer to know|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||

pc|s5|pc|d5|nt|chilloncan: E debloque la dame au 2e tour de la couleur|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|paulg:  yes, i think 5@c immediately is likely to be best|pg||
nt|athene: south will try to cater for 5 spades and @DK with partner|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: as well as just the two aces cashing|pg||
nt|athene: so he lays down the @DA first to see what partner has to say about that|pg||
nt|idc: or if North passes, a second dbl from South is a bit undefined as to how takeout-ish it is|pg||
nt|chilloncan: dame de coeur je voulais dire|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d6|nt|chilloncan: pour Ouest c'est evident qu'E tient une honneur a K|pg||

pc|d7|nt|dburn: well, he followed it - but declarer didn't have any diamond losers to ruff in dummy|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|dburn: and this has helped him keep control of the hand|pg||
nt|dburn: to the extent that if he can guess hearts, he will actually make|pg||
nt|rmb1: or discard a heart and ensure -1|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mrt2000: not now  :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sybarra: 2 @H was both majors,  5-10 pts |pg||
nt|ralfwil: it was a mistake from W not to ruff @dK|pg||

nt|athene: of course he might not be able to make it (he might play silly artificial 4minor openers or something)|pg||
nt|idc: Every other North in the event seems to have dbld 1@s with North hand - I prefer Shields' approach|pg||
nt|justin c: if East had @H length there would be|pg||
nt|roswolf: just because the contract may fail doesnt mean the bidding was wrong - and i feel n/s were unlucky|pg||
nt|othered1: close|pg||
nt|chilloncan: peut-etre le record europeen pour la duree du jeu d'u n contrat de 2K a la 2e donne d'un match :)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|rodal f: A new interestin spot NS this time|pg||
nt|sybarra: landing in 3 nt by e/w?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: A interesting hand|pg||
nt|dburn: undignified, that|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 6@C anybody?|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello emre |pg||
nt|paulg:  yes, 4@d shows spades for them|pg||
nt|idc: Matheson will sit for this dbl I'm sure|pg||
nt|paulg:  tough for matheson|pg||
nt|toobad: on a sunny day|pg||
nt|othered1: more like they weren't lucky.|pg||
nt|roswolf: well put:)|pg||
nt|athos: pourquoi europoe|pg||
nt|athos: europeen|pg||
nt|hawe45:  et non-vulnerable aussi...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  et non-vulnerable|pg||
nt|chilloncan: a cause de Mark Feldman et d'autres tortues legendaires de mon pays|pg||
mb|1H|nt|rodal f: U can clime if it's obvious vug opperator:) Spare time|pg||
nt|egezzer: Shirley:)|pg||
nt|toobad: spade part score here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rmb1: Can west make 4@S|pg||
nt|justin c: 2@D = @D and Major, 5-9, or long @D 10-13|pg||
nt|roswolf: multi -bid showing here a weak red suited x2 hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Ici il faut Ã©viter 6 111s|pg||
mb|2D|nt|vugraphzxa: hai all|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1@H=1S|pg||
nt|idc: 5-4-2-2 is close enough to balanced and the 5-level is awfully high already|pg||
nt|dagold: 2@d showing hearts|pg||
nt|hawe45:  6 @s|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 3SA|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 3SA semble une enchere evidente et automatique|pg||
mb|2N|nt|justin c: @CK lead|pg||
nt|milton_se: possible to make -- but I wouldn't like to be here :)|pg||
nt|idc: The N-S 1@d is < 16 hcp, bal or unbalanced with either minor|pg||
nt|chilloncan: mais lente, semblerait-il|pg||
nt|chilloncan: waouw .... 2SA=Passe|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  although Sime could hardly be worse and you'd expect to make 5@h|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rodal f: Interesting. Need @H lead for stop a 6er|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr wrong|pg||
nt|rodal f: Have one chance more|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: he might - the cards are fairly well disposed|pg||
nt|toobad: started with 12 finished with 10|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 5422 with a trump trick is not at all a hard decision in my view|pg||
nt|idc: Looking at North's hand on opening lead, there must be a case for a @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: 2@S=force|pg||
nt|insia1: will they go to slam ?|pg||
nt|rmb1: 4@C allowing partner to judge what to do over 4@S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @dA as well as @hJ on side  in 6@c|pg||
nt|milton_se: there|pg||
nt|sybarra: anderson showing good judgement, as much as he would like to be in red game|pg||
nt|idc: 2@d is I think a relay for a game-forcing North hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: 3@d alerted by shields but not denning|pg||
nt|roswolf: the e/w system has a lot of relays and transfers|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: can subsequently promote @S10|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 3@D showed a @H suit here|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2NT = 16+ BAL|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@d=hearts, 10+hcp, not 5332 shape |pg||
nt|dagold: might just get home in this but should be 1 down really|pg||
nt|chilloncan: sur la 2, Zimmerman a bien evalue sa main de facon plus aggressive que Philippe, et en a paye une amende de 5 IMPs|pg||
nt|chilloncan: on ne pourrait en conclure que 2SA etait forcing|pg||
pc|d7|nt|steveray: but 5@H is cold on 2 finesses|pg||
nt|rmb1: And NS judged to give up quietly ?|pg||
nt|justin c: if dec ducks trick 1, needs @h underlead later|pg||
nt|justin c: bit easier from where we are sitting|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rodal f: 6@C to come|pg||
nt|toobad: 6c is a great contract|pg||
nt|idc: Oh, South would be on lead on this auction of course|pg||
nt|idc: I supose a @s from South would also do|pg||
nt|chilloncan: mais ce serait une nouvaute|pg||
nt|mgchat: lollll|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rodal f: And the @C blowed away after the invit 3@D|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 10 or 11 tricks here|pg||
nt|roswolf: should make since he shouldnt get the trumps wrong|pg||
nt|warrens:  @H shift or he can make it with an endplay|pg||
nt|athos: j ai une CC (qui n'eest peut etre plus à jour) pour fantoni nunes|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 3T = ?|pg||
nt|athos: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008MindSportGamesBeijing/Open/Italy/fantoni-nunes.pdf|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Meddy:)|pg||
nt|steveray: North needs partner to play a club before the D@s are set up|pg||
nt|steveray: Diamonds that is|pg||
nt|dburn: one of these days, the English will lead trumps when declarer actually has some diamond losers to ruff in dummy|pg||
nt|justin c: lol|pg||
nt|dburn: still, no great matter against a part score|pg||
nt|rmb1: Less good opposite 3442|pg||
nt|idc: "relay" isn't quite the right term (he said, wearing his pedants hat) but we know what the CC means|pg||
pc|h7|nt|warrens:  well done|pg||
nt|athos: 1@c 3@c = 5@c 5x+ FM|pg||
nt|athos: en admettant que cette CC de 2008 est tjs valide|pg||
pc|hA|nt|idc: Can't complain to the dealing machine so far; these first few hands fun|pg||
nt|athene: declarer trying to get something going - set up a spade is almost impossible but you might set up a black-suit squeeze if the defence are very sleepy|pg||
nt|idc: Quite a bit of work to do here|pg||
pc|h3|nt|yo_yo: well done erichsen|pg||
nt|justin c: if i understood the system card, E knew West with 6@D or @D and M|pg||
nt|justin c: so marked with @H once dec followed to trick 1|pg||
nt|chilloncan: CC Monegasque risque d'etre legerement differente|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but will south lead @C?|pg||
nt|steveray: might the @D be a singleton?|pg||
nt|mikeirl: odds on to|pg||
nt|rmb1: North can afford to be passive, but this is the most direct approach.  Hopefully 4@C bid will reap its rewards now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he might take his partner for a singleton @D?|pg||
nt|rmb1: Declarer would not allow @DK to win if he had the ace|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hopefully selway will work that out|pg||
nt|justin c: is the West hand not worth a strong @C opening?|pg||
nt|justin c: seen worse|pg||
nt|justin c: maybe they dont get to game even then|pg||
nt|chilloncan: normalement 2SA = proposition de manche, et je n'arrive pas a voir a quel titre E pourrait juger qu'il a meme une miette de valeurs supplementaires, ayant deja intervenu rouge ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: contre vert en face un partenaire  passe|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|insia1: good bid|pg||
nt|rodal f: Make S hand as main and nwxt|pg||
nt|rodal f: Coffe|pg||
nt|steveray: might expect the finesse to win|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he did |pg||
nt|paulg:  ruffing with the @d9 only tells the opponents that the @d8 might be an entry .. does not matter here, but careless talk can often cost|pg||
nt|idc: West has led the unbid suit (assuming as I suspect that 3@d is natural), and looks good for defence|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/camroseteams.htm  for team rosters and convention cards|pg||
nt|sybarra: click on the partnership, to see the convention card|pg||
nt|egezzer: West is John Greenwood,Shirley?|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe club lead ...after alert, which may have been "could be 2" |pg||
nt|idc: I should warn specs that comparisons may take some time to trickle through - other room still on their first board|pg||
pc|c3|nt|pfbr: david greenwood|pg||
nt|idc: and since they start with 15 & 16, they won't reach Bd 1 for a while|pg||
nt|paulg:  Walker and Short then, not the Outreds, in the other room|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|dburn: the strong variety of 1@c has a higher lower bound for Carrot players than for Precision players|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No swing - chelem dans la salle ouverte aussi, je pense - 4 @S se joue plus vite|pg||
pc|h6|nt|insia1: I think he will drop @C, after finess @D|pg||
nt|idc: indeed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: can take the heart finesse twice - 3@h 1@d 5@c?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|pfbr: (JTR) on bbo|pg||
nt|rmb1: Like scores at http://bridge.silvertexter.eu/results/1O3.TXT|pg||
nt|chilloncan: la main de E vaut plus justement une enchere de 1SA sur l'invitation de 2SA, plutot qu'allr a 3SA:)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|toobad: +4 after the lead|pg||
nt|idc: Tough hands this type: neither declarer & dummy nor the defenders' hands have any communications between them|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is -1|pg||
nt|warrens:  hoping to endplay E if he has Kxx of @C's and 2 @h's (not really possible, but he can dream)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|chilloncan: et entretemps E avait une enchere hyper-evidente de 3SA en directe sur 2KA. |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rmb1: Temptation with 2-suiters is to open 1suit nat if possible to get your suits over quickly|pg||
nt|egezzer: Oh. Thank you Anita|pg||
pc|sA|nt|yo_yo: Just what we would expect from the winners of the Premier league|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Bonjour à Gilles Péré|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c9|nt|dagold: indeed he can. Sorry, distracted here|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: sorry, 4 cards left to play, declarer has won last 4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: why not @CJ? |pg||
nt|mdgraham: not that it matters with 3-2 clubs|pg||
nt|dagold: to keep the entry to the hearts?|pg||
nt|chilloncan: difficile a commenter les encheres ici sans connaitre les nuances aussi bien que les significations en gros|pg||
pc|c5|nt|idc: Declarer has @s suit I guess, but other than that, yuck|pg||
nt|dagold: good result for EW|pg||
nt|8252: hello|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|chilloncan: sur la  2 dans l'autre salle, sequence rarement timide chez les Bessis pour rater la manche imbattable...et ils ne jouaient meme pas le coup|pg||
nt|chilloncan: salut Gilles:)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rodal f: Normal? But who chares?|pg||
nt|insia1: well, mantap|pg||
pc|s5|nt|idc: Declarer now wondering if he has anything better than @dA onside & @s 3-3|pg||
pc|s7|nt|steveray: well done|pg||
nt|roswolf: east is taking a slight risk|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @dA on side and 3.-3 in @s.....|pg||
pc|s3|nt|dburn: and experience suggests that, especially when at unfavourable vulnerability, two-suiters should try to bid naturally rather than open a strong club|pg||
pc|sT|pc|c7|pc|s8|pg||

nt|rmb1: open room started at board 15, so we will see comparisons when they complete board 1, etc.|pg||
nt|dburn: not quite sure why he made only three|pg||
nt|dburn: perhaps to reassure his partner that they had not missed a game|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: sorry bad light some cards incorrect|pg||
nt|toobad: that always feels bad, even when it isnt|pg||
nt|athene: east might open 1@C in third seat here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, solid plus |pg||
nt|roswolf: a good start for the english|pg||
nt|chilloncan: mais one se serait attendu chez cette paire qu'ils aient les moyens de decouvrir la qualite trouee de leur atout|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mikeirl: they're just starting Board 1 no|pg||
nt|mikeirl: *now|pg||
nt|athene: looks reasonable, if not exactly mandatory|pg||
nt|paulg:  nice hand for South but these strong 4441s often tricky to bid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@d=0+@D|pg||
mb|d|nt|rodal f: A coffe board to come it seems|pg||
nt|idc: Wales also opened 1NT on Bd 17, so no slam bid in other room either: 1 IMP to Scotland|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: par looks like 4M-1 over 4@C=|pg||
nt|mikeirl: perhapsS |pg||
nt|steveray: S might try 3NT|pg||
nt|mikeirl: perhaps S will bid 3nt|pg||
nt|rmb1: OK. So 4@C= is par because 4MX-1 is 200|pg||
nt|mikeirl: snap!|pg||
nt|steveray: or will ask for a @S stop|pg||
nt|rmb1: Will NS get into the auction on this one? |pg||
nt|mrt2000: David must be getting bored  .......  :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: only -1 in 5@c on board 1. Defence must have sipped|pg||
nt|sybarra: one of our fellow commentators with great analysis and even greater sense of humor (imo)|pg||
nt|pfbr: mine too :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @D= multi|pg||
nt|athene: they're easier when opps bid your singleton :)|pg||
mb|2N|nt|athene: ok, east didn't oblige :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: I would have opened at Ws hand. 1@S 110 by 100 times|pg||
nt|dburn: well, one of them will|pg||
nt|dburn: probably the one with the spades|pg||
nt|dburn: ah - the support double!|pg||
nt|dburn: now what on Earth, I wonder, is East supposed to do with that?|pg||
nt|rmb1: Support XX from North ?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry slipped...|pg||
nt|egezzer: I fully agree with you. And excellent player actually|pg||
nt|paulg:  Matheson would want a better suit, or worse hand, to open 1@c|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt on ew with that nice @c situation|pg||
mb|3S|nt|toobad: on board 17 Wales have been allowed to play in 3nt where the Jones found the good 4S save against it|pg||
nt|athene: east must be a bit worried about the hearts now|pg||
nt|athene: that might stop him balancing|pg||
nt|idc: I like 1@s but here it may end the bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: that is a bad idea|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Hedy Gray |pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Shirley |pg||
nt|paulg:  perhaps not that tricky to bid, although you'd prefer to be in 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt pass 3nt would get the job done|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and 1@s is, amazingly, natural|pg||
nt|dagold: sometimes 3-cards|pg||
mb|4H|nt|rodal f: :) 100 by 100|pg||
nt|steveray: non scientific|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2@D = Ms constructive|pg||

nt|athene: no way west is finding a club lead against that sequence|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://bridge.silvertexter.eu/results/1O3.TXT  for running scores|pg||
mb|p|nt|milton_se: North raised w AS on first spade from dummy|pg||

nt|hedyg: where is Anderson going?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: David smiling and asking questions|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3@h from W?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: Yes|pg||
nt|idc: 3@h West, 3NT East, then West thinks for a while and ..?|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: je m'excuse aussi pour tout massacre de la grammaire francaise qui n'arrive pas a se deguiser vraisemblable en alibi de faute de frappe:)|pg||
mb|p|pc|sA|nt|sybarra: and overwhelming response that he is also one of the world's nicest guys |pg||
nt|rmb1: 4@H now - nowhereelse to go|pg||
nt|idc: Sorry, East bidding 3NT would be wrong - I forgot the early auction, heh|pg||
nt|idc: Tough spot for West now|pg||
nt|mgchat: ca va pas arranger les choses pour Laffineur|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rodal f: 2@D game force I precume|pg||
nt|rmb1: On  1 NS's decision to play in 4@H rather than 5@C was worth an IMP to England|pg||
nt|sybarra: hopefully anderson "hits the deck" |pg||
nt|sybarra: (aka passes)|pg||
nt|justin c: @C lead and @H switch was needed here|pg||
nt|chilloncan: vraisemblablement|pg||
pc|s4|nt|hedyg: he can make this|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@d GF relay|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|dburn: it ought to have been worth more than that - 5@c was down off the top|pg||
nt|athene: yes, a pity that the one time in a hundred years a real blue club 2@D comes up, and the person holding the hand isn't playing blue club :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: As W I had used a straight forward 3@d instead of 1@s|pg||
nt|dagold: the lucky spade lie see's this home|pg||
nt|dagold: needed a heart lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South just knew North would lead one of those|pg||
nt|dagold: if declarer takes the 4th heart, north can switch to a club to defeat 3N|pg||
nt|justin c: @h lead seems normal enough tho|pg||
nt|roswolf: for running scores see http://bridge.silvertexter.eu/results/1O3.TXT|pg||
pc|d7|nt|idc: Though I could have been worse: he might be in 4@s with AKX opposite xxxx :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and easy for E to bid 3nt|pg||
nt|idc: No one likes to jump rebid their suit these days - seems to have got devalued by people doing it on 15 counts|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rodal f: The X from S could have costed 800|pg||
nt|rmb1: Not that you want to be in 4@H, even if you pick up @HK|pg||
nt|hawe45:  A la grammaire danoise, je suis imbattable|pg||
nt|chilloncan: une donne "pause-cafe"|pg||
pc|dA|nt|toobad: i'd rather have a shot at 3nt|pg||
nt|othered1: lead may have given the positin away|pg||
nt|roswolf: england currently hold the lead but many boards to go|pg||
nt|warrens:  he knows that West has at least 2 high clubs, but all 3 or HH10x?|pg||
nt|justin c: wonder what N will make of this?|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|mikeirl: good lead|pg||
nt|toobad: thinks all his cards are working, if David short in H game has chances|pg||
pc|d5|nt|idc: In Bridge World this month I saw someone (Zia?) playing 1@c - 1M - 3@d as forcing good club suit - interesting treatment|pg||
nt|idc: Not that it would have helped on this auction|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mrt2000: 10 tricks again, I think|pg||
nt|warrens:  if he thinks that East has the @H K, he should get it right|pg||
nt|warrens:  :)|pg||
nt|othered1: North obviously has been there before :)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|dagold: a heart lead no good for the defence of course due to declarer's heart spots|pg||
pc|h4|nt|idc: If dummy had another entry, declarer could try crossing & taking early @d finesse to test it out|pg||
nt|idc: but here that's a bit all-or-nothing|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Walddk7: http://bridge.silvertexter.eu/results/1O3.TXT for running scores|pg||
nt|rmb1: To reach 3NT South needs to show some of his stuff outside @H - rather than rebidding 3@H|pg||
nt|chilloncan: concours quotidien?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mdgraham: neat pin |pg||
nt|dagold: it has to be QT doubleton really|pg||

nt|mrt2000: as predicted|pg||
nt|toobad: after the opening bid, that hand played itself|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes|pg||
nt|rmb1: Open room managed a more normal 11 tricks in @C part score on  18|pg||
nt|toobad: 3nt + seems par|pg||

nt|chilloncan: je me demande que voulait dire S par son enchere de 2SA...la main ne semble pas  se conformer  au profl de Lebensohl|pg||

nt|steveray: easy 4@H|pg||
nt|toobad: 3nt here for ns|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|athos: Marshall tu peux me confirmer ? on les appelle des swan les 7411 chez vous :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|insia1: NS or EW will become a decl ?|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2@D is a weak multi 0-7 (2M is 8-11)|pg||
nt|paulg:  Sime might bid a weak 2@s now?|pg||

nt|dburn: more or less forced|pg||
nt|dburn: would like to double for penalty, of course, but...|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@D=4+|pg||
nt|rmb1: On  18 in open, South could open 3@C = both minors, weak|pg||
nt|athene: he's a disciplined fellow obviously - he'll wait until he has that @SJ :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: strong club|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@d=0-7|pg||
nt|roswolf: strong|pg||
nt|othered1: looks like normal 4@S here after east shows strong balanced hand|pg||
nt|chilloncan: terme anglais|pg||
nt|chilloncan: pas tres repandu aux USA|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|sybarra: a reason the Hogg does not bid 1 sp?|pg||
nt|toobad: not the sort of board NI require when searching for imps|pg||
nt|paulg:  it may not be an option of course|pg||
nt|athene: many pairs would have some other way to bid the north hand, to show the big support right away - 3@D perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: this might be a semi-psychic ploy, trying to buy the contract more cheaply|pg||
nt|idc: I like to call hands like North's a mixed raise: 3@d showing something between a preemptive raise & vaule raise|pg||
nt|paulg:  yes, 3@d often a mixed raise|pg||
nt|athos: 2@c gazzilli |pg||
nt|athos: ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athos: hum non car 2@d ne colle pas |pg||
mb|3S|nt|hawe45:  Contre de 2 @D ne sert Ã¡ rien - assiste N/S|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: "South could" in the sense that South was able to open|pg||
mb|4C|nt|rmb1: +1|pg||
nt|dburn: still, that rather woeful defence to two spades on board 18 appears not to have mattered very much|pg||
nt|justin c: yikes|pg||
nt|dburn: since North-South at the other table attempted Stayman redoubled|pg||
nt|milton_se: good nrakes|pg||
nt|pfbr: might be some imps if they find 6@d :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: or 6 clubs|pg||
nt|mrt2000: Greetings all, sorry I'm late|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I think 2@c=4+@H, and 2@H shows three|pg||
mb|p|nt|milton_se: brakes|pg||
nt|idc: Hey, we have the beginnings of partnership harmony here!|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mikeirl: unusual lead of Q@H - wud normally be asking to unblock the J|pg||
nt|sybarra: but I think they stop in game |pg||
nt|hedyg: so much for 3NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: "we" zoomed passed that|pg||
nt|toobad: NI have bid the club slam on board 19|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: East asking questions|pg||
nt|idc: Declarer ruffed @dK at trick one (better than line here)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: assuming that EW revert to "standard system" after a 1NT rebid|pg||
nt|athos: en gazzilli, sur le relais à 2@d, normalement l ouvreur indique la main mini avec 2@s |pg||
nt|athos: donc les autres encheres sont reservées pour les mains fortes (2@c vient de 4@c ou de 17+ ou d'une main reguliere forte) pour les zones, faudrait leur demander|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: not that unusual - plenty of pairs play that the king asks for count or unblock, the queen or ace for attitude|pg||
mb|4N|nt|pfbr: yes|pg||
nt|egezzer: indeed|pg||
nt|toobad: cant see more than 5 being bid|pg||
nt|pfbr: i'm just optimistic :)|pg||
nt|egezzer: :)|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S will surely be found by some EW pairs|pg||
nt|paulg:  4@s would be a fair save even when you get the spades wrong, so chances of a welsh pickup|pg||
nt|athene: even with the horrible misfit in the side suits (three club losers, @DKQ wasted) it is ok|pg||
nt|athene: when opps have ten hearts and you have ten spades it just can't be wrong to bid 4@S|pg||
nt|paulg:  bidding 1@s is fine when this is their hand and you need to suggest a save|pg||
nt|mrt2000: Hi Geoff and Mike|pg||
nt|roswolf: a practical bid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@H may be four if mimimum|pg||
nt|roswolf: but unsuccessful|pg||
mb|p|nt|toobad: about the weather??|pg||
nt|chilloncan: on en conclurait que EO n'ont pas une methode conventionnelle de montrer soutien primaire FdeM|pg||
mb|5H|nt|sybarra: this wont long to play |pg||
nt|toobad: 50 up.......... not a time for punting!!|pg||
nt|rmb1: The computer says only @S4 to the 10 at trick two would defeat 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: written in braille:(|pg||
nt|idc: And then you remember me asking if it was a mistake for North to ruff 3rd round of @c?|pg||
nt|warrens:  ok, after 2 rounds of @D and a @C shift, draw trump, ruff out the last club, then a @H to the 10 or Ace and a @H?|pg||
nt|chilloncan: pas 100% avec le "sert a rien"....X indique l'entame desiree et en meme temps augmente (quoique legerement)  la chance que la dame de P fasse une leveee|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: waht did 2@s mean?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@s Art game try |pg||
nt|roswolf: show a stop!?|pg||
nt|dagold: Hi Geoffrey|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is a true dodo contract|pg||
mb|6S|nt|paulg:  if partner has the strong hand then it could go wrong|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi David:)|pg||
nt|dagold: very odd lead|pg||
nt|mrt2000: why??|pg||
nt|roswolf: will declarer play on hearts ?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: probably|pg||
nt|justin c: assuming they cash 2@D and exit in @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|milton_se: but NS really should be in 4 -- not this time though|pg||
nt|idc: Looks like it was :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: not every day you see a 1600 |pg||
nt|rmb1: card shows Q from KQxx, K from KQ10 and stronger|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure we should have seen one today either - three down looks a bit excessive|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think we say "next" |pg||
nt|rmb1: Declarer still has to play it right|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: Now declarer need to play on @Cs|pg||
nt|paulg:  but i do prefer to bid my six-card majors|pg||
nt|dagold: because low doubletons are not the usual attack vs NTx|pg||
nt|justin c: what is his best move in the @H suit|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|hawe45:  DÂ´accord, jÂ´ai oubliÃ©, que 2 @D etait artificiel|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: i think west could even consider 4@S over 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: if he was forced to pass first time|pg||
nt|idc: Looks like IMPs for Scotlan on Bd 1 - Walker/Short in 5@h which should make|pg||

nt|steveray: pass looks right NV|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @S  was David's guess  that pard's suit was spades if the weak hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c not described on the CC probably just meaning gf|pg||
nt|hedyg: t/o double purely showing shape, not force|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok opposite a PH pd who is not supposed to hang you|pg||

nt|ralfwil: another 3nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: will west punt 3nt|pg||
mb|3C|nt|idc: An uneventful 3NT it seems|pg||
nt|justin c: 12 imps to england for playing 5@D rather than 6@D brd 18|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: 2@D might better and u have space to find info|pg||
nt|sybarra: also saying,  I have a better hand in hts, and prepared to play at least 3 @H  (if weak version)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: Lindsay asking 2 c cards|pg||
mb|3N|nt|pitnor: no dobl from e|pg||
nt|steveray: thinks it is @C+@H??|pg||
nt|yo_yo: does he think 4@C is a 2 suited hand?|pg||
nt|rmb1: Does South think it is non-leaping michaels?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: brb|pg||
nt|athene: east might think he is facing a 2-suiter, now, and bid 4@D rather than 3nt|pg||
nt|dagold: east limited|pg||
nt|mrt2000: and will get what he deserves if he does|pg||
nt|athos: 2@c = 10-13 avec 5@c+. Toutes les ouvertures au palier de 2 suivent ce schéma. avec 8-9 ça doit etre libre |pg||
mb|p|nt|pitnor: seems like 8 tricks |pg||
nt|yo_yo: i think he does|pg||
nt|hedyg: A@S lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: should be rapidly off|pg||
nt|dagold: Crouch is max so raises anyway|pg||
mb|4S|nt|yo_yo: only 50s|pg||
nt|steveray: else he thought it was Gerber|pg||
nt|steveray: just joking|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2NT = GF raise of M (at least by unpassed hand)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: i bet you dont even play Gerber Steve!|pg||
nt|sybarra: round about way of explaining here |pg||
nt|athene: if west really did have 5-6 reds, then east's hand would be very good for things like 6@D|pg||
nt|athene: with the black aces and diamond fit|pg||
nt|paulg:  the West hand is interesting ... many now use 2@c with a gf balanced hand so that 2@d promises five|pg||
nt|paulg:  however, bidding your second weakest suit is not always ideal|pg||
nt|athene: yes, that is much the best i think - garozzo advocated that for a long time with artificial continuations over 2@C|pg||
nt|athene: people are generally starting to catch up with him|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a bit aggressive, this|pg||
nt|roswolf: THIS DOES HAVE CHANCES|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Pour moi, 2 @S sur 2 @C suffit|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitnor: d3-3|pg||
nt|sybarra: they can beat it |pg||
nt|paulg:  a bit to do here|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might have a restricted choice dilemma in diamonds at some point|pg||
nt|idc: Matheson will spend some time but all the cards lie well for him|pg||
nt|athene: (cash ace and king, dropping a big one from north, and then you have to decide whether to finesse the nine)|pg||
nt|paulg:  not sure he'll have the entries to worry about it|pg||
nt|idc: True, and at that point he may well know North has 4 @s, making 4-2 @d a little more likely|pg||
nt|mrt2000: will make though, with @S 3-3|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: or an eventful 6NT but that's not really likely :)|pg||
nt|dagold: even with this, the best lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: and the club pips are favorable for declarer|pg||
nt|chilloncan: sequence impeccable qui revele tout|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: win this trick and go for spades seems normal|pg||
nt|chilloncan: pas d'accord... Qxx a P au mort suffirait peut-etre largement pour 4P et rare serait le Cronier ou autre qui ira a 4P qu'avec cela|pg||
nt|chilloncan: egal|pg||
nt|chilloncan: pas d'impasse pique|pg||
nt|8252: Nicolas peut jouer que sud n'a que 2 atouts, ce qui le mettrait 6 4 2 1, et jouer as d'atout atout pour ne pas décaisser la coupe @c|pg||
nt|chilloncan: ou plutot -1|pg||
nt|chilloncan: mais la verite est que le declarant devrait faire l'impasse|pg||
pc|c2|nt|idc: Say he wins this, spade finesse & duck, or immediate duck - later wins, test spades and then has to guess @d|pg||
pc|c3|nt|steveray: not often - I only get weak hands|pg||
nt|justin c: 4@S off in top tricks|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|toobad: 6d has chances on a non H lead|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|rmb1:  20 flat in 3@S-1.  McGann bid 3@S a couple of rounds earlier than Liggins|pg||
nt|hedyg: actually safety= ruff this and play A@D|pg||
nt|idc: Best for defence probably @c switch now|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|yo_yo: I'm the only one in Manchester who likes Gerber|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but not here |pg||
nt|steveray: nothing wrong with it|pg||
nt|athene: many people would lead a spade to the queen but even if the suit lies as well as it possibly can, you have to lose one, so you might as well take the deep finesse|pg||
nt|dagold: NI managed to stop in 2N on board 5 to gain 6 imps|pg||
nt|dagold: West judged well|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is straightforward now|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|mgchat: il est obligé de la faire|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rmb1: West and South know something went wrong, but what about East|pg||
nt|steveray: so how many down?|pg||
nt|idc: if they continue @h, declarer can set up a long spade to the heartless North|pg||
nt|athene: you don't especially need two fast spades|pg||
nt|chilloncan: singleton sans controle a pique serait une mauvaise entame la plupart du temps, est il est quasiment probable que S a Rxx|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: agree,  |pg||
nt|hedyg: :) sry Geoff|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Mais lÂ´alternativw - nous avons vu - est dÂ´insister sur 4 @S - avec une couleur miserable|pg||

nt|ralfwil: an easy 4@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: 6 clubs by n/s but not sure I want to be there|pg||
nt|athene: it's surprising how often it's necessary to cling onto three small in a key suit|pg||
nt|athene: to give declarer a guess|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, so my spy tells me :) |pg||
nt|roswolf: this is a trappy board for e/w|pg||

nt|hedyg: you lose 1@d and 1@H|pg||

nt|hedyg: 2@c inverted minor|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @C is inverted,  meaning good hand no 4 card major|pg||
nt|toobad: it would suit me since i alwats play for Q over J with no info|pg||
nt|hedyg: because?|pg||
nt|sybarra: so serious 3nt,  looking for slam?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or to play?|pg||

mb|p|nt|steveray: N/S will be frustrated about the club position|pg||

nt|steveray: did north really discard 2 hearts?|pg||
nt|rmb1: Seems odd but true|pg||
nt|egezzer: http://www.wbu.org.uk/ There is a site of the WBU(Welsh Bridge Union)|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 nt might have been making |pg||
nt|hedyg: nicely played|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: Its like LeMans.. cant they play slow... ever|pg||
nt|rmb1: Same result in open room on  20 but NS got closer to 3NT, at least North bid NT :)|pg||
nt|toobad: 6 h??|pg||
nt|athene: ace and another heart, and draw trumps then finesse clubs the other way, would have been 170|pg||
nt|roswolf: a boring push|pg||
nt|dagold: yes just another dull hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes they got appropriate punishment|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Et demai au handball... ? Les Bleus? - ou les miennes|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: And another 10 to England on  21.  South did not make a negative double and NS settled for 2NT+1|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|paulg:  Wales have drawn level after a more conservative 4@d pre-empt from Walker on board 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: @H and@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: now this is a bidding test for e/w played by east 6@D is very good|pg||
mb|1N|nt|steveray: can E/W make 4@S|pg||
nt|rmb1: Have OR only played 3 boards or have we lost touch with them?|pg||
nt|mikeirl: ghestem|pg||
nt|toobad: even the bad break doesnt beat this|pg||
nt|rmb1: 3@D 3@S 4@C now?|pg||
nt|toobad: 4c i hope|pg||
nt|rmb1: Many can only splinter in opponents suit after an overcall|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 4@H now?|pg||
nt|dagold: well it's ok|pg||
nt|dagold: not sure about very good|pg||
nt|roswolf: ston club start and a frivolous overcall|pg||
nt|mdgraham: may be a two-suiter|pg||
nt|dagold: 1@h may have shown the majors, or perhaps spades|pg||
nt|mrt2000: it is!!!|pg||
nt|mrt2000: @H and @S|pg||
nt|justin c: 2@H = @S and minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: so, seems ok over a strong club|pg||
nt|roswolf: well even trump break is very good in Roland's book|pg||
mb|3N|nt|yo_yo: 3@C  is ghestem   2 highest suits|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1@C = 11-13 BAL or 17+ (any)|pg||
nt|dburn: the two-way nature of the 1@c opening hurt a little - South can't make a negative double with a five count facing what might be a balanced 11|pg||
nt|justin c: East raising now?|pg||
nt|rmb1: how far?|pg||
nt|rmb1: If so, 4@D fit would work|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt is diamonds i guess|pg||
nt|chick: Hello Ralf and Ian :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If W shows his @c and @h E can see and value his @hAQ and @cKQx|pg||
nt|idc: I was chatting to someone who works as an operator on BBO last night|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Cornelia! wlc|pg||
nt|justin c: so 2@S a good @H raise of some sort|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: So EW a natural bidding system. @S=4+ as @H=4+|pg||
nt|mikeirl: dbl now|pg||
nt|dagold: 1@s showed clubs i guess?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitnor: d and s sup i guess|pg||
nt|steveray: open playing board 2|pg||
nt|rmb1: I see the result is in from  2 now.|pg||
nt|rmb1: Is West supposed to pass this?|pg||
nt|steveray: west starts with balanced rubbish and ends having a big decision to make|pg||
nt|mikeirl: miss defence to allow 3@cx to make|pg||
nt|rmb1: Nobody it seems got close to 4@H on  2 |pg||
nt|dburn: well, he hasn't shown anything and he has quite a lot|pg||
nt|ralfwil: rebid 1nt on N?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes!|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 3NT yet again !!|pg||
nt|idc: and she was pointing out how helples they are when a revoke happens, since software doesn't allow them to enter it, heh|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitnor: some inv|pg||
nt|athene: if south can now bid 3@H natural, north may go 3@S to highlight the club weakness|pg||
nt|athene: and then NS have a bit of a problem|pg||
nt|roswolf: 11S SHOWS A CLUB POSITIVE!?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: well done Ian and Willie|pg||
nt|dagold: clubs and diamonds about the same|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1@S|pg||
nt|8252: 2 mains mirroirs pour 9 levées seulement|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mrt2000: 2@C asking, I presume|pg||
nt|sybarra: n/s probably have serveral kinds of raises  |pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @S being weaker, than the cue, etc |pg||
nt|hedyg: the other table is even faster|pg||
nt|athene: they won't like 3nt since they have told opps to lead clubs|pg||
nt|idc: Hi Cornelia!|pg||
nt|8252: ils ont évité ces même 9 levées atout @h|pg||
nt|chilloncan: N doit mettre roi de coeur au 1e tour|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pitnor: disiplin is ok after that 1 s bid:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Standard lead seems to be?|pg||
nt|mikeirl: surely we're waiting on W|pg||
nt|toobad: another 3nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: but we dont get paid|pg||
nt|hedyg: no, we dont either|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe they get paid by the number of cards they play in lifetime :) |pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rodal f: @S|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: y|pg||
nt|toobad: not even for undos Geoff?|pg||
nt|hedyg: rofl|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: as Sabine said... i love this game|pg||
nt|rmb1: 3NT? |pg||
nt|athene: but of course 3nt is where you want to be|pg||
nt|athene: south now wants to know how many clubs his partner has|pg||
nt|othered1: interesting decision for south|pg||
nt|toobad: the hand that David got the Jc right in 3nt ,,,,,,,,,,, at other table same defence... Lindsay won 10c and went back to hearts|pg||
nt|justin c: unappealing lead for E here|pg||
nt|chilloncan: sur coeur du mort|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|paulg:  4@h is where you want to be|pg||
nt|ralfwil: That´s a point Ian!|pg||
nt|othered1: trump might work out best and he found it|pg||
nt|chilloncan: mais le declarant peut jouer trefle|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mrt2000: could be a swing to NI|pg||
nt|athene: if north is 4-3-4-2 then 5@D is better than 3n|pg||
nt|warrens:  3 rounds of trump followed by @d's should do the trick|pg||
pc|hT|nt|pitnor: std carding too|pg||
nt|steveray: looks easy +300|pg||
nt|chick: same happens on a lead out of turn, the operator has to try and compensate|pg||
nt|idc: but I guess allowing it might cause chaos in the software at some point; I can see why it is best to leave it alone|pg||
nt|ralfwil: win with @sA aand play @dK|pg||
pc|h2|nt|insia1: Liliek keringat dingin lagi|pg||
nt|athene: but if north has three clubs of course you want to play 3n (or 4@H)|pg||
nt|idc: I think I'd try 3NT over 3@s - don't think it should promise stop|pg||
nt|chilloncan: erreur du declarant|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|paulg:  and North may bid it now if 3@h promised 4|pg||
nt|chilloncan: mais bcp plus grosse erreur par N|pg||
nt|chilloncan: roi s'imposait|pg||
nt|chilloncan: spectateurs disent que maintenant N peut defausser le roi, mai il y a 3 defauts dans cette idee|pg||
nt|chilloncan: a) si N n'a pas deja mis le roi, cette defausse est fort improbabe|pg||
nt|chilloncan: b)  meme s'il le fait, E saura la situation est peut retomber sur les T|pg||
nt|8252: oui baiser à la reine à @c, spécialité de Nico|pg||
nt|chilloncan: c) peut-etre S duquera le 2e carreau por tromper le declarant|pg||
pc|d7|nt|hedyg: he loves to lead declarers suits, this time definitely best lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: well he didnt lead clubs this time |pg||
nt|hedyg: no|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: Goodman thinking|pg||
nt|sybarra: not clear to me that declarer can survive this one|pg||
nt|hedyg: with @d finesse on 9 tricks are there|pg||
nt|idc: I think at matchpoints West might have competed further but sensible to pass 2@d at teams|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the overcall may have been, well, a bit light, but combined with the pre-empt, made exploration difficult|pg||
pc|d2|nt|paulg:  perhaps this sequence normally shows six diamonds|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
pc|d9|nt|steveray: with game doubtful|pg||

nt|justin c: 4@S EW|pg||
nt|toobad: 6s??|pg||
nt|athene: then the scoring-up conversation goes like this:   expert teammates:- how did you find 3nt on board 8??  g. g-m: <looks puzzled>|pg||
nt|idc: Ron Anderson's would captain the team of course|pg||
nt|diumraid: *** Live Overall Scores - CAMROSE *** http://bridge.silvertexter.eu  then "browse results" then 1o3.txt  *****|pg||
nt|mrt2000: plus 1, surely|pg||
nt|roswolf: MORE FUN AND GAMES HERE!?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|toobad: EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: On  3, Ireland played in 5@H= with favourable cards|pg||
nt|ralfwil: another 3nt....|pg||
nt|roswolf: take out double is cool here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 5+@H+4m|pg||
nt|justin c: 7@D is the most fun|pg||
nt|roswolf: this will reach the stratosphere|pg||
nt|othered1: depends on how far EW push it.|pg||
nt|othered1: 7@D by south doubled and down?|pg||
mb|p|nt|toobad: 2s or 3c|pg||
mb|d|nt|hedyg: if you want to watch other tables as well: http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
nt|roswolf: 6@C should be reached but...........|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: On  21, NS made 3NT after a small diamond opening lead to @D10 |pg||
nt|athene: aggressive 3@H makes it very easy for south now|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzxa: akhmad said that 1@s must be 4cd, if he had 5cd @s he would bid 1nt|pg||
nt|steveray: on board 3 Ireland were pushed to 5@H - but it made for 8 imps|pg||
nt|rmb1: Presumably West thinking|pg||
nt|justin c: 800 odd on offer here|pg||
nt|dburn: wondering how short his partner is in diamonds|pg||
nt|sybarra: may play it here,  |pg||
nt|idc: South worth a slam try I feel, but presumably North will decline to cooperate being (sub) minimum|pg||
nt|athene: there is a case for starting hands like that south (game force, balanced) with 2@C rather than 1@S|pg||
nt|athene: depends on your subsequent methods but it can be easier if you set up the game force first|pg||
nt|paulg:  he may not get the chance to decline|pg||
nt|athene: of course you have to be playing 2@C as GF :)|pg||
nt|athene: south must drive to slam after 3@H|pg||
nt|athene: surely?|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@H does prevent south from making that bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: 3@D = 4414|pg||
pc|d8|nt|rmb1: or 4441 or similar 5440s|pg||
nt|paulg:  6@h is not a great contract, needing a finesse and 3-2 hearts|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose no heart honour is a bit of a worry|pg||
nt|idc: I wouldn't drive, but I'd make a couple of tries|pg||
nt|dagold: i assume 3@h showed a stop|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt looks favorite now|pg||
nt|dagold: 3N shows the diamond stop I guess|pg||
nt|dagold: since that seems|pg||
nt|dagold: to be what norht is worried about|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hedyg: light double by W showing minors|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: sry no hesitation|pg||
pc|d6|nt|milton_se: important lead|pg||
nt|mrt2000: this can go off|pg||
nt|sybarra: arriving undoubled .... |pg||
nt|mrt2000: oh dear|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks like EW pushed just enough to keep NS from all but the grossest investigation|pg||
nt|roswolf: there may also be a good red sac in 6@Hx BUT the irish have wimped out|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|pitnor: as the card lays 3 n is ok but probably 4s ....-1|pg||
nt|mrt2000: not now ....................|pg||
nt|milton_se: not this way|pg||
nt|ralfwil: will make now!|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@s was the limit|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|idc: Hmm, maybe that would be wet of me ... wouldn't blame anyone for just blasting|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 1P peux scandaliser certains spectateurs, et je ne suis guere persuade non plus de son charme...quand les adveaux tinnent les cours (on s'y attends avec la main S), 1SA n;est guere ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: plus obstruteur que 1P|pg||
pc|hK|nt|dburn: and electing to try for slam in spades|pg||
nt|rmb1: 5@H by West op?|pg||
nt|toobad: no defence to these slams|pg||
nt|rmb1: Efficiently bid,  but I bet East thinks the singleton isnt the A and West has more in hearts/clubs|pg||
nt|toobad: indeed....... he'll fret about the H finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: Burns would make a gd croupier|pg||
pc|h4|nt|rodal f: Surpricing but good decision          this time for NS|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1@C = 3+, 1NT may be limited to 14, 2@D looks artificial and then we are guessing :)|pg||
nt|chick: a good lead that doesn't give anything away, although N was kinda forced into it|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@C will not be a success|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|pitnor: y...need to guess dia ...|pg||
nt|mrt2000: one off quickly, I suspect|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no indeed - easy for East to cash out|pg||
nt|roswolf: is east up to cashing out?|pg||
nt|othered1: I think the entire problem lies with their defensive bidding over 2@C.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: sur la donne precedente, le 4C joue dans l'autre salle etait egalement gagnable a cartes ouvertes|pg||
pc|s5|nt|yo_yo: 2@D  new minor forcing|pg||
nt|steveray: N/S will reach 3NT and can make it with a good guess|pg||
nt|toobad: too dangerous to double at imps|pg||
nt|toobad: has he a fluffy tail??|pg||
nt|chilloncan: dame de K, trefle duquer, est puis jouer les coeur de facon qui ne permets pas une entree tot a a la main sud|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: you might not need the diamond finesse|pg||
pc|sA|nt|yo_yo: leading from Jxxx isnt popular but what's the alternative?|pg||
nt|rmb1: @D lead requires declarer to drop @CQ|pg||
nt|idc: Not sure the threats work for a squeeze|pg||
nt|paulg:  i will be pleasantly surprised if Short/Walker bid this|pg||
nt|athene: @SA lead (ok unlikely) or perhaps lead a spade to the queen and then duck spades and ruff down west's short ace|pg||
nt|roswolf: a true test of something|pg||
nt|justin c: safety play @D here (@DK and low to @D9)|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|mikeirl: I favour defense on D lead|pg||
nt|steveray: looks 50/50 to me|pg||
nt|athene: or lead the @S6 from hand and east flies in with his ace, scared you have a singleton|pg||
nt|idc: Ahh, missed the @sA dropping|pg||
nt|athene: so many luscious possibilities :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|steveray: clear the @Hs|pg||
nt|hedyg: cannot double|pg||
nt|chick: declarer can easily find his 9th trick in hearts|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rmb1: On  22 East did not open but stil played in 2@S -1|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|pg||
nt|steveray: then cash an AK befor finessing in the other black suit|pg||
nt|milton_se: reasonable choice though, since North i more likely to have QS|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rodal f: Hard to find, but @HJ is best def|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|nt|chilloncan: SORRY je voulais dire "1SA peut scandaliser..."|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|mdgraham: particularly if on the @dK West can deny six |pg||
nt|dagold: if 3! showed a stop, south should bid 3N|pg||
nt|roswolf: well done the test is passed|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rodal f: Did. WD|pg||
pc|s2|nt|justin c: perhaps East's pass over 5@D was encouraging West to bid on here|pg||
nt|idc: Gives defenders a chance to signal for @d but no big deal I guess|pg||
nt|dagold: 3@h|pg||
pc|h6|nt|idc: May have been right to play a @s immediately though, entries a bit sticky to dummy|pg||
nt|athene: he's a bit short of entries to try the spade to the queen line, so i think @S6 from hand is coming|pg||
nt|dagold: if it asked it was the wrong bid|pg||
nt|dagold: so something to discuss for NS|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|athene: but you are better to try that really early, before east knows the trumps are solid|pg||
nt|athene: he is more likely to go in with his ace if there is the possibility his partner has a trump trick|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|8252: On revient aux 500 d'origine|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|rodal f: Still. Non vul u don'nt earn as much as u do at vul.    As long as 3@S seemed invitational|pg||
nt|rmb1: On  4 it looks as if NS found their @S stop for 3NT and still lost the first five @Hs|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|steveray: the club finesse looks to be wrong now|pg||
nt|rmb1: Black suit squeeze for +1 :) If you don't get deflected into putting in @CJ|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|athene: well, he can still make on a black suit squeeze on east, unless west returns a club now|pg||
nt|idc: Good in fact: gets us on to next hand more quickly :)|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|idc: This line isn't unreasonable: some small squeeze chances with @d finesse in reserve but fails as cards lie|pg||
nt|athene: @SK, spade ruff to isolate the threat, cash the @DAK, run the trumps|pg||
nt|8252: guy calcule si le déclarant peut avoir AQ @c|pg||
pc|dK|nt|8252: nico devrait defausser a l'enver du déclarant, sur ce K @d|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|nt|athene: ok, now dead|pg||
nt|warrens:  if North's 3@S showed spade values and denied @H values, South could have jumped to 6@C|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|c8|nt|steveray: interesting defence|pg||
nt|roswolf: no problem bidding 3nt in the other room after a lebensohl sequence|pg||
nt|warrens:  since his partner has to have most of his points in the other 3 suits|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|pc|c4|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|pc|c7|nt|steveray: and play|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|athene: it will end up being a show-up - he will know the diamond finesse isn't working as east has the @CJ left|pg||

nt|chick: in fact, I don't see any reason not to take the heart finesse for an overtrick|pg||
nt|chilloncan: et "tiennent les coeurs".  j'ai un clavier peu gerable|pg||
mb|1S|nt|paulg:  as a spec suggested, quite a lot more play than I suggested|pg||
nt|roswolf: another positional slam this time for n/s|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzxa: @h last board here, ty for all viewers, hope u all enjoyed @h|pg||
nt|mrt2000: although S will get very busy in @S|pg||
nt|milton_se: and an excellent 6S save|pg||
mb|1N|nt|paulg:  but a likely gain for Scotland|pg||
nt|idc: The Welsh lead up to a healthy 11 IMPs now but may well drop after the last two boards we have seen here|pg||
nt|athene: north has about a 2nt bid now but many play that as a spade raise|pg||
nt|paulg:  Daffyd Jones is getting quite an early morning workout with all these hands to bid in the South seat|pg||
nt|paulg:  though leaving his Dad to play the really difficult ones must help|pg||
nt|chilloncan: on m'a dit que 1SA est l'ouverture systemique dans leurs methodes|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitnor: how to not bid 7?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|rodal f: Normaly NS shall by the contract now|pg||
nt|mikeirl: yes, seemed normal|pg||
nt|chick: (try for the overtrick, doesn't work of course)|pg||
nt|justin c: 2@D = 1 suited major|pg||
nt|athos: Texas sur le X apparemment |pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Last board at the segment. TKX Paul:) Might joy the next one?|pg||
nt|pitnor: sure   ....:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: TKX also to spec for inputs and TKX to the exelant vug operator:)|pg||
nt|pfbr: eh?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: tis the truth|pg||
nt|rmb1: NS play 4 card majors but open minor before major, so missed their @H fit|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: well, this is going to be less difficult to play|pg||
nt|paulg:  I'm told board 6 will probably be flat and not 3 imps to Wales|pg||
nt|idc: I was expecting a UCB of 2@d and then perhaps a further try|pg||
nt|athene: will east start with the @DA? or queen?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 3NT likely here|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: But if E opened 1@H   S would pass and W bid 2@H for pass around I belive|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: 2@h a good 3 card raise|pg||
nt|toobad: that s bid should defeat 3nt|pg||

mb|p|nt|pitnor: if u get a dia lead u might guess right in 7 s :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: cu all tomorrow or later today |pg||
nt|rmb1: Ah well. they have found it in the play.  No enough if declarer picks up the stiff minor kings|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 6@D|pg||

pc|h3|nt|sybarra: bd 23 they made 4 sp in the other room |pg||
nt|justin c: irish dec played @H to the @H10, but then misguessed on @H return|pg||

nt|warrens:  couldn't guess right on the @H return|pg||
pc|h4|nt|pitnor: else u play for squezze|pg||

pc|h5|nt|mrt2000: this is bizarre!!|pg||

pc|hA|pg||
nt|milton_se: do they play 5-cards Ms?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: might have checked for a 5-3 spade fit, but 3NT should have enough high cards |pg||
nt|chilloncan: je sais que le system francais est peu tolerant des telles infidelites, mais a mon avis l'ouverture pragmatique avec la main de Ouest est 1C|pg||

nt|justin c: sry, u right, nothing he could do after playing to @H10|pg||

nt|athene: 4 is the goldilocks bid|pg||
nt|8252: eisenberg a astucieusmeent caché ses @c, pour 7 imps|pg||
mb|1H|nt|steveray: the 1NT opening will get them to @Hs|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks a straightforward game for n/s|pg||
mb|p|nt|steveray: with poor results|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that bid will annoy Carroll :)|pg||
nt|athene: yes south should obviously have opened 2@S to keep his partner from getting ideas|pg||
nt|chick: XX by N to show values|pg||
nt|idc: After North redbls, be interesting to see East's action|pg||
nt|idc: pass looks right: let partner choose for now since you have the higher suits|pg||
nt|mrt2000: do wish players wouldn't make those sort of takeout X's|pg||
nt|justin c: (S bidding 2@S)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|rmb1: EW got there (@Hs) first :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: E might have bid 4@d with a singleton or void|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: Goodman pondering|pg||
nt|paulg:  why bid 4@d when three wins the pot|pg||
nt|chick: modern style is to pass with the E hand, but I really hate that ... I think W has already said he doesn't know what suit to bid, so E should ALWAYS tell him when possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: forcing NT, I believe|pg||
nt|athene: when you have a hand like that south, it's pretty rare that you will make more tricks in hearts than in spades, even if partner has a heart fit|pg||
nt|idc: I expect Dbl from East would have been takeout - Matheson a little fixed with his actual hand|pg||
nt|idc: N-S playing strong @c, so 1@s more understandable since limited to 16 - I expect some other will preempt|pg||
nt|dagold: your opps or partner's? normal for me|pg||
nt|othered1: is that multi or just a strong balanced hand?|pg||
nt|athos: encore Texas|pg||
mb|2D|nt|athene: west can reopen with a good hand and doubleton diamond|pg||
nt|paulg:  true Bill, but partner would not expect such playing strength from a weak two|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'd rather open 1@s than 2@s|pg||
nt|justin c: multi|pg||
nt|roswolf: much better|pg||
mb|p|nt|steveray: is this double penalty?|pg||
nt|steveray: does South know?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i think so, after South has described his hand|pg||
nt|mrt2000: sorry, seems it showed @D|pg||
nt|dagold: but I would respond 1N as south|pg||
nt|roswolf: agree but they do |pg||
mb|2H|nt|roswolf: agree with 1nt too|pg||
nt|dagold: 13 points out side spades and 4@h. could be making 4@h. I love opps who pass 1@s with that|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: corrected on movie|pg||
mb|3C|nt|rodal f: Power at E? Why not use 2NT at the road?|pg||
nt|chick: I'm afraid I would always open S hand 1@S, 29 zarpoints, only need 26 to open|pg||
nt|idc: Note the 3@s bid made immediately: normal is to jump with great shape (sub)minimums and pass then jump with full value openings|pg||

nt|dburn: 11 IMPs to Ireland when Erichsen and Selway tried a slam that was not likely to make given the bidding|pg||
nt|ralfwil: trumph lead from S?|pg||
nt|toobad: the c position saves this, i think|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|dburn: and sure enough, the bloke who bid a lot of spades had the king of them, so the finesse lost|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 11 tricks now|pg||
mb|4C|nt|sybarra: is this the way you would start this play?  |pg||
nt|toobad: no, but has he caught a fish?|pg||
nt|hedyg: might play this one slower|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: only if playing with Mcgann:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|milton_se: this won't be easy|pg||
nt|mrt2000: if 4@H is making, S is going to have a bid|pg||
mb|4D|nt|yo_yo: maybe Erichsen didnt see the first X|pg||
nt|athene: when you have to launch KJ109xxx(x) from hand, you normally lead the king, because the only chance to escape for one loser is to snare a singleton queen, but here even that would ...|pg||
nt|athene: not help north, as he would still lose two trumps to the A87xx|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: West able to double 3@H and 4@H for penalties |pg||
nt|rmb1: and he wasn't on opening lead to lead one :)|pg||
nt|justin c: 3NT was a better idea than this|pg||
nt|rmb1: How about 4NT to play|pg||
nt|justin c: what could possibly go wrong :)|pg||
nt|mrt2000: it'll make though, I think|pg||
nt|hedyg: bd 10 in OR the slam was bid and made, so new leaders|pg||
mb|5C|nt|steveray: doubles are never penalty these days|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikeirl: 5@c may make - not easy to find @D lead|pg||
nt|justin c: needs a @D lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzxy: east is contemplative|pg||
nt|mrt2000: often is, I can assure you|pg||
nt|chilloncan: a part les partiels:   1  3SA avec 6T faisable      3 chelem quasi-embarrassant     5  4H plus-qu'embarrassant, moins 2 avec 4P (contrat hyper-banal a annoncer) frigide     |pg||

pc|d9|pg||
nt|paulg:  can you ever sneak anything past Qx? :)|pg||
nt|athene: you can if you offer east a Fruit Pastille as you lead the nine|pg||

nt|athene: yes, unless your teammate in the north seat decides not to lead a club |pg||
nt|dagold: reaching the grand is ultra tough. I do feel that west hasnt really bid his cards though. surely a small slam over 5@c was in order|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rmb1: @D was surprising |pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|8252: et Guy a assuré ses 9 levées|pg||

pc|d3|nt|dburn: to stop the opponents from doing so if he loses, say, a spade finesse|pg||

nt|hedyg: the double by N looks like a Zia double except surely has a special meaning here|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: maybe they play reversed doubles, i.e. X= i have NO @S honour and pass= i have 1|pg||
nt|toobad: dont lead spades|pg||
nt|athene: if north had chosen 1@D then south would probably have rebid 1nt|pg||
nt|athene: 1@D - 1@H; 1@S - 1NT|pg||
nt|idc: Short rebid 2@h only on Bd 9 so they finished in 4@h rather than slam as here - so more IMPs to come for Scots|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess double just shows extras, ij the modern style, or perhaps some kind of support, as east rebid a mediocre 5-bagger|pg||
nt|8252: il y a bien 4 levées rouges à prendre mais le ballon ne circule pas entre E et O|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: i suppose you set off on diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: hoping, some day, to ruff one in dummy|pg||
nt|idc: But Welsh have potential gain later on so still too close to call|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|nt|yo_yo: that's the end of dummy |pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder if west is allowing for east's hand?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|paulg:  over the past few years, Scotland has beaten Wales but finished below them in the Camrose|pg||
pc|s7|nt|rodal f: And the lead gave 140. Next|pg||
nt|roswolf: what is this !?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rmb1: 1NT = 6-12 (semi-forcing).  2@C rebid would be INV+ with spades or GF.  Difficult to get to @S part score|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they did well keeping low, easy to get excited with 6/5 distribution|pg||
nt|steveray: yes, have to open one, then pass the raise - unlikely, better off where they are|pg||
nt|yo_yo: does Garvey know he won the trick?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: your lead partner!|pg||
nt|steveray: guess he'd rather not have, Selway didn't want to win, as he didn't know what to do next either:)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: correct decision to pass  if ew takes their 4 tricks|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|justin c: this, geoffrey, is a minus score|pg||
pc|sK|nt|hedyg: duck?|pg||
nt|toobad: has to|pg||
nt|ralfwil: ????|pg||
nt|idc: I guess 4@c is the last making spot for either side - on best defence of course|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: @h was continued|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hedyg: wd|pg||
pc|sT|nt|hedyg: so this will drift 1 off|pg||
nt|hedyg: same on a @s lead|pg||
nt|othered1: Anyone understand north's double?|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|mrt2000: NS lost their way now !|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|justin c: i understand souths|pg||
nt|roswolf: a big minus - the vampires start to gather|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|c5|pg||
nt|toobad: will play c first |pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: of course declarer wants to lose diamonds to east|pg||
nt|athene: as trump leads from east are more welcome|pg||
nt|athene: but he can't lose them both to east|pg||
pc|c8|nt|rodal f: Lost the @S ruff|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hedyg: cashing out|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|justin c: 3NT always makeable on this, but not the greatest contract|pg||
pc|cK|pc|d4|pc|h5|pc|c9|pg||
nt|toobad: exactly|pg||
nt|athene: maybe it was right to ruff a heart early - then you elope with both small clubs in hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: south will be disappointed at that|pg||
nt|justin c: playing for N to hold @SQ for the double|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h6|nt|idc: My last partner had me persuaded that 4-4-4-1 shapes are for defending|pg||
nt|athene: of course if you do that you give up any chance of making anything of the spades|pg||
pc|s6|nt|idc: he preferred passing anything fewer than 14 hcp or so|pg||
nt|paulg:  pass them all then Ian?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|dburn: and indeed board 27 was worth ten more to Ireland|pg||
nt|justin c: @C break, and @DQ right, and need to play W for the @SQ|pg||
nt|dburn: so we might have been doing a lot of running in order to stay still|pg||
nt|mikeirl: that discard can't be right?|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 4441 is often good for defending - the trick is persuading your opponents to bid|pg||

nt|othered1: 2N - 3N?|pg||
nt|justin c: South might have been defending 4@S here if he passed|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes the downside of interfering over strong clubs|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rodal f: Or?|pg||
nt|dburn: that might not get a heart lead|pg||
nt|mrt2000: might be coming back here though|pg||
nt|athene: both north and south have borderline decisions here|pg||
nt|chilloncan: je parles de la donne precedente|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: or then again...|pg||
nt|rmb1: wd|pg||
nt|dburn: Whittaker perhaps thought that Carroll was taking an advance save|pg||
nt|dburn: so his double was just penalty, not Lightner|pg||
nt|justin c: if one of East's @h were a @C would have 12 here|pg||
nt|paulg:  three small diamonds a concern|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: surely NOT 3@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: no way Goodman bid 3@s|pg||
nt|hedyg: with this hand we see here?|pg||
nt|toobad: no pay increase for you this year, Geoff!!|pg||
nt|othered1: It's not just this position where interference gives the opponents an edge in both bidding and play.|pg||
mb|p|nt|8252: encore une donne kelton, pour une égalité|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: they both vaguely want to bid something but neither has the perfect hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: well the axe might fall and blood may flow - the ghouls are circling|pg||
pc|s2|nt|idc: Not a bad 6-loser hand East has: would anyone be tempted by a 3@h rebid?|pg||
nt|paulg:  but operation successful, at least in pushing them up|pg||
nt|mrt2000: horrific|pg||
nt|dburn: probably down only one|pg||
nt|roswolf: the vampires feast|pg||
nt|roswolf: probably showing the distribution|pg||
nt|athos: 2@d est forcing de manche|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 2T = force proposition de manche / 2K - F de M|pg||
pc|s4|nt|yo_yo: very low scores in all the matches, does that mean flat hands or brilliant bridge?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: K@H I hope ..............|pg||
nt|pfbr: me too|pg||
nt|hedyg: why would he bid 3@s with 7 flat hcps and no fit?|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'd rebid 3@h in a strong club system, or if playing gadgets like gazzilli|pg||
nt|idc: I must be getting old, was sure gazzilli was a soup|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|rmb1: not very flat, not necessarily brilliant|pg||
nt|mrt2000: YES !!!|pg||
nt|pfbr: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: fished swiftly out it was|pg||
nt|othered1: double here would have been very dangerous|pg||
nt|othered1: I wouldn't like to defend 3@SXX|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|idc: perhaps @h9 then @h5 might have been better suit preference for clubs but not trivial to suggest that suit|pg||
pc|s9|nt|vugraphzxy: Will fix 13 later|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok ty|pg||
nt|idc: For preference I'd mini-splinter the East hand with 3@c, but 3@h otherwise|pg||
nt|paulg:  Matheson a big fan, trying to persuade Sime ... not on their card but I know they've been practising it over major openings|pg||
nt|dburn: but never mind - you guys could get a job in the publishing industry writing blurbs|pg||
nt|justin c: dont know what all this means, but probably playing 3NT|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 3H = chelemotrope, car la sequence est FdeM|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: declarer doesn't know both red suits are breaking|pg||
nt|roswolf: david you of all people should be rooting for the vampires|pg||
nt|mrt2000: does it pay well?|pg||
nt|roswolf: ;0|pg||
nt|mdgraham: depends how many bodices are ripped, I believe|pg||
nt|dburn: might have been more if the defence had attacked hearts, mind|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|toobad: okedoke|pg||
nt|idc: 10 then 9 suggests diamonds, 10 then 5 neutral, maybe that will be East's explanation|pg||

pc|s6|nt|rodal f: @H better from W?|pg||

nt|athos: 6@h ? pas content de son enchere de 4@h ?|pg||

mb|2C|nt|jaapfr: imo b15 and 16 well for Timah A so pk Liliek not to win this|pg||
nt|rmb1: Ireland retake the lead by bidding and making 3NT+1 on  29|pg||

nt|sybarra: last 2 hands here for this set |pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: double for the red suits? |pg||

nt|mrt2000: or raise @S|pg||
nt|dburn: he is allowed to pass systemically, yes|pg||
mb|2D|nt|rmb1: Another guess the outcome?|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|nt|rodal f: A @H lead give 9|pg||
nt|idc: I used to playing 14-16 NT, since these sequences showed 11-13, but having them show 11-14 is too much, so would pass playing 15-17|pg||
nt|othered1: Actually it has, but it's not likely they see a need for every imp that's not nailed down.|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: 24 zarpoints, need 26 to open|pg||
nt|roswolf: spades were never bid in the other room|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rmb1: 1@S walsh style, does not deny longer @D with < GF.  |pg||
nt|athene: he can put the @C9 on this perhaps to get one ruff |pg||
nt|justin c: would have thought such a scientific pair could show minors over 1NT here|pg||
mb|p|nt|toobad: screaming for a h lead here|pg||
nt|hedyg: what good was bidding 2@D if you are going to bid 3NT no matter what?|pg||
nt|idc: the dbl was good in that it helped North to get off to right lead, but bad when contract made anyway|pg||
mb|4N|nt|steveray: why on earth 1@s?|pg||
nt|sybarra: thanks to our terrific operator,    great job! |pg||
nt|ralfwil: bad 11 points ....|pg||

nt|Walddk5: a gain for NI for sure|pg||

nt|chilloncan: derniere donne de ce segment|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  all the matches look pretty close at the moment, so all to play for in the second halves|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Scotland did too against WBU|pg||
nt|chilloncan: en regardant le score on dirait que c'est un match de baseball|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rodal f: Last board up. Next segment start in 58 min. TKX for the inputs specs:) TKX also to the exelant vug operator:) I'm Frank from Norway 04.17 local time:)|pg||
nt|steveray: come on then Robin, what's this?|pg||
nt|toobad: horrible @H overcall in the open room - what a suit!|pg||
nt|rmb1: Jones the West's claims in 1NT are getting worse :)|pg||
nt|chick: Last board of this match|pg||
nt|Walddk5: ON the other hand, if diamonds are 3-1 you go 1 zillion down vulnerable|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: 4414 or |pg||
nt|rmb1: 4414 or 4405|pg||
nt|rmb1: Last board.  Thanks to commentators Mike, Justin and David.  Thanks to operator and organisers CBAI|pg||
nt|chick: Next session starts in about 1/2 hour, I believe|pg||
nt|mdgraham: another 2-way bid, I think|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mdgraham: 5-9 4+@D, 4/5M or 10-13, 6+@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: 2@H 3 suited, short @D|pg||
nt|idc: Looked at this earlier: 3NT is interesting after East's preempt|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@h=pass/correct|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - ou tabel-tennis|pg||
nt|hawe45:  table|pg||
mb|2S|nt|toobad: can we make 3nt?|pg||
nt|pfbr: oh, i do hope so.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: I think Crouch has had enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: 10-16 (?)  card does not say|pg||
nt|steveray: see it was S in @s in other room:)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: selway pulled a penalty double earler, will he do it again?|pg||
nt|steveray: we used to play that - light years ago, pick your poison, a 4-2 break and no points or a 5-1|pg||
nt|justin c: (like old precision 2@D)|pg||
nt|roswolf: surely east hasnt enough to bid on|pg||
nt|chilloncan: NO swing sur la  5 a 4C.......j'aurais parie 10 euros contre 2 lire que cela n'arriverait jamais|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rodal f: A new X?|pg||
nt|hedyg: obviously a misunderstanding|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think E will go down with a @s shifr on @hJ and another @s after @hA|pg||
nt|idc: 40 mins I think: 14:55 local time|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: 3@C any min|pg||
nt|rmb1: England retake the lead by avoiding slam on  30|pg||
nt|justin c: 3NT not safe here|pg||
nt|justin c: @HJ lead, @D10 switch |pg||
nt|golfsquash: This will be a good gain for England|pg||
nt|chilloncan: sequence par E assez curieuse....partenaire a passe sur 2C, alors forcer les encheres maintenant au palier de 4 apres une reponse simple de 2C, c'est un peu....schizophrenique|pg||
nt|chilloncan: felicitations a notre excellent operateur, et grands remerciments a Gilles Pere pour ses commentaires astucieux et eloquents. cette seance renouvelle et elargit mon parternariat ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: avec lui :):)|pg||
nt|8252: oui, 18 imps d'écart avant le dernier sprint : il va falloir bien coacher|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mrt2000: good lead|pg||
nt|toobad: when opps make that big a boo boo it should be punished|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Oh, I did not foresee 3@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: well north has offerred his head|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I think there is a safety play in the spade suit - run the 10|pg||
nt|chilloncan: sans doute E a un super-maximum, mais en pricipe il devrait pouvoir indiuer sa force inattendue avec un X|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: last board of this match now|pg||
nt|hedyg: thanks Geoff, great job :)|pg||
nt|athene: you build a trick for the @SJ to throw a club from dummy, maybe|pg||
nt|idc: I wondered if West might come under pressure but on some lines they have @cQ exit to recover with|pg||
mb|p|nt|steveray: but this is not penalty - or is it?|pg||
nt|justin c: kibs predicting 5@C|pg||
nt|hedyg: thanks John :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: tyHedy|pg||
nt|toobad: ditto|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mikeirl: A more effective|pg||
nt|justin c: correctly :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  yes, although West comes under pressure on the trumps anyhow|pg||
nt|idc: And another hassle for declarer is what to pitch from dummy now|pg||
nt|chick: a @D|pg||
nt|idc: That's all there is but means you cannot finish @d ending in dummy|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no! I vote for a @s|pg||
nt|chick: keep the black suit options open and decide later what to pitch on the long diamond|pg||
nt|idc: but really I'm probably kidding myself if I think it has much play anyway|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 2 off, I hope|pg||
nt|Walddk5: If you want to get in with that North hand, get in right away|pg||
pc|c9|nt|athene: yes, west has to guard all three side-suits, so he is in for a rough time|pg||
nt|athene: it's easy for declarer to place the high cards here :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  sime/matheson more forward in the bidding than their team mates, who would pass the West hand|pg||
nt|chilloncan: et egalements gramercy aux spectateurs pour leur contributions, meme les non-payants:)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rmb1: He might make this one.  We may even get to see the play|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: lol|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rodal f: I understand N. At OR S was in with 3@H over 2@S|pg||
nt|golfsquash: going down|pg||
nt|rmb1: Just ruff 3 @D in dummy|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|nt|roswolf: it looks like the english team has won the first half of this event - the second half is played in Wales on the first weekend in March|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|toobad: our thanks to all the specs for your comments|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rmb1: Not enough entries now|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: you are more inclined to pass the west hand at this vulnerability if playing a weak notrump i suppose|pg||
nt|chick: this is kinda useless given that he has no spade to lead toward the 10, but I guess so is everything else :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|toobad: should be a swing to the good guys |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rmb1: On  11 West bid @H before North could, so NS stayed out of trouble and defended 3D-2 +9 to Ireland|pg||
nt|justin c: needed to play @D immediately i think|pg||
nt|hedyg: dont go far, we will be back for more fun soon!|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|toobad: easy now - overtricks - 10 or 11 in|pg||
nt|chick: oh, not so useless now|pg||
nt|idc: ahha, that @c exit wasn't best|pg||
nt|athos: le 7@s est consideré comme une preferentielle inversée. Sans discuter des avantages vraiment techniques à inverser la preference, il y a un avantage deja noté : sur des matches ...|pg||
nt|athos: longs, un declarant fatigué ne pensera pas tjs à lire cette carte correctement (c'est deja arrivé)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: draw trumps then do that would have left west endplayed|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|golfsquash: yes, had the chance|pg||
nt|toobad: we need more boards - we are hitting our stride now|pg||
nt|paulg:  the restart is scheduled for 30 minutes time, at 12:20 GMT|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vugraphzxa: closing|pg||
nt|mrt2000: agreed|pg||
pc|c5|nt|idc: The @cQ would have been but not a low one|pg||
nt|chick: set up club for 9th trick and claim|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rodal f: See u later folks:))|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe they had not had enough tea |pg||
nt|sybarra: os coffee |pg||
nt|sybarra: *or|pg||
nt|toobad: indeed|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|mikeirl: dbl TO|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 1 off, I think|pg||
nt|sybarra: see you all in about 40 min |pg||
nt|toobad: thx all - |pg||
nt|egezzer: bye|pg||
mc|11|nt|steveray: yes I know:)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes  t/o converted|pg||
nt|rmb1: This is the last hand of the round.  Thanks to Steve, Mike, Kath,  Thanks to the operator, and to CBAI. |pg||
nt|steveray: bye all|pg||
nt|rmb1: Next round (second half of this match) at 21:50 if I read my emails correctly|pg||
