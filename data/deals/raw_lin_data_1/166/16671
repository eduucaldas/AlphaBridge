mb|p|mb|4C|nt|othered1: What's east's 1@C?|pg||
nt|othered1: From south's 2@C bid, I might infer it's a big @C|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|pc|c2|nt|bg: it was 16+|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: in the other room West raised to 5@C|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c5|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i might be tempted to do so too.|pg||
nt|xenya: makes sense, considering the vulnerability |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: with the west hand... 7 points in partners preemt might not produce a single trick|pg||
nt|xenya: putting maximum pressure on NS|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bg: same result in other room on board 1|pg||
nt|othered1: the overcall does give west some useful information|pg||
nt|fabsayc: are you prepared to bid 7 if opponents reach slam, because that often happens with these extreme preempts|pg||

nt|jbgood: and sometimes it is wise to take the plus even if it doesnt make you happy...|pg||
nt|petergill: Some expert pairs play that after 3@C P 5@C or 3@D P 5@D, if you are vul against not vul, Pass is forcing, so that you have two ways to show good hands - Pass and Double.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: These two teams are currently 7th and 8th|pg||

nt|jbgood: S not online|pg||
nt|petergill: For the second time, bidding "five over five" is wrong|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brgpro: must admit this is a hand hard to judge...how would theey know they have 4 cashing tricks in the minors...|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|jbgood: on the other hand - agree Jack|pg||
nt|kaz08833: no game for both sides .. what's the matter is EW's defense|pg||
nt|brgpro: Jon, do u also say down one is good bridge in Norway?|pg||
nt|petergill: A direct 5@C by North over 3@H makes it harder for East to judge what to do|pg||

pc|d2|pc|h2|pc|h8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Early on a Wednesday morning|pg||
nt|jbgood: but even so, 4@d often is a lead-director, and should not be treated as a long suit ? Perhaps 4 NT from S to make prd choose if S must bid...|pg||
nt|kaz08833: E (Takahashi) was my regular pd for more than 10 years|pg||

mb|5D|mb|5H|nt|othered1: The longer north keeps this off of a quantitative NT track, the better for NS.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|bg: would you rebid three clubs here?|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Bedst to be said about 5 @H: even 4 @H is no winner...|pg||
pc|dA|nt|othered1: I don't hate 2@C rebid, but I think it would be nice to have methods that didn't require me to balckwood on north hand, though maybe it will work out.  7th @C, as yet unbid, is key ...|pg||
nt|othered1: and north can't count it.|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|nt|brgpro: 1@d =1+. so he has to bid 2@d to show length |pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|kaz08833: NS has 3NT or 5@d|pg||

nt|xenya: tough hand for NS|pg||

nt|petergill: Should South pass? or open 3@D?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|2S|nt|tejjyid: or compromise :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: a compromise|pg||
nt|petergill: I like the weak 2@D - too many losers for a vul 3@D in my opinion|pg||
nt|kaz08833: not suitable for 2nd hand preempt|pg||
nt|brgpro: i would...knowing we are behind....but normally wont because 2nd hand Vul. tends to have better suits than this|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3D|nt|kaz08833: agressive 3@d by E|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 5@D hard to reach after a 2@D opening though|pg||
mb|d|nt|brgpro: 5@d is a good save against 4@s this time|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Walddk2: Good rule of thumb. Bids in 2nd seat, especially vulnerable, should have full value|pg||
nt|kaz08833: i wud simply bid 4@s with E's hand|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it's a very good save - it might easily make|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Only 3@S by West = a surprise to me - I like to bid vul games|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s2|nt|kaz08833: they play 3@s=decent minimum, pass=bare minimum at 3-level|pg||
nt|kaz08833: of course forcing pass is on at another level (2 or 4-level)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|nt|brgpro: looks like a good lead again this time|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Maybe NOrth should try 4@D over 3@S|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|pc|dQ|nt|brgpro: he has to abandon @h finesse, risking a @h ruff later...|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|pc|d4|nt|petergill: I think South's Dbl of 3@D should not merely be lead -directing - in a live competitive auction, Dbl should encourage North to bid more in @d's - if so, that is not the message ...|pg||
nt|petergill: North received. |pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|brgpro: would be wrong if S has @hKxx...|pg||
nt|brgpro: he might suspect S has some values after a 2nd hand opening and a X on 3@d|pg||
nt|brgpro: tough to guess|pg||
nt|brgpro: if he ruffs a @d now and play a @h to the A and ruff another, then he would go down when S has @h Kxx|pg||
nt|petergill: @D2 (count) suggests 7-2 diamonds, and the lack of a 3@D opener thus suggests North has @HK|pg||
nt|kaz08833: W might guess S has 6@d-3-3-1 then reach rite answer (actually S has 7@d-3-2-1)|pg||
nt|brgpro: the question is who has @hk|pg||
nt|petergill: Also, North's failure to ever raise @D, e.g. no 4@d bid, suggests 7-2 not 6-3 @d's and strengthens the inference about who has @HK |pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|nt|brgpro: he needs to guess|pg||
pc|s7|pc|d3|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||
pc|dT|pc|c4|pc|sQ|pc|d7|pg||
nt|brgpro: he got it right,|pg||
nt|petergill: NS have been giving accurate count signals throughout the match, so @D2 strongly suggested 7-2 @d's|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|brgpro: if S has @hK he would go down|pg||
nt|brgpro: all depends on who has it|pg||
nt|kaz08833: yes, W might guess if S has 7@d headed A with @hk he might open 3@d|pg||

nt|kaz08833: S know EW has 10@s still biding only 2@S.. it strongly suggests EW have balanced hands|pg||

nt|petergill: 2 imps to Beijing Trinergy anyway|pg||
mc|9|nt|brgpro: but how can W have 3@c only and 1@h? then he bids only 2@s?|pg||
nt|petergill: 19-11 in VPs I think|pg||
nt|kaz08833: 17 imps = 19-11 VP  i guess|pg||
nt|jbgood: bye for now|pg||
nt|kaz08833: thx all bye|pg||
nt|vugraphzys: at trick 2,W followed @HQ|pg||
nt|petergill: all very odd. Perhaps S thought West had 4 trumps and was minimizing undertricks? But West would have doubled 4@H with @SA and @HKQxx|pg||
nt|petergill: Nice play, @HQ, brought a big dividend, but it shouldn't have, if S counted West's hand out|pg||
nt|brgpro: he doesnt have to...seeing both followed 2@d, and 3@c...|pg||
nt|brgpro: W has max 6 cards in the minors|pg||
nt|brgpro: with 1@h...he has 6@s?|pg||
nt|petergill: As for South passing 2@S out at the other table instead of bidding 3@D, it is a bidder's game.|pg||
nt|petergill: The pressure of playing on BBO seems to have led to a few slips in this match|pg||
