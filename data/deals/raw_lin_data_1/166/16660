mb|p|nt|fluffy: this catched Llluis Malla off guard|pg||

pc|h3|nt|fluffy: uh ohhh|pg||
pc|h5|nt|fluffy: and the psyche works!|pg||
nt|pelu: surprise attack: @DQ|pg||
nt|fluffy: 24 balanced again not worth a game|pg||
nt|fluffy: neither low heart not @hQ work on this hand|pg||
nt|fluffy: but @hA would at least prevent declarer from making 2 tricks on the suit|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|fluffy: ohhh|pg||
nt|fluffy: but still needs to guess hearts|pg||

pc|dA|nt|fluffy: a good guess and 1 IMP win|pg||
pc|d2|nt|pelu: hi operator - did S pass?|pg||
nt|fluffy: on the end NS did the right thing to stay away from this awful game|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|fluffy: you need to play penalty doubles of new suits after a preemptive opening|pg||
nt|fluffy: because psyches are much more common than other situations|pg||
pc|h2|nt|fluffy: with AQ10 if you ahve to lead the suit, you have to guess if you ahve no entry, but with a side entry I think @hA is the best lead|pg||
nt|fluffy: to catch any honnor singleton or doubleton in dummy|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|pc|hA|pg||
nt|pelu: or are we playing 1@sX|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|nt|fluffy: but with every red suit 3-3, @dK onside and @s 4-4 there is no way to go down on 3NT, nor 4@h, not even 5@d|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d9|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|c3|nt|fluffy: perhaps south was distracted|pg||
nt|rodal f: If u have 9 it's right to bid it Gonzalo:) Else....|pg||
pc|d8|nt|fluffy: or operator was distracted and north took an agressive pass|pg||

mb|1D|nt|fluffy: Hi all This is the Open de Cataluña tournament played in Barcelona|pg||
mb|d|mb|r|mb|1S|mb|3C|nt|fluffy: this match features Juanito Pont and Javier Graupera (NS) one of the best and most succesful pairs in Spain all time against Xavi Massana and Norberto Bocchi, not a regular pair as ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: long as I know|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: they are confirming me now, Javier Graupera actually passed 1@s with 20 HCP on board 1 on the last set and collected +150 only|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|fluffy: I think East opened a multi 2@d showing a weak in a major hand or 22-23 balanced|pg||
nt|fluffy: or maybe 2@d is just GF hand|pg||
nt|fluffy: 1@s might be artificial|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|fluffy: 2NT is a balanced hand|pg||
nt|fluffy: 3@h is a transfer bid showing spades|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|fluffy: 1@s is I think Brazilian style, showing a forcing 1NT hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: this is the only way to show 10-11 HCP support for hearts|pg||
nt|fluffy: if Llluis opted for showing spades he would have to force to game|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: and Xavi now bis 3NT as choice of games|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: 2D its For.|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: 23+|pg||
nt|fluffy: Norberto picks 3NT with his stiff spade|pg||
pc|cA|nt|fluffy: thank you|pg||
pc|d6|pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||
pc|s3|nt|fluffy: some might be surprised by the decision of Norberto to show a balanced hand|pg||
nt|fluffy: it is a very common "lie" to show a balanced hand with 4441 and 5431 with a stiff King or Ace|pg||
nt|fluffy: the reason is that showing your shape, specially 4441 across as well as strenght is very complicated, takes 3 rounds of bidding, and in the end partner is unsure if you have 18 or ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: 23|pg||
pc|s2|nt|fluffy: Nacho only has 11 HCP,but he goes for game, 6-4 hands only require the correct 18 HCP to make game (@hAKQ @dAKQ), this is just a dream hand, but actually with a 6-4 hand you might ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: make game with a lot less than 25 HCP|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s5|pg||
nt|fluffy: but when you just go with the balanced approach you define your hand in 1 bid|pg||
nt|fluffy: or something very close to it :)|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|pc|d7|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|fluffy: saly for him partner had zero points in his suits, not even @h10 wich would be enough to make game after a non trump lead|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|fluffy: A superb result on previous board by EW thx to the unlucky diamond lead from south|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|bigtrain: even without the @D lead it looked like they would be able to scramble 9 tricks and only had 4 losers|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: but the @D lead surely put declarer at ease|pg||
nt|fluffy: at the other table Bocchi found the @sA duck but his partner slipped a bit in the endgame not puling trumps|pg||
pc|s2|nt|fluffy: declarer "should" missguess clubs|pg||
pc|sA|nt|fluffy: yes, to defeat it it would be needed some perfect defence, winning @sA on first round wich is almost impossible from the bidding|pg||
pc|s9|nt|bigtrain: looks like declarer will lose the race to 7 here|pg||
nt|fluffy: graupera makes an agressive switch now, clubs would be great if partner had @cA or @cJ, but sadly he has neither this time|pg||
nt|bigtrain: he may even go -2|pg||
nt|fluffy: the proper way to play @cKJ10x vs @cAxxx or @cAJ10x vs @cKxxx is to play the lonely top honnor first|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|fluffy: and then finese the queen by low to 10 or jack|pg||
pc|hK|nt|pelu: would u play @D4 or @D10 from that holding?|pg||

pc|c4|nt|favallu: hola a todos|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|fluffy: why? because if you play a force finese by winning @cA and running the @cJ, you only make 3 tricks if the suit breaks 4-1|pg||

mb|p|nt|pelu: hi all|pg||

mb|1S|nt|fluffy: hey Peter, wellcome|pg||
nt|pelu: tx|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: not me...  it's not like you're risking a game bonus :)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|fluffy: FM means game forcing in spannish|pg||
mb|p|nt|favallu: solo se multan 4 @S con salida de as de @D y @D, es muy dificil|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|pelu: a nice 6@s - but I dont exp them to bid the slam|pg||
mb|3H|nt|fluffy: so 2@c is game forcing but natural, 2@s is also forcing obviously|pg||
nt|fluffy: 3@c is north's obvious bid, pinpointing @d shortness|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: tough to get to 3NT after a superaccept|pg||
nt|fluffy: if Massana had any doubts about what to do after transfer, the 3@h bid clears them all|pg||
mb|4S|nt|pelu: 3-3 in both black suits = down 1 with @dK wrong|pg||
nt|bigtrain: but as you can see 3NT will make while 4@H goes down|pg||

nt|fluffy: Javier Graupera did 2 efforts (2@s is stronger than 4@s and 3@d is also stronger than 4@s), he doesn't ahve enough to bid any more|pg||
nt|pelu: what is 3@D? and why not 4@D - all Ss cards are working|pg||
pc|dA|nt|fluffy: 4@h should go down, declarer is trying to develop some sort of endplay maybe|pg||
pc|s3|pc|d4|nt|fluffy: perhaps north has a bit more to show than he did, I would had rathe bid 4@c than 3@s with his hand|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|fluffy: 2@h is a weak response|pg||
nt|fluffy: in Spain the first bid after a strong opening is used to show weakness (0-7)|pg||

pc|c2|nt|fluffy: and since 1NT cannot be passed south has to bid something with 5332 hands, so 2@d could be jsut 3 card suit|pg||

pc|c4|nt|pelu: @C-lead and @S back will defeat 2@S|pg||

pc|c3|pc|s9|nt|fluffy: yes, I agree since I learnt that you have to bid 4@s over 4@h as much as possible, I realiced you also have to bid then 4@h as much as possible to counter it :)|pg||

nt|favallu: is down with @S lead ?|pg||
nt|fluffy: double dummy it is not down|pg||

nt|rodal f: Am to quick with TV at left side. Right u are and I was:)|pg||

nt|fluffy: when oyu know an opponent is broke and the other has all HCP you don't need 25 HCP any more to bid game|pg||
nt|fluffy: because you can endplay the strong guy many times|pg||
nt|favallu: re, me vengo persiguiendo a Gonzalo :)|pg||

nt|fluffy: contain it or not, so blackwood with a void is useless|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bigtrain: it certainly limits the effective uses for stayman|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|fluffy: 6@h might be codified or not, I think it is not, Javier asks for aces, but Juanito knows that since he is void in spades, the answer won't tell partner how many quick tricks can ...|pg||

nt|fluffy: maybe captain said that they needed to squeeze every posibility and tire the opponents|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: we probably have some vugraf operator types on the play of last board, nevermind, 3@d after a non trump lead must make 9 tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|fluffy: indeed very good play from Carlos Fernandez, although with a bit of help from Bocchi|pg||
mb|2C|nt|fluffy: again forcing 1NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|fluffy: 1@c is not very artificial|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: they play 5 card diamonds|pg||
mb|3N|nt|fluffy: 1@d openingis 5+ @d for NS|pg||
nt|pelu: a lot of action from West on a hand where many would pass first time|pg||
nt|fluffy: this is very common in barcelona, and that might explain west's unnusual bidding|pg||
nt|fluffy: the 1@d opening means 1@c can be often be opened on 2@c, for examplo with any 4@d 2@c hand|pg||
nt|pelu: so 1@c could be a sigleton - but not after 1@S|pg||
nt|rodal f: Waited that 2NT|pg||
nt|fluffy: so 1@c can be 2 cards often|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: surprised by the 3NT rebid, most partnerships show 18-19 balanced with 2NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: I hardly ever play against this system, so I am not sure how common is west's approach|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: not as much as singleton, cos 4441 opens 1@d also, but low doubleton yes|pg||
nt|fluffy: 2NT is fine, but why didn't west raise diamonds?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Had his minimum12HP but we need to ask W.|pg||
nt|fluffy: might he try to sneack a heart trick before trying clubs?|pg||
nt|fluffy: thx Allan, yes indeed, it seems that 4@h is completelly cold as the cards lie|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or do 1@D promisse minimum 4@D by there system, 1@C +2|pg||
pc|h4|nt|pelu: and - as I see - no way to 9 tricks with @Hs 4-1|pg||
nt|fluffy: the best Pont can do is go 1 off after a club lead|pg||
nt|fluffy: worst for him is that 4@h on the other side might only lose 1@h 1@c and 1@D|pg||

mb|2C|nt|fluffy: his spades were a bit lousy, might he have though that 2@s "oculd" maybe be real?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|fluffy: better to avoid temptations here, the hand looks very good, but as the cards lie 5@s is down|pg||
nt|fluffy: oh well didn't expect a 1NT overcall with @sKx|pg||
mb|3D|nt|fluffy: that is something I would never do, I don't like playing NT when I win first trick but the opponents have 4-5 tricks ready for the next time they get in|pg||
nt|pelu: most players would X in East 3 "suirs" to play - and 4 card @h|pg||
nt|fluffy: 1@s alerted?|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: or drury sorry|pg||
mb|3S|nt|fluffy: doubling instead with good support for all the other suits is IMO superior, but obviously Norberto is better than me, so who knows|pg||
nt|pelu: why not 2NT by W = both minors????|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: becasue it would be one level higher probably|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|fluffy: I don't really understand what Graupera is up to|pg||
nt|pelu: could be playing in 5-2 with 5-4 in @C - for sure I would bid 2Nt in West|pg||
nt|pelu: on way to 4@S (making)|pg||
nt|fluffy: its up to partnership agreements, but if yo have a shapelly hand that wants to invite to 4@s over 1NT the proper bid is 2NT|pg||
nt|fluffy: 2@c is the duri-fit convention showing 10-11 HCP (maximum for a passed hand) and support for partner's major|pg||
nt|fluffy: 2@d is a relaty bid, and that's where I bet their agreements end|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR only 10 tricks - decl played on a non-chance|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|fluffy: when opponents open or overcall a strong NT, you can use the 2NT bid as a cuebid when partner shows a suit|pg||
nt|pelu: depend on system agreements - many would X first|pg||
mb|4H|nt|fluffy: I think Fernandez downgraded @hK|pg||
nt|fluffy: with his hand with no opposition the normal bid is 4@s vulnerable at IMPs|pg||
nt|rodal f: If 3@C was positive trail E had for a.....|pg||
nt|fluffy: but having @hK under the 2@h bidder is bad news normally|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: yes, but it doesn't take much imagination to construct a hand where 1NT X makes and so does 4@s|pg||
nt|pelu: u can also use 2NT as minors from S|pg||
nt|fluffy: constructing a hand consisten with west passing 1NTX will be a lot tougher though|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|mb|6C|nt|fluffy: 3@s is in no danger, but 4@s requires to guess diamonds|pg||
nt|rodal f: Normaly Y. Still E have to take the trail ask if it was that|pg||
mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|mb|7N|nt|pelu: but now NS have preblems|pg||
nt|fluffy: you can play the suits in 2 ways to score 1 trick, either low to the king, or run the @dJ|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: this makes double dummy|pg||
nt|fluffy: but requires verty precise timing|pg||
nt|fluffy: you have to cross ruff all the minors|pg||
nt|fluffy: and then put East in with @sK|pg||
nt|fluffy: but from the bidding is is a possible play|pg||
nt|pelu: S has shown are better hand - but N know that East has @SK so vewry agresssive to go for slam with 5@D|pg||
nt|fluffy: yes, and, what is 5@d anyway? shouldn't it be 5@c?|pg||
nt|fluffy: declarer was looking for something amazing on Open room, I am too lazy today to try to igure out what|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c5|nt|fluffy: anyway, note that the key for this hand is to use dummy's entrys properly|pg||
nt|fluffy: ye sit was a trial ask, east decided to go with the low road this time, wich is not normal, because he is a very agressive player|pg||
nt|rodal f: Still though. 4@S is down with a @C lead|pg||
pc|c3|nt|fluffy: sorry, thx netto for pointing out, obviously on a @c lead 4@s goes down if defence finds the @hA entry|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|fluffy: cos then they ruff a club, and even 2 down is possible then|pg||
pc|sA|nt|fluffy: good start|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@D is not in my book :)|pg||
nt|pelu: snd easy ride in OE after a @h-lead|pg||
nt|fluffy: we all know many players who after winning @dA, would draw trumps and then try @c finese, and when they later found north with @sAJ and 1 club honnor would say "I was so unlucky"|pg||

nt|fluffy: and the last board|pg||
nt|fluffy: fernandez guessed the @ds easilly because north had overcalled 2@h instead of preempting 3@h so he has to have 10+ HCP|pg||
mb|1S|nt|fluffy: in the other room I mean|pg||
mb|d|mb|2H|nt|pelu: 3 very expensive bords by NS in OR |pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|fluffy: Xavi cannot pass 2@c, not because he has 7 spades, but because he has only 1 club, and parnter might have up to 20 HCP with long clubs, awaiting for us to reopen with a double|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|fluffy: both north and south have stretched to bid 4@h, and its no surpise that they go down|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: ouch East makes an agressive double|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: good for him|pg||

nt|fluffy: with a low doubleton I'd say|pg||
nt|fluffy: yes 4@s was a good decision|pg||
nt|fluffy: I can't blame NS for playing 5@c|pg||

nt|pelu: for sure I will open 4@S against you :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|fluffy: but it depends on your opponents I guess, my normal opponents when they open 4@s they have an 8 card suit with few values, not 3 defensive tricks hehe|pg||
