mb|p|mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: NS play variable NT  [1/2=weak  3/4=strong]|pg||
nt|petergill: The Australian team came 1st in the Swiss qualifying and chose to play their Chinese opponents|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|petergill: 2@C Precision|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|petergill: 11-15 with clubs|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4C|nt|ahollan1: it seems all of the Chinese Precision pairs are using original 2@C opening  6+@C or 5@C & 4@H/@S|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D artificial enquiry|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: but NOT using Precision 2@D opener for 3-suit short @D|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@C slam try, natural|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|petergill: 4@D cue bid, 1st or 2nd round control|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS are in good form -- just coming off win in Australia NOT|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|petergill: with terrific datums in the finals of that event|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|petergill: NS also won one of India's biggest bridge events a few months ago|pg||
mb|6C|nt|tejjyid: not a god hand for 1430 BW responses|pg||
nt|petergill: They are regulars in the Australian Open Team, about 5 of the last 6 years I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the room just crashed, but when open you can keep an eye on the Closed Room using http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|vugraphzys: Now North is asking the meaning of the bidding.|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzys: then doubled.|pg||
nt|petergill: East gave some thought to simply bidding 5@C over 4@C to show his very poor hand with poor clubs - perhaps he should have!|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: i think either systemic flaw if 4@C is just a random slam try [vs Key Card Ask]  or West failed to bid 4@D as RKC @C|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|pc|h3|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|pc|c9|pc|c6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: excellent poing Peter -- that hand is lousy opposite a game forcing @H hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: poing??|pg||
nt|petergill: Then East decided that cue-bidding @D was obligatory in case partner with e.g. Ax, Axxxx, xxx, AKQx was desperately seeking @D control|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|othered1: What's east's 1@C?|pg||
nt|othered1: From south's 2@C bid, I might infer it's a big @C|pg||

nt|bobh1: EW will make a game try...bid 3N and try to make it|pg||

nt|chessmaste: 3NT is the spot for E/W|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: might even land in wrong suit|pg||

mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: 6@D ? asks a kibitzer|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - on this board?...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes|pg||
nt|saverio: NS could take 11 tricks in 5@d here     another "not easy to find" game  |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'd prefer 2@C over the X|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 8 easy tricks is a good start; usuallythe defence will provide one along the way|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|saverio: 6@d should be off on a @s lead  even if it is a though lead|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Communications are not very good especially if defenders lead clubs, but 9 tricks shouldn't be a problem|pg||
nt|chessmaste: In their precision style that would be an overbid|pg||
mb|3N|nt|othered1: NS will h ave another chance to take 7 top tricks.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bg: it was 16+|pg||
nt|othered1: looks like a normal big @C auction, with 2@S showing a limited positive response.|pg||
nt|othered1: ty operator|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: in the other room West raised to 5@C|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 3N made on 1 for 6 imps|pg||
nt|sharkey: Previous match was decided on a misunderstanding of a 4 NT bid|pg||
nt|sharkey: Played 4 NT down 2 instead of 6@S making...|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I think 4NT is too much with no fit and East showing no encouragement|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: goofy little hand |pg||
nt|lestergold: after A@c could be interesting if PO tries to sneak a spade he may may make|pg||
nt|othered1: in the OR, it was east who thought his hand worth initial action and opened 1@C, cheating his partner out of the chance to be first to bid.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: i might be tempted to do so too.|pg||
nt|xenya: makes sense, considering the vulnerability |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: with the west hand... 7 points in partners preemt might not produce a single trick|pg||
nt|xenya: putting maximum pressure on NS|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bg: same result in other room on board 1|pg||
nt|othered1: the overcall does give west some useful information|pg||
nt|fabsayc: are you prepared to bid 7 if opponents reach slam, because that often happens with these extreme preempts|pg||
nt|xenya: spades behave, in a sense, so declarer can get out for -1|pg||
nt|saverio: do you agree on S 3NT?    |pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest11/nec.html   for Daily Bulletins (scroll down in the column to the left)|pg||

nt|othered1: first of EW, that it|pg||
pc|s3|nt|tejjyid: Those bulletins are astounding, the eds/authors do a fantastic job|pg||
nt|lestergold: question of overtricks now|pg||
nt|lestergold: surely no tank here must be odds to play J or T @c|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Well if they play 4NT and South leads a spade it is easy enough to score ten tricks|pg||
nt|othered1: IN OR, I guess west couldn't imagine a hand with no key cards.  Those who require a modicum of quality in the suits they open 2@C won't face that|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jcwla: Will lead @DQ to preserve the opportunity to play S out of @D KT7.  Or won't.|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|saverio: wd by N to move from 3NT anyway|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kiwibridge: indeed the stiff A@H didn't look that great|pg||
nt|tejjyid: T1 tank is OK for planning - but tankins at T@@ as well is a bit rough|pg||
nt|tejjyid: T2|pg||
nt|bobh1: he's trying to decide which red suit S has|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sJ|pc|s5|pg||

pc|s8|nt|hawe45:  MY partner(s) doÂ´nt open 3 @C|pg||
nt|saverio: i think i'd pass 3NT as N   (i'd expect something like AQ for that bid)|pg||

nt|bobh1: are available anyway|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pc|sT|pg||

nt|henryb:  I must say these events that play an infinite number of boards to qualify and then throw out those results make no sense to me|pg||
nt|petergill: Oz Two as a name has no reference to the other Aussie team here - it is an informal follow-up to a project called Oz One which wound down a few years ago. |pg||
nt|petergill: 3@D good raise|pg||
nt|frankaus: do u think OZ1 acheived its goals Peter|pg||
nt|petergill: Have you and your partner discussed whether, after South 's Dbl, which is weaker - Pass or 3@H?|pg||

pc|c8|nt|othered1: I don't hate 2@C rebid, but I think it would be nice to have methods that didn't require me to balckwood on north hand, though maybe it will work out.  7th @C, as yet unbid, is key ...|pg||
nt|othered1: and north can't count it.|pg||

nt|tejjyid: NOrth has shown an appreciation of the "soft" nature of his 16 count, but 'm not sure whathe can do about it|pg||
nt|chilloncan: mirrored shapes and marginal game values dont mix well|pg||
nt|lestergold: well if he bids it will west lead his fourth best from hismlongest and strongest the only lead to give 3N|pg||
nt|lestergold: and that was a few decades ago|pg||
nt|lestergold: like 4|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3@c probably bid to direct lead |pg||
nt|othered1: might have dissuaded west to only make a game try|pg||
nt|tejjyid: well timed, becasue nothing in the auction said the @C layout was like this|pg||
nt|othered1: but it is a vul game and you don't need to be bonded to try it (if the opponents don't look like the doubling kind)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: if West has AQT, he would be greatly encouragesd on minimum values|pg||

nt|jcwla: Rule of 11 tells W the whole story.|pg||
nt|xenya: anyway, NS were lucky to remain oblivious of their spade fit|pg||
pc|h2|nt|saverio: not easy to get to slam after 2@h/3@c/4@h...  a lot of space wasted and no more room to investigate|pg||
nt|tejjyid: OH, thy're certainly getting to game|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like 4@d is systematic|pg||
nt|chilloncan: the double by W makes S hand worse, and NS not vul. but most wiould bid game even if appreciating the negative factors|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|sharkey: *Catch|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  When you have heart tolerance and clubs and nothing much in their suit, it will usually be best to compete I think|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  It is much harder for North even with quite a good hand unless they have extra shape|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|tejjyid: I guess, that's why it took so long to find.  |pg||
nt|chilloncan: 6 LTC + 8.5 LTC means larginal for game even apart from the mirror|pg||
nt|tejjyid: South *might* have passed 2@S NV< but once not, no way to stop|pg||
nt|bobh1: actually no way to misdefend|pg||
nt|chilloncan: it is a difficult double dummy problem i ndeed to imagine a scenario where EW could let it make|pg||
nt|lestergold: well North was very max for his 2@s and south was sub min for 2N|pg||
nt|tejjyid: If they routinely make single raises with 16 HCP, South is pretty much compelled to try will 9+|pg||

nt|othered1: I can contrive an auction where south would be asking and might be able to find both red kings.  But everything has to go right|pg||

nt|nigel_k:  But it's hard for North to find a passive lead|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: this is pushing it|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: nice jump overcall in the balancing position by Zhan|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@S in last seat tends to show a decent hand -- just what S has|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the other option of dbling and then bidding @Ss will show more points and defence|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Lots of work to do|pg||
mb|d|nt|xenya: what's your prediction on this one, Martin?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I the good old days, North had "taken the money against 2 @C D!"|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I only see two losers in 5 @D? But how many tricks...|pg||
nt|saverio: after the 2@h opening in the earlier board we can understand why N opened 1@h here     though it is not my style since i prefer sounds openings and overcalls....:)|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i dont really agree with the double by W, but the position is a very awkward one|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I have never played Precision where 2@c can have a major|pg||
nt|chessmaste: In a way both sides are endplayed|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I fI were NOrth I would lead a @S - but if I were South I would have bid @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 1 off guaranteed club guess needed to avoid 2 light|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I used to play cheapest NT was a void based T/O|pg||
nt|sybarra: some sort of drury by N |pg||
nt|tejjyid: and on that lead, it won't be too hard|pg||
nt|othered1: west's pass, compared to an earlier board, must mean he looks at the vulnerability before bidding|pg||
mb|2D|nt|othered1: and I guess east is making a game try|pg||
nt|xenya: tough hand for NS|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5@D is down after 2 rounds of clubs|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: if South has soft values in the majors 3 nt may be right.. but i guess he will bid 5@D|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I worked oncein real life, and this appears to be the 2nd time|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm...|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: well N knows all the spades on his left |pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: and the @Da ofcourse|pg||

nt|sybarra: been around long enough to have learned |pg||
pc|c2|nt|tejjyid: NOrth may find he has too many trumps|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|tejjyid: West will force declarer, but the location of the @D A means the contract is safe|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Probaly the best exit was the @D J, creating an entry to East's hand|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|tejjyid: peopel usually forget to put you to the guess when they have the Q|pg||
pc|cT|nt|hawe45:  Even the @D 2 would do |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: west has to perforce continue @C after seeing the major holding in dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If declarer gets another club he will try to get rid of his clubs on dummy's majors|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But he won't succeed|pg||
nt|othered1: HI!|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi|pg||

nt|saverio: uh ho   now he could be in trouble (if my def lines works :))|pg||

nt|sybarra: or not?|pg||
nt|chilloncan: good bid by E, but this should end it|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Bidding over a strong club works at lot of the time|pg||
nt|sharkey: indeed|pg||
nt|othered1: But north has extras, maybe too many|pg||
nt|sybarra: can they handle the clubs?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: NOrth maybe a little conservative opposite a 3rd hand opening|pg||
pc|s5|nt|nigel_k:  5@c may have been easier|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant fail to make as cards lie|pg||
nt|lestergold: but north's 1N an underbid|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I would upgrae my "well-positioned" @S honours and try 2NT as a passed hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: any one for neg X |pg||
nt|lestergold: especially as  apassed hand and indeed qorth an upgrade in any case with the spade overall|pg||
nt|sybarra: or does that double mean something else to them?|pg||
nt|othered1: I'sd prefer a negative double, if available, then 2N giving partner a bunch of choices|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: so was W bid a psyche? or systemic|pg||
nt|tejjyid: -ve X seems reasonable as well|pg||
nt|lestergold: certainly cannot blame south who has no move opposite 1N|pg||
nt|caitlin: 2N by S?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: stewards inquiry|pg||
nt|lestergold: er i dont think so Ellen|pg||
pc|sK|nt|chilloncan: wow. apparently 2N was forcing|pg||
nt|tejjyid: a simple & descriptive bid...|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, and now W could bid 3N -- i'm surprised he didn't|pg||
nt|jcwla: Considering this suit leaves a lot to be desired, W should feel comfortable in thinking JT shores it up nicely when in fact it's little better than 32.|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|saverio: but the seems not to have a bid showing both M so they could have wronsided the contract if they happened to have @h and not @s fit....|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: well said Jordan|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Still down in 5@C|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yes because of the overruff|pg||
pc|cK|nt|xenya: the 4@S bid is routine -- E doesn't need much from partner for game to be good |pg||
nt|chilloncan: looks good for W|pg||
nt|sybarra: how did they make 4 @S?  not sure I see enough tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: as cards lie|pg||
nt|sybarra: I see,  @H lead and hopped ace|pg||
nt|chilloncan: club ruffs out third, and they may have led D ace|pg||
nt|lestergold: surely only lose 1 trick in each side suit|pg||
nt|othered1: That doesn't come up all that often on defensive bidding, and I might think it showed a different hand with longer, better @D and a bit less outside.|pg||
nt|chessmaste: This will be worse|pg||
nt|caitlin: agree you mean by N?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bg: many players do not like to doubles with voids and a weakness in defensive cards  probably best here just to overcall 1 heart|pg||
nt|saverio: wrongsided*|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it probably gets bid with your hand type more often - 19-20 balanced usually goes through a X|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|sharkey: @S spots certainly coming into play here|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|dburn: not sure I'd have responded to 1@d at all with the North cards, let alone responded 1@h. But Kokish is very big in Japan, so that a 1@d overcall has a range of about 9 to about 29|pg||
pc|c5|nt|othered1:  a little wild and wooly, but I'll take defending 4@S on these hands.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|sunsamvar: with 2 sure trump losers Tanaka has the choice of the @S or @D fin|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Oups|pg||
nt|saverio: over 3@d it is a normal agreement to play 4@c both M with slam interest and 4@d w/out.....|pg||
nt|sharkey: looks like off 3|pg||
nt|caitlin: what is aler on 1@D?|pg||
nt|caitlin: alert|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Precision|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kiwibridge: Korbachev has made his 5@D another 12 imp blow|pg||
nt|sharkey: at least|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: well hopefully there is a real explanation, I am getting several from kibs|pg||
pc|c3|nt|tejjyid: reasonable to raise to 2@D|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: good @D shift by Zhan forcing declarer to take the choice now..|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: South had a tough choice at trick 2|pg||
pc|h6|nt|dburn: meanwhile, though, how will he make it?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I can't imagine introuding the @H suit though|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  One heart and five trumps|pg||
pc|hA|nt|othered1: eventually, the auction will let declarer get the @D position right|pg||
pc|h4|nt|xenya: also, the defence may go wrong...|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: a spec points out that Tanaka shd have pld a @S to the 10 on the second trick... true i think|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|dburn: I guess that with this vile layout (diamonds 4-1, all the hearts wrong) he won't|pg||
pc|d3|nt|hawe45:  But taking the @C Ace behind tha strong hand looks strange|pg||

nt|lestergold: 4@h will make played by S only goes off played by N on a @s lead|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sunsamvar: has Zhan mixed a club along with his @Ss|pg||
nt|jcwla: This collection of quacks is not my idea of an opening bid.  The @S bid and rebid are both unilateral shoot-the-moon moves, particularly if 2@D is known to show three.|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Anyway they did well to stop because it looks like 3NT is down on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|chessmaste: A trap pass - not a good idea in my opinion|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: they got to 6 @D in the other room making|pg||
nt|pelu: I have just cheked the scores: 15-17 now|pg||
nt|othered1: 3@H is a really interesting bid, which I guess they play forcing.  South still backs off with what looks like a minimum.|pg||

nt|othered1: Looks like they play 2-way Stayman (a good method, especially over weak NT)|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n safer of course|pg||
mb|4H|nt|hawe45:  South might have a 5-card major|pg||

nt|chilloncan: double more attractive if you had a hand where you thought 5C or 4S was likely to make. but N has too much defense to accommodate a possible club save|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: now what?|pg||
nt|othered1: 4N would have been a very descriptive bid, if quantitative.  Not sure what 5@H would mean in that context.  Perhaps a choice of game, perhaps responding to blackwood, which some do ...|pg||
nt|othered1: if continuing over a quantitative 4N.|pg||
nt|sharkey: Dont think 3 NT was an option|pg||
nt|caitlin: 2 way is 2@C non forcing and 2@D forcing Stayman|pg||

nt|lestergold: yes the clubs will take care of the losing spade|pg||

pc|dA|nt|bg: sb 11 imps to Neduk making score 15-28|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 5H totally undisciplined|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I saw a similar themed bidding problem yesterday... South needs a widr range of bids to help NOrth decidewhat to do over 4@S |pg||
nt|sybarra: unlikely to get @D right imo|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 5@H is wild, given the lack of shape/playing strength|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think N should double 4@S....pass is my second choice|pg||
nt|dburn: what good would that do?|pg||
nt|lestergold: with nothing to go on east playing partner with marked high cards tries for the ruff|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|sybarra: these teams are ranked  1 (Neduk) and  2  ;Taipei W |pg||
nt|othered1: south really hasn't had much of a chance to do something with that hand.  North will be very pleased to find the good @S tricks that never got into the auction directly.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: subtle not!|pg||
nt|tejjyid: what harm?|pg||
nt|dburn: only to P-O's reputation|pg||
nt|tejjyid: his reputation is what makes it worthwhile|pg||
nt|dburn: I see what you mean - it could gain a trick, if North were familiar with Grosvenor Gambits|pg||
pc|d2|nt|othered1: This will be a swing againstthe 450 in the OR|pg||
nt|bg: with a spade lead it would create minor transportation problems if Wreturns a dia after winning a club lead to q|pg||
nt|bg: oops all over now n not likely to try fancy backward heart finesse|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I see no other chance for an extra trick than an error by declarer|pg||
nt|dburn: better late than never...|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|othered1: easy game, as cards lie.  but north is trying to figure out how to avoid @C loser on the lead.  Playing east for J.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 3S by S could not have been a slam try and almost surely not a probe for 3N. so that means it was simply establishing ownership of the hand, to set up a forcing pas situation. N ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: has absolutely zero reason to bid 5H. his offense to defense ratio is about as low as it coul be|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lestergold: yes south has shown a raise with high cards|pg||
nt|sybarra: think tonight I should go to casino |pg||

nt|sharkey: EW 4@C|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  3NT has a chance if you can get there without letting North bid hearts|pg||
nt|sharkey: or 3...|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Provided the defenders lead hearts at some point 3NT would be doomed - and so might 1NT|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|bg: s|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 2@C probably majors?|pg||
nt|sharkey: @H longer than @S according Alert?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: last hand of the set now |pg||
nt|tejjyid: this is the way the world ends...|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 2@S clearly minors|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3@D or 3@C shud be ok|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sunsamvar: and hard to believe that Yamada discarded @S instead of @C on the 3rd @D|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|xenya: that was the last board -- thanks everyone|pg||

nt|sharkey: Easier with all hands in view....|pg||
nt|chessmaste: I wonder if the explanation to East was correct? Pass of 2@S is very odd otherwise|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jcwla: Maybe 2NT by N as pick a minor instead of 3@C.|pg||

nt|nigel_k:  I'm not sure about 2@s when you can also bid 2NT|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Still, if he knows North has four spades he should make it easily |pg||

nt|petergill: all round. |pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks to Frank too, and to JCBL and it hard workers in Yokohama|pg||
nt|petergill: As we approach half time, which is 16 boards, China leads 32 to 28.5|pg||
nt|petergill: The lack of a (lead-directing, as it happens) 1@S response by the Precision-playing South led to 12 imps to Australia on Bd 13.|pg||
nt|petergill: On Bd 7, is West too strong for a 15-17 1NT?  |pg||
nt|petergill: Kaplan - Rubens Evaluator says http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=j982+aq+k7+ak432 |pg||
nt|petergill: 17.40, so maybe not|pg||
nt|petergill: but wires got crossed over whether 2NT or 3@C was the super-accept to 2@S, I think|pg||
nt|petergill: Gosney - Gill play 2NT as the super-accept, but I don't know for Gosney - Edgtton. |pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 7 - on a spade lead, 3NT might fail, anyway. |pg||
nt|petergill: Nobody will worry about Bd 6 - there are those of us like me who never play for what appears to be a certain overtrick (@SK must be onside after that @SJ switch), and there are ...|pg||
nt|petergill: those who play the game mathematically ref Woolsey interview in Feb 2011 Bridge World magazine (not available online) |pg||

nt|caitlin: last 1/4 final|pg||
nt|othered1: but with the 2N, slam-killer auction, they won't investigate it|pg||

mb|6D|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: bet we are off to 6 @D in this room |pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems flawed for East to become declarer in @H  --  but  NS aren't finished|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: how badly will 6@CX be hurt if declarer takes some right views?|pg||
nt|caitlin: and it's so close to br swinging now|pg||
nt|othered1: =rather 6@DX|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|tejjyid: trading trmp loser for @C ruff, so not much in it, Ed|pg||
nt|othered1: looks like -300 if south sees things right|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h5|pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer might get out for 300 if he sets up spades|pg||
nt|tejjyid: guess the @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: has to guess the @D also |pg||
nt|tejjyid: not so hard|pg||
nt|caitlin: W opened 2N.....|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry yes after 2 @D easy|pg||
nt|petergill: If West passes 6@D to East who bids 6@H, I think South would have bid 7@D|pg||
nt|tejjyid: maybe a low @D best now|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|dJ|nt|petergill: Yes, a low diamond reduces the entries to dummy to set up spades - wd Nabil Edgtton|pg||
