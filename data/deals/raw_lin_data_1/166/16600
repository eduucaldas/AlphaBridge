nt|mrdct: hi everyone|pg||
mb|1C|nt|marcsmith: looks like a dull 4S for EW although 12 tricks can be made with the favourable diamond position|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mrdct: EW play a variant of the fantunes system|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: hi all e/w are playing fantunes|pg||

pc|h8|nt|marcsmith: if they got to 6, declarer would have a 50-50 guess -- whether to play for DJ singleton with north or DK singleton with south|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|nt|marcsmith: my guess is 1 IMP to BROWN|pg||
nt|mrdct: EW play a weak 1NT opening, so the 1NT rebid is usually strong|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mrdct: good start for EW as 3NT looks to be a superior contract to 4@s|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|mrdct: although both appear to make comfortably today|pg||
mc|9|nt|marcsmith: at the other table they played from West and north led his singleton, solving declarer's problems in the suit|pg||
nt|marcsmith: draw trumps and play ace and another diamond looks like a normal line here|pg||

nt|mrdct: it's a pity that the ABF are so short-sighted as to not allow BBO coverage of the 3rd match even though there was someone willing to do it|pg||
nt|bebechira: i am the closed room table... Klinger-Mullamphy playing Serhat-Travis|pg||

nt|mrdct: interesting choice for north - should he preference to @s now?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c3|nt|mrdct: my personal policy with 6-5s is i always want to play in game|pg||

nt|ahollan1: nicely done|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: there are only a few of us in the room so if there's something special you want to discuss -- just holler|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|mrdct: Alex Smirnov is a regular on the german open team and the welland team in US nationals|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: i believe 2@D=artifiicial game force|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|mrdct: he has been a regular visitor to the main australian summer events in recent years - particularly Youth Week|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H = 4+ hcp, no good suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|nickf: -------------------------------------------------->   Can you please put the player names in?|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|mrdct: south worth a raise now given that he passed 1st round|pg||
nt|mrdct: north has quite a good hand with some game prospects even opposite a very weak hand|pg||
mb|4S|mb|d|mb|p|nt|marcsmith: a heart lead or switch forces declarer to guess the clubs, but he can afford a wrong guess on a spade continuation|pg||
nt|mrdct: but he will anticipate that communication will likely be a problem|pg||
nt|mrdct: even more so with dummy a 4333|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: the players in the NOT [national open teams]  qualified for the event via a 14-round swiss event called the SWPT|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Klinger won that event after gaining the lead in round 3 or 4 [and never looked back]|pg||
nt|peachy: E wants a diamond lead, I assume|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: back to back 5@D contracts   you won't see that often -- especially in non-imp games|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|marcsmith: now he has to guess the clubs again|pg||
nt|peachy: this is a challenging hand to make, but not impossible|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|nt|mrdct: at the risk of some differing views, i would say that EW have been quite easily the top pair in Victoria for the past 5 years or so|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|peachy: But I believe Justin would make it.  Has to avoid giving too many natural spade tricks to the opponents|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|s3|pc|d4|pg||

nt|mrdct: this would be a good hand for minorwood|pg||
mb|2D|an| |nt|mrdct: south can keycard in @D and now he is absolutely cold for 6@d which will be enough to win a big swing here|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|mrdct: whibley semi-inventing a @s suit to convey his reversing values|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|mrdct: 3@c by north may have been more informative|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|mrdct: i'm told this board was pass-out in the other match|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|cQ|nt|mrdct: 5@d really should be the weakest bid possible by north after 3@h and he has AKxx in trumps which is a bit too much imho|pg||

nt|mrdct: no worries jane|pg||
nt|ahollan1: fyi  4@S did specifically show @D|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct: a @h raise from east will no doubt propel west to game at these colours|pg||

mb|p|nt|mrdct: ben is thinking "bad raise schmad raise - i've got a good hand"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW play the Fantunes system   1N is weak and covers many shapes,  1-suit openings are forcing 1 round, 2-suit openings are limited and unbal|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|mrdct: the milne team are all under 30, indeed a couple of them are under 20 with smirnov the "senior" on the team at age 28|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS play a souped up 2/1 but  Weak NT 1st/2nd seat|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|marcsmith: they should stop in game -- only 17 opposite a minimum opening|pg||
nt|marcsmith: with no fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: looks like both matches playing the same boards  you can keep an eye on all tables using either http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||

nt|marcsmith: think South at the other table must have forgotten what notrump range they were playing|pg||
mc|11|nt|mrdct: 4@h was surely going to be at least one off and i think this will come up a trick short|pg||

nt|marcsmith: 4@S is certainly a strange contract|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3rd/4th seat  NS play 1N=good14 to bad 17|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D = @S and @C/@D  [ASPRO]|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2D|nt|marcsmith: presumably 1@S shows four spades and a negative double would deny four|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N looks like either transfer or lebensohl|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or  transfer lebensohl|pg||
nt|ahollan1: either way   i think Thompson is supposed to bid 3@C unless holding a really strong hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmmm maybe they play 2@D=@S & another  [including @H]|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3D|nt|peachy: I don't know what NS 1NT vul opening range is, but I assume 10-12. Kibitzer says "gutsy"|pg||
mb|3H|nt|marcsmith: 2@H likely now from South|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: bit too good for 3@C|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: Gosney in 1N West|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: now 3@D from north and another game try with 4@C by south seems sensibel|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Klinger led the 14 round Qualifying Event [South-West Pacific Teams] from Round 3 or 4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another possible double partscore swing -- but both will be close|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: the defenders from 2010, McManus just barely made it into the NOT in the final match of the SWPT|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: this looks like the road to 3NT|pg||
nt|peachy: could be 12-14 with an upgrade to 12 due to good spots|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mrdct: or not|pg||
nt|mrdct: 5@c a maker also |pg||

pc|d7|pg||
nt|peachy: South cnnot go wrong nearly whatever he returns|pg||
nt|peachy: but understandably he wants to weigh the options at this time|pg||

pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: @D3-3 should be enough for Hans|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cT|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|peachy: North could have ducked this, to assure two club tricks. Perha[s he thought S had a singleton|pg||
nt|peachy: but if so, the trick was coming back laster in clubs|pg||
nt|peachy: *later|pg||

mb|p|pc|sK|nt|mrdct: i wonder if the double will suggest to east a non-@s lead|pg||
nt|mrdct: if milne had the entries he could pull a @D to the 9 but i think plan A will be to hope @d are 3-2|pg||
nt|mrdct: and once that isn't happening scramble for 8 tricks|pg||
nt|mrdct: a scenario to look out for is a switch to the @CQ by west - but i think Reynolds is awake enough not to try that|pg||
nt|mrdct: maybe north will read that the double is partially based on @D being covered by west and he'll leave that suit alone a try to engineer an endplay on west|pg||

mb|3D|nt|marcsmith: a diamond lead might beat 6@S but 6@H is solid|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: the problem with 6@S is that you have to ruff a club. If North then ducks the first round of trumps, declarer may be tempted to repeat the finesse|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|marcsmith: something like 3@C should now show a sound diamond raise or better|pg||
nt|marcsmith: 3@S would be non-forcing and 3@H a forcing 3@S bid|pg||
nt|marcsmith: EW may think 5@D will be cheap but it should be 800 as there is no entry to take the @D hook|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: Mullamphy is playing 3@S North|pg||
mb|4S|nt|marcsmith: they obviously play 3@C and 3@H the other way around, which not efficient in this particular auction|pg||
nt|tez: 1@s 1nt 2@c 2@s all pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: West too weak for 1N and not distributional enough for 10-13 HCP 2@H opener  [needs 6@H or 2nd suit]|pg||

nt|peachy: West wisely stayed out of the sac|pg||

nt|marcsmith: likely to give away a trick -- generally Jx Jxx Jxxx Qx are terrible holdings to lead|pg||
nt|marcsmith: much prefer @CA here in the hope you can score fast tricks and maybe a ruff|pg||

mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: min 1@H -- forcing 1 round|pg||

nt|marcsmith: ie a weak hand with some diamonds|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: 51 imps exchanged so far this set -- translating to a whopping +7 for Bloom|pg||

nt|marcsmith: having not raised the diamonds, West should lead the Jack here|pg||
