mb|3N|nt|wygbe1: should have 9 tricks now - 3 sp, 3 diam, 1h, 2c|pg||
nt|timmy5:  now declarer is forced to find the diamond queen to protect king of hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin:  if you have unlimited entries|pg||
nt|dilipgidwa: experts hate to lead from unsupported 4 card suits |pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin:  the best way to play the suit|pg||
nt|gavin:  is to lead low to the queen|pg||
nt|gavin:  its better than playing the Jack in case south has singleton king|pg||
nt|gavin:  so she will be evaluating if she can afford to do so|pg||
mb|p|pc|h9|pc|h5|nt|dilipgidwa: hence no @h lead |pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|pg||

nt|gavin:  in order to come to 9 tricks she needs 3@S 1@H 3@D and 2@C|pg||
nt|gavin:  she still doesnt know how many @H tricks|pg||

nt|gavin:  establishing clubs isnt serving a purpose with no more entries|pg||
nt|wygbe1: winning the h and playing back the nine, as spec points out, may have beaten this|pg||
nt|gavin:  now levin pretty much knows she is making|pg||
nt|wygbe1: ace and a spade now, results in 9 tricks|pg||

nt|gavin:  in a normal 2/1 style|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|nt|gavin:  a lot of pairs play 2NT as a limit raise in @H here|pg||

nt|timmy5:  this can still make if declarer finds the queen of clubs|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
nt|gavin:  east is considering throwing away a diamond here to avoid being shortened|pg||
nt|gavin:  it looks obvious to ruff but with the preempt over her a bad trump break very possible|pg||
nt|gavin:  when thinking about it, she must assume they will continue leading spades (if trumps are breaking badly)|pg||
nt|gavin:  and figure out if she can handle a 5-0 split|pg||

pc|d9|pc|dA|nt|gavin:  there will be no diamond finesse on this hand, |pg||

mb|p|nt|gavin:  west's distribution makes her hand a comfortable texas transfer|pg||
mb|1S|nt|gavin:  when agreeing to play texas transfers its important to discuss whether you play them in competition|pg||
nt|gavin:  and when the bids cease to be texas|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin:  I'm a fan of using texas over 1NT (3D)|pg||
nt|gavin:  or even 3H|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|gavin:  but its commonly played only up until a 3C overcall|pg||

mb|p|nt|newmoon: in MPs, it may be right to go back to @Hs by North|pg||
nt|tec123: a club partial will be a good stop here, but South may try again over a 3C raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin:  this contract had its chances but we can see the club finesse is offside (rather expected)|pg||
nt|gavin:  but still can be a good sacrifice|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfk: we play negative free bids for hearts, but jtxxx?|pg||
nt|newmoon: Welcome to Tim Cope from Cape Town  :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|gavin:  this auction shows "a hand not strong enough to bid a direct 2@H"|pg||
nt|newmoon: these matches last 20 boards...|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: hmmm "does 4@H make"  Bosie muses...|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin:  would typically have more hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|wygbe1: fearless 3h bid - can make by guessing h suit|pg||
nt|gavin:  but sprung hits a bullseye|pg||
nt|tec123: Can go down on a club lead in 4@H|pg||
nt|newmoon: good stop, and event 2NT is precarious|pg||
nt|newmoon: even not "event"|pg||
nt|newmoon: the "t" was silent|pg||
pc|c4|nt|gavin:  right will surely lose 1@S and 2@D, need to avoid 2 trump losers|pg||
nt|gavin:  and the two ways to play the suit to avoid 2 losers|pg||
nt|gavin:  are if you think the layout is as it lies with east having honor doubeton|pg||
nt|gavin:  you lead the jack of hearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: ladies talking, bridge stuff|pg||
nt|gavin:  now if east doesnt cover the ace will drop the king|pg||
nt|gavin:  if east does cover then you win the ace and lead towards the ten|pg||
nt|gavin:  however that would not work if east has Q9x and west has Kx|pg||
nt|gavin:  as east would not cover with Q9x and have a sure trick later|pg||
pc|cT|nt|tec123: I think he will struggle without help to find the 8th trick as there is no entry to dummy for the @H finesse|pg||
nt|newmoon: I am lost with this bidding...  conventional meanings|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|gavin:  so if you think the hearts are reversed|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|nt|tec123: This will be a good slam to bid, making when there is only 1 possible heart loser and all the clubs disappear on the AK @D and the established 5th @D|pg||
nt|newmoon: 6@H available here - even on @C lead - he has to smother @H10 dbleton on his right|pg||

nt|newmoon: @CA intact, @Ds blocked...  exit a diamond now|pg||
nt|newmoon: in the fullness of time, the @C9 makes!|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|gavin:  then if west has Honor doubleton they can fly up|pg||
nt|gavin:  but now you can finesse east|pg||
nt|gavin:  and if they dont fly their honor will drop under the ace|pg||
nt|wygbe1: moment of truth coming up - knows w has 5s, so might play w for the shortness|pg||
nt|tec123: Now declarer must win the spade in hand, cash 2 top hearts hoping the Q drops, and when it does not set about serring up the diamond suit for three club discards|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||

nt|newmoon: 4th seat|pg||

nt|newmoon: yes, esp at white v/s red|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfk: other room says 2s -1|pg||
nt|newmoon: in SA, we use the phrase "at these colours"|pg||
nt|newmoon: meaning at "favourable" or non-vul/vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|tec123: 3@D should show a good hand if playing Good/Bad 2NT as we would compete with 2N with same shape and less points|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|nt|newmoon: hehehe  5@C now?|pg||
nt|newmoon: no?   wow|pg||
pc|d6|nt|newmoon: 2@S a bit risky here, as West can still be 17-18 and if he has KJx @S, an easy 500 pickup|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|s2|nt|tec123: Presumably 1N was forcing and 2@C was better minor - South has now bid 2@S in a situation where the opposition have already passed a lot of information.|pg||

pc|s9|pc|sQ|nt|vugraphzhc: Sorry, trouble with the Internet connexion...|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|nt|newmoon: this is the kind of board where anything is possible in OR.   |pg||
nt|tec123: I would bid 5@C - this one has chances as North is going to be endplayed after 3 trumps and a @H exit|pg||
nt|tec123: Good pass by North - using the Law's adage of "Eight Never, Nine Ever" knowing that their spade fit will be only eight cards|pg||
nt|newmoon: 3@H is precarious|pg||
pc|s4|nt|tec123: 5 top losers, and a possible diamond to worry about, though the lead may help with that|pg||

nt|newmoon: 3NT reached in OR also, lead = @S7|pg||

pc|cT|nt|gavin:  hard to argue with either of wests passes|pg||
nt|tec123: I think East would have done better to take over with 4N after 4@C - will be difficult yo bid 7 if West in charge of Blackwood|pg||

nt|gavin:  here is a good example of declarer being able to take advantage of defensive carding|pg||
nt|gavin:  there is no way that west would lie about her club count |pg||
nt|newmoon: 4NT now... sets @C the suit... can now get info regarding @CQ|pg||
pc|h2|nt|gavin:  so south can assume clubs are 4-2 (west high lowed to show an even  )|pg||

pc|h7|nt|gavin:  ahh mor like it|pg||

nt|newmoon: wow, well done!|pg||
nt|newmoon: 5@S = 2 keys + @CQ|pg||
nt|tec123: Will need to protect against 4/1 clubs, so best to ruff two diamonds before drawing all the trumps|pg||
nt|newmoon: bd 9:  apteker (South) went 3@C - wjs - after North opens 1@H|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|nt|Vugraphzfk: took it back|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfk: definitely played 10|pg||
pc|h3|nt|gavin:  the Ten ensures a 4th round diamond entry if they break 3-2|pg||

mb|1C|mb|1D|nt|tec123: Paretner asks you to choose between @H & @D so you choose @S - may worry West|pg||
nt|newmoon: bd 9, loss to SA of 3 IMPs (or 5)     playing still in 4@C by South in OR|pg||

mb|1S|nt|wygbe1: are ns playing polish 2 bids?|pg||
nt|newmoon: and Taymour El Henawy (Egypt) has just joined him as commentator|pg||
nt|tec123: Close to a cue bid raise - 9 pts and a probable working doubleton, but 2@S will keep them out of trouble|pg||
nt|newmoon: 2 soft Js in his raise... I like 2@S|pg||
nt|tec123: agreed|pg||
nt|newmoon: AJx, xxx, KJx, 10xxx  = 2@D raise  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|tec123: That looks wrong...maybe 3@C|pg||

nt|tec123: might be some blood now|pg||
nt|newmoon: remember 1@D denied 4-card major.  So 3@H must be longer @Cs?|pg||
nt|tec123: True, but a simple t/out dbl would have been lower and carried a similar message|pg||
nt|newmoon: if it COULD be, North must pass the x, and South will 4@C|pg||
nt|newmoon: yes, of course, a t/o of 2@S|pg||
nt|newmoon: or even 2NT|pg||

mb|4S|mb|d|nt|tec123: Agreed, but always worth taking some time to ensure that you are passing a Penalty double - probably discussion over some bids meaning|pg||

nt|glensa: vugraph, do you have the auction correct?|pg||
mb|p|nt|tec123: A spade partial for EW - danger is getting too high|pg||
nt|newmoon: 2@S, even if a max pass, may still by it|pg||
nt|newmoon: buy|pg||
mb|3C|nt|jjsb: 2@d is 4 @s and another |pg||
nt|jjsb: so yes|pg||
nt|glensa: thank you, an astro use|pg||
nt|jjsb: another 5+ that is |pg||
nt|glensa: good chance for a pickup here for Egypt|pg||
mb|p|nt|tec123: I assume 2@S shows a maximum passed hand with a @C fit, but no reason for E to proceed with a minimum opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|jjsb: we call it "reunion jacoby" :) just dont laugh too much pls :) |pg||

nt|jjsb: well basically Patrice in North like to be very solid on overcall so definitely and for that reason u will see some balancing situation kinda weak with her partner .. |pg||
nt|glensa: unless north found the inspired heart lead on this hand, I think delcarer lost his way at the other table.|pg||

mb|2D|nt|glensa: I don't know what east is thinking. The shape and high card positioning is wrong for a double|pg||

nt|newmoon: 3NT = max and 2 stoppers in @S.   Presumably 2@C stayman shows values |pg||
mb|4S|nt|glensa: it is always subject to partnership agreement, but I play this as 9 tricks with some defense|pg||
nt|jjsb: patrice cant bid 3@c cause its showing a 55 but i really dont like the 2@c rebid he has to do ... |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|newmoon: was 4@S unilateral?|pg||
nt|tec123: I see 5@C made - looks like there was never a @H switch when in with A@C - 3N a better contract|pg||
mb|p|pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|tec123: Very difficult lead for South = a club may let it through though declarer can always make by dropping the K@S|pg||

mb|p|nt|newmoon: in OR, EAST opens 1@H.  They settle in 4@H|pg||

nt|newmoon: and, in 3rd seat, at these colours (favourable) 3NT is very descriptive|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|nt|newmoon: Tim - I expected more swingy boards - something like the set you had against the Italians in the quarters of the BB some 4 years ago(?) where 3 slam swings won the match|pg||
