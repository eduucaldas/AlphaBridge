nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Peter Marstrander|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Hi.|pg||
nt|brolucius: This is a better slam than the previous one, but still not worth bidding at single dummy.|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Looks like another push board. No one will get to 6 without the Q of trumps these days|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer can play Restricted Choice if his choice of trump honor on the first round drops the Q or J offside.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D!|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|brolucius: North rebid only 2@S at the other table. The hand is worth something in between the two possible rebids.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now Brogeland must at least consider a slam. He can cue-bid 4@C to consult partner.|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|brolucius: The slam depends on the trump position, which is around a 50% proposition. Maybe a bit less.|pg||

nt|brolucius: If my reading of the results site is correct, Angelini has yet to lose an IMP in this event. Mind you, this is only the second round.|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Still plenty of chances to lose an IMP|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|brolucius: You could scrape 10 tricks on these values if the cards lay well, but it is not a game you would expect anyone to bid.|pg||

Once more a keycard and the trump Q are missing.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|brolucius: If trumps are 2-2, you can ditch a diamond from North on the long club and ruff two diamonds in the North hand, losing only a spade trick. |pg||

mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|vugraphplf: 2@D is a relay for power and @H length|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|brolucius: An Italian kibitzer has helped us with the 1@C system (many thanks!). He says that 1@C is indeed strong and the response is on a step system based on HCP.  So 1@D = 0-3, 1@H - ...|pg||
