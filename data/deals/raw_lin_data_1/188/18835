pc|s2|nt|jcomyn: many kibs wont know what 3d is Jon you are the expert tell em|pg||
nt|jcomyn: bergen yes but i know m,any of the people watching need explanation|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and the difference with 3c|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jbgood: it is very important to locate the 4 trumps with prd when you have at least 5 yourself|pg||
nt|jcomyn: so 3d is the weak version and 3c stronger|pg||
nt|jbgood: not sure how they play it - 3 @c may be 6-8 and 3 @d 9-10|pg||
nt|jbgood: (11)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jcomyn: weell is sup;pose they all have their own versions|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|pc|h3|nt|jbgood: i seem to remember that 3@c is the weaker the way they play it|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|pc|s6|pc|h6|pg||
nt|jcomyn: just that several kibs have 3c weak or strong and 3d weak or strong, so...|pg||
nt|jbgood: most play it that way, although some have switched the minor meanings|pg||

nt|jcomyn: keep low here 12+11 going nowehere anyway|pg||
nt|jbgood: well - some lucky @d Q finder will win 3 NT|pg||
nt|jcomyn: maybe the 5-card suit will attract sabine|pg||
nt|jcomyn: that blooming q again|pg||
nt|jcomyn: those 3-card trick men must be all  bridge players|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: and 2D is?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jbgood: playing S for the @d queen is slightly against the odds, since you can deal with Q to 4 with N, not so easy with S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: unusual convention jon|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||
nt|jbgood: it looks like it was meant to be an intermediate 2 with 5-6 diamonds...|pg||
