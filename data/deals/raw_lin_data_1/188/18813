nt|timmy5:  now declarer is forced to find the diamond queen to protect king of hearts|pg||
pc|s8|nt|gavin:  if you have unlimited entries|pg||
nt|dilipgidwa: experts hate to lead from unsupported 4 card suits |pg||
pc|s4|nt|gavin:  the best way to play the suit|pg||
nt|gavin:  is to lead low to the queen|pg||
nt|gavin:  its better than playing the Jack in case south has singleton king|pg||
nt|gavin:  so she will be evaluating if she can afford to do so|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|c4|nt|dilipgidwa: hence no @h lead |pg||
pc|s9|pc|c2|pg||

nt|gavin:  in order to come to 9 tricks she needs 3@S 1@H 3@D and 2@C|pg||
nt|gavin:  she still doesnt know how many @H tricks|pg||
nt|wygbe1: club is good shift, may need to lead h after winning second club and before leading spade|pg||

nt|wygbe1: winning the h and playing back the nine, as spec points out, may have beaten this|pg||

nt|gavin:  in a normal 2/1 style|pg||

mb|4S|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gavin:  a lot of pairs play 2NT as a limit raise in @H here|pg||

nt|timmy5:  this can still make if declarer finds the queen of clubs|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|gavin:  east is considering throwing away a diamond here to avoid being shortened|pg||
nt|gavin:  it looks obvious to ruff but with the preempt over her a bad trump break very possible|pg||
nt|gavin:  when thinking about it, she must assume they will continue leading spades (if trumps are breaking badly)|pg||
nt|gavin:  and figure out if she can handle a 5-0 split|pg||

mb|1H|nt|newmoon: wlc  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin:  west's distribution makes her hand a comfortable texas transfer|pg||
mb|2N|nt|gavin:  when agreeing to play texas transfers its important to discuss whether you play them in competition|pg||
nt|gavin:  and when the bids cease to be texas|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin:  I'm a fan of using texas over 1NT (3D)|pg||
nt|gavin:  or even 3H|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|gavin:  but its commonly played only up until a 3C overcall|pg||
nt|gavin:  when both bids are jumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: not enough to explore for slam, so looking for best game|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: in MPs, it may be right to go back to @Hs by North|pg||
nt|tec123: a club partial will be a good stop here, but South may try again over a 3C raise|pg||
pc|c2|nt|gavin:  this contract had its chances but we can see the club finesse is offside (rather expected)|pg||
nt|gavin:  but still can be a good sacrifice|pg||
nt|gavin:  4S can go down|pg||
nt|gavin:  by leading a diamond and using the ace of hearts entry to get a ruff|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cT|nt|newmoon: a normal @C-lead gives the overtrick|pg||

nt|gavin:  the other hand was dummy in the other room and north holding two aces lead their singleton Q|pg||
nt|gavin:  more difficult when west is dummy|pg||
nt|gavin:  as T, J, Q, A doesnt really expose norths singleton|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|nt|gavin:  north isnt strong enough for a competative 2/1 bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin:  this is always an uncomfortable spot because souh will never really find out that north has 5@H|pg||
nt|newmoon: pity... I have to leave in 10 to run my bridge club   :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin:  a reopening double will earn a 2NT bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: we play negative free bids for hearts, but jtxxx?|pg||
nt|newmoon: Welcome to Tim Cope from Cape Town  :)|pg||
nt|newmoon: dble = support dble = 3@Ss|pg||
pc|h6|nt|gavin:  this auction shows "a hand not strong enough to bid a direct 2@H"|pg||
nt|newmoon: these matches last 20 boards...|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|newmoon: hmmm "does 4@H make"  Bosie muses...|pg||
nt|newmoon: 3@S = 5x@S    using The Law|pg||
nt|newmoon: with 4, he passes, or something else|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: Sorry to be late. Internet trouble...|pg||
nt|newmoon: still... one over The Law... but 5x indicated|pg||
pc|hA|nt|gavin:  would typically have more hearts|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|wygbe1: fearless 3h bid - can make by guessing h suit|pg||
nt|gavin:  but sprung hits a bullseye|pg||
nt|tec123: Can go down on a club lead in 4@H|pg||
nt|newmoon: good stop, and event 2NT is precarious|pg||
nt|newmoon: even not "event"|pg||
nt|newmoon: the "t" was silent|pg||
pc|sK|nt|gavin:  right will surely lose 1@S and 2@D, need to avoid 2 trump losers|pg||
nt|gavin:  and the two ways to play the suit to avoid 2 losers|pg||
nt|gavin:  are if you think the layout is as it lies with east having honor doubeton|pg||
nt|gavin:  you lead the jack of hearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: ladies talking, bridge stuff|pg||
nt|gavin:  now if east doesnt cover the ace will drop the king|pg||
nt|gavin:  if east does cover then you win the ace and lead towards the ten|pg||
nt|gavin:  however that would not work if east has Q9x and west has Kx|pg||
nt|gavin:  as east would not cover with Q9x and have a sure trick later|pg||
pc|s9|nt|tec123: I think he will struggle without help to find the 8th trick as there is no entry to dummy for the @H finesse|pg||
nt|newmoon: I am lost with this bidding...  conventional meanings|pg||
pc|s6|nt|gavin:  so if you think the hearts are reversed|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|nt|tec123: This will be a good slam to bid, making when there is only 1 possible heart loser and all the clubs disappear on the AK @D and the established 5th @D|pg||
nt|newmoon: 6@H available here - even on @C lead - he has to smother @H10 dbleton on his right|pg||
nt|newmoon: on North's left, i.e.|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|newmoon: in -practice, @C-lead is difficult to find against 6@H|pg||
nt|newmoon: hmmm   Donde could make +1 |pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dK|nt|newmoon: Egypt beat SA yesterday - we saw it all on VUgraph - here is the transcript:  http://www.sabf.co.za/tunisia/bb1.htm|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|gavin:  you must begin the suit by leading low from Axx|pg||
nt|newmoon: @CA intact, @Ds blocked...  exit a diamond now|pg||
nt|newmoon: in the fullness of time, the @C9 makes!|pg||
nt|newmoon: GIB says "-1"   we see...|pg||
nt|newmoon: Donde will want to make all his trumps separately.|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|gavin:  then if west has Honor doubleton they can fly up|pg||
nt|gavin:  but now you can finesse east|pg||
nt|gavin:  and if they dont fly their honor will drop under the ace|pg||
nt|wygbe1: moment of truth coming up - knows w has 5s, so might play w for the shortness|pg||
nt|tec123: Now declarer must win the spade in hand, cash 2 top hearts hoping the Q drops, and when it does not set about serring up the diamond suit for three club discards|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d9|pc|d8|pc|s8|pg||
nt|gavin:  leading the jack has the added bonus of being able to pick up KQx in east and 9x with west|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h8|pc|h2|nt|newmoon: kib said:  "egypt player play a system called gandofli and 1 @d opening means 11-22 pts and no 4 cards in @s or 4 cards in @h"|pg||
nt|newmoon: if West cannot play trumps, Sadek not happy|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: ????????????????????????|pg||
nt|gavin:  well that wasnt one of my options|pg||
nt|gavin:  if that was the plan then better to lead low from the table|pg||

mb|p|nt|newmoon: hot off the press:   http://www.sabf.co.za/tunisia/results/bulletin4.pdf|pg||
nt|newmoon: 2 Mb file (with some photos)|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin:  south could decide to overcall 1NT or double , I like double much better|pg||
nt|gavin:  since their partner is a passed hand the likely hood of game in NT isnt great|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: i said 1nt recently, paid with my life almost :)|pg||
nt|gavin:  as a passed hand sprung has a max|pg||
nt|wygbe1: i agree, with the dblton diamond - with 3 or more diamonds, it is closer to a nt overcall|pg||
nt|newmoon: n/s have the luxury of bidding space now|pg||
nt|tec123: I agree discoount k@H,for offense but too much defense for 3@D as the K@H rates to work there|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|newmoon: lead helps to give declarer THEE @S-tricks|pg||
pc|h3|nt|tec123: With the spade suit effectively cut off, declarer can male with 2 spades 4 red suit tricks and either a club or a long diamond|pg||

pc|c6|nt|tec123: Bibitzer sounds more fun (from the Latin bibo bibere meaning to drink which is always fun)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|gavin:  then were down 55 imps at one point in the semi finals of the USA 2 bracket|pg||
nt|tec123: Egypt picked up a deserved 9 iimps when our boys tries a poor game on board 6 (3N down 2)|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|newmoon: 3rd seat 1@S or 2@S (5-4) ?|pg||
mb|d|mb|2S|nt|tec123: I agree, After 1@H P 1N I like to use 2@S as any GF and 3of a suit as 4/4 Invitational, but that problem has disappeared now|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: he went 2@S... I am more conservative, in 5th seat, vul|pg||
nt|newmoon: 4th seat|pg||
nt|tec123: I would open a weak 2@S at these colours in 3rd seat opposite a passed partner|pg||
nt|newmoon: yes, esp at white v/s red|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|3S|nt|Vugraphzfk: other room says 2s -1|pg||
nt|newmoon: in SA, we use the phrase "at these colours"|pg||
nt|newmoon: meaning at "favourable" or non-vul/vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|tec123: 3@D should show a good hand if playing Good/Bad 2NT as we would compete with 2N with same shape and less points|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|newmoon: hehehe  5@C now?|pg||
nt|newmoon: no?   wow|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: 2@S a bit risky here, as West can still be 17-18 and if he has KJx @S, an easy 500 pickup|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|tec123: Presumably 1N was forcing and 2@C was better minor - South has now bid 2@S in a situation where the opposition have already passed a lot of information.|pg||
nt|newmoon: East lets 2@S off the hook|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|nt|vugraphzhc: Sorry, trouble with the Internet connexion...|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
pc|c9|nt|newmoon: this is the kind of board where anything is possible in OR.   |pg||
nt|tec123: I would bid 5@C - this one has chances as North is going to be endplayed after 3 trumps and a @H exit|pg||
nt|tec123: Good pass by North - using the Law's adage of "Eight Never, Nine Ever" knowing that their spade fit will be only eight cards|pg||
nt|newmoon: 3@H is precarious|pg||
pc|c8|nt|tec123: 5 top losers, and a possible diamond to worry about, though the lead may help with that|pg||
nt|newmoon: has to put in the @S10, and thereafter leave @Ss alone|pg||

mb|p|nt|newmoon: yes.... and 7@C|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|pc|c9|pc|c5|pg||
nt|gavin:  now there is a risk of your opponents bidding 3NT having never got your heart lead|pg||
nt|glensa: well done|pg||
pc|s2|nt|gavin:  the risk of overcalling is quite large the 2nd time around|pg||
nt|gavin:  as n-s havent found a fit|pg||
nt|gavin:  and now norths double would be penalty|pg||
nt|newmoon: 3NT reached in OR also, lead = @S7|pg||
pc|s3|nt|newmoon: 7@C - no finessing - ruff a spade in West after getting pitches on @Hs|pg||
pc|sK|nt|gavin:  hard to argue with either of wests passes|pg||
nt|tec123: I think East would have done better to take over with 4N after 4@C - will be difficult yo bid 7 if West in charge of Blackwood|pg||
pc|sA|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|hT|nt|tec123: May get there now as Blackwood transferred back :)|pg||

nt|glensa: i think on this auction a double by south of 3d should show a better hand|pg||
pc|s5|nt|gavin:  here is a good example of declarer being able to take advantage of defensive carding|pg||
nt|gavin:  there is no way that west would lie about her club count |pg||
nt|newmoon: 4NT now... sets @C the suit... can now get info regarding @CQ|pg||
pc|s7|nt|gavin:  so south can assume clubs are 4-2 (west high lowed to show an even  )|pg||
nt|gavin:  interesting that she rose ace of diamonds, seems like she wants to be in dummy to either lead trumps or high clubs|pg||
pc|sT|nt|gavin:  ahh mor like it|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|tec123: My choice would be a @H as well - I tend to attacke againt 3NT, but would lead a @S against 1N say where defense can take their time to look for tricks|pg||
pc|c3|nt|newmoon: wow, well done!|pg||
nt|newmoon: 5@S = 2 keys + @CQ|pg||
nt|tec123: Will need to protect against 4/1 clubs, so best to ruff two diamonds before drawing all the trumps|pg||
nt|newmoon: bd 9:  apteker (South) went 3@C - wjs - after North opens 1@H|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cT|nt|Vugraphzfk: took it back|pg||

nt|gavin:  at some point in the trump drawing process|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: definitely played 10|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|gavin:  the Ten ensures a 4th round diamond entry if they break 3-2|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|tec123: Paretner asks you to choose between @H & @D so you choose @S - may worry West|pg||
nt|newmoon: bd 9, loss to SA of 3 IMPs (or 5)     playing still in 4@C by South in OR|pg||
nt|glensa: should be a routine 3nt|pg||
mb|1C|nt|wygbe1: are ns playing polish 2 bids?|pg||
nt|newmoon: and Taymour El Henawy (Egypt) has just joined him as commentator|pg||
nt|tec123: Close to a cue bid raise - 9 pts and a probable working doubleton, but 2@S will keep them out of trouble|pg||
nt|newmoon: 2 soft Js in his raise... I like 2@S|pg||
nt|tec123: agreed|pg||
nt|newmoon: AJx, xxx, KJx, 10xxx  = 2@D raise  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|tec123: That looks wrong...maybe 3@C|pg||
nt|glensa: 6 diamonds has a play, but is a bad contract on a spade lead.|pg||

mb|p|nt|newmoon: sensible jump by Bosie to shut out the bidding|pg||

nt|tec123: might be some blood now|pg||
nt|newmoon: remember 1@D denied 4-card major.  So 3@H must be longer @Cs?|pg||
nt|tec123: True, but a simple t/out dbl would have been lower and carried a similar message|pg||
nt|newmoon: if it COULD be, North must pass the x, and South will 4@C|pg||
nt|newmoon: yes, of course, a t/o of 2@S|pg||
nt|newmoon: or even 2NT|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|gavin:  so with 5 boards to play the 84 imp lead will be enough for Joel to capture the 2nd USA birth in the Venice Cup|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: no|pg||
nt|tec123: Declarer can be held to 4 trump tricks and 2 clubs on best defense|pg||

nt|newmoon: what has West got that he hasn't already shown?|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|tec123: Agreed, but always worth taking some time to ensure that you are passing a Penalty double - probably discussion over some bids meaning|pg||
