mb|p|nt|mamos: EW have no need to regret giving in to Diamonds  they could make nothing|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|sunsamvar: hi Hans|pg||
nt|mamos: Ns will bid 3NT   in any language|pg||
nt|jcomyn: agreed but they didnt look as if they would find a major fit|pg||
nt|yke:  W should have played low and East should have throw the K under spade Ace, not that easy|pg||
nt|jcomyn: gee here we go again with ultra-light opening|pg||
nt|yke:  but it's only for an overtrick|pg||
nt|jcomyn: how many clubs|pg||
nt|yke:  nice hand :) |pg||
mb|3N|nt|jcomyn: i like that|pg||
nt|yke:  I don't like 3NT, with a void|pg||
nt|jcomyn: banking on a d leade|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Rather easy boards to start with here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|grebrof: 3@s is not an underbid|pg||
nt|jcomyn: especially vul very aggressive stuff|pg||
nt|jcomyn: NOOOOO|pg||
pc|sK|nt|danilo1: Double -dummy 3NT ... but guess would not find @DK|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sunsamvar: will they get to 6 here ?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  If so - 6 @H D is free for 1100|pg||
nt|hawe45:  7 the 1400 and 1 IMP|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Difficult to find out, how bad slam is|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mamos: defence to 4@h not trivial|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|grebrof: playing 4@s wouldnt be either|pg||
nt|grebrof: missing the AK of trumps, not always fun|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well ca ruff and h ak|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes|pg||
nt|jcomyn: see the one earlier missing ak of trumps slam|pg||
nt|mamos: S probably has to rise with @hA  and play Club|pg||
nt|grebrof: I actually played 6@hs with single A vs my Ps single K|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|eamongall: good afternoon |pg||
pc|s2|nt|jcomyn: cue bidding no doubt|pg||
nt|grebrof: you know - the multi|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Team NONACO might be M-onaco|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: hello|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|yke:  what about double with the East hand? I think one of them will run|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mamos: yes the Slam missing AK of trumps was the result of RKCB and a 5@s response which pinpointed two missing KC when the agreed suit was @h|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: It is, sry for that|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Z = Zimmermann...|pg||
nt|danilo1: mini NT ... North is still not giving up slam ...  ... need not to go over 4NT|pg||
pc|s6|nt|grebrof: can give ruff?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: J10xx wouldnt happen to me|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|jcomyn: uses will bid this in two bids but maybe we are oldfashioned. They take 9 bids to get to the most unobvious contract u ever saw|pg||
nt|mamos: 1NT was 11-14|pg||
nt|jcomyn: looks as if the 19 ciount aint finished yet|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|nt|eamongall: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/orrleaderb.html    open teams running scores seem up |pg||
nt|yke:  but maybe to 5@C :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|grebrof: very nice|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this is a real quare one - p opens 2d multi and you have void h and 7 spades - what was my partners suit|pg||
nt|grebrof: @s|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yep. One of my many most embarassing moments|pg||
nt|eamongall: good evening kacper |pg||
nt|danilo1: well ... if South decides to open .. in nat. system, may not be so easy for North to stop ... here ... mini NT and relays should have advantage ... seems North not using them|pg||
pc|dA|pg||

nt|grebrof: my P had 6 @hs and 3 @s after my multi and jumped to 4@s - what was my suit?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: big question around - who was the idiot who played in 2s+5|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thast makes things easy |pg||
pc|cK|nt|danilo1: in Open room .. 3NT made bd one ... after East's Dble ... and @H cashed ... West already exposed 5Hcp ... so @DK found|pg||

nt|grebrof: NS at 18th - EW 21|pg||

mb|2C!|mb|3C|nt|eamongall: strong NT and transfer and probably play 2@S ... or as it is 1NT |pg||
nt|jcomyn: another light opening wont work|pg||
mb|3H|nt|hawe45:  Probably in board 2, 6 @C is the best slam|pg||
nt|eamongall: personally I would attempt to play 2@S but I am not in Poznan |pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: i cannot see any way to make 4@h on this board even if the defence fail to get a Spade ruff|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i am not bidding 2c on that hand to let opps have a cheap bid|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|grebrof: 3nt doesnt make either|pg||

nt|jbgood: brekka is an imaginative player - but will have problems here|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hawe45:  North could even have hands, where 4 @S had a play - and where 1 NT was a bad spot|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jcomyn: not sure why w bids with such defence against hearts|pg||

mb|p|nt|jbgood: sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: Now there is a slim 1@S but the preemptive value ovr 1@C might make it worth it ...and being a passed hand |pg||
nt|eamongall: the combined 13 count is bullying the 27 count for now |pg||
nt|eamongall: but 4@Hs is a comfortable outcome for NS |pg||
nt|yke:  in the south hand ofcourse|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mamos:  It is easy for us oldies to look at the South hand and sneer at opening such a barren 11 count and attribute this to the failure of the Slam but all the modern experts play like ...|pg||
nt|mamos: this so must succeed |pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: what would you open John ? 1@h?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: yes|pg||

nt|jcomyn: n does not meet the 20-standard|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|nt|sunsamvar: 10 even|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|jcomyn: whatever happened to the original weak NT opening promising a top honour in 3 suits and a minor honour in the 4th|pg||
nt|danilo1: hmmm ... If North opens 1@S ... gues south would only invite ... is 2@S stronger n system?|pg||

nt|twcho: sorry, double squeezed|pg||
nt|toral5: when will east play j?frm j single or jx?|pg||
nt|toral5: looking at 10 on board|pg||
nt|toral5: especially when declarer played the king;it will be from kq or kx|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Heart lead is very good for defence removing entries from the dummy|pg||
nt|toral5: if dec has kq,@D j will cost heavily\|pg||
nt|toral5: i think @D jack return will have to be from jack stiff|pg||

pc|c6|pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
nt|cenglund:  It requires very good card-reading to make this now|pg||
nt|toral5: dummy has enough trump entries as far as @D is rightly guessed|pg||
nt|toral5: after @C ace,@D ace has to be with north for 2@C|pg||

nt|danilo1: South knows pd has @S (EW did not bid them)|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: I guess it would be unusual for a 2@S 4@S auction to tackle 5@Hs for penos unless the 4@S chap is strong balanced |pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: yea but he wont like that xx in d|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|mamos: oooohh are they on the same page??|pg||
nt|danilo1: opps .. South may now read @C as cue!!!!|pg||
mb|6C!|nt|eamongall: NS hands show the power of a couple of singletons ... especially the xxx opposite x in @Hs |pg||
nt|jbgood: and he will not know that prd has a @d ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: 6h|pg||
mb|6D!|mb|p|nt|mamos: phew|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|nt|jbgood: might go all in with the long spade suit?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: no|pg||

nt|toral5: yes.too much=11|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But South is somehow endlayed|pg||

nt|bigtrain: sorry if i missed responding to anyone's questions...  resend it if i missed you...  there was alot of activity |pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|twcho: the only lead south will not immediate suffer is a @c|pg||
nt|toral5: walter i was talking bout the previous hand|pg||
nt|toral5: say if south had bid 4c on 3h,what it wd have meant?|pg||
nt|toral5: doubt it to be natural|pg||
nt|bigtrain: art @H raise|pg||
nt|bigtrain: doesn't really help things much|pg||
nt|toral5: meaning a @C cue in favour of @H?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: artificial|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|toral5: ok|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In most systems, East must bid 3 @D now and West 3 @H|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|toral5: the last thing ew wants is a 3nt bid by west|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphpld: W didnt alert 3@d|pg||
nt|toral5: harding surely will be tested here|pg||
nt|twcho: a difficult choice for Meckstroth|pg||

pc|s9|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|s8|pc|s6|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The lost IMP is due to the @S-lead at the other table|pg||

nt|jcomyn: this rotten 4-1 break again. soon we wont play in 4-4 fits any more|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: I was told Cronier has a birthday today :)|pg||
nt|eamongall: Now we see the Germans grand slam bidding in action ... |pg||
nt|danilo1: RE ... looks like, well bid :)|pg||
nt|mamos: well done NS   not sure I admire their auction but no arguing with success   very awkward hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Let South start with some weak 2 @S...|pg||
nt|eamongall: 7@Hs is different but clearly hoping for 2 @D tricks |pg||
mb|1S|nt|jcomyn: ouch dont like 1h|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Yes, that was what I meant with unusual|pg||
mb|2H|nt|grebrof: new boats have arrived - here NS at 13th and EW at 12th|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: nice @S fit|pg||
nt|hawe45:  1 @S - not my cup of coffee|pg||
nt|danilo1: pass or 1@H ... guess question for everyone ... I prefer pass|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|grebrof: congrats from BBO to her - and also with the win yesterday|pg||
nt|eamongall: sure |pg||
nt|mamos: pass|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: yea|pg||
nt|eamongall: yes a timely non vulnerable 2@S ... or madcap 3@S would stir things up severely |pg||
mb|3H|nt|grebrof: nice stop in 3nt|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|jcomyn: some one should explain to these players you are allowed to pass now and again|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  I would prefer 2 @S (weak) on this South-hand than on the 6-4 hand, we just saw|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: you can never get ruffed in NT - as far as i know|pg||
nt|eamongall: with no interference this is just going to meat and spuds to this very strong EW |pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|mamos: well maybe 1@h a reason for this outcome  EW  seem likely to make  3NT|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This will probably be the only table to bid 7|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|nt|mamos: it might not of course |pg||
pc|h2|nt|mamos: there is an amusing symmetry about the Black suits|pg||

mb|p|nt|yke:  another slem, but about 50% with a heart lead|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|nt|grebrof: 3nt again?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Dutch De Wijs-Muller bid 7 NT|pg||
nt|yke:  well in 6@C you can try Ace of clubs in case the king is bare and then diamond finesse|pg||
mb|4N|nt|grebrof: 2@s - 3@s?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: so if you nplay in nt you are vul and in spades not vul - interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: good bid :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Very good lead this - also|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East will take the Ace - and play a @D, IÂ´m sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|danilo1: probable 1NT by South ... so will probably end in 3NT |pg||
nt|snorre: Helgemo open this hand 1NT. Brekka think it is a 18-19 NT...|pg||
pc|h8|nt|yke:  I think it is too strong fro a 15-17 NT|pg||
nt|jbgood: Kvangrtaven will regret his 3 NT now - wrongsided and a possible slam miss|pg||
nt|snorre: 3NT north isn't much better than 6@c...|pg||

pc|h2|nt|danilo1: probably -1|pg||
