mb|3N|mb|p|nt|timmy5:  if declarer finds diamond queen this will be an easy 3nt if not he will go down if Sadek leads hearts|pg||
nt|jjsb2: gaby a decide de simplifier le coup et de jouer le contrat qu'il avait envie |pg||
mb|4C|nt|dilipgidwa: hi timmy |pg||
nt|jjsb2: sans preciser ca distribution , pourquoi pas d'ailleurs |pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfk: Hi all, back finally...live from DEeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeetroit.|pg||
nt|gavin:  levins first order of business is going to be to take a diamond finesse|pg||
mb|4S|nt|wygbe1: should have 9 tricks now - 3 sp, 3 diam, 1h, 2c|pg||
nt|timmy5:  now declarer is forced to find the diamond queen to protect king of hearts|pg||
nt|jjsb2: le jeux de la carte ne pose pas de problème apparemment |pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin:  if you have unlimited entries|pg||
nt|dilipgidwa: experts hate to lead from unsupported 4 card suits |pg||
nt|jjsb2: pour une nouvelle égalité|pg||
mb|4N|nt|gavin:  the best way to play the suit|pg||
nt|gavin:  is to lead low to the queen|pg||
nt|gavin:  its better than playing the Jack in case south has singleton king|pg||
nt|gavin:  so she will be evaluating if she can afford to do so|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|dilipgidwa: hence no @h lead |pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|gavin:  things are getting a little hairy with that losing finesse|pg||
nt|gavin:  in order to come to 9 tricks she needs 3@S 1@H 3@D and 2@C|pg||
nt|gavin:  she still doesnt know how many @H tricks|pg||
nt|wygbe1: club is good shift, may need to lead h after winning second club and before leading spade|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dJ|pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|dK|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|jjsb2: on me dit qu'on peut retrouver le cotnrat en 4 4 oui certes mais l'avantage de 4@s permet d'aider un peu moins la defense egalement |pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|nt|gavin:  now north played very quickly|pg||
nt|gavin:  may have been worried their partner had KJTx of clubs|pg||
nt|gavin:  establishing clubs isnt serving a purpose with no more entries|pg||
nt|wygbe1: winning the h and playing back the nine, as spec points out, may have beaten this|pg||
nt|gavin:  now levin pretty much knows she is making|pg||
nt|wygbe1: ace and a spade now, results in 9 tricks|pg||
nt|gavin:  since the location of the KS is known|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|gavin:  you always hear people at the club saying "I open with A, K, A (West)"|pg||
nt|jjsb2: personalement je suis plus proche de 2@s ici que de 1@s choisi a l'autre table |pg||
nt|jjsb2: Jean Marc? |pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin:  its definitely not a good idea to be opening balanced hands like this|pg||
nt|gavin:  in a normal 2/1 style|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin:  west giving leeway to easts 3rd seat opening|pg||
nt|timmy5:  unfriendly diamond distribution|pg||
nt|jjsb2: meme chose a l'autre table il est tentant maintenant de dire 4@s a cause du fit 10ieme |pg||
mb|3D|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|gavin:  a lot of pairs play 2NT as a limit raise in @H here|pg||

nt|jjsb2: meme contrat donc |pg||
mb|p|nt|jmbw: oui....certains jouent ce 2@s semi-constructif :)|pg||

nt|timmy5:  this can still make if declarer finds the queen of clubs|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|d4|nt|gavin:  east is considering throwing away a diamond here to avoid being shortened|pg||
nt|gavin:  it looks obvious to ruff but with the preempt over her a bad trump break very possible|pg||
nt|gavin:  when thinking about it, she must assume they will continue leading spades (if trumps are breaking badly)|pg||
nt|gavin:  and figure out if she can handle a 5-0 split|pg||
nt|newmoon: we welcome Tim Cope's insight as we watch the play    great to have you, Tim  :)|pg||

pc|d2|nt|newmoon: hello all  :)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d3|pg||
pc|c3|nt|dilipgidwa: declarer likely to finesse east for C Q , to avoid danger hand |pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|nt|gavin:  there will be no diamond finesse on this hand, |pg||

mb|1H|nt|gavin:  when agreeing to play texas transfers its important to discuss whether you play them in competition|pg||
nt|gavin:  and when the bids cease to be texas|pg||
nt|jjsb2: un peu etonne qu'Est ne se trouve pas d'eenhcere |pg||
mb|4S|nt|gavin:  I'm a fan of using texas over 1NT (3D)|pg||
nt|gavin:  or even 3H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|gavin:  but its commonly played only up until a 3C overcall|pg||

mb|p|nt|newmoon: not enough to explore for slam, so looking for best game|pg||
pc|hK|nt|newmoon: in MPs, it may be right to go back to @Hs by North|pg||
nt|tec123: a club partial will be a good stop here, but South may try again over a 3C raise|pg||
pc|hA|nt|gavin:  this contract had its chances but we can see the club finesse is offside (rather expected)|pg||
nt|gavin:  but still can be a good sacrifice|pg||
nt|gavin:  4S can go down|pg||
nt|gavin:  by leading a diamond and using the ace of hearts entry to get a ruff|pg||
nt|jmbw: 2@s dans l'autre ligne est envisageable...|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||

mb|p|nt|gavin:  north isnt strong enough for a competative 2/1 bid|pg||
mb|3D|nt|gavin:  this is always an uncomfortable spot because souh will never really find out that north has 5@H|pg||
nt|newmoon: pity... I have to leave in 10 to run my bridge club   :(|pg||
nt|jjsb2: le probleme c'est que maintenant dire 2Sa est inquietant et on a du mal a parler .. et on a quand meme un 5-5 pour se battre un peu |pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin:  a reopening double will earn a 2NT bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: we play negative free bids for hearts, but jtxxx?|pg||
nt|newmoon: Welcome to Tim Cope from Cape Town  :)|pg||
nt|newmoon: dble = support dble = 3@Ss|pg||
nt|jjsb2: on va jouer 3@c je suppose |pg||
nt|jmbw: 3@c semble gagner|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin:  this auction shows "a hand not strong enough to bid a direct 2@H"|pg||
nt|newmoon: these matches last 20 boards...|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: hmmm "does 4@H make"  Bosie muses...|pg||
nt|newmoon: 3@S = 5x@S    using The Law|pg||
nt|newmoon: with 4, he passes, or something else|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: Sorry to be late. Internet trouble...|pg||
nt|newmoon: still... one over The Law... but 5x indicated|pg||
pc|d3|nt|gavin:  would typically have more hearts|pg||
nt|jjsb2: huh |pg||
pc|dA|nt|wygbe1: fearless 3h bid - can make by guessing h suit|pg||
nt|gavin:  but sprung hits a bullseye|pg||
nt|tec123: Can go down on a club lead in 4@H|pg||
nt|newmoon: good stop, and event 2NT is precarious|pg||
nt|newmoon: even not "event"|pg||
nt|newmoon: the "t" was silent|pg||
pc|d2|nt|gavin:  right will surely lose 1@S and 2@D, need to avoid 2 trump losers|pg||
nt|gavin:  and the two ways to play the suit to avoid 2 losers|pg||
nt|gavin:  are if you think the layout is as it lies with east having honor doubeton|pg||
nt|gavin:  you lead the jack of hearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: ladies talking, bridge stuff|pg||
nt|gavin:  now if east doesnt cover the ace will drop the king|pg||
nt|gavin:  if east does cover then you win the ace and lead towards the ten|pg||
nt|gavin:  however that would not work if east has Q9x and west has Kx|pg||
nt|gavin:  as east would not cover with Q9x and have a sure trick later|pg||
nt|jmbw: aie|pg||
nt|jjsb2: 3@c pouvait ...|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|tec123: I think he will struggle without help to find the 8th trick as there is no entry to dummy for the @H finesse|pg||
nt|newmoon: I am lost with this bidding...  conventional meanings|pg||
pc|s3|nt|gavin:  so if you think the hearts are reversed|pg||
nt|jmbw: gaby annonce en couvrantes sur la base de 5 perdantes|pg||
pc|sT|nt|jjsb2: 5@c ne peut pas ... il faut essayer de faire -1 seulement maintenant |pg||
nt|jjsb2: qui semble aussi possible d'ailleurs|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|tec123: This will be a good slam to bid, making when there is only 1 possible heart loser and all the clubs disappear on the AK @D and the established 5th @D|pg||
nt|newmoon: 6@H available here - even on @C lead - he has to smother @H10 dbleton on his right|pg||
nt|newmoon: on North's left, i.e.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jjsb2: Gaby sait que la main ne peut vraiment pas etre plus forte que ce qu'il voit au mort .. 5@c est tres exagere je trouve |pg||
nt|jmbw:  on conseille d'être assez rigoureux sur les bicolores....|pg||
pc|h9|nt|newmoon: in -practice, @C-lead is difficult to find against 6@H|pg||
nt|newmoon: hmmm   Donde could make +1 |pg||
pc|h7|pc|h8|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|newmoon: Egypt beat SA yesterday - we saw it all on VUgraph - here is the transcript:  http://www.sabf.co.za/tunisia/bb1.htm|pg||

pc|hT|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|gavin:  you must begin the suit by leading low from Axx|pg||
nt|newmoon: @CA intact, @Ds blocked...  exit a diamond now|pg||
nt|newmoon: in the fullness of time, the @C9 makes!|pg||
nt|newmoon: GIB says "-1"   we see...|pg||
nt|newmoon: Donde will want to make all his trumps separately.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|gavin:  then if west has Honor doubleton they can fly up|pg||
nt|gavin:  but now you can finesse east|pg||
nt|gavin:  and if they dont fly their honor will drop under the ace|pg||
nt|wygbe1: moment of truth coming up - knows w has 5s, so might play w for the shortness|pg||
nt|tec123: Now declarer must win the spade in hand, cash 2 top hearts hoping the Q drops, and when it does not set about serring up the diamond suit for three club discards|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|nt|gavin:  leading the jack has the added bonus of being able to pick up KQx in east and 9x with west|pg||
pc|s7|pc|h2|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|newmoon: kib said:  "egypt player play a system called gandofli and 1 @d opening means 11-22 pts and no 4 cards in @s or 4 cards in @h"|pg||

pc|d9|nt|Vugraphzfk: ????????????????????????|pg||

nt|newmoon: 2 Mb file (with some photos)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|gavin:  south could decide to overcall 1NT or double , I like double much better|pg||
nt|gavin:  since their partner is a passed hand the likely hood of game in NT isnt great|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: i said 1nt recently, paid with my life almost :)|pg||
nt|gavin:  as a passed hand sprung has a max|pg||
nt|wygbe1: i agree, with the dblton diamond - with 3 or more diamonds, it is closer to a nt overcall|pg||
nt|newmoon: n/s have the luxury of bidding space now|pg||
nt|tec123: I agree discoount k@H,for offense but too much defense for 3@D as the K@H rates to work there|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfk: other room says 2s -1|pg||
nt|newmoon: in SA, we use the phrase "at these colours"|pg||
nt|newmoon: meaning at "favourable" or non-vul/vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|tec123: 3@D should show a good hand if playing Good/Bad 2NT as we would compete with 2N with same shape and less points|pg||

pc|h2|nt|newmoon: hehehe  5@C now?|pg||

pc|hA|nt|newmoon: 2@S a bit risky here, as West can still be 17-18 and if he has KJx @S, an easy 500 pickup|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|tec123: Presumably 1N was forcing and 2@C was better minor - South has now bid 2@S in a situation where the opposition have already passed a lot of information.|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h3|nt|vugraphzhc: Sorry, trouble with the Internet connexion...|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|newmoon: this is the kind of board where anything is possible in OR.   |pg||
nt|tec123: I would bid 5@C - this one has chances as North is going to be endplayed after 3 trumps and a @H exit|pg||
nt|tec123: Good pass by North - using the Law's adage of "Eight Never, Nine Ever" knowing that their spade fit will be only eight cards|pg||
nt|newmoon: 3@H is precarious|pg||
pc|c2|nt|tec123: 5 top losers, and a possible diamond to worry about, though the lead may help with that|pg||
nt|newmoon: has to put in the @S10, and thereafter leave @Ss alone|pg||

nt|gavin:  there is no way that west would lie about her club count |pg||
nt|newmoon: 4NT now... sets @C the suit... can now get info regarding @CQ|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|gavin:  so south can assume clubs are 4-2 (west high lowed to show an even  )|pg||
nt|gavin:  interesting that she rose ace of diamonds, seems like she wants to be in dummy to either lead trumps or high clubs|pg||
nt|jjsb: oui .. pas mon style mais en 3ieme on peut tout faire je suppose |pg||
pc|s7|nt|gavin:  ahh mor like it|pg||
pc|s2|nt|tec123: My choice would be a @H as well - I tend to attacke againt 3NT, but would lead a @S against 1N say where defense can take their time to look for tricks|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|newmoon: wow, well done!|pg||
nt|newmoon: 5@S = 2 keys + @CQ|pg||
nt|tec123: Will need to protect against 4/1 clubs, so best to ruff two diamonds before drawing all the trumps|pg||
nt|newmoon: bd 9:  apteker (South) went 3@C - wjs - after North opens 1@H|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Vugraphzfk: took it back|pg||
nt|gavin:  not sure I like unblocking the Ten, EW are going to get their hearts in|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfk: definitely played 10|pg||
nt|jjsb: encore 1IMP pour les Egyptiens a priori |pg||
pc|h3|nt|gavin:  the Ten ensures a 4th round diamond entry if they break 3-2|pg||
nt|gavin:  but its a purposeless entry once the opponents play hearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: just checking my brain :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|wygbe1: are ns playing polish 2 bids?|pg||
nt|newmoon: and Taymour El Henawy (Egypt) has just joined him as commentator|pg||
nt|tec123: Close to a cue bid raise - 9 pts and a probable working doubleton, but 2@S will keep them out of trouble|pg||
nt|newmoon: 2 soft Js in his raise... I like 2@S|pg||
nt|tec123: agreed|pg||
nt|newmoon: AJx, xxx, KJx, 10xxx  = 2@D raise  :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|tec123: That looks wrong...maybe 3@C|pg||

mb|3N|nt|newmoon: sensible jump by Bosie to shut out the bidding|pg||
nt|newmoon: ignore me|pg||
nt|tec123: might be some blood now|pg||
nt|newmoon: remember 1@D denied 4-card major.  So 3@H must be longer @Cs?|pg||
nt|tec123: True, but a simple t/out dbl would have been lower and carried a similar message|pg||
nt|newmoon: if it COULD be, North must pass the x, and South will 4@C|pg||
nt|newmoon: yes, of course, a t/o of 2@S|pg||
nt|newmoon: or even 2NT|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfk: no|pg||
nt|tec123: Declarer can be held to 4 trump tricks and 2 clubs on best defense|pg||
nt|newmoon: easy pickup of 12 IMPs in that case, if West passes now|pg||
nt|newmoon: what has West got that he hasn't already shown?|pg||
nt|jjsb: il y aura apparemment une donne qui ira en arbitrage a l'autre table le resultat ne sera donc pas definitif (juste pour info) |pg||
mb|p|pc|cT|nt|tec123: Agreed, but always worth taking some time to ensure that you are passing a Penalty double - probably discussion over some bids meaning|pg||

pc|d4|nt|tec123: One might Dbl 6@H to ensure @S lead|pg||

nt|newmoon: Mostafa - why didn't South open 2@D, I am asked|pg||
nt|newmoon: not with 4 cards @h  one says;   Mostafa says 2@D may be weaker|pg||
nt|glensa: the same 3d contract will be reached|pg||

nt|jjsb: vraiment tres difficile comme main |pg||
mb|p|nt|tec123: 3@S is a transfer to 3N (as they play 3N as both minors|pg||
nt|newmoon: good interaction between kibs and panel.   If u see +++ in profile by commentators, that means you CAN chat to person|pg||
nt|tec123: Much discussion on whether to open a weak 2 with a side 4 card major - I do , but you need a system where is pard is good enough to proceed you can show the 4 card major so a fit ...|pg||
nt|tec123: is not lost|pg||
nt|jjsb: a l'autre table on a ouvert de 2@c |pg||
mb|p|nt|glensa: Wow! what a choice of opening bids|pg||
nt|glensa: I cannot say enough bad things about the 1nt bid. Partner transfer to clubs, yech, opponents compete and partner doubles yech|pg||
pc|cA|nt|glensa: in the old days, east could have checked for a 4-4 heart fit and reached a decent game (just reverse west's hearts and spades)|pg||

nt|newmoon: helloooooooo, what is happening, Operator?|pg||
nt|newmoon: Bathroom break?|pg||
nt|tec123: Its tough - he can pass, bid 3H or 3N - if partner has made a shaped double this could be tight, but any cards pard has are likely to be lying well, so pass looks right at these ...|pg||

nt|glensa: I prefer a 4club opening showing a strong 4h hand myself, but 1 heart is certainly not wrong|pg||

pc|h8|nt|newmoon: yes, OR made 5@C.  South led her stiff @D (holding a stiff trump), North won trump ace tr 2 and returned a @D but no ruff...  @Ds came in for @H discards|pg||
pc|s3|pc|hQ|nt|newmoon: lead was @CQ... a lead from Q-J certainly denies holding of @DA-K, right?|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|d2|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|mb|3S|mb|4H|nt|tec123: With spades 4-4 and club right 3N can make EW - 5@C down as @H finesse loses|pg||
nt|newmoon: A-K-J-10 7th is solid?   today it is, with Qx dropping!    LOL|pg||
nt|jjsb: P P 1@d x P and..  i guess actualy not much choice and u have to bid 1@s |pg||
mb|p|nt|jjsb: oh ok .. see patrice like to overcall solid....|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: in OR, EAST opens 1@H.  They settle in 4@H|pg||
nt|tec123: With 2 quick tricks East should pass rather than bale out to 4@C despite lack of @S stopper - potentially a very good result for Tunisia|pg||
nt|glensa: this might end the auction|pg||
nt|jjsb: can we considere that "solid"?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jjsb: i am a doubler Glen , am i wrong?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|glensa: that is defintely solid|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sT|pc|s2|pg||
nt|glensa: I am with Patrice on this one. I don't much value the q of diamonds, and don't want to play a 4-3 spade fit|pg||
nt|jjsb: good point |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|newmoon: an ace is the std. lead against a gambling 3NT... gets encouragement|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|vugraphzhc: Sorry trouble with connexion...|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|newmoon: West made a "state of the match" bid... knows that up to now, they have had a good session in this room|pg||
nt|tec123: 4@H should make as well though as @H are 3-3 and the same club suit is equally useful|pg||
nt|newmoon: and, in 3rd seat, at these colours (favourable) 3NT is very descriptive|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|h2|nt|newmoon: Tim - I expected more swingy boards - something like the set you had against the Italians in the quarters of the BB some 4 years ago(?) where 3 slam swings won the match|pg||
nt|tec123: The 4-3 fit will play well here though I would have chosen 3@C rather than 2@S as the 1@H bid rather than double denied spades|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h5|nt|tec123: Maybe 19 & 20 will be swingy - still not a flat match as 66 IMPs have changed hands already|pg||
pc|s8|pc|hK|pc|h9|pg||
nt|jjsb: ok so just made it will be as far as i see |pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|d3|pc|cT|pg||
nt|glensa: this is ping pong play and defense. Donde asked for a spade, got a diamond, which Patrice should have discarded a spade on|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|pc|h6|pc|c9|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|newmoon: a lucky make here as South and not North has the dbleton @C|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|pc|d2|pg||
nt|glensa: this should be just in, another good result for egypt as ns can make 2s|pg||
pc|d9|nt|tec123: running the 81S would have worked better, but with N having J@S this will still come home|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|nt|newmoon: both rooms are playing fast now... seems that there was a time warning.   Both operators couldn't keep up with play|pg||
nt|newmoon: as we said before 1@h maybe with 4 cards and 1@s relay|pg||
nt|newmoon: Mostafa is back|pg||
mb|p|nt|glensa: the spade split is very rude for declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: and yes, Tim, bd 16 could have been a wash in 3@Dx both rooms.    Really, was that a 3@D bid, vul, 1st seat?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jjsb: surprised she did not opeen 1nt as they are playing that weak vulnerable ... |pg||
pc|h9|nt|jjsb: they migth change ?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jjsb: well ok maybe they changed... |pg||
pc|c4|nt|tec123: In the modern style (Every hand an Adventure and bid whenever you can) it was a 3@D opener|pg||

nt|glensa: 2nt must be conventional|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|newmoon: in OR, South 1NT, North 3NT, swish|pg||
nt|tec123: A spade lead can beat 3N provided E snatches his aces when a minor suit is played|pg||
pc|s3|nt|newmoon: possible dble-swing now.   200 here + 100 from OR = 300 = 7 IMPs to Tunisia             provided they get 3@H here -2|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jjsb: we are french .. so i guess we are not "used" to that 3card fit ... i like also 2@s here |pg||

mb|p|nt|glensa: 1 club is any blcd hand not in 14-16 range, 1 spade is no four card major, less than 11|pg||
mb|2C|nt|tec123: A daring 6H contract making when @D are 3-3 and @H 2-2 ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|tec123: 4@S possible here (on spade finesse) - will it be bid?|pg||

pc|hK|pc|hJ|pc|h7|nt|tec123: After only bidding 1@S over 2@H a splinter to 4@C may have got them there|pg||
