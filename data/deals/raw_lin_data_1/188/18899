nt|STRIK3R: N/S can make 3@h and E/W can make 3@d, but need accurate play to make 3@H I think|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|kirp:  3@H looks ambitious on 43|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 1@d was suction|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: @H or @s and @c|pg||
mb|4S|nt|oosmanb: 3@D probably for EW|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 3@h might be tricky|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: this 2@D is a new species, at least for me|pg||

mb|2C!|mb|d|nt|fabsayc: hardly recommended but brown would have done well to balance with double|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d6|mc|10|nt|ralfwil: not the best defence. Either a @d lead or continue with @s|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 4nt?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: first slam 6@d or 6@c|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i dont like double|pg||

nt|STRIK3R: 1@s from north show 3-5 @s's they open 1@c with weak hands with 5-5 in @c and @s|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|oosmanb: Fun hand now|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|kirp:  3@H by NS should be the limit, not successfully either|pg||

nt|oosmanb: has put an upper limit I think|pg||
nt|kirp:  gives W a problem, tho' strong@C system helps|pg||
nt|kirp:  W knows NS have 8+@Hs ,|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|STRIK3R: 8@hs I would say, x from east should show 4@h?|pg||

mb|p|nt|oosmanb: I doubt it, so NS would do well to stop below game|pg||
mb|d|nt|fabsayc: 61% for NS on board 6, nobody made 3@C|pg||
nt|oosmanb: but with a 10 card fit, vulnerable, can Fjaelberg put the brakes on |pg||
nt|kirp:  4@H can make if W does not switch to @S when in with the A@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: How? even if @C are stripped East has 4th @d to exit?|pg||
nt|kirp:  8@S|pg||

mb|p|nt|oosmanb: Well spotted Martin|pg||
