nt|Walddk2: This is pretty expensive on best defence|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Looks like 800-1100 to me|pg||

nt|paulg:  exciting hand, nice that South gets to open the good hand for a change|pg||
nt|paulg:  i guess 23.5 |pg||

nt|paulg:  it is certainly a hand for a strong club system|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|mareczek: 3@h transfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  with such great controls, even opposite 0-7, it must be tempting to break the transfer to 4@d to show a second suit|pg||
pc|s3|nt|pelu: same contract all over - Pony M took 12 tricks - but 11 is normal|pg||

nt|mareczek: we will see how many pairs will not use Blackwood or any other kay-checking method|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|3S!|mb|p|nt|pelu: so far only 1 pairs (McGann-Brown) in 6@Hx -1|pg||
nt|paulg:  that is one way to flatten the round ... make 13 tricks on first board when most are making 11, and then bid slam missing the ace & king of trumps|pg||
nt|pelu: also Cronier-Zimmermann|pg||
nt|paulg:  despite the singleton opposite @sAK, North does have a powerful hand|pg||
