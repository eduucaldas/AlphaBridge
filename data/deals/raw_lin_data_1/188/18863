mb|2N|nt|twcho: she doesn't know that west hand is so wild|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: test of methods here for EW|pg||

nt|fabsayc: dont think so|pg||

mb|6C|mb|p|nt|twcho: partner has shown slam interest and you have 5 cards in both her suits|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|twcho: judging from these few bds, we can see that west is a very aggressive player|pg||

nt|twcho: I think declarer better plays the @dJ or 9 instead of the 6 at 1st trick|pg||
nt|twcho: this likely clarify which defender holds the @d Q|pg||
nt|twcho: and he may opt for the other route to reach his 10th trick instead of resorting on 33 @h break|pg||
nt|twcho: another wild hand|pg||
nt|twcho: south 8410 and north 6520|pg||
nt|twcho: hard to predict the final contract here|pg||
nt|twcho: anything can happen|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ups:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzej: claim loose club|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|twcho: it seems to me the 2NT is NF so the raise to game by east is a bit aggressive|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: so 4@d is middle of the road action imo|pg||
nt|twcho: east will probably balanced with 4@h|pg||
nt|rodal f: An ugly one for NS|pg||
mb|2C|nt|twcho: but anyway, east did a good job of shifting to @s to hold declarer to 9 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: ok, north add one more|pg||
mb|2D|nt|vugraphzej: if 7@Dx E lead club :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: but one should be more courageous in bidding game especially when vulnerable as the imp scale definitely favors it|pg||
nt|twcho: so buy the contract cheaply|pg||
mb|2H|nt|twcho: 1N is 14-16|pg||
nt|twcho: can have 5M or 6m|pg||
nt|twcho: as @h10 will win the trick, it all depends on how declarer play the @c suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|twcho: the only way to make here is ruffing finesse in @c|pg||
mb|3N|nt|twcho: if he opts to finesse west, he will be rewarded with an overtrick as the card lies while if he chooses the other way round, he may well go down|pg||
nt|twcho: so again the prize went to the bold bidder|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: but it will fail |pg||
nt|twcho: and west will return his trump|pg||
nt|twcho: south can settle for only one down by ruffing this card|pg||
nt|twcho: but if he wants to make his game, he has to finesse|pg||
nt|rodal f: EW at an interesting fight here. I @S give a trick it's OK. Else it's NS at @C|pg||
nt|rodal f: And gere we go?|pg||
nt|rodal f: My opening would have been 3@D|pg||
nt|rodal f: Even with those 4 @Ss|pg||
mb|5D|nt|twcho: With the lucky lie of red cards and @s not running for defenders, 3NT will roll home easily|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: *If @S give one trick..... Sr|pg||

pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|nt|twcho: so there are two alternative lines for declarer|pg||
nt|twcho: trying the @c finesse or test @h for 33|pg||
nt|twcho: so probably he can test @h first and then finesse in @c|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s7|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|nt|twcho: he doesn't know defenders' @s is not running|pg||
pc|h6|nt|vugraphzej: E play 3 @S :(|pg||
nt|twcho: looks like better to me to test @h before @c finesse|pg||
nt|twcho: both I and our excellent operator, Chayes are biased, but to different sides. :)|pg||
nt|twcho: so probably the play has finished.|pg||
nt|twcho: 9 tricks I supposed, right?|pg||
nt|vugraphzej: +1|pg||
nt|twcho: so he decided that it is quite impossible for east not rising with @cA if he has it|pg||

nt|twcho: if this is not alerted on his side|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|nt|twcho: I shd say this is unlucky|pg||
pc|sK|nt|twcho: given the @s lead, declarer will probably go down because the normal play in @h will yield two tricks for the defenders and it is difficult for declarer to come to 9 tricks before ...|pg||
nt|twcho: defenders get their 5 tricks|pg||
pc|s2|pg||

nt|twcho: so it actually depends on their agreement but this is not shown in their CC|pg||
nt|twcho: unfavorable for the Sinagpore pair because Director will rule against them then|pg||

mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|twcho: any method for them to show M two suiters|pg||

nt|twcho: a better line perhaps|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d8|nt|petergill: Perhaps South should bid 3@C over 2@C, as @H can conveniently be bid later when EW bid @D, the suit they seem (to S) to have|pg||

nt|twcho: he is certainly under pressure|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||
nt|petergill: When E discards on @C, West can count that South has 6 clubs, thus only 5 @h, so shortening S's hearts is good defence|pg||

mb|3C|nt|twcho: this must be a flat bd|pg||

nt|rodal f: 14 -03 is better if minor comes as the quest.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dQ|pc|d5|nt|twcho: since east didn't call director for bd 10, Singapore has secured the 10 imps for that one|pg||

nt|rodal f: Missed the QXX@D at W and 800 for a payout|pg||
nt|petergill: Perhaps declarer, after winning @DA at Trick 2, should have played a heart. |pg||
mb|1D!|nt|twcho: and they played prepared club|pg||
nt|twcho: so he can't open 1@d with only 3 cards|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|twcho: west can double or make a 2@h jump imo|pg||
nt|twcho: 1@h is not ideal|pg||
nt|twcho: so both N opt to open 1@h instead of a strong 2 opening|pg||
nt|twcho: and this makes the slam bidding easier|pg||

nt|twcho: 3@d looks like a cue bid|pg||
nt|twcho: the match is really tight. Only 4 imps difference|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: so kind Tommy, that was just abysmal, all kibs agree|pg||
nt|fabsayc: double fitters are very hard indeed since values can be minimal|pg||
mb|2N|an|alert|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: for me 3@S would have been splinter bid, then north hand is terrible|pg||
mb|3H|nt|kiwibridge: it seemed like an I don't know what to do bid|pg||
nt|twcho: yes, probably that's how north construe the 3@s bid and decide to signoff|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: in the good old days, the idea was to bid longest first|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|twcho: 2@d looks like showing both M|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: modern fixation on the 4 card major before the long minor is ruining many auctions|pg||
nt|twcho: and 2NT asking which longer|pg||
pc|cA|nt|twcho: and north bids the stronger suit|pg||
nt|twcho: with such strong hand, south of course happily go to game|pg||

nt|vugraphzej: claim -2 but W said K drop :)|pg||
nt|twcho: :)|pg||
nt|twcho: tks for the information|pg||
nt|rodal f: B11 EW played 2@S+3      OR play 3@D at S.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|petergill: thanks to useful @d9 in dummy|pg||
nt|twcho: still if trumps 22, it is highly playable|pg||
nt|twcho: please tell us more for the table action|pg||
nt|twcho: we will be interested in it|pg||
nt|vugraphzej: :)|pg||
nt|petergill: which is basically how she played 6@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2C!|an|2 majors|nt|twcho: but with trumps not breaking and double finesse in @d off, chance are slim unless there are some defensive slips|pg||
nt|petergill: majors|pg||
mb|d|mb|2H|nt|petergill: Most experts nowadays open East's hand 1@C, liking the good club suit and two tens|pg||
nt|twcho: agree|pg||
nt|petergill: Now that South aggresively opens 1@S, 4@s will be reached|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: this is a very low scoring match|pg||
nt|twcho: normally this is the sign of good bridge|pg||
nt|rodal f: Some interesting major contracts at NS.|pg||
nt|petergill: If South can penalty dbl 1NT, I'm not sure how much NS can get from 1NTX or 2@CX|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: 7: 15 so far in this segment|pg||
mb|p|pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|twcho: sorry, have something to do now. Bye|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@C shortage - is this a clue for West to find club lead?|pg||
nt|twcho: can't think of a way that north will stop short of game|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|twcho: and the total is only 101 to 104|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|nt|rodal f: Press on for -1 it seems|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
nt|twcho: both teams keep the opponent below 2 imps per bd, still very good|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@CX by East is 500 on a trump lead, less on a non-trump lead|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|rodal f: OY. Got the help so fare.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||
pc|d7|nt|twcho: you can see the value of opening 1@c as just mentioned by Peter|pg||
pc|d9|nt|petergill: At other table, the good 1@C opening guided West to the good club lead - it's a bidder's game, especially if you have a good suit. |pg||
nt|rodal f: No 10 is home|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|twcho: OR east opened 1@c and partner did not have any difficulty to find the right lead|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|pc|s2|nt|twcho: very effective defense here|pg||
nt|rodal f: Was a nice lead from W.|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|petergill: If NS play 2@CXX (boldly? recklessly?), East needs to lead a major to beat it|pg||
pc|cK|nt|twcho: holding declarer to 9 tricks|pg||
pc|cT|nt|twcho: I shd say, it is good to keep the opponent to below 2 imps per bd and very good if it is below 1.5 imps|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c6|pg||
nt|petergill: 1NTX is not so bad - probably only 300, perhaps better than that for EW|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|s4|pc|dK|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|nt|petergill: Without @D10, South would not have opened 1@S (he liked having two good suits with good texture) and then 4@s would not have been reached. |pg||

nt|vugraphzej: 4|pg||
nt|twcho: so NZ and FP will play 4 segments to decide the berth to the Netherlands?|pg||
nt|twcho: the 2nd last bd|pg||
nt|twcho: interesting contract in OR|pg||
nt|rodal f: B12 ended 6NT      6@S here so a push.|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: so the Taipei team can't handle the multi it seems and have a complete mixed up|pg||
mb|1S|nt|twcho: this may be fatal to them|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|twcho: Has Australia grabbed a berth already?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|twcho: So the 3NT at bd 11 has earned HK another 11 imps and now the gap is 25 imps|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|twcho: 3NT cold here|pg||
nt|twcho: so a possible 12 imps to Japan|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: This Zone 7 playoff is for a spot in Netherlands. So is Japan vs Singapore via Zone 6. Then loser of Japan - Singapore plays winner of Chinese Taipei - Hong Kong for other Zone 6 ...|pg||
nt|petergill: spot in Bermuda Bowl|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kiwibridge: no they all play each other|pg||
nt|rodal f: Non vul at NS=11(12)-14 and at vul 15 - 17(18) as readed now:)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|petergill: Yes, China (1st) and Aus (top Z7 team yesterday) already in Bermuda Bowl|pg||
nt|twcho: and this board is decisive|pg||

nt|petergill: That's why Hugh Grosvenor of Aus Open team is playing in the APBF Pairs today|pg||
