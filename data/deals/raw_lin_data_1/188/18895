mb|p|mb|3D|mb|d|nt|mcsd: hello all|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcsd: 4@S should be plyed, but may go to 6|pg||
mb|4C|nt|jfaria:  all ok for overtricks except 4 @c :)|pg||
nt|mcsd: or even 7|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcsd: this auction dictates Major suit lead, as books said|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|oosb: Will probably work on @C |pg||
mb|p|nt|mcsd: but N found safest one|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d3|pc|dT|pc|dJ|pg||

pc|h2|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|s8|pg||
nt|mcsd: 4@Sis weakest bidd, 4@D is |pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|pc|s5|nt|oosb: unless it gets singleton Q from pd :)|pg||
nt|oosb: I think safest is to let Jack ride :)|pg||
nt|jfaria:  playing on @s will avoid @h finesse|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|mcsd: Posible bidd|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s9|pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|nt|jfaria:  forgot singleton !q , that would be very sad indeed|pg||
mc|11|nt|oosb: 6 pairs made 3NT + 2 for  76% .. 3NT +1 worth only 23% |pg||

nt|oosb: but 2 aces missing and @s 4-1, so best spot is 4@S,|pg||
nt|oosb: But @c ruffs involved|pg||
mb|p|nt|jfaria:  3nt?|pg||
nt|oosb: 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosb: you're right|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|jfaria:  easy looking at 4 hands :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosb: Sorry I was thinking they might be interested in @S slam, so end up in 4@S|pg||
nt|oosb: double dummy 3NT is best|pg||
nt|jfaria:  almost sure|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|mcsd: 1nt-3nt (stayman possivble), bidding|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: could bid 3@S as forcing heart raise|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mcsd: s propb ably asking him self why did i assk 2@C in the first place|pg||
mb|p|nt|jfaria:  10 tricks in Nt|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: and north continues 3nt to show 4333, south passes|pg||
nt|mcsd: that is why he should bidd 3nt imidiately|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jfaria:  same in @s it seems|pg||
nt|mcsd: defenders now have some informatio|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||

nt|fabsayc: defense with knowledge of 4333 should continue club when diamond ducked|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but they did not :)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2D|nt|fabsayc: in fact he should have returned spade trick 2, then declarer has no chance|pg||
mb|3S|mb|4H|mb|4S|nt|jfaria:  must be @h|pg||
nt|mcsd: so the 4@H goes down 2, nowhere to discard anything|pg||
