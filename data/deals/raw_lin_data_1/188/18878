mb|p|mb|p|nt|royhughes: It is possible that declarer in 5@s might take a safety play against a 4-0 trump split|pg||
nt|jcwla: S knows the whole story.  It's a Dirty Harry situation: "Do you feel lucky?"|pg||
nt|royhughes: The main risk of going down is 4-0 trumps, but if he fears a ruff he may just play ace and king|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcwla: Not likely to be anything more than a simple transfer here.|pg||
nt|royhughes: South transfers to spades and elects not to go any further|pg||

nt|eggy: I suppose if West had the SK instead of CK it wouldn't be so great|pg||
nt|royhughes: But when only one side is bidding it is often clear who has the problem|pg||
nt|royhughes: and one is not supposed to take inference from the fact that partner takes a long time|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|royhughes: Another point on the last hand is that East probably did not know his partner had 4 diamonds, so there was a chance of a loser if they didn't split|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|eggy: The other thing about screens is that the overall tempo is slower (N or S is obliged to ensure that it is even) so slight hesitations are less noticeable|pg||
pc|hT|nt|jcwla: After trumps gone, the CR S got in with a @S against that 4@H and led @SA, ruffed and creating a @D pitch for decl with @SK - so 4@H made and 10 more to Bessis there.|pg||
