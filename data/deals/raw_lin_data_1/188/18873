mb|p|mb|3D!|nt|fabsayc: hardly recommended but brown would have done well to balance with double|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S!|nt|kirp:  14-16 hcp, 3@C is simple Stayman|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: not the best defence. Either a @d lead or continue with @s|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: @c lead ?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|kirp:  3N is fairly lucky to make, 3@C could be 5 CMS looking at 3@S bid to show 4@Hs|pg||
nt|oosmanb: can he play on @C instead of @H ?|pg||
nt|kirp:  W showed @S if any 4 crd major, so @S lead is not best usually|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kirp:  may play on @Hs |pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this is what happened!|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kirp:  small @H best now, but @D finesse works|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: considering his middelcards in @c, playing one round on @h's was more attempting, needed to try @c's if first @h failed?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Team Angelini picked up more imps in board 2 when the other room bid 3NT instead of 3@D|pg||
nt|kirp:  ad hope NY couldn't take 3@Hs and 2@Cs|pg||
nt|oosmanb: a fair punt, but didnt work out|pg||
nt|oosmanb: yes, I guess J@H onside is higher %age than @C 3-3? |pg||
nt|kirp:  3@S lead certainly gave defense little chance to figure out what to do|pg||
nt|kirp:  if @H J is onside, then has time to test @Cs and if not 33, then @Ds|pg||
nt|kirp:  @D finesse|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Doesnt he need @d finesse in any case? |pg||
pc|sT|pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|hA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: likely not much difference here since NS on for 4@S|pg||
nt|kirp:  still only 8 trix with J@H onside|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: need to get 3@d tricks, so @d finesse is very much needed|pg||
nt|kirp:  S should have continued @Hs ,then needed @D finesse|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c2|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
