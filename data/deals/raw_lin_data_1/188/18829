nt|jjsb: re hi all ...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|hajru:  First round is Pony Nehmert from Germany and Micheal Yuen from Canada (IIRC)|pg||
nt|hajru:  I'm not familiar with the EW pair|pg||
nt|jjsb: +1 still one can have an idea of there nationality :) |pg||
mb|2S!|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|hajru:  Operator, do we play 2 board rounds?|pg||
nt|jjsb: 4@s is makeable and i think East will just bid it |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jjsb: and its done |pg||
pc|c6|nt|jjsb: @d lead would have been better for defense |pg||
nt|jjsb: not that its changing much here |pg||
nt|hajru:  The score lists imps but this is matchpoints.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sQ|pc|s3|pc|s7|pg||

mc|10|nt|jjsb: MP is , IMO much more harder than IMP .... |pg||
nt|jjsb: every deal are important and u need to focuse 100% always , there is some deals in IMP u can just "rest" a little |pg||
nt|hajru:  It is a totally different game.  Bob Hamman once described IMP as 2 boxers fighting|pg||
pg||

mb|1H|nt|hajru:  drunks as fast as possible.|pg||
mb|3C|nt|jjsb: :) i like Bob so :) |pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|jjsb: here 6@h is somehow playable |pg||
nt|hajru:  This will make 6@h EW on a non-diamond lead|pg||
nt|jjsb: i do believe u can find a play even on @d lead as far as i see |pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|jjsb: thougth i think practically yes @d lead will make that down |pg||
mb|4C|nt|jjsb: they wll play it is my guess|pg||
nt|jjsb: when u look at West hand i guess its slam u want to be when ur p open 1@h ..|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|jjsb: on there way .. thougth i dont think its suppose to be East "blackwooding"|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jjsb: not quite sure why West didnt bid 4nt the answer will just tell him where to go |pg||
nt|hajru:  As a spec points out, you can ruff the @d high and hope for trumps 2-2|pg||
nt|jjsb: here 2 keycard and @hQ ..|pg||
nt|jjsb: yes Hank but in practice ...|pg||
nt|jjsb: i am not sure that will be made |pg||
pc|d2|nt|jjsb: let see if 1) @d lead will be made and 2) how declarer will play |pg||
nt|hajru:  We'll know in about 1.75 trick|pg||
nt|jjsb: :) |pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|jjsb: 1.25? |pg||
nt|jjsb: :)|pg||

mc|11|nt|jjsb: the singleton i mean|pg||
nt|jjsb: well she probably knew it was singleton , but now thinking N migth have J10x ? oh well .. interesting board |pg||
nt|hajru:  That will be a bad score for EW but I'm not going to guess percentages.|pg||
nt|hajru:  I don't know what the spot card leads from NS are.|pg||
nt|jjsb: 16.27% :) i try :) |pg||
nt|hajru:  Back in 2 mins|pg||
nt|jjsb: rigth hajru would be interested to know if UDCA or standard |pg||

nt|jjsb: 3@c opening i guess will be chose (at least i would) |pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|jjsb: ok take that back |pg||
mb|2D!|nt|hajru:  NS have moved to the EW seats, NS is a Bulgarian pair|pg||
nt|jjsb: some point out too many defensive value , i agree |pg||
nt|jjsb: just that it still will be my bid MP...|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|jjsb: i dont  say i bid well :) |pg||
mb|p|nt|jjsb: in any case i much prefere to bid 3@c rigth away than now (again just my opinion they are much better than me ) |pg||
mb|d|nt|hajru:  I don't quite understand 3@c at this point|pg||
mb|p|nt|hajru:  If you want to bid 3@c, why give EW a round to exchange information first?|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|jjsb: really just hard to deal on EW as plan |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jjsb: so 2@c was just not forcing to game |pg||
pc|s4|nt|jjsb: and i do believe its not the worse spot u can be in, 3@d...|pg||
nt|hajru:  Not sure what EW play, but 2@c as strong but not quite GF and 2@d as GF is quite|pg||
nt|hajru:  popular in Germany.  |pg||
nt|jjsb: thank u |pg||
nt|jjsb: not the worse but of course down 2 at elast it will be |pg||
nt|jjsb: just saying other table u migth see some 4@s double |pg||
nt|jjsb: some 3nt down 2 or 3 also etc |pg||

nt|jjsb: mmhhh sorry got crashed , apparently i missed something , down 1 it was at end?|pg||
nt|hajru:  Yes, north cashed out too quickly. |pg||
mb|1N|nt|jjsb: we will reach 4@s i believe here |pg||
nt|jjsb: 4@h|pg||
nt|jjsb: sorry |pg||
mb|3D|nt|jjsb: that will test EW system |pg||
nt|jjsb: and they migth now play the much better contract of 3nt maybe |pg||
nt|hajru:  1N-(3D)-3H-P; 4H?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|jjsb: i can understand that now East can have suddenly a lot of options while if there is no overcall the bidding is standard |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jjsb: i mean u want o play 3nt , 4@h why not even 3@d double ?|pg||
nt|jjsb: so she decided for the practical 3nt bid that i can really understand |pg||

nt|hajru:  Yes, I don't see how you can defeat 3N by winning the second @h|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|d|mb|p|nt|jjsb: this one celong to NS in IMP a no brainer , in MP again a hand u cant really "throw" card in defense |pg||

nt|jjsb: 2nt is probably not much interested on @d ? |pg||
nt|hajru:  Strong club, 2@d showing diamonds.  |pg||

mb|p|nt|oosb: Is 2@H non forcing in this sequence? (instead of 3@H)|pg||

nt|hajru:  On 10, we have 1 pair in 3NT so-far|pg||
nt|hajru:  so 5@d is still 60%|pg||
nt|hajru:  And next we have Noberto Bocchi and Sabine Auken joining this table.|pg||
