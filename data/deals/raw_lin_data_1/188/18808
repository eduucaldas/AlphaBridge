nt|petergill: understandable. |pg||
nt|duncan8622:  bd 32: if 3C shows clubs and a 4card major then clearly West should bid something other than 3NT|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|mb|d|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|petergill: Indonesia needs 10 or more VPs to win the Championship. A 9-21 loss would give the title to their opponents. Ref http://www.2011apbf.com/Rrr2_S.pdf for current scores. |pg||

nt|petergill: so perhaps a double finesse was better play - I'm not sure|pg||
nt|offthebend: she could win HA and then exit DK and a D |pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Well done|pg||
nt|andyv:  could be... final result may simply be 300 and 150 for 4 imp swing|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: reasonable 4@H contract here, EW|pg||
nt|petergill: If you must overcall 2@D, then you need to dbl 2@H for take-out|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y|pg||
nt|petergill: I predict that Australia, China and Chinese Taipei will win the medals in this event, but in which order I have no idea. |pg||
nt|woozle: Good hand for North. 6C will roll home on the kind diamond layout|pg||
nt|patricck: that missed game will be an opportunity for Hongkong when played in the Open Room|pg||
nt|twcho: Declarer will do better if flying up with the @h honor|pg||
nt|rodal f: B17 OR ended 4@SW|pg||
nt|duncan8622:  do you have a link to the datums pls?|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 1@D Precision|pg||
nt|petergill: Dynamite hand this one - anything could happen |pg||
nt|rodal f: B3 made one more IMP to the Aussies|pg||
nt|robbroy: Philippines slightly unlucky here to find a cashing AK on lead|pg||
nt|petergill: Last year Chinese Taipei came 1st on 401, Australia 2nd on 399, Indonesia 3rd and China 4th|pg||
nt|patricck: yes the lack of entries to the South hand doesn't really allow declarer to find a losing option|pg||
mb|1D|nt|petergill: In Seniors after 2 rounds http://www.2011apbf.com/Rrr1_S.pdf - NZ's official team leads from Australia|pg||
nt|jcwla: What over 1@S?|pg||
nt|petergill: on Bd 21|pg||
nt|robbroy: no dbl though spotingly|pg||
nt|robbroy: sportingly|pg||
nt|woozle: Pele looks at the vulnerability but perhaps not at her hand|pg||
nt|woozle: At least if she shows the specific suits, North can just arrange to play in clubs by bidding them|pg||
nt|offthebend: might be in 6/7 D very soon on that bidding :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 5NT - 6@D..|pg||
mb|1S|nt|petergill: Australia  would be very happy with 25-5 win over Japan Yamada who won World Seniors in 2008. |pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D Michaels, both majors|pg||
nt|jcwla: 2@H and double back later if needed?  Or double originally?|pg||
nt|petergill: Indonesia had Asbi-Tobing and Sacul - Karwur in their lineup last year. |pg||
nt|patricck: another borderline game|pg||
nt|twcho: Sun is very discipline to pass east hand although she plays precision|pg||
mb|d|nt|patricck: heart lead would be awkward in 6@D|pg||
nt|woozle: An error to make diamonds trumps, especially played by South|pg||
nt|woozle: Paula makes no error|pg||
nt|patricck: not that a heart lead from Jxxxx of declarer's other suit was very likely|pg||
nt|twcho: I think most precisioners will open her hand|pg||
nt|twcho: not so convenient for natural bidders though|pg||
mb|r|nt|patricck: very straightforward 4@H|pg||
nt|petergill: Chinese Taipei team is unchanged|pg||
nt|offthebend: good practical  bid By Paula |pg||
nt|patricck: If NS find the @C lead against 3NT it seems destined to fail|pg||
nt|twcho: 2@h probably shows both M|pg||
nt|twcho: I hope. :)|pg||
nt|twcho: or maybe it is a transfer?|pg||
nt|twcho: so my first guess is right. :)|pg||
nt|twcho: shows both M|pg||
nt|rodal f: A major spot to come|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or will Suci bid the @S for game?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|kiwi_joker: second double should get them there|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzek: http://www.2011apbf.com/tournament.htm|pg||
nt|offthebend: danger if they find 4-4 C fit and start exploring slam |pg||
nt|petergill: 4NT RKCB|pg||
nt|petergill: 5@D = one key card|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@D or 6NT - that's what he's thinking about|pg||
nt|patricck: If South had KQJxx of diamonds we would be wondering how they missed 7@C|pg||
nt|woozle: Pele won't be proud of her hand, but it's good enough on any reasonable line|pg||
nt|patricck: A lot of pairs play double by West in that position as showing 3 card @H support|pg||
nt|duncan8622:  peter... link to the datum website pls?|pg||
nt|petergill: Scores are with only this match remaining ... the medal winners will be: Open China gold, then Australia on 420 or Japan on 412, Ladies (already finished) China 475 from Indo 411 ...|pg||
nt|petergill: Japan 348 and Chinese Taipei 348 !, Seniors Indo 431, Dragon Cartoon 420, Japan 415  |pg||
mb|3D|nt|petergill: I think I would have passed as North and hope S reopens with Dbl, which I would expect S to do|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@SX is worth only 500, not 800, for NS|pg||
nt|petergill: and 3NT is easy, so the difference is negligible|pg||
nt|rodal f: So 15-17NT for NS and a easy push|pg||
nt|rodal f: If u like watch more than one table: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|rodal f: Quite a nice spot in @H here|pg||
nt|twcho: without knowing partner's relative length, south just stay low and pass|pg||
nt|twcho: looks like 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|twcho: as stated in their CC|pg||
mb|3S|nt|petergill: and if S does not reopen with X of 3@S, then 4@H, not 5@D, needs to be reached|pg||
nt|petergill: women's Round 1 results at http://www.2011apbf.com/Rrr1_L.pdf|pg||
nt|petergill: Korea beat NZ 16-14 - a huge upset, and a mild upset was hosts Malaysia over Thailand 19-11|pg||
nt|petergill: After @S2 lead 4th best, I would play back a low spade as North at trick 2|pg||
nt|patricck: Open Team placings before this match are at http://www.2011apbf.com/Rrr1_O.pdf|pg||
nt|rodal f: @S K and get a lavental or a shot in the sky?|pg||
mb|p|nt|offthebend: short and sweet -- who bothers about showing second suit |pg||
nt|rodal f: 2@H=longer @S than @C? No idea. But remember the 1@H opening by 10XXXX|pg||
nt|offthebend: 1C was artificial strong ( 15+ )|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: 2@H maybe trf after 1NT|pg||
nt|kerasidis: nice contract cinsidering that 4@s can be down|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: or 3@H   :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Wow.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or @C?|pg||
nt|woozle: Poor technique from Park - aside from the dangers in a trump lead (dummy could be void, partner holding Jxxx) but she should lead low from two trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|kerasidis: considering|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Now that is some lead directing X|pg||
nt|jcwla: E totally devaluing the hand b/c of @SK - almost worth the raise just on trumps.|pg||
nt|patricck: this contract might have been more interesting with some 4-1 breaks in the red suits, but on this layout everyone makes at least 11 tricks|pg||
nt|petergill: 6NT to protect @CK seems best|pg||
nt|petergill: Well bid, as long as you don't mind the aggressive 3@D opening|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: 6@H just requires finding the @DQ|pg||
nt|petergill: Results website is http://www.2011apbf.com/Rrr2_S.pdf|pg||
nt|duncan8622:  thx|pg||
mb|4D|nt|offthebend: yes 2H showed 5 cards in S |pg||
nt|tejjyid: and East couldn't find a raise? Maybe East's @C's were so good he thought the X meant something else|pg||
nt|petergill: in case East has Qxx|pg||
nt|petergill: Let's see what Sun Ming does|pg||
nt|twcho: can north raise with her hand?|pg||
nt|petergill: but top five pairs in datums are in Daily Bulletins|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: OK. So not 16+ as I wait for at 1@C prec variant|pg||
nt|petergill: An Indonesian team of Lasut - Manoppo (+ a whopping 1.9 imps a board in the Seniors event at present), Asbi - Tobing and Sacul - Karwur would be favourites to win this event, given ...|pg||
nt|petergill: that China are not at full strength (with Jack Zhao, Fu and Dai all not playing)|pg||
nt|petergill: Australia however has a stronger team than last year - Australia's teenage debutant Nabil Edgtton is an excellent player, currently he's +0.85 imps a bd in datums. |pg||
nt|rodal f: B18 hard fighting by EW at 3@H and NS ending 4@S. Seems as a new score for China.|pg||
nt|twcho: She does have quite a maximum for her bid and partner should guarantee some strength as she has rebid after 21c|pg||
nt|twcho: 2@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: Yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Here there's a useful card and a ruffing value to go with the four small.|pg||
nt|patricck: EW have done well to stay out of game on 24 points|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: (or 6NT, for that matter)|pg||
nt|twcho: 4@c is cold as the cards lie|pg||
nt|duncan8622:  oh ok|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|nt|petergill: Just a question of how many 50's this contract fails by, given the misfit|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Declarer's @D's will serve as trump substitutes, and the @S pips prevent the defence getting 3@S tricks|pg||
nt|petergill: http://www.2011apbf.com/Bulletins.htm .... latest is http://www.2011apbf.com/BULLETIN_07.pdf|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rodal f: Quite a funny board. EW as well as NS kave nive fits, but whome do bid as W do here?|pg||
nt|patricck: when playing a 4-3 fit it is usually vital that the 3 card suit is the one being force to ruff. So this is good, I am fairly confident declarer will make his contract|pg||
nt|twcho: if north dare to raise to 3@s, south certainly will go for it imo|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|petergill: In Round 1, Board 16 contributed to some upset results, with a good slam bid by the good teams failing due to a bad break|pg||
nt|petergill: At some point, perhaps on the 2nd round of @d's, I expect her to hook @DK and make 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: thinking . .  .|pg||
nt|petergill: though there is a big worry that at the unfav vulnerability, West may have @DKx or bare @D king|pg||
nt|petergill: but Japanese women tend not to worry all that much about vulnerability and bid 3@S anyway, no on 2nd thought, Japanese players are very disciplined in the bidding|pg||
nt|petergill: surely Sun Ming knows this EW better than I do|pg||
nt|petergill: East is a well-known fairly famous player, but I don't know much about West|pg||
nt|rodal f: Obvious if u have a invome or two.|pg||
nt|rodal f: *income|pg||
pc|c9|nt|petergill: Sun Ming rarely (almost never) lets you down |pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|nt|kiwi_joker: It's a vul game, after all. Big payout chance vs small chance of -1|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|petergill: the heart break will lead her to count West as 7123 shape|pg||
nt|jcwla: Anyway, I'm not in love with this sequence.  This sounds like a very big @H hand that's one-suited in @H's.|pg||
nt|duncan8622:  north should probably 3H over 2D or something similar|pg||
nt|petergill: Indonesia had a disaster at the other table on Bd 31 or 32, so their lead is not as convincing as it looks|pg||
pc|cT|nt|offthebend: everybody UPGRADES these days 14 into 15 , 15 into 16 :)|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: thanks to the kibber who pointed out that A, K and a 3rd spade, after drawing trumps and eliminating clubs, will bring in the (6@H) contract no trouble|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|petergill: My sister (npc of Aus Women in Kuala Lumpur) says that Sun Ming would be ranked much higher than  4 women player in the world, if she played more often|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: coz spades are 3-3|pg||
nt|rodal f: At B18 something must be wrong by the biddings. We'll see later.|pg||
nt|rodal f: At OR of cauce.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|patricck: on a diamond lead 3 rounds of hearts and 5 rounds of diamonds pitching spades, then with the club finesse there are 12 tricks, maybe even 13 if south pitches a club|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|petergill: @C5 from East was bottom card, showing originally 4 clubs|pg||
nt|petergill: there is a very real danger that she will play West for @DKx|pg||
pc|dA|nt|twcho: disturbing opponents 1NT as promoted by Martin Bergen has made some great influence in bridge world.|pg||
nt|twcho: Many players that won't bid after opponent open 1N will now intervene more aggressively|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|petergill: you have to be a very good player to do things like that - the mundane average players just take the @D finesse, in their innocence |pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit strange that they want the contract over to the weak hand?|pg||
nt|kerasidis: i do see an other swing here for ew|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|petergill: If East plays a spade, West has to duck|pg||
pc|h9|nt|petergill: No squeeze, so no overtrick|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jcwla: If you're going to emphasize the @H's, then I think you start with 2@H and double back later.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|petergill: The U26 and U21 fields are combined into one 16 team field, and in the early matches the U26 teams are beating up the u21 teams, ref http://www.2011apbf.com/Rrr1_J.pdf|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|petergill: I agree with Duncan, 3@H or 2@H over 2@D looks reasonable, possibly even 2@H over 1@S|pg||
nt|duncan8622:  yes i like 2H right away|pg||
pc|sA|nt|petergill: otherwise N has 9 tricks without needing to guess @D|pg||
pc|s5|nt|petergill: We may be in for a long wait|pg||
nt|petergill: Does @DJ (not @D10) sway her decision?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|petergill: With @C7 in dummy, I think North's low club switch was right - East might play high from KQ8|pg||
nt|twcho: anyway, 2@s is safe and clean|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|petergill: and your smart idea of 3@H over 2@D, even if undiscussed, must by inference have a @d fit|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|henryb:  Hi Peter|pg||
pc|d9|nt|offthebend: pitching a H by W may cost a trick |pg||
pc|d7|nt|jcwla: What is Eric Kokish's line, you're never too strong to overcall?|pg||
nt|patricck: there you go|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|d6|nt|rodal f: Hi Patrick - specs and vug opperator:)|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|nt|rodal f: Was not easy for Law. @SK or attack from a K. Choosed the wrong one.|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|andyv:  I thought it was you always hurt the ones you love|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rodal f: B4 a doubble score. 3@C= at OR and 3@D= here. 6IMP to the Kiwi|pg||
nt|twcho: Actually if the opponent is vulnerable, the chance is that you will score better by defending rather than declaring|pg||

nt|petergill: with good shape in competitive auctions, getting in and bidding your suit(s) and ignoring your HCP usually works out very well|pg||

nt|petergill: In recent years, I am told Singapore has had Chinese and other coaches for their youths, which might be (part of) why Singapore U26 and U21 are doing so well |pg||
nt|petergill: Unusual decision by West not to open 3@H nor 2@H|pg||

mb|p|nt|petergill: 1@D Precision|pg||
nt|rodal f: If W got 2@H from E. What to bid? Can't bid 3@C, to weak|pg||
nt|patricck: while 7@C can be made, the best contract is 6@C|pg||

nt|petergill: Seniors Round 1 results at http://www.2011apbf.com/Rrr1_S.pdf - no upsets|pg||
nt|patricck: on 2 hands with marginal game values NS has stopped in part-score on one and made a slam try on another|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: are we really here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Still a healty contract.|pg||
nt|petergill: Having 3 cards in the other major is a downside for any preempt - might miss a 5-3 or 6-3 spade fit|pg||
nt|patricck: slam would b a errible contract, but 12 tricks can be made thatnks to the A@D onside if you can guess which way to play the @H suit|pg||
nt|offthebend: DA right , find the HQ for 12 tricks |pg||
mb|4H|nt|rodal f: So I always open 1@C with 5-5 in black when I cant revers and @S +@S from W show the hand. 5@S and 5 or 6@C|pg||
nt|twcho: :)|pg||
nt|patricck: well it won't take much finding now|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: so West can place the NS HCP as "8 N -12 S or so" as a starting point for her declarer play|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: 4@S?|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: W cue and E pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: In the Seniors, Indonesia, Japan Yamada and Australia all have classy teams |pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT must have shown 4414 minimum or perhaps 4!+ @D|pg||
nt|petergill: Dbl = various, then 2@H = both majors|pg||
nt|patricck: There is a theory that bidding grand slams on a hand such as this is a good idea missing Qxxx. Because trumps are so often led against a grand slam you either get a trump lead or ...|pg||
nt|patricck: you finesse against the opening leader for the queen of trumps|pg||
nt|twcho: so some message didn't get pass|pg||
nt|twcho: I think west hand is stronger than 28-30 bal|pg||
nt|twcho: so maybe she can take the lead to jump to 7|pg||
nt|twcho: as her counterpart in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: @DQx is lucky, but is it lucky enough for this to make?|pg||
nt|petergill: @CAQ lead helps declarer|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 3@D would complete the shape nicely, but wuld it be forcing? (It should be)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: tif So, West has to decide whether to try 3NT or 5@D|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Q empty oposite a singleton isn't great|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: China (1) - Japan (3)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rodal f: At non vul u don.t risk anything if u stop under 3NT. Max 1IMP. But at vul it cost. The reason 3NT bidded by the 24HP|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ain't the luckyest lead I,ve seen at a color partscore.|pg||
nt|twcho: now she is hoping for bad break so that 7NT will fail|pg||
nt|patricck: looks difficult to me|pg||
nt|petergill: Youth medallists will be (scores are with just this match to go): U26 Singapore on 451 are playing China on 441, Japan 421 and Australia 414 vie for bronze medal, U21: Australia on ...|pg||
nt|petergill: 372 play Singapore on 366, China on 259 also could win the event (half VPs ignored in my scores). |pg||
pc|c9|nt|petergill: but declarer seems might be one trick short, unless two spades can be ruffed in dummy|pg||
nt|petergill: The duck is an attempt to avoid the fatal @d switch|pg||
nt|petergill: A very clever attempt|pg||
nt|tejjyid: so far, nice bidding|pg||
nt|tejjyid: the problem is, from West's point of view, that if he has to ruff @H, it will be with good trumps|pg||
nt|petergill: 6 North - 8 South now, after the @DQ and @DA are removed|pg||
nt|patricck: K@C is a much better lead than a singleton when holding 4 trumps as West has here|pg||
pc|c8|nt|petergill: South needs to play a red suit now|pg||
nt|offthebend: easy 8 tricks here |pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y. Need to find the @CQXX and % for that might under 30|pg||
nt|patricck: If that theory became too widely followed then people would stop leading trumps so readily against a grand slam|pg||
nt|duncan8622:  usually a good idea to stay lower with such a misfit but in this case E is so strong that slam has a decent chance|pg||
pc|c4|nt|tejjyid: so I think he has to bid 3NT - unless he decides this isn;t forcing. We have to say "nice stop" - although, I think East might be surprised|pg||
nt|rodal f: Now for shure E need to find the @CQ.|pg||
nt|patricck: 6NT is a terrible contract|pg||
nt|rodal f: Wonder why E didn't sat the slam at @C by a 4@C bid?|pg||
nt|patricck: the defence always know they are in with a good chance when declarer takes this long at trick 1 :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit strange in a way that most of the best players/pairs at the earth play natural. Any reason for that?|pg||
nt|twcho: are you sure?|pg||
nt|twcho: I know many play various types of artificial system|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|petergill: Good deduction by South about the reason for East's clever play|pg||
nt|offthebend: H lead predicted by Nick Fahrer and there it came :)|pg||
nt|patricck: ruffing a club in dummy will bring an unpleasant surprise|pg||
nt|twcho: the OR west committed a serious mistake in bd 4 and let Singapore score 6@d|pg||
pc|c6|nt|petergill: S hand lacks entries for 2 spade ruffs in dummy, so might have to rely on @H break (no good) or @s hook ( no good)|pg||
nt|petergill: so this looks like -1|pg||
nt|petergill: even if @DJ is led and not covered, 6@D still seems to fail - perhaps I'm mistaken?|pg||
nt|petergill: expect a very long tank by Wang Hongli|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: :)|pg||
nt|petergill: perhaps a better auction is 4@D by N over 3NT, then if 4NT by S is signoff, then even 4NT might be hard work to make|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|petergill: NS play high to encourage|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might a bit cloudy that 1IMP. U loose and win if u are correct, but at long term u loose only 1IMP pr. board if 50% fail etc 50% in.|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: thinking|pg||
nt|twcho: and she will find it out very quickly|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: I was about to say 4@S doesnt make .. but that was by North. 4@S by West is Every Cue-Bidder's Worst Fear.|pg||
nt|petergill: 31-0 is a handy lead for a team who can afford to lose 10-20 and still win the Championship|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|nt|andyv:  2@h opener here looks like super refined flannery|pg||
nt|jcwla: Fairly common to use 2@H these days.|pg||
nt|twcho: and claim|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|rodal f: I might was a bit hard by the NT with 9 auto. Can loose 3@H and 2@D.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|nt|petergill: North (whose @D pip at Trick 2 suggested 5 @D's) is known to have 5 @D and 3 @H (no 1@h bid), thus some risk of club and @d overruffs. |pg||
nt|petergill: thus the playing off of @CA from dummy was premature|pg||
pc|s3|nt|petergill: Wang Hongli is the number one ranked female player in the world ref http://worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=3828|pg||
nt|andyv:  for 6@h?|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|rodal f: .|pg||
nt|twcho: it is probably true in Norway that most play natural system|pg||
nt|twcho: but I think most Polish play Polish Club|pg||
nt|twcho: while Bulgarian plays some sort of Precision|pg||
nt|rodal f: Grøtheim - Tundal are one of them, but most of the good players/pairs play natural. It will might change. |pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|petergill: alas @D4 was not high enough - what bad luck in the @D pips|pg||
nt|petergill: though S probably should have worked out that continuing @d had to be better than playing clubs|pg||
nt|petergill: as it was impossible for E to duck Trick 1 with anything other than a singleton club|pg||
nt|andyv:  or is that 5 or 6@h that they were showing?|pg||
nt|jcwla: 5 or 6|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3-trick difference if W tries to make.|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok, I misread the %- symbol|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: 5-6@H :)|pg||

nt|twcho: a bit conservative not to open a weak 2 with west hand|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 7: Normal 3@H opening at other table yielded a dividend when North chose to Dbl instead of bid 3NT over 3@H|pg||

nt|rodal f: US as well. As UK, as Denmark, as Sweeden, as Assies, as Kiwi as a lot others.|pg||

mb|d|nt|petergill: 4@S might get doubled|pg||
nt|rodal f: A new interesting board up|pg||
nt|jjsb: this one interesting also , its not that frequent u should play a slam on a 7 card fit rather than on a 8 card fit |pg||
nt|kerasidis: not tough to guess this auction will end in 4@h|pg||
nt|patricck: bidding them is another question|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jjsb: a really weird situation|pg||
nt|rodal f: B3 OR got @DA as the lead and found @CQ. for 6@S= Well done 13IMP to China.|pg||
nt|petergill: Ignore me, I was not quite with it then|pg||
mb|d|nt|offthebend: Spades OVER hearts |pg||
nt|twcho: can NS stop short of game?|pg||
nt|blewah: about their cc, you are right Tommy|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rodal f: Y|pg||
nt|rodal f: Wasted values at E|pg||
nt|patricck: would still have been OK for 4@H if the AQ@S were not both offside|pg||
nt|twcho: 3@h is the limit|pg||
nt|twcho: is 2@c capp?|pg||
nt|twcho: showing any one suiter?|pg||
nt|twcho: The Indonesian ladies has performed particularly well throughout the 2nd round|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: so declarer preferede to play for @S fiensse (50% chance) than for person with short @H to have short @D (less than 50%)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Still an ok sac in 5@H|pg||
nt|kerasidis: yes wd|pg||
nt|twcho: one may have to discuss whether transfer is still on here|pg||
nt|kerasidis: 2nt attacking bid ..wild|pg||
nt|jcwla: We are probably on our way to 3@D here.|pg||
nt|patricck: cards are VERY friendly for EW|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Park fints the solution to partners who open weak balanced hands : INVITE game|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 1NT weak, Dbl pen, Rdbl = long minor|pg||

nt|twcho: yes, tks operator for confirming my guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: :)|pg||
nt|patricck: but this is the time you would have wanted to be there :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: sadly, true|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but even though the @S are great, I can;t see myself forcing to game|pg||
nt|patricck: indeed, was not seriously suggesting East should do more|pg||
nt|twcho: so a routine 4@s here|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: West knows East has less than 3 hearts, so unless North has 5 or 6 hearts (unlikely?), West has 4 top tricks to 41S|pg||
nt|petergill: to 4@S I mean|pg||
nt|offthebend: They can make 5S on S finesse and by playing D towards the J |pg||
nt|rodal f: By that long thinking if no screens W have problem to bid. |pg||
nt|rodal f: But can tey take the safe income?|pg||
nt|jjsb: some in the audience  point out 1nt can only be made if junior :) not sure about that :) |pg||
nt|jjsb: basically on a strong club|pg||
nt|jjsb: u try to overcall as far as poossible |pg||
nt|rodal f: Tapei made 710 at 4@H at OR and 2IMP|pg||
nt|patricck: I think it highly unlikely they will get to slam'|pg||
nt|woozle: I am suggesting East drive to game - AJTx worth about eight points on this auction|pg||
nt|twcho: west of course shd bid to the game with 64 shape|pg||
nt|twcho: the imp scale favors aggressive bidding|pg||

nt|twcho: hi Rodal|pg||
nt|twcho: NS is probably the top pair of HK|pg||
nt|kerasidis: about a weak ago ...i saw a very expeirienced pair misunderstanding their bid upon overcall on 1nt opening|pg||
nt|kerasidis: 16 imps lost|pg||
nt|twcho: and they are very aggressive bidders|pg||
nt|kerasidis: hi tommy|pg||

nt|vugraphzek: thinking|pg||
nt|rodal f: B4 OR ended 3@HN. Here it was 5@DE= IMPs for Thailand.|pg||
nt|twcho: so one have to agree explicitly with partner when the transfer is still on  or not|pg||
nt|twcho: sell out to 3H with 7411?|pg||
nt|twcho: too cheap indeed|pg||
nt|kerasidis: of course...but there are some many difficulties yet to deal with|pg||
nt|rodal f: Cheep or cheap. I love the speciality made by cheep's:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  E can dbl here?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree|pg||
nt|rodal f: But what are N gona lead?|pg||
nt|patricck: Q@C|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 7: with poor spade texture for 4@S, perhaps 3NT is the better choice over 3@H|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C Precision |pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D artificial enquiry|pg||
nt|blewah: they need to do something with the mixed up of @c and @d symbols|pg||
nt|twcho: They had accumulated 200 VP from 9 matches, more than 22VP per match. It is amazing feat|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Aria.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|petergill: so I think the odds massively favour a penalty dbl of 4@s on the West cards|pg||
nt|rodal f: If any like the BBO-TV: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php    = til B20|pg||
nt|jjsb: a pass folloxed by a bid is normally stronger than initial overcal |pg||
nt|kerasidis: yes cheep endeed especially when partner showed values|pg||
nt|petergill: Rdbl = long suit not clubs (would bid 2@C with clubs)|pg||
nt|henryb:  Presumably XX was forced and 2@d showed @d and a major|pg||
nt|henryb:  you see, sorry, Peter and I disagree|pg||
nt|rodal f: Now the @C became more important|pg||
nt|twcho: I don't like such strategy as west|pg||
nt|twcho: I will like to bid my suit first instead of coming later|pg||
nt|twcho: of course this is personal style|pg||
nt|petergill: Bad breaks make this hard to amke, but @S9 lead brings dummy's @S65 into play later|pg||
nt|petergill: NS have given no clues in bidding to help declarer navigate this one|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|rodal f: Do they play with screens?|pg||
nt|offthebend: 4Sx in a limited system and a known 10 card H fit is a bit surprising |pg||
nt|vugraphzek: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: sceen|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: screen|pg||
nt|jjsb: i still admit , i can see with that hand why i dont want to play a strong club ..|pg||
nt|andyv:  S's hand a bit difficult to evaluate but a 10 count does deserve more than a suit preference|pg||
nt|patricck: goes down easily if the defence find their diamond ruffs of course|pg||
pc|c4|nt|vugraphzek: http://www.2011apbf.com/Rrr1_O.pdf|pg||
nt|twcho: if their partnership can handle this, it is fine|pg||
nt|twcho: good job for NS to stop at the par contract|pg||
nt|twcho: now let's see whether she can make it|pg||
nt|twcho: she has danger of losing 3 trumps|pg||
nt|patricck: but even when they don't declarer has some work to do|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rodal f: +3 and next|pg||
nt|jjsb: the idea if opening 1@c with N is kinda scaring me ...|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4 lavental as I play it|pg||
nt|patricck: The spades are a bonus but the rest of the hand looked limp|pg||
nt|twcho: but my prediction is wrong again. :(|pg||
nt|blewah: but I just learned that they played precision too|pg||
pc|cA|nt|petergill: so I was unfair to South - her line of play is perhaps best|pg||
nt|petergill: NS play Precision|pg||
nt|petergill: I would have played @HK at Trick 2, in case partner's heart was singleton|pg||
nt|petergill: then switched to clubs|pg||
nt|petergill: The low heart play shows that they have 100% faith in partner's count card at Trick 1|pg||
nt|jjsb: but of course not saying its bad !!! of course it can be more than helpfull in a lot of situation |pg||
nt|rodal f: Good news. Not at the @H trap. Sad news, could get some more income.|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: http://www.2011apbf.com/Rrr1_L.pdf|pg||
nt|patricck: slam was only a moderate proposition.... basically needing both @H and @C to be 3-2, which is about a 50% chance when combining both suits together|pg||
nt|twcho: anyhow, east will accept the Invitation|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|rodal f: If no screen and pass from NS the TD should be called after the board is finnich.|pg||
nt|blewah: with weak NT|pg||
nt|petergill: I like the 4@S bid on the suity 6-4 shape - unlucky to find partner with only xxx in @D, might have been a good save if partner's ! h were weaker. |pg||
pc|d9|nt|petergill: That looks more like it. |pg||
nt|twcho: probably she shd lead a small trump from hand now|pg||
pc|dA|nt|petergill: Other table: normal @S4 lead to same bidding to 3NT, then Patrick Huang played @CA and CK, so surely he will go down|pg||
pc|d5|nt|offthebend: 5H can be made by playing Clubs early and guessing the C J otherwise one down |pg||
nt|rodal f: OK. Then might harder for call the TD.|pg||
nt|andyv:  despite the sterile nature of his hand, 3@d was a reasonable alternative|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|patricck: hmmm, maybe that is too harsh|pg||
nt|twcho: ok, perhaps you can say something about their system and agreement for the coming boards|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|petergill: I wondered why Pass was (possibly) not alerted|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Well,I guess with AQTx you'd go; this is not much worse|pg||
pc|sA|nt|petergill: @CK, then @DJ, then @S10 then @S6, but no entries to dummy|pg||
nt|petergill: @DJ ducking, playing for 3-3 @D, looks like a possible play now|pg||
nt|petergill: North's @D3 discard might be from 3 cards, but more likely from 5 or 6 cards|pg||
nt|petergill: @SQ play suggests to E that S has !J, so must have @SJ98x(x) and 5 clubs, thus not many red cards|pg||
pc|s6|nt|petergill: with 2/1 GF|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: http://www.2011apbf.com/Rrr1_S.pdf|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|petergill: so all the bids after 1@S were forcing|pg||
nt|tejjyid: tough problem for West; I would have made a pre-emptive @C raise on the 1st round & Perhaps X is better than 2@H|pg||
nt|petergill: More "discplined"(?) bidders might prefer 3@D game try on the West cards|pg||
pc|s7|nt|rodal f: @CK onside  so no problems|pg||
nt|henryb:  Playing "DONT" runouts has become fairly common|pg||
pc|sT|nt|jjsb: will play AK of @h now i guess|pg||
nt|petergill: E thinks: As North did not bid over 2@C with long red suits, @HA is more likely to be in South's hand|pg||
nt|woozle: There's a lot of imps in bidding and making tight games on upgraded holdings|pg||
nt|patricck: I was disliking the lack of intermediates in the other suits, but I guess you can't have everything|pg||
pc|s8|nt|twcho: even she goes down, there will still be a small gain for them|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I'm sure East is expecting the @H suit to be 6 cards long|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jcwla: It is a light-looking 10 but I'm with you, Andy, this seems Milquetoast.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|blewah: so that explained the previous board why Suci opened 1@d. She intended to rebid 1NT (15-17bal) had she got the chance|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jjsb: and then +1 or = depends of where he will try to throw the @c |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 5-3 major fits are a real problem for the Precision 2@C opening|pg||
pc|s9|nt|patricck: they lost one defensive ruff, there was 50 points chucked away|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rodal f: Was a safetynes but, ....|pg||
nt|petergill: North knew East had @S10 from @S9 lead, so N knew @S65 was in danger of setting up, so might have played nonspade then|pg||
nt|petergill: sorry, i forgot, it was E not N who led @S|pg||
nt|petergill: S had better play @H now, or he will be re-endplayed in clubs |pg||
nt|petergill: S wondering whether to play @HA then @H9 to clear himself from being endplayed, or play @H9 or @H3 (putting himself in danger of later endplay)|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: thinking|pg||
nt|woozle: making two, but without that dreadful heart play, prospects were good for nine tricks|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|pg||
nt|offthebend: running the C10 to throw a D can not cost or finessing now |pg||
pc|s4|pc|cQ|nt|petergill: plenty to think about, since South has no idea what the @H layout is|pg||
pc|hT|nt|jjsb: so +1 it is |pg||
nt|jjsb: mmhh not yet |pg||
nt|jjsb: have ti tap @d first if u play @s ruff its not working |pg||
nt|twcho: the moment of truth|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: 5@H in hand :)|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|rodal f: B7 OR S opened 2NT=minor and N direct 5@C. Here 1NT+1NS|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will at least never go down.|pg||
nt|twcho: tks Chayes|pg||
pc|s3|nt|offthebend: didn't do any of those PLUS hearts spots were all blocked up by west |pg||
nt|twcho: well done|pg||
pc|h8|pc|d6|nt|jjsb: u just dont over ruffer , take the next heart and play @d|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|petergill: @HA now, so he can exit with @H3|pg||
pc|cT|nt|andyv:  claim time|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jjsb: rigth :) |pg||
nt|petergill: His plan is to squeeze North|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|rodal f: So a new gain for the Aussies it seems|pg||
nt|offthebend: 5C would have made on a likely S lead|pg||
nt|jjsb: ok ... |pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|rodal f: Spec said bl w is ok. What if the two A is @S an @H or @S and @D? 6 is down. Exlution bl wood then u bid a unnatural @S bid and ask for A in the other colors. Hopeless here as long ...|pg||
nt|rodal f: as W bidded 3@S as well|pg||
pc|cK|nt|petergill: Good defence by Herstein Liu|pg||
pc|c9|nt|tejjyid: it is important to match your bidding and your cardplay though|pg||
pc|d3|nt|petergill: On reflection, I think S's line of play in 6@S was right. The other table failed in 5@D.|pg||
nt|petergill: in 6@D, I mean|pg||
nt|woozle: okay, not making two, the diamonds withering on the vine|pg||
nt|petergill: Great play by Shan|pg||

pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|rodal f: Didn't come.|pg||

nt|vugraphzek: Suci Alert pass 0-4|pg||
nt|patricck: Exclusion Blackwood|pg||
nt|rodal f: Grand an d no comments|pg||
nt|petergill: About two years ago, superstar Patrick Huang sent about 2,000 emails to the other five players in his team to train them up to become champion players|pg||
nt|tejjyid: as a broad general principle|pg||
nt|patricck: I didn't know diamonds grew on vines :)|pg||
nt|twcho: a possible slam here|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Sanity prevailed in the Open Room on that weird bd 23, final contract beign 3@S by N|pg||
nt|twcho: so Aria, what does the sequence 1N-2C-2H-2S show for them?|pg||
nt|twcho: as in bd  22|pg||
nt|blewah: crawling stayman i suppose|pg||
nt|blewah: non-forcing|pg||
nt|petergill: To stop the squeeze, North has to duck @CA|pg||
mb|p|nt|kerasidis: i apologize for my many mistakes during typing |pg||
nt|rodal f: Not much to say here|pg||
nt|twcho: with capable declaring, slam will likely make as east will be squeezed in the M|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: (the player with 6 spades)    lol|pg||
nt|twcho: Does 2S has invitational value or can be rubbish?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  4@h for NS although EW should go to 4@s despite the vul|pg||
nt|jcwla: Indonesia did bid the @H game on 6 so 10 more to them and NZ just hemorrhaging IMPs at this point.|pg||
nt|rodal f: A part but where?|pg||
nt|rodal f: B24 OR also 4@H|pg||
mb|1H|nt|twcho: wonder why OR will play in 3@s|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C to set up GF auction |pg||
nt|woozle: 4S here beaten by an early heart play; 4H beaten by a well-placed early club play|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: 11 tricks available for EW in spades here|pg||
nt|blewah: crappy hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: NT at W I hope, but will they be taken by NS activity?|pg||
nt|twcho: after they have found fit in @c|pg||
nt|woozle: If nobody bids game, whoever buys this hand will do well|pg||
nt|twcho: but very difficult to bid once north treat it as 15-17 hand|pg||
nt|petergill: Ducking @CA can be good technique, as West's @C is unlikely to be singleton, and it's usually best to retain major tenace|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|andyv:  matter of style here|pg||
nt|patricck: The members at my bridge club would be complaining that N/S are getting no cards :)|pg||
nt|patricck: both sides could make part-scores in a major, but EW will be satisfied with beating 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: The suitable vulnerability, and being dealer, would tempt me to open the North cards with a weak 2@S (normally 6 spades), but that is too random to be the French style. |pg||
nt|rodal f: By wich lead?|pg||
nt|patricck: 7@S is a good contract, 7NT is a bad contract which happens to be lucky|pg||
nt|twcho: this hand worths an upgrade in my evaluation|pg||
nt|twcho: 17 HCP and a decent 5 cards suit|pg||
nt|twcho: if he opts to open 1@d then jump to 2NT, chance is there for them to get to slam|pg||
nt|twcho: with south hand opposite a normal 1NT opening, 3NT shd be the limit|pg||
mb|4H|nt|rodal f: B21: 3@D+1 here and 2@S-1 at OR and one IMP for Tapei|pg||
nt|andyv:  those who play drury, would bid 2@c (one way) or 2@d (two way) with N hand|pg||
nt|jcwla: That is one heavy 2@H raise.|pg||
nt|twcho: ok, so this explains why north didn't take further action over it|pg||
nt|blewah: yes|pg||
nt|twcho: she does have quite a good hand|pg||
nt|petergill: or, havng won @CA, play 2nd club to destroy entries for squeeze play|pg||
nt|duncan8622:  yes south must duck (preferable) or return one if he wins it|pg||
mb|p|nt|jjsb: rigth |pg||
nt|twcho: HK is the leading team after 6 rounds|pg||
nt|woozle: Kim might have done better to pass over 1NT; defending 1NT on a heart lead looks promising|pg||
nt|patricck: sorry about that, someone kicked the table over, but we're back now :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: I guess the aim here is to stop in 6@S and not reach 7@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: :)|pg||
nt|jjsb: @h is best for defense as i see it |pg||
nt|twcho: probably south means 3@s to be forcing but north is taking a different view|pg||
nt|twcho: 5@c is cold|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: with short spades, it is often better to bid 2@H a bit light than to neg dbl, as the inevitable (in 2011) spade preemption might make a 2@H bid lead to easier continuations in the ...|pg||
nt|petergill: competitive bidding|pg||
nt|rodal f: @C from A no|pg||
nt|jjsb: not at all impossible to lead @c |pg||
nt|jjsb: yes |pg||
nt|jjsb: reasonable |pg||
nt|rodal f: Is to defancive normaly|pg||
nt|petergill: South might have acted over 3@C. With Axx in partner's preempt suit, an expert named Michael Courtney once told me you cannot pass ever. |pg||
nt|henryb:  Passing 3@c seems strange to me. I would surely bid 4@c, and possibly 5|pg||
nt|rodal f: OR at the road for 6@C and bidded it|pg||
nt|petergill: Their most common line-up is the older pair Jonky and Herstein, and the veteran star Patrick (who has won this event between 10 and 20 times, I think) plays with one of the three ...|pg||
nt|petergill: younger looking team members at the other table. |pg||
pc|s9|nt|petergill: Sun Ming is ranked  4 women player in the world ref http://worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=3827|pg||

nt|jjsb: ok ..|pg||

nt|andyv:  W will pass as he is clueless as to where his tricks are coming from|pg||
nt|twcho: so another pick up by Philippines|pg||
nt|rodal f: And I see 6 tricks now. But....|pg||
nt|petergill: Still on Bd 24: Would be easier to defend if West does 3@D game try, revealing his hand more|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 25: 2NT good raise|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@H Precision|pg||
nt|petergill: In case @S9 is single, will probably play ace, then 2 hearts ending in dummy, then spade to jack|pg||
nt|petergill: but if @S9 lead is from queen, need to duck at Trick 1|pg||
pc|s3|nt|offthebend: No way to go down in 3NT here -- lose 3 aces |pg||
nt|rodal f: If standard carding|pg||
nt|jjsb: brb so :) |pg||

nt|tejjyid: South no unreasonably oping for 6@C tricks, 2 Aces and a @D|pg||

pc|d6|nt|rodal f: No free trick even if it seems so|pg||

nt|kiwi_joker: hmmm Paul G may be nervous about his super-weak 1NT at this point|pg||
nt|blewah: can the def finds @s shift|pg||
pc|dA|nt|twcho: China is picking up and back into the chasing field|pg||
nt|jcwla: But in the scheme of things, this may be one of NZ's best chances for a pickup.|pg||
nt|petergill: With trumps 4-1, a good decision|pg||
nt|woozle: Pele takes advantage of the second chance to bid her spades|pg||
nt|twcho: but they lost a chance|pg||
nt|duncan8622:  a lot of pairs playing the 9 lead from QT9(xx..) these days so might depend on their system|pg||
pc|d5|nt|tejjyid: North sould probably trust SOuth; the contract wasn't without chances|pg||
nt|petergill: Perhaps their fav vul 3@C preempts as dealer are normally 6 card suits?|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|rodal f: But tempo for the @H|pg||
nt|henryb:  On the other hand, N-S will probably go plus here as West is unlikely to guess hearts|pg||
nt|petergill: 9 lead must be 0 or 2 higher, so he covers possibility of lead being from Q109x|pg||
pc|hA|nt|petergill: Sun Ming usually only plays international bridge every 2nd year, so being ranked  4 in the world is particularly good|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sleepingtime for me:(|pg||
nt|twcho: by their transfer bid|pg||
nt|blewah: ya, bd 21 was a nice bid|pg||
nt|blewah: that's why transfers in competition become popular, i think|pg||
nt|twcho: Yes, bridge playing technique has not much ground to improve|pg||
nt|twcho: but new bidding concept is continuously springing|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|nt|petergill: surely they can find out that @DK is missing and stop in 6@S, e.g. 5@H asks about @SQ, 6@H response shows @HK and @SQ and denies @DK and denies @CK|pg||
nt|petergill: so only 6@S|pg||
nt|petergill: A trump lead was best too|pg||
nt|rodal f: Free Willy. A and a new @C passive|pg||
nt|blewah: agreed absolutely|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|rodal f: +1 and next|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: @S|pg||
nt|rodal f: At match I would have liked the 3@C opening but not at team. Ok. Style.|pg||
nt|patricck: I probably would have opened 3@C, but some of my partners are less forgiving if it goes wrong than others|pg||
nt|rodal f: OR open 1@C here.|pg||
nt|rodal f: :)|pg||
nt|twcho: it is difficult to reach game once north hasn't opened her hand|pg||
nt|petergill: 4th highest of longest and strongest works better as opening lead|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jjsb: east knows now 4@c 2@d and 2 aces thats 8|pg||
nt|petergill: Compared to "Pass", in my opinion 3@D, 3NT, 3@S, 3@H, 4@C and 5@C are all better bids by South after "3@C Pass" |pg||
nt|patricck: A good win to Japan in this match will make an interesting battle for 2nd place, but will allow China to break away to a big lead|pg||
nt|patricck: scores before this round are at http://www.2011apbf.com/Rrr1_L.pdf|pg||

nt|petergill: might have to cash a heart before playing trumps in the scenario I was describing|pg||
nt|petergill: then +100|pg||
nt|rodal f: B22 at OR: 3NT as here Here was 9 tr|pg||
nt|jjsb: i guess if u ask what to open with East u will have a lot of options|pg||
nt|jjsb: depending ur style |pg||
nt|jjsb: im personally a 2@h opening |pg||
nt|jcwla: NZ on the board with 1 on 7 (130 vs. 100)|pg||
nt|petergill: but 3@C P 5@C doesn't cost much, even if 4@S fails - especially if East leads a @D to 5@C|pg||
nt|petergill: or East might lead a club to 5@C|pg||
nt|rodal f: Some fun to come|pg||
nt|twcho: wow, the defense has founded the uppercut|pg||
nt|petergill: Patrick probably wrote something like that in email 1,673 of his 2,000 emails, but I'm only guessing|pg||
nt|woozle: At least EW are cashing out accurately, but the  board represents a plus position for australia|pg||
nt|woozle: EW may attempt a game here, but I can't see how they'll make it|pg||
nt|patricck: yes 25 points, but nothing like 9 tricks|pg||
nt|patricck: that was down 1 for 50 to EW|pg||
nt|twcho: in NT one can't rectify the count.|pg||
nt|twcho: if they play in 6@d, then they can give away one @c and surely squeeze east in the end play|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: oh right, the @D trick disappeared instead|pg||
nt|blewah: slam time|pg||
mb|p|nt|offthebend: likely 4S contract here UNLESS West overcalls 1S :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  so this must show something besides @s:)|pg||
nt|twcho: so sorry for all my previous comments. Game is not there with this defense|pg||
nt|twcho: although EW is the youngest pair in the formiddable China team, they are the no. 1 pair in the Butler table before this match among all ladies pair|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|jcwla: Completing the @D-@S inversion.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|rodal f: Interesting cards NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Next Round Indonesia - China (Open)|pg||
nt|henryb:  Or @sA and a @s|pg||
nt|rodal f: Spot to come? But might hard to stop early enough.|pg||
nt|twcho: of course they may still be able to make 6N by finessing in @s|pg||
nt|twcho: but the chance is not so good as in 6@d|pg||
nt|rodal f: By no @H lead NS should have fun here.|pg||
nt|twcho: We are glad that China has new blood to replenish and hopefully they can maintain their strength for the coming years|pg||
nt|twcho: How about NS pair, how old are they?|pg||
nt|blewah: they are very young too|pg||
nt|petergill: Safety leads from xxx can work better against 2 level contracts than 4 level contracts - the lower contracts are less of a race for tricks|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@D Precision, so 3@D natural|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jjsb: but i am pretty sure a lot will find pass or also 1@h |pg||
nt|petergill: 11C Precision |pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C Precision|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@S balanced, 8+ HCP|pg||
nt|patricck: North won't be denied bidding 4@H, hopefully West doesn't think about doubling|pg||
nt|twcho: a cold slam missing 2 aces|pg||
nt|twcho: can they bid it?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not cold by a @H lead.|pg||
nt|blewah: 4@d must be splinter here|pg||
nt|twcho: certainly|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Patrick Huang has also coached Chinese Taipei youth teams - they won U26 Championship last year|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@D 11-15, can be short|pg||
mb|4H|nt|petergill: and her (relative newcomer, compared to Wang Hongli and Sun Ming) partner Feng Xuefeng is ranked  48 woman in the world due mainly to the win in Philly|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D inverted, forcing|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H shows stopper, hardly even alertable in the modern era, as it is so normal|pg||
nt|rodal f: B20 will become a =|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr 1 IMP for China|pg||
nt|andyv:  if NS have any agreements in place, 2@s, 3@s and 4@s should all be natural|pg||
nt|andyv:  and use the @d suit for cue bidding purposes|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H 5+ @H, 16+ HCP|pg||
nt|patricck: The 2@S opening is 5@S and another 4 card suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Often u will drop for 2-2 if u miss QXXX as @C here|pg||
nt|rodal f: B22 ended =|pg||
nt|offthebend: Pele didn't Really need to keep the bidding open with that poor 12 points and non working QJ in spades |pg||
nt|offthebend: max 8 tricks again on a natural D lead |pg||
nt|woozle: Kim bids as though she has a bus to catch. This could have been ridiculous opposite a singleton heart (but perhaps ok opposite a singleton spade - how could east know the ...|pg||
nt|woozle: difference?)|pg||
nt|offthebend: but accident may happen here if Pele puts up the Q |pg||
nt|patricck: declarer could finesse twice against the QJ@C and lose 3 @C tricks and the contract|pg||
nt|twcho: I doubt east hand worth GF vs a normal 1@h response|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 3@C shows stopper|pg||
nt|petergill: 1NT 13-15|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Good lead!|pg||
nt|petergill: I like it - go for the good 4 card suit ahead of the weak longer suit with no entries  - a very sensible thing to try, especially in a match in which your team is the underdog |pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT should fail now - on a heart lead, the bold 3NT had some chance. |pg||
nt|jjsb: i am afraid im not sure of there system on 1@c i just that 1@d is expressing a number of point |pg||
nt|twcho: not everyone will open east hand with a bal 10 pts|pg||
nt|petergill: Bidding looks normal to me|pg||
nt|blewah: my researcher :) reported that Suci and Kristina are still below 30. |pg||
pc|d8|nt|petergill: 5@D and 3@S both are safe|pg||
nt|petergill: and 3NT I meant|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: S think 3@S is suit|pg||
nt|rodal f: Seems as I was wrong when I belived NS to paly 15-17NT. This is precission and relay or only @D from N|pg||
nt|rodal f: OR might at the line now. Let's see|pg||
nt|patricck: If double was takeout from South I would do that|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ended 5@C|pg||
nt|rodal f: 5@H? Whay not 4NT if that road?|pg||
nt|twcho: and she is red|pg||
nt|twcho: it is an overbid imo|pg||
pc|d9|nt|rodal f: N will bid and show the adwanced que in @S I hope|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: ohh|pg||
nt|rodal f: S can't pass since 2/1 is made|pg||
nt|rodal f: Would have been from me.|pg||
nt|patricck: will try to keep up the commentary hear, but have just been served dinner|pg||
nt|patricck: for that reason West wold do well to allow declarer a 2nd entry by way of the 10@H|pg||
pc|dA|nt|petergill: Declarer might still come to 9 tricks if he plays a heart to the ten|pg||
nt|petergill: which is not impossible|pg||
nt|petergill: only "might" = more likely is -100 or -200|pg||
nt|tejjyid: excellent; East's subsequent 2@H bid will say 6 cards & too weak to open|pg||
nt|jcwla: Query whether N is really ever going to find out information to play somewhere other than 4@S opposite pd's vul 2-level overcall?|pg||
nt|andyv:  so, little gained by the convention here as NS easily bid their hands.  Would a 3@d opener have been more effective?|pg||
nt|jcwla: I think all roads lead to Rome on this hand.|pg||
nt|andyv:  maybe|pg||
nt|andyv:  but took a long time to build those roads|pg||
nt|henryb:  6 of either red suit is not the worst contract ever seen|pg||
nt|patricck: wow|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|offthebend: good stop - this should come to easy 8 tricks unless Heart suit is attacked |pg||
nt|tejjyid: whihc, these days, is pretty weak|pg||
nt|rodal f: At OR EW are out bicikling but S helped by 4@C and E bidded 4@D. Than W made it 5. Pass around.|pg||
nt|petergill: Will his hearts tempt him to try 3NTt now|pg||
nt|blewah: 4@s was not what S wanted to hear|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|petergill: E thinks that 4@D is strong, slam try. West just bid 4@D as not so strong|pg||
nt|petergill: If @d is trumps, before bidding 4NT, always check if 5@H response takes you past your last safe haven|pg||
nt|rodal f: UPS. THIS CAN COST|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S denies Hxx (H = A, K or Q) support, I think|pg||
nt|petergill: over the heart bidder|pg||
nt|petergill: Very well bid by NS|pg||
nt|patricck: did declarer really duck that?|pg||
nt|blewah: so she resigned in 5@h|pg||
nt|twcho: yes, south has nothing to add after hearing the @s cue|pg||
nt|twcho: so has to rebid 5@h|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rodal f: 1@D can also be controls if they use it for 0-2|pg||
nt|petergill: West would have raised a 3@D opener to 5@D.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Quite normal thees days|pg||
pc|d6|nt|rodal f: U meam u have underbidded by ure 16HP? |pg||
nt|twcho: strange not to introduce his 2nd good suit  by south|pg||
nt|tejjyid: South sould have bid that @S suit at some stage though|pg||
nt|tejjyid: IMO, over the 1@H; later for the tightrope walkers|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@D natural, 3@H = xxx support without top honour|pg||
nt|twcho: but still NS has founded the best contract|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|petergill: I think E failed to do so - or perhaps 4NT does not mean what I think it means|pg||
nt|jjsb: with the @c situation this one seems to be an ok contract |pg||
nt|jcwla: On 8, where NS here played 2@D making 4, their NZ counterparts failed by 3 in 3NT, so 7 more to Indonesia, up 35 through half the comparisons.|pg||
nt|twcho: so a cold slam missed|pg||
nt|blewah: something they can discuss later|pg||
nt|rodal f: By all other leads than @H from W 6@H is cold, as now.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|henryb:  but won't make because of the bad @d break. and even 4@h needs careful play|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@S cue as slam try, 4@H signoff|pg||
nt|twcho: even 3@s is dangerous|pg||
nt|petergill: Other table is in 3@C after Patrick opened 2@D as dealer|pg||
nt|woozle: I dislike Paula's choice of the diamond jack (compared to a low diamond), like Pele's unblock, but Kim plays this hand as though all cards below jack are the same|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: club Q onside should bring in 12 tricks ... as they say, a 'Roland Slam'|pg||
pc|h3|nt|petergill: anyway, West worked out that this is not a slam auction - else East would bid 4NT earlier - and thus had the commonsense to signoff with her poor hand|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, I agree, but you never know when a pair might have a different agreement in that area|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|pg||
nt|offthebend: and paula better overtake the second spade in case west ducks twice :)|pg||
nt|jjsb: i am been told its a 0 to 7 |pg||
nt|rodal f: A nice value at @D now, but is it enough?|pg||
nt|rodal f: @D3|pg||
nt|petergill: the imps seem to go to the side which strike the first blow|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jjsb: i think @d looks like the only possible considering the dummy ? |pg||
nt|patricck: West is going to force declarer to take the winning line in clubs|pg||
pc|h5|nt|offthebend: oops - why did she throw the S |pg||
nt|andyv:  3N was good contract except for lack of tricks|pg||
pc|h9|pc|d2|pg||
nt|petergill: South has a difficult time getting off lead now|pg||
nt|offthebend: still OK |pg||
nt|petergill: on both Bds 7 and 10|pg||
pc|hK|nt|petergill: 600 to EW, after an exciting auction|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree u there:)|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h6|pc|h8|pg||
nt|petergill: Nice play - @CJ was best, only because all other options looked bad|pg||
nt|twcho: west has founded the safest return|pg||
nt|twcho: but this is not adequate for defeating 2@s|pg||
pc|c8|nt|vbman: hi all|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|nt|petergill: Good @H play - devastating defence |pg||
nt|petergill: You ruff the 2nd club, play 2 top hearts to find the bad break, stop trumps perforce, and play @d by|pg||
nt|rodal f: B25. 4@CN-1 here and 5@DW-1 at OR made 4IMP for Malaysia|pg||
nt|rodal f: Do Fong feel him self inputted? |pg||
nt|patricck: very tight, low-scoring match so far|pg||
nt|rodal f: At this board OR ended 1NTE|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: thinking|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|jjsb: and that contract is all about @c so |pg||
nt|twcho: with such good hand and good suit quality|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|petergill: Like having the serve at tennis, you can strike first blow and ace the opponents, that perhaps was in email  849, but I'm only guessing|pg||
nt|patricck: Welcome Kursat|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|patricck: Help out these poor people, they have only had me to listen to for an hour or so|pg||
nt|patricck: :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rodal f: 2@Ds and a @H ruff to come|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|rodal f: With the 16HPs Y. Agree u|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rodal f: So a presission where Weiwei should have had some lessons for some?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. Only 2@Ds|pg||
nt|vbman: doubt if l can match you|pg||
nt|vbman: so this makes|pg||
pc|c7|nt|kerasidis: or by north even if its not stronh|pg||
nt|petergill: leading low to king then low through the person with long trumps so a top @d doesn't get ruffed.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|andyv:  somehow something seems amiss in the play of that hand|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|jjsb: and = it is |pg||
nt|patricck: yes, the defence had the chance to allow declarer two entries to the South hand so that he could play 109x opposite K8x wrong, but they forced him to get it right|pg||
nt|vbman: checking again|pg||
nt|patricck: declarer could play low and then try to smother the other honour, but that seems far fetched|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|petergill: then concede a @D |pg||
pc|c9|nt|twcho: south shd overtake the @cQ|pg||
nt|twcho: and he will be able to enjoy one more @c winner then|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rodal f: Had two nice free cards. Small @S or @D9 with the nice @D3|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|henryb:  a good play by Wang to tell partner not to ruff declarer's losing @d|pg||
nt|petergill: then pitch a @d on the club, to retain control|pg||
nt|henryb:  or ruff and play @sK, @sA and ruff a @s|pg||
nt|twcho: with his preserved @dA entry|pg||
pc|cT|nt|petergill: Sorry, North is in danger of being squeeed - not good defence at all!|pg||
nt|kerasidis: u mean clubs|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, a good alternative|pg||
nt|petergill: North has pitched clubs, so the contract is safe, no matter what happens now|pg||
nt|petergill: If North pitches 2 spades instead of 2 clubs, 4@h would still have made |pg||

nt|rodal f: B23 3NT at OR. Will cost as here I belive. Was -2 at vul|pg||
nt|offthebend: so , NZ may pay for this overcall and keep opps out of a possible 4S contract |pg||
nt|rodal f: B8 OR at 5@S and here 5@H-1|pg||
nt|offthebend: 4S may have made on a non club lead though |pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 10: West's duck of the @H at trick 2 was very good defence|pg||
nt|henryb:  a decent 6@s for N-S|pg||
nt|patricck: 12 tricks available in No Trumps|pg||
nt|twcho: declarer play safe to get 8 tricks by refusing the finesse|pg||
nt|patricck: 6@D is hard to bid, but an excellent spot|pg||
nt|twcho: It is good for bridge to attract more young ladies to play. :)|pg||
nt|twcho: it will make bridge more appealing|pg||
nt|twcho: :)|pg||

nt|twcho: slam|pg||
nt|twcho: can they bid it|pg||
nt|rodal f: OR now start B9. The grand slam.|pg||
nt|patricck: basically just needing 4 tricks from the @D suit|pg||
nt|twcho: 3N on for NS|pg||
nt|twcho: as the cards lie|pg||
nt|petergill: In the Chinese Taipei Trials Final in 2010 and 2011, Patrick's team (oops, this Chinese Taipei team, I should say) beat a very strong team, most of whom which won the World ...|pg||
nt|petergill: Transnational Mixed Teams in 2007. |pg||
nt|patricck: The North/South bidding might tell him partner is short in spades, but finding out about that @C honour is difficult|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|petergill: In the Women's, China having won world cahmpionships in 2009 and 2010 are the favourites, with Indonesia some mild danger I guess, and Japan are one of medal contenders. |pg||
nt|petergill: and North could have ducked @CJ|pg||
nt|twcho: but EW have a cheap sacrifice over NS red slam|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 1@S? 2@S? 3@S? much too strong for 3, IMO|pg||
nt|patricck: a chance if they bid it for Japan to take a commanding lead|pg||
nt|twcho: but of course it is almost impossible to reach such contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: not now :)|pg||
nt|twcho: not any more. :)|pg||
nt|woozle: paula will doubtless drive this hand to game, and it will probably be made|pg||

nt|patricck: maybe that will do the trick and get to 6@D|pg||
nt|vbman: sometimes u save|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S Michaels |pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: when the heart finesse wins declarer can duck a spade, so would make on a spade break then as well|pg||
nt|twcho: what is 2@c?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jjsb: 1@h P 2@h and probably 3@c|pg||

nt|rodal f: The bomerange?|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: How many just blast the 3NT with the East cards, opp a 15-18 NT overcall?|pg||
nt|petergill: North needs to bid 4@d, to prevent 4@c and 4@d cues helping EW to slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: ther rest of the defence was fine, but the outcome for NS was very poor|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. 180 minus 100 ake 2IMP|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Next round China Hong Kong - China|pg||

nt|petergill: first Precision team.|pg||

nt|twcho: and buy the contract cheaply at 3@d|pg||
nt|vbman: this is even ok|pg||
nt|patricck: would East bid that with no honours at all in the minor suits? Probably not, so 6@D may have been a possible punt at that point|pg||

nt|woozle: Perhaps not. I forgot this is the women's field....I'd be shocked to see that double in another field|pg||
nt|patricck: well let's face it game is no bargain on the NS cards, quite lucky really|pg||
nt|vbman: 5dia wd indicate a cl royal|pg||
nt|twcho: I know. :)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|woozle: 4H needs three out of four: heart break, DA onside, spade ruffing hook, spade break|pg||
nt|twcho: so 2@c is DONT type overcall showing @c and another|pg||
nt|petergill: Jens might have bid more, possibly 4@D splinter or 4@s, with only 5 losers|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@S moderate raise, as would bid 3@H (opponent's suit) with better raise|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jjsb: North decided enough of discussion i want to play 4 @h and i guess this has no play |pg||
nt|rodal f: Was the X from W K Lai noted to E?|pg||
nt|andyv:  rebidding AQxxx suits has never been a favorite...I'd rather raise @ss|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H 5+ @h, 8+ HCP, GF|pg||
nt|patricck: If partner had either missing @S honour they could have doubled 3@S|pg||
nt|twcho: east is bidding to much|pg||
nt|twcho: For last bd, north can push a bit harder |pg||
nt|twcho: she is looking at a potential slam by her own|pg||
pc|d7|nt|offthebend: they have to find a way to cash 4 club tricks after winning a D - to beat 3NT |pg||
pc|d2|nt|twcho: for west, her partner is showing a powerhouse and she has ace and 3 trumps to support her|pg||
nt|petergill: AKQ109xx is not 9 points - it is 7 tricks, hence must jump to 3@D - rebid of 2@D is only for pointcounters, not for good bidders |pg||
nt|twcho: but of course she has her worry. They may have 2 quick losers in @c as 6@h is declarerd by her partner|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit to late for me now. Good luck Tommy and Aria + specs. See u later.|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|petergill: @CK lead leaves declarer with some work to do, to make 41H|pg||
nt|twcho: but partnership has to agree on the relative length in two suits in order to find the best partial/game|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|petergill: Good stop by NS, but will the 5-1 break cause problems?|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: west said sorry sorry|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: after pass|pg||
nt|rodal f: I understand him:) Clear quebids|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: no|pg||
nt|twcho: I think they play with screen, right?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think I'd try and keep the @H support a secret|pg||
nt|tejjyid: if I didn't pass 2NT, then I would bid 4@S|pg||
nt|tejjyid: now the defence has a blueprint of what to do|pg||
nt|jcwla: Not only did NZ not gain on 9, they lost 5, bidding 4@H but going down 1. So this one is all Indonesia.|pg||
nt|petergill: I would win @CA at Trick 1 and play @H, hoping they duck. |pg||
nt|petergill: West, being a passed hand, might risk 2@S over 2@H, at the suitable vulnerabiltiy for competing|pg||
nt|twcho: c u|pg||
nt|blewah: g nite Rodal|pg||
nt|twcho: Yes, this hand confirmed that NS play precision rather than strong @c|pg||
nt|twcho: @d|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphzek: yes|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y|pg||
nt|twcho: so the 6@c is understandable|pg||
pc|hT|nt|twcho: so NE are screenmates|pg||
nt|patricck: so if all those things were 50/50 propositions (I know they aren't) that would make game 31.25%|pg||
nt|twcho: one @s looks like bal hand|pg||
nt|twcho: 1N relay|pg||
nt|twcho: so I think north is relaying south's shape|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|petergill: Perhaps declarer should set up the side suit first, which is usually a good policy?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|twcho: just one down and an excellent result for EW|pg||
nt|rodal f: So well pressed by EW by a possible lost slam for China.|pg||
nt|kerasidis: i dont know what would be the ended contract if Mak opened 1@d|pg||
nt|tejjyid: although, apparently the defence aren't architects|pg||
nt|twcho: a convention with just stated response is of no use without discussion|pg||
nt|blewah: i think so|pg||
pc|dA|nt|patricck: with only one entry in the K@D maybe a @C lead is a reasonab;e shot|pg||
nt|petergill: Will he try @h after @CA?|pg||
nt|blewah: 1@s showed bal hand|pg||
nt|twcho: and they land on a perfectly safe contract|pg||
pc|d9|nt|rodal f: B21 ended as here 3NT|pg||
nt|jjsb: for down 2 . are we really suppose to bid 4@h rigth away Rodal?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: wel, that's a good start for NOrth and he can x-ruff his way home|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|blewah: will end up +2, my guess|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rodal f: Ain't @CQ free there? Not the K|pg||
nt|andyv:  they had to dbl hook the @ds starting with the J from S hand|pg||
nt|henryb:  The interference made it hard for N-S to exchange enough information. I wonder whether S would have bid differently with @sK instead of Q, which would make slam excellent|pg||
nt|petergill: East should have bid more, with 6-4 fit, thus only 5 losers (only one loser in @s, and 4 others), e.g bid 4@c cue bid|pg||
nt|petergill: and 10 trumps is so much better for slam than 8 or 9 trumps|pg||
pc|h9|nt|petergill: A useful agreement could be for the delayed 2@S by East over 2@H to show spades and a minor, on the grounds that with only spades, East could bid 2@s directly over 2@D |pg||
pc|d5|nt|jjsb: oh well i guess yes ... EW are not playing badly in minors thougth so .. |pg||
nt|rodal f: Me. Never. 3@H always |pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|petergill: she seems to have 7 tricks even if she loses trump control|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: time to claim 9 and move on|pg||
pc|s8|nt|petergill: the 590 will be just 5 imps to Fr Poly, with @DA the (unapproved, in my opinion) opening lead to 4@s undoubled at the other table|pg||
nt|offthebend: Yes CQ is better card and get the encourgement by west|pg||
nt|patricck: finding the good news straight away|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rodal f: The 2@D I'm unshure at. 2/1 and foring with color or rev drurey?|pg||
nt|jcwla: The third choice of course is 1NT but hard to think that could be best.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rodal f: B9 The wrong side made the ask but not finnished.|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: oh claim 8|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|offthebend: she ain't making 10 tricks any more |pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: or squeeze S in spades and hearts, someone points out, for the overtk|pg||
nt|petergill: There's a vague case for N to lead @DQ at Trick 1 - the idea being that partner with (most likely) 4 trumps might not want a heart ruff, so the top hearts can wait. But @HA lead is ...|pg||
nt|petergill: normal. |pg||
pc|d8|nt|petergill: Chinese Taipei women's team includes two women who almost made their Open team, so they should do well too|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@HX at OR -300|pg||
nt|twcho: certainly, 33 @s will bring her the 11th trick|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rodal f: B23 also at the table|pg||
nt|petergill: Indonesia needs 10 VPs to win the event. Their opponents need 21-9 win to take the gold medals|pg||
pc|sT|nt|jjsb: i like to have some kind of shortness to play a 21-22 game contract even on 9 card fit ... |pg||
nt|rodal f: OK. Let them find it and take 1 IMP. 4 @H make risk as I feel it.|pg||
nt|jjsb: i would have double maybe showing some cards a good 3@h bid |pg||
nt|rodal f: Was the deal with ure mate. Cards or hart:)|pg||
nt|blewah: 3@s, 5@h, 1@d, 2@c|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|twcho: as long as east dare to introduce his @s suit, it is very difficult for NS to buy the contract|pg||
nt|kerasidis: would any one open this 1@d?|pg||
nt|andyv:  reverse the @ss and @hs, and 1NT is fine|pg||
nt|patricck: now cash the diamonds and clubs and hope that East is squeezed in clubs and hearts|pg||
pc|s7|pc|h5|nt|twcho: i would open 1@h|pg||
nt|petergill: With spades 3-0, entries to the South hand are a bit limited in 6@S, and one might have to overtake @HJ (if @H ace is ducked), use @H as "replacement trumps" to make 6@S|pg||
nt|petergill: anyway, RKCB would keep one out of 6@S|pg||
nt|rodal f: 7@S |pg||
pc|s9|nt|petergill: @S ruff looks best, as East cannot have 6 spades on the bidding|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|jcwla: Of course.|pg||
nt|patricck: for the overtrick|pg||
pc|s2|nt|henryb:  A kibitzer points out that RKCB keeps modern players out of these 50% slams|pg||
nt|patricck: a bit unlikely because East already known to hold 5@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Now -1?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|rodal f: Same bidding (seen away from the hard 2@D) til 3@H. Then the roads splitted. Endstation at OR 6@CN |pg||
nt|twcho: lucky that south didn't double them|pg||
nt|twcho: so just a small minus for them|pg||
nt|twcho: and north plays for the safest way of getting 3 tricks in @s|pg||
pc|h8|nt|petergill: Declarer is in dire danger. I think @S to queen and ruffing spades in dummy looks like a much better plan|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: =|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|twcho: by playing AK and then small towards J|pg||
pc|c4|nt|henryb:  This one was better than that after E shows clubs and hearts|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|petergill: East knows by adding N's points that N has @DAQ, so will exit in spades|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry, he doesn't know that - North could have @SJ or 1DQ|pg||
nt|petergill: or @DAQ|pg||
nt|petergill: I think West has discouraged @d and encouraged @S|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: K@D in Hand|pg||
nt|twcho: this will gain for Qx doubleton offside|pg||
nt|blewah: brb|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|dT|pc|c3|pc|c7|nt|petergill: oops|pg||

nt|petergill: I tried to download it from the website (under Participants) earlier but it seemed to make my computer crash|pg||
nt|rodal f: B9 OR 3NT as here|pg||
nt|kerasidis: Rodal?|pg||
nt|rodal f: B6 will become a new swing. OR 4@SE and CR 3NTW+2|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: NS Talk about last board|pg||
nt|tejjyid: "well done"|pg||
nt|rodal f: A two IMPer to come for Singapore I belive.|pg||
nt|petergill: Happy to take 8 tricks - I might have settled for 8 tricks if vul, but not vul I don't mind -150, trying for @H duck |pg||
nt|vbman: machine dealt hands always have some kind of safety in them----- if u have a fit bid|pg||
nt|patricck: play the spades for 1 loser to make slam in spades|pg||
nt|twcho: it is unwise for north to balance|pg||
nt|twcho: First of all, they are vul and @d will be covered by any M and NS is impossible to buy the contract|pg||
nt|petergill: duly done|pg||
nt|petergill: -1. On the bidding, playing North for a doubleton club honour was possible, e.g. by low club towards ten|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  so far no slam hands and this one headed for the 4 level in @hs and 5 level in @cs|pg||
nt|andyv:  strong xfer preempts?|pg||
nt|rodal f: By the askes W showed @S color.     3A - @HK, but never the nice @C AKQ9|pg||
nt|vbman: if e bids 1 h it will be lot easier|pg||
nt|petergill: as North with 55 and 1 spade has 2 clubs, most likely one of those cards is honour|pg||
mb|1D|nt|kerasidis: i wish i could hear them:)|pg||
nt|twcho: should S introduce his 2nd suit after 3S or the double?|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 1@d Precision|pg||
nt|petergill: 1NT might be a transfer to clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: yes|pg||
nt|rodal f: A part score to come again|pg||
nt|jjsb: 2@c opening is precision style of course |pg||
nt|rodal f: B22 also 4@S as here|pg||
nt|andyv:  I usually don't have a 4 loser hand when I preempt but maybe I should try it.|pg||
nt|andyv:  S will not go gently|pg||
nt|jcwla: Might end in 4@H.|pg||
nt|andyv:  since E didn't bid game, S must assume that N has some values|pg||
nt|twcho: actually if east opt to pass 4@h, it is not without chance|pg||
nt|petergill: My slip - i didn't notice South has void in hearts - sorry about that|pg||
nt|woozle: played with great diplomacy|pg||
nt|twcho: and may push the opponents to a making 4M contract|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rodal f: 3@H som S? Pre emt|pg||
nt|rodal f: Came|pg||
nt|rodal f: P|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: :)|pg||
nt|petergill: If playing Stayman that can be weak, East would have bid 2@C directly over 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: 2@D ask|pg||
nt|twcho: if so, they may be able to push the opponent to one level higher|pg||
nt|twcho: 1@c by east is precision|pg||
nt|twcho: 1@d negative|pg||
mb|2C|nt|twcho: and collect more money|pg||
nt|patricck: A quiet moment after all those games and slams and grand slams|pg||
nt|rodal f: As often at part score trumh lead again is right.|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C is often weak, so NS have some work to do now, to reach 4@H|pg||
nt|twcho: so it is time for north to enter the fry|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: S are missing @DJ for have fynny cards here as well, but @DA10 can be droped|pg||
nt|offthebend: 10 card H fit but you can ONLY make 1H |pg||
nt|rodal f: Payout for some|pg||
nt|rodal f: 5@C+ and 4@S|pg||
nt|rodal f: This can be -2|pg||
nt|patricck: I would have been happy with a simple negative double by East|pg||
nt|rodal f: Same here, but there system might|pg||
nt|twcho: she shd just keep silent by passing 2@c quietly|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@D Precision|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C = both minors, could be 5/4 either way|pg||
mb|2H|nt|petergill: To save or not to save?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Max was 3@C|pg||
nt|offthebend: it was hard to get to 3NT by EW on this bidding |pg||
nt|kerasidis: could ...but N could not imagine it is 6 card|pg||
nt|vbman: sp set as trumps quickly|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: B24 also 3NT but S to lead a @S and 12 tricks for a push|pg||
nt|jjsb: and we will probably play 3nt no @h fit and around 25hp thougth here its not the best contract |pg||
nt|twcho: this contract is destined to fail|pg||
nt|petergill: South should raise to 3@C, then 3@H by N?|pg||
nt|patricck: 2@C just 4th suit, not agreeing @S i think|pg||
mb|3H|nt|petergill: 2@H transfer|pg||
nt|twcho: so I add a "may". :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  3N would not be among my choices with two small @d|pg||
nt|petergill: A triumph for the weak 1NT here|pg||
nt|petergill: South might misguess hearts, if @H10 is ducked at some stage|pg||
nt|petergill: The bonus @D trick is immaterial|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 4@S makes as long as declarer does not lose trump control|pg||
nt|rodal f: A two IMPer came as exspected|pg||
nt|patricck: 5@D and 3@S|pg||
nt|vbman: next round maybe|pg||
nt|vbman: just imagine 1dia-2cl sequence|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Last round for today|pg||
nt|petergill: Bidding has marked the @H lead, and if South shows long spades, West MUST attack on opening lead to try to get tricks before they run away, thus lead his strongest suit @H|pg||
mb|4N|nt|woozle: Pele uses fourth suit, presumably to choose between 3NT and 3NT|pg||
nt|twcho: 5@d/@h is makeable |pg||
nt|twcho: but impossible to bid|pg||
nt|twcho: given the color|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: No relay so color. 2NT=relay|pg||
nt|jjsb: let see if they can find a better minors game |pg||
nt|petergill: Scores at http://www.2011apbf.com/Rrr2_S.pdf do not include the previous round ... Indonesia leading, Japan (Yamada) not far behind|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@D Precision, 2@D forcing|pg||
nt|petergill: Too high, assuming West is on the ball on opening lead|pg||
mb|5C|nt|petergill: the undertricks are only 50's, so no big loss compared to 2@S making|pg||
nt|petergill: Good dbl by N, avoids the trap of bidding 5 over 5 with too few trumps (even though 5@S might make on perfect play)|pg||
nt|rodal f: B22 China made 1IMP|pg||
nt|jjsb: nice lead |pg||
nt|rodal f: Now E will hook once more for 8 tricks and run|pg||
nt|vbman: no way to go wrong in sp|pg||
nt|patricck: well, actually I could go wrong in spades|pg||
nt|patricck: I like to take two finesses with this holding by leading to the 10@S and then running the Q@S from dummy|pg||
nt|vbman:  6 or 4 better?|pg||
mb|p|nt|offthebend: why not a practical 3NT with S hand instead of 4th suit  ? 5m/6m looks awfully distant on that bidding |pg||
nt|twcho: east found the good lead of @c although north has opened 1@c|pg||
nt|petergill: I like 3@S over 3@H, forcing as 4th suit was GF|pg||
nt|petergill: North bids 3NT over 3@S, suggesting void, and North's 4@S now is slam try, as otherwise would bid 4@s directly over 3@H|pg||
nt|petergill: but I can see all 4 hands, he cannot|pg||
nt|petergill: 5@C 1 or 4|pg||
mb|5S|nt|andyv:  so, NS play non-leaping michaels as one noted commentator speculated|pg||
nt|rodal f: Am not shure Patrick by a @S lead:)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: partner might raise 2@S to 3@S; now 5/6 minor more interesting|pg||
nt|patricck: I get two finesses which is as good as anyone else, but when the cards are like this it is interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  sorry, they don't play it (didn't see the dbl)|pg||
nt|twcho: now they may make|pg||
nt|twcho: finesse @s to discard the @h loser|pg||
nt|twcho: this is a serious mistake by east|pg||
nt|twcho: she has the @hJ|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: 2@C=5@C+4M this time and a vul game lost|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: because although that line should fail with the cards like this when the small @S is led from dummy it is very hard for South to duck smoothly with Kx|pg||
nt|petergill: Up to West now ...|pg||
nt|petergill: Attack = man (woman too), passive lead = mouse|pg||
pc|cT|nt|rodal f: Or a auto after the bidding?|pg||
nt|woozle: What would that be? North can't have spades|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Can have 3 of them, surely?|pg||
nt|petergill: N is known to have 0 or 1 spades, so S has very long spades. If you don't attack, S will be able to find sidetricks somewhere.  |pg||
pc|c6|nt|petergill: I think N can be endplayed for 300 instead of 500|pg||
nt|twcho: so no way for south to misguess|pg||
nt|twcho: and her low @h return is of no plus side|pg||
pc|c4|nt|woozle: I notice that she heard about a 5/5 shape and still just bid 3NT|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|rodal f: @C or @D to play?|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3-3 in @C than that is correct. Drop the A@D than that is correct. We see it but declerer|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Look like play for Ax@D|pg||
nt|twcho: now the contract is in danger|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|nt|twcho: although still makeable|pg||
nt|petergill: I think a club was the killing lead, almost impossible to find|pg||
pc|h2|nt|petergill: S might find East with @CA and @SQ and play the bidder for @HA, although fav vul preempts as dealer can be very weak indeed|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|petergill: 150 or 100 to NS. |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|nt|rodal f: B25 3NT as here. Normaly +1|pg||
nt|rodal f: Best now a @D and small|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@d would have been effective also in shutting out the @c suit|pg||
nt|patricck: should lose just one more @D from here to make 10 tricks|pg||
nt|petergill: 9 tricks, maybe 10 tricks|pg||
pc|h5|nt|patricck: sirry @D and @C for 9 tricks|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|petergill: I have made this same comment about 30 times in the last 3 years as a BBO commentator, and nobody ever seems to take any notice. |pg||
nt|petergill: This worldwide tendency to lead passively when declarer has a long suit is the single biggest imp loser that I can think of. |pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|nt|petergill: Even underleading the spade at Trick 2 to @SQ would not have stopped the endplay for 300|pg||
nt|petergill: Do you prefer 3@H, Pass or 4@d on the East cards, Henry?|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1@S always 7 but easy for OR to end an other place. Don't know there CC|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|petergill: Reasonable for N to run. |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|rodal f: -1 and not -2|pg||
nt|patricck: declarer was taking two finesses through North, he will be successful today|pg||
nt|twcho: 4@h is a better contract but south didn't try (or didn't have the tools) to find their @h fit|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|h4|nt|twcho: the lead has given declarer the 9th trick|pg||
nt|petergill: Fav vul preempts as dealer can be very weak, and xx is not great support for running tricks in 3NT|pg||
nt|petergill: Not reasonable is South not raising to 3@C in my opinion. |pg||

nt|petergill: Hi Andy, Jordon|pg||
nt|henryb:  P, probably, because I have a lot of defense. But 4@d might be better to force the opponents to bid at the 4 level|pg||
nt|petergill: Pass 3@d as smoothly as possible, hoping South balances?|pg||
nt|patricck: lol, I don't have the excuse that English is a 2nd language :)|pg||
nt|twcho: so let go the impossible game|pg||
nt|twcho: it is really hard to predict the result. :(|pg||
nt|offthebend: yes N can be short in Hearts biut still needs very good minors and S card to explore a slam |pg||
nt|petergill: Kyoko Ohno knew from @SJ play that North had @S10, and expected only 3 spades for 2@S (not 3@S), thus played West for @HA|pg||
nt|petergill: You have to take whatever tricks you can, as quickly as possible, when declarer has few cards outside of this long suit |pg||
nt|petergill: This is simple logic, but alas the world out there is not logical. Maybe that is what the problem is?|pg||
mb|1C|nt|jjsb: again i admit i have some problem to open that hand 1@c but well systemic so.. no choice .. here thougth nto causing problem |pg||
nt|twcho: while a @s lead will leave declarer finding for his 9th trick|pg||
nt|tejjyid: This is the South who just opened a 10-count and swindled a game...|pg||
nt|petergill: perhaps email 159 says that "Passing puts all your eggs in one basket, and raising to 3@C loses only when you can make exaclty 8 tricks in clubs" or something like that - I'm ...|pg||
nt|petergill: guessing|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: B23 at OR is 2@S W. Can be hard. Here it was 2@D+1|pg||
nt|rodal f: EW|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Next round after lunch Malaysia - Singapore (Open)|pg||
nt|rodal f: B10 ended 1NTN where this room played 2@D-1. Might a double score.|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 12: Perhaps 3@C by North, or 2NT by North (playable in 2 or more strains, else would pass 1NTX) after the Dbl?  |pg||
mb|2C|nt|petergill: a gain for the light opener - S played reasonably enough, though I like the costfree idea of leading @H10 in case it is covered by the queen |pg||
nt|petergill: Benito Garozzo (formerly best player in world, sillafu on BBO, now in his 80s) agrees wih me, or should I say, I agree with the great Benito|pg||
mb|2H|nt|rodal f: Some system chec and next?:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nope. Direct|pg||
nt|patricck: 6@D just on the @D finesse..... not making today, but 5@D is more likely to be bid anyway|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 2@C didn't actually deny that though|pg||
nt|patricck: well diamond finesse and 2-1 break|pg||
nt|twcho: because defense has kept their communication in @c so whoever wins the @hA, they still have 3@c to cash|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C Precision, 16+ HCP|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C 5+ clubs, 8+ HCP|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: perhaps he felt the gods were watching him|pg||
nt|petergill: I think that was the first significant card play error by NZ in the whole match - 40 of Indonesia's 41 imps have come from basic bidding errors by NZ players, such as when to bid ...|pg||
nt|petergill: game, how to compete etc|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW should wind up in a thin 3N contract|pg||
nt|twcho: :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: :)|pg||
nt|woozle: Maybe 2C didn't deny that, but for me to be persuaded by a sequence I'd have to see how they can tell the difference|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Any for 2/1 and 1NT by W?|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 12 at other table: Patrick bid a direct 2@C over 1NT at the other table (despite memories of the -1100 hand in the Daily Bulletin a few days ago) and NS at other table are on ...|pg||
nt|petergill: their way to game|pg||
nt|woozle: Park doubles 2D, and she's right - it's not making|pg||
mb|2N|nt|rodal f: 1NT one round force minimum|pg||
nt|patricck: at least that allows the @S ruff, so there are 3 tricks and 1 @D before declarer thinks about trumps|pg||
nt|twcho: so the only remaining possibility is finessing in @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|offthebend: Pele may be getting excited and try the slam |pg||
nt|rodal f: B10 I didn't watch. OR 1@S NS and CR 1NT+1 EW. A doubble score to come.|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@D means that if South bids, you can start doubling, with confidence|pg||
nt|henryb:  If E had bid 4@d she probably would have had a chance to double 4@s|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Yes, that's reasonable - immediate 3NT (previous board) definitely pregmatic on South minimum-ish hand|pg||
nt|vbman: will balance and reach 2sp|pg||
mb|3N|nt|petergill: Japan (Yamada) team won 2008 World Seniors Teams Championship, beating this Indonesian team in the Grand Final. |pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: Sorry, maybe I have my South's mixed up...|pg||
nt|vbman: no balance|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@D Precision, 2@D forcing like a new suit at 2 level|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: For a photo of Wang Hongli, she's wearing the red scarf at http://www.nwpu.edu.cn/english/NewsEvents/NPUNews/84817.htm|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 12 was 300 to NS|pg||
nt|petergill: Does any lead beat 3NT?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I hope 4@D is forcing...|pg||
nt|twcho: and this is also a deduction from this. Even if east tried @cA and another, declarer shdn't tried to force out @hA|pg||
nt|petergill: Bad luck - @S5 lead works better|pg||
nt|petergill: @S( lead (0 or 2 higher) |pg||
nt|petergill: need to cover with jack right now|pg||
nt|petergill: would not be a good hand to play too fast from dummy at Trick 1|pg||
nt|twcho: now make|pg||
nt|petergill: Other table: Good lead by Lim to gain 11 imps for Malaysia on Bd 8|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: That near slam for NS, where EW had there best at 5@C-2|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1@D still 0-6HP as u got from a spec Sylvian:)|pg||
nt|jjsb: 1@s is relay 2@c should shoulg a certain force ? 2@d is relay again |pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 12: 5@CX was a good save - 4@H would have made - declarer should play @HA then !J in 4@h, after West has shown 7-4 (and thus short @H) in the bidding|pg||
nt|twcho: because east is certainly the one holding it or else she won't play the @c that way|pg||
nt|petergill: I would have overcalled 1@S over a strong 1@C, but can understand passing. |pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|nt|petergill: I think Wang Hong Li would have passed 4@D, as @d length is a danger signal over 4@D - if partner cannot act with short @d, partner is likely to be weak|pg||
nt|offthebend: IS Kim going to Bid on -- doubtful opposite a passed hand !! East had to bid it |pg||
pc|h7|nt|andyv:  not sure what 2@s was all about...maybe an invite (replacing 2N)|pg||
nt|twcho: a @h lead will defeat it|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|rodal f: What if N had 15HP with @Da and not J. Still 1@S and not 1@C=16+ I belive|pg||
nt|rodal f: Kiwi at the lead after B10|pg||
nt|petergill: Henky Lasut finds the right play, as he usually does|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S on the flat 6322 vulnerable would be some people's choice, but too risky for me, can go for 1100 whenever RHO or LHO has 4 spades|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jjsb: i dont know what will be bidding but pretty sure North will find ways to shows 6-4 and that kind of strength :) and pretty sure also this will ended up 4@h |pg||
nt|jjsb: ty operator :) |pg||
nt|rodal f: Have S forced for game now. Normaly Y, but....|pg||
nt|duncan8622:  lost our commentator, ill take over|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|tejjyid: That's a good auction|pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer will try to duck first @d to East (not West), in case @d honours are split - thus will lead @D from dummy|pg||
nt|petergill: @H switch beats it |pg||
pc|c3|nt|petergill: Seems very likely|pg||
nt|petergill: E should be able to read the @s position|pg||
nt|petergill: Good defence |pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|cK|nt|offthebend: Lucky for North but Prime AK and Ace -- did not cooperate , very timid bidding |pg||
nt|jjsb: i cant see any clear way not to loose the 2@s 1@d and 1@c (at least) |pg||
nt|rodal f: Right u are|pg||
nt|petergill: I don't think so|pg||
nt|woozle: EW don't diagnose the perfect fit, but to digress and examine NS's auction - I can't see why anybody would bid 2D if the most that your partner will bid with all working points, ...|pg||
nt|woozle: working singleton and a double-fit is give a simple preference|pg||
pc|c9|nt|tejjyid: time-saving lead|pg||
nt|petergill: Well bid, but I'm not a big fan of 3@C - I think Pass is OK. |pg||
pc|c4|nt|petergill: 4 rounds of clubs, ruffing with @HQ, would be great defence, but alas S was dealt an attractive @S lead|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|jjsb: plus i have the impression the defense has a clear idea of North distribution |pg||
nt|rodal f: At OR N in 3@S|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@C guided South to 3NT|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rodal f: Might look at what the result could be if 1NT was 2/1. At @D contract u have some tricks|pg||
pc|d6|nt|tejjyid: Iexpoect Ace and anoterh @D soon|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: thinking|pg||
nt|petergill: Will Patrick pass or bid 3@C over 2@s at other table - any takers? Please guess. |pg||
nt|petergill: !8D by E was good play - @D3 would have told declarer about the imminent @d ruff|pg||
nt|petergill: @D8|pg||
pc|c5|nt|petergill: If a top sapde was led at Trick 1, then a club switch to lock declarer out of dummy would be great defence|pg||
nt|twcho: 4@d is cold for EW but they didn't try|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Well, of course he cant see the hand as we can|pg||
pc|c2|nt|petergill: South can do little else but continue @h and hope declarer errs later|pg||
nt|henryb:  Perhaps, but when you have 6@s partner might not have been able to act because of lack of spades|pg||
nt|petergill: Too late - he just bid 3@C|pg||
pc|s5|nt|tejjyid: he's worried by the Kxx of @D possibility; then he'd need some black suit magic to get home|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but if you bid the value 4@H, the opponents might be shocked into bidding their @D game|pg||
pc|c6|nt|andyv:  on this hand it works well as W hand is too top heavy in @hs...but usually with 9 hcp and pd overcalling 1NT, 3N seems to be automatic (esp. when vul)|pg||
nt|petergill: Now that he knows from @H9 that @HQ is offside, N attempts to sneak @d past E|pg||
nt|petergill: Spades might blocked, so 3NT is hard to beat on a spade lead even if declarer misguesses @DQ |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|jjsb: i take back the 4 loosers i see 5 now |pg||
nt|rodal f: B23 ended = ups. And 6IMP for China|pg||
nt|twcho: Indonesia recovers quite a bit by going only one down in 3H in bd 10|pg||
pc|c7|nt|petergill: one way to find that defence would be that if declarer has a 2nd @H, the defence has little chance|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, I agree 100% with Andy|pg||
pc|s6|nt|twcho: good guess by north|pg||
nt|henryb:  perhaps a 3-4-1-5 ten count|pg||
nt|petergill: True|pg||
pc|cT|nt|vbman: blew a few tricks|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|petergill: always push to a vul game opposite a 1NT overcall|pg||
nt|petergill: If @SK lead taken by ace, with suit blocked West would need to discard a spade on the clubs to unblock |pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|twcho: there must be some reason for east not leading his partner's suit|pg||
nt|patricck: 5@D might be possible, but who knows how the bidding would go?|pg||
nt|rodal f: B11 OR ended as here. 3NT|pg||
nt|patricck: all on the lead against 3NT|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|jjsb: East insure the down 1 and i believe rigth he is |pg||
nt|rodal f: U as me would have done the same at team.|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: 2@S = 4 cards|pg||
nt|jjsb: well not to be said u have to be a little "carefull" if east from that point ...|pg||
nt|jjsb: but i dont see any reason to play that Q @d |pg||
nt|rodal f: Must say that 3@S often is a heltier contract than 4@S, but it work and they need it.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|offthebend: 1S down 5 -- doesn't look very appetising to team mates :)|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|nt|tejjyid: perhaps this is the better line, in fact|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|petergill: but it requires a (quite possible, not double dummy at all) top spade at Trick 1 to have a look at dummy|pg||
nt|twcho: so 2@d+1|pg||
nt|twcho: only +1|pg||
nt|twcho: still a trump to lose|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: :)|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d7|nt|petergill: Declarer playing safely for 8 tricks, in case @s 4-2 and @H plays make him lose trump control|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|petergill: but with 9 points for the 3 @H stoppers and only 6 points elsewhere in 3433 shape, West's hand is more like a 14 count than a 15 count|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|dA|pc|s3|pc|h8|pc|h4|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sQ|pc|sA|nt|petergill: If @SA ducked on @s lead, East has to play low spade at Trick 2 (ignoring J in dummy) to unblock spades|pg||

nt|jjsb: coffee board?|pg||
nt|twcho: tks|pg||
nt|andyv:  but have to applaud the result...good brakes by EW|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h seems routine for NS|pg||
nt|andyv:  and I think this is the last hand of this set.|pg||
nt|rodal f: A 2@S end NS?|pg||
nt|petergill: and South has merely bid 3@S over 3@C|pg||
nt|petergill: so the 10 imps lost on Bd 12 is coming back to Taipei on Bd 13|pg||
nt|woozle: today the EW cards are freakishly distributed and 5D is making, but with more sedate breaks it could be a routine NS game|pg||
nt|offthebend: Paula was a passed hand so Pele knew she would be playing opposite 8-9 points at most - and may push opponents into 5D  |pg||
nt|woozle: All of these arguments make me wonder - if you're going to take this ultra-negative competitive position, why bid at all?|pg||
nt|petergill: shlould win first spade at Trick 1, shouldn't North?|pg||
nt|petergill: Trick 1 !9 - J - K - A seems normal to me|pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer was trying to safeguard against 5-2 spades perhaps|pg||
nt|twcho: but anyway it is not easy for EW to compete to 4 level|pg||
nt|twcho: so what they need is to find the killing defense|pg||
nt|twcho: which they failed|pg||
nt|petergill: Main reason for 1@S overcall is to get @s lead, 2nd reason is to remove bidding space|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: 24 and non vul. Time for a part score as exsplained earlyer.|pg||

nt|henryb:  14 top tricks in NT|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or might LIM open. Y did|pg||

nt|patricck: 11 easy tricks on spades|pg||
nt|petergill: = good lead - I approve :)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|vugraphzek: after lunch |pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree u. but 5@D could been bidded if the system was on. Anyway 150 and no looser comared 1@H pass|pg||
nt|petergill: at other table|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Seems so|pg||
nt|jjsb: 1s 4 @s and next one ! :) (1@s is limited so i dont see slam there ) better not to give some help for defense (thouth it wil be the dummy) |pg||
nt|jjsb: now alternative of coruse is what North made |pg||
nt|jjsb: a splinter |pg||
nt|jjsb: well maybe im too pessimitic not to see slam there , my bad ...|pg||
nt|rodal f: B24 NS tryed a slam by 4NT ask and ended 5@H . Here it was 4@H+1|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty to Chayes, our wonderful operator for doing a wonderful job|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: left 3 boards :)|pg||
nt|patricck: 2@H|pg||
nt|patricck: ?|pg||
nt|patricck: why not 2@D?|pg||
nt|vbman: bid 5c pls|pg||
nt|patricck: West won't pass that|pg||
nt|petergill: but with @SQ109xx, a top @d and either @HQ or another top @d, East might overcall 1@S, so I think best was to win @SA at Trick 1|pg||
nt|petergill: so Indonesian lead improving|pg||
mb|1H|nt|petergill: Three 16 board matches each day, just like the World Championships|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Full press for nothing?|pg||
nt|andyv:  ah, ok, I'll stick around and ty later:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2@H is OK. Ain't strong enough for 3@D=revers|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 13: Excellent 3NT bid by Herstein, now that I think about it. He hit a minimum hand and cold 3NT on low HCP - the game is about tricks, not HCP|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S or 2@C or Dbl now?|pg||
nt|vbman: might reach 6|pg||
nt|vbman: no make off course|pg||
nt|petergill: No squeeze in 7NT, or is there?|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: E wants to bid something, but what?|pg||
nt|twcho: after her pd responds 1@h, she shd simply raise to 2@h. That's it and you will leave the decision to pd|pg||
nt|twcho: the 1@s rebid is outright wrong|pg||
mb|2D|nt|rodal f: he 15 ruul is a good one to use. If ure HP+@Ss make 15 u have for a opening.|pg||
nt|offthebend: Paula apparantly is an aggressive bidder - so Pele can hold back a little |pg||
nt|twcho: it describes a completely different picture to partner|pg||
nt|duncan8622:  should be a flat board with 4S, though possible for EW to get too excited if W makes a negative X of 1S|pg||
nt|petergill: If 2@s was a Range Probe, then 3NT would show max and a 4333 shape I think|pg||
nt|petergill: The 12 imps on Bd 9 were (in part) gained by Malaysian West finding good 4@s bid whereas other West misled partner a bit about his @S relative to his @H/defensive strength |pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C Precision |pg||
nt|petergill: 1@D 0-7|pg||
mb|d|nt|petergill: 1@C Precision|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr all. 2@D obli|pg||
nt|rodal f: But might a CC variant by them?|pg||
nt|patricck: then it would need an alert|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Recipe for disaster|pg||
nt|tejjyid: You should bid the value of your cards as you see them; partner's aggression is THEIR problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: more could be said about the defence of the last hand, but perhaps silence is appropriate  |pg||
nt|patricck: bridge has many recipes for disaster|pg||
nt|vbman: east hand is golden|pg||
nt|petergill: Dbl take/out|pg||
mb|3C|nt|petergill: with @SK onside, 6@s plays well, but I think 6@s is a touch less than 50% chance, thus should not be bid. But I'm not sure|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@C was splinter|pg||
nt|petergill: some (not me) say not to splinter with bare king|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@D Precision|pg||

nt|offthebend: good and lucky part score bidding by NZ |pg||
nt|rodal f: 140 contra 300 ain't good|pg||
nt|offthebend: can collect 500 now on good defence otherwise 300 for sure |pg||
nt|twcho: the 1NT is a miniNT|pg||
nt|twcho: 10-13|pg||
nt|patricck: oops, where are we going here?|pg||
nt|petergill: If Dbl is t/o by East over 2@S, that would be nice, but is Dbl here t/o or penalty?|pg||
nt|petergill: East can keep @HJ to stop any squeeze in 7NT. |pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: 1@S=4@S+or 4@S and a longer color?|pg||
nt|rodal f: E have 11HP + 3@S = 14 Not a opening hand.|pg||
nt|vbman: 6cl|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Non know. But 4NT ain't bad if u find the @C|pg||
nt|rodal f: S need to pitch a bit by the @D. Still it's hard.|pg||
nt|petergill: 140 will be the outcome|pg||
nt|twcho: 2@d must be GF checkback|pg||
nt|petergill: and North's 5@H bid on Bd 9 was poor choice on balanced hand|pg||
mb|3D|nt|tejjyid: on the previous board, Pele had 4! great cards opposite the 2 suiter; simple preference there cannot be a questions of "style"|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: 3@H=4@S+and invit it seems.|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: East, who did not open a 13-15 NT, decided he had a maximum, but 4@s should fail, with black kings offside and @DQ a useless asset|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C strong|pg||
nt|twcho: given that west has to lead a @d from hand to set up her 10th trick. Defense has tempo in reserve|pg||
nt|petergill: Nil vul = good vul to compete, only -50 -50 = 3 imps out if wrong|pg||
mb|4C|nt|rodal f: How I love minisplinter and splinter at team. 3@D from N=singel and @S support. 4@D=renonce|pg||
nt|petergill: and with South unable to get North on lead, 3@d has more going for it, and West can tell this in the bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Website is http://www.2011apbf.com/|pg||
nt|petergill: EW make about 9 tricks in @D, perhaps 10|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzek: 1@S = 4@S 10-14 may have longer minor|pg||
nt|offthebend: If E does not Open the bidding , the hand can easily get passed out |pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C 5+ clubs, 8+ HCP|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 2@D asks |pg||
nt|petergill: East didn't lead a spade as he has no entries to his spades = makes sense|pg||
nt|petergill: S bids 4@C which solves his opening lead problem (which is always a factor in a competitive bidding decision)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jjsb: u can play on @h to discard a @c or play on @c to discard a @h :) i have more better card in club so im making +1 here :) |pg||
pc|d5|nt|petergill: 2@D was forced|pg||
nt|henryb:  2@h probably minimum|pg||
nt|petergill: I think West should bid 2@D over 1NT - it'|pg||
nt|twcho: but now make|pg||
pc|d6|nt|petergill: 2@S showed 5+ spades and invitational, denied 4 hearts. |pg||
nt|rodal f: B12 ened 2@SN. So might a new gain for Japan (L)|pg||
nt|patricck: declaarer won't be keen to finesse a club into the long spade hand|pg||
nt|patricck: What is an opening bid may be affected by the rest of your system. Another suggested offering is the rule of 20  which suggests that the HCP + the length of your 2 longest suits ...|pg||
nt|patricck: being at least 20 is a good indicator|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|rodal f: Still back to the splinter at NS contra minisplinter and splinter at team. Not match.|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H response probably shows minimum, 3@C and 4@C natural, 3@C showing the 6th club |pg||
nt|petergill: 4@D cue|pg||
nt|petergill: 4NT 1430, 5@C one key card|pg||
nt|petergill: 5@D asks, 5NT = @CQ, thus @CKQxxxx|pg||
nt|henryb:  5@d asks trump Q, 5N = Q and no side K|pg||
nt|petergill: 5NT also denies side king, thus no @DK, so 4@d cue must be singleton|pg||
nt|petergill: Can they ask for queens below 6NT?|pg||
nt|petergill: 2|pg||
nt|henryb:  so to get to 8 HCP must have major suit Q|pg||
pc|s3|nt|tejjyid: of all the recipes, 2nd guessing partner is the most dangerous|pg||
pc|s2|nt|andyv:  with A@c onside, this hand becomes even easier|pg||
nt|petergill: it's virtually always best to rebid your 4 card lower suit over 1NT |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|petergill: For profile of China Women's team of 2009, with photo of N and S, scroll down at http://www.clairebridge.com/textes/equipechine09.pdf|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@S is a fair contract, but will fail|pg||
nt|twcho: north didn't think hard enough|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|petergill: 2NT natural, forcing, does not have to be balanced, asks partner to bid out her shape|pg||
nt|henryb:  7N at worst on @d finesse|pg||
nt|petergill: Over 2NT, North would have bid a 4 card major, so South knows North is 3316 or 7+ clubs|pg||
nt|petergill: and probably has @SQ to make up her 8 + HCP|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|nt|jjsb: i think im making +1 also on playing @h thougth :) |pg||
nt|petergill: That allows EW to compete effectively |pg||
pc|c2|nt|petergill: Talking of "disaster", on Bd 8 Korea's North is in 3@CX on a small club lead, @d switch to East, another club. |pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|jjsb: its more "sexy" with the squeeze :) |pg||
nt|vbman: msut play for J10 cl tripleton first|pg||
nt|petergill: This hand plays like a dream for NS, as the cards lie|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|pc|c4|nt|rodal f: B11 the Aussies didn't find the defence and 6IMP more to Kiwi|pg||

nt|patricck: shortage points|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jjsb: ok so @c it was , as plann and +1 , next board ! |pg||

nt|rodal f: Esther in good mood?|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Spec told me 3@H was @S and invit by no shortage|pg||
nt|offthebend: In my opinion , NZ have bid and played better so far and scores show that|pg||
nt|jjsb: another 1@c this one the balanced hand |pg||
nt|petergill: The Results page has a Summary (overall scores) Page, and also the scoresheets and datums for each pair under each Round number|pg||
nt|henryb:  or @hQ. Which makes 12 even with only 6 clubs|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@S failed on Bd 13, so 3NT rightsiding the hand was a much better bid than 3@S. Points schmoints. |pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Next round after lunch Chinese Taipei - Australia (Open)|pg||
nt|duncan8622:  lots of imps exchanged this match with an unlucky 6D going down on bd 26 with a ruff|pg||
nt|petergill: S has to discard before W, so no squeeze|pg||
nt|twcho: and the bidding gives away little to them and it is much more difficult for her to find the correct defense|pg||
nt|petergill: so EW need massive swings on Bds 29 and 30|pg||
nt|petergill: 29 looks impossible for that|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: B12 OR NS at 2@H. Here 4@H+1|pg||
nt|offthebend: yes over 1H , 3D is limit or better and I think over 1S , 3H is limit or better without shortage |pg||
nt|rodal f: B24 ended=|pg||
nt|jjsb: on that kind of hand strong @c shows a big uperiority compare to natural system |pg||
nt|patricck: wow, I have just played it through and I find it hard to believe|pg||
mb|1C|nt|rodal f: Tapei can gain a bit here|pg||
nt|patricck: a very good slam, possible to bid, but not so easy|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y. There are some different rules made up. Which to be the best I will not argue abought. For me I drive the 15 ruul.|pg||
nt|petergill: 30 and 31 look possible, but not enough|pg||
mb|1S|nt|twcho: should be a pedestrian 4@s|pg||
nt|rodal f: *rule|pg||
nt|petergill: Well bid to 6@C by EW for Chinese Taipei|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: This time funny card EW. Net's see if they bid the slam in @S|pg||
nt|petergill: 110, not 140, I should have written - I cannot count very well. |pg||
nt|petergill: 2NT good raise|pg||
nt|twcho: this is the 2nd last bd of this match|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Puppet?|pg||
nt|twcho: still a very tight match with only 9 imps difference|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@c now will get them to 6@C|pg||
mb|2H|nt|rodal f: % for it is bad 33-35% cirka|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2NT range is?|pg||
nt|offthebend: 22 and a solid 5-card suit -- no chance of a grand slam now -- at least I doubt it |pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C Precision|pg||
nt|patricck: Happy driving then :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Heading towards 6@H, which is a lucky make with friendly @D position|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@H is a bit less than 50%, needs @DK onside and 3-2 break, or bare king or maybe bare minor honour in @D |pg||
nt|duncan8622:  need a club lead to defeat 3NT, found at the other table|pg||
nt|petergill: 5@C is the winner here|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzek: 20-22 semibal|pg||
nt|rodal f: 5IMP more to Kiwi at B12|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: 3@C puppet|pg||
nt|andyv:  I'd be tempted with the E hand to bid if I had some type of methods to show the majors|pg||
nt|andyv:  modified landy would work well|pg||
nt|rodal f: :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: As bouth tables drove right at this one?|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2@S alerted Chayes. |pg||
nt|robbroy: careful defence needed on 32 so 5IMPs up for grabs to Malaysia to tunr this match into a small win|pg||
nt|robbroy: 2@S Ghestem?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Michaels we call it|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Next round China Hong Kong - China|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: start in 30 min|pg||
nt|twcho: I would open a weak 2 with south hand|pg||
nt|petergill: Pass however does not :(|pg||
mb|3C|nt|rodal f: *Let's|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not Michaels not a cue is it|pg||
nt|twcho: don't know what is 2@s bid directlyover the T/O double|pg||
nt|twcho: most play it as weak|pg||
nt|twcho: and it will describe south hand perfectly|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Because 2Nt has wrongsided 3NT, he chose to play in 5@C|pg||
nt|petergill: so Henky Lasut, Eddy Manoppo, Munawar Sawiruddin and Bambang Hartono are heading towards another Championship win|pg||
nt|petergill: 29: 6@C can be made|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: In particular, Patrick Huang at the other table has played splendidly, as always - age does not weary him at all, after 5 decades of being the supreme expert in this part of the ...|pg||
nt|petergill: world (he first starred when still a teenager)|pg||
nt|offthebend: Pele needs to Cue and paula may as well take a shot after finding all key cards and DQ|pg||
nt|super nova: 5c probably 2 key cards and the queen|pg||
nt|jjsb: when i start 2nt and other start with 1nt we can all see why 1 @c is better" |pg||
nt|petergill: 1@D 0-7 any|pg||
nt|henryb:  an effective preempt to keep N-S out of their cold 4@h|pg||
nt|twcho: I don't want to suppress my 7 cards suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 4@D splinter|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 14 at other table: I don't understand North's Pass of 1NT - it's a bidder's game, and nil vul is the best vul to compete on (only 50 + 50 = 3 imps out if you're wrong)|pg||
nt|petergill: NS have missed their @D fit|pg||
nt|petergill: but surely he will bid 3@D now|pg||
nt|petergill: he's worried about preference to spades on a doubleton, then being doubled|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: Could we check Paula McLeish is still at the table.... did she really pass on the North hand over a 1@H opening?|pg||
nt|twcho: partnership have to take the positive as well as negative inferences from the bidding|pg||
nt|duncan8622:  4th best of longest/strongest works as usual|pg||
nt|petergill: I think 2@H was some major-oriented bid (11-15), perhaps even a variation of an American convention. 2NT asked and 3@h showed what South had. |pg||
nt|petergill: East assumed 2@S was 100% forcing, W did not|pg||
pc|dK|nt|twcho: effect the same now|pg||
nt|twcho: still buying the contract|pg||
nt|twcho: at 2 level|pg||
nt|patricck: I know it is red vulnerability, but......|pg||
nt|woozle: Certainly check her pulse|pg||
nt|petergill: Worries too much?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|petergill: This looks easy ... but|pg||
nt|rodal f: A healty one.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: in our room N bid a silly 2N which forced them too high|pg||
nt|petergill: They will bid this slowly to 6@H, I think. I have no idea what their bids mean. |pg||
nt|petergill: Romex style Asking Bids in action here|pg||
nt|twcho: looks like one down|pg||
nt|twcho: and Indonesia will have a small gain|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rodal f: If 20-22 and 5@C with 22HP. Should S upgrade to 23HP. I mean it's correct but....|pg||
nt|jjsb: 2nt not fitted i guess ? |pg||
nt|petergill: Thought he had the title wrapped up as long as he didn't go minus 1700, and he is right|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|twcho: and the cards are lying friendly for declarer|pg||
nt|patricck: very strange bidding in the other room|pg||
nt|rodal f: B12. I asked. If 2/1. Or used it but ended 5@C|pg||
nt|twcho: don't understand why N hasn't supported south's @s?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|petergill: There's a good case to bid something on the East cards, especially if 2@S shows spades and a minor. The argument is that if you don't bid something, partner will surely lead the ...|pg||
nt|petergill: suit of your small singleton, which will eb a very bad start for the dfence, and you are not vul, so take the risk and avoid your fate defending 1NT|pg||
pc|cK|nt|petergill: For any NZ fans out there, datums for NZ Open Team's pairs in Rounds 1-7 are: B-C +19, +14, +8 and -30, T-W -19, -13, -5, +24 (vs P Huang) and -18; B-L -51, -31 and -23. |pg||
nt|petergill: Good point, Andy|pg||
nt|petergill: i.e. 2@C as takeout for majors|pg||
nt|petergill: How should 6@h be played?|pg||
nt|twcho: with east hand, some may opt for 1N overcall|pg||
pc|c5|nt|patricck: I tracked down the system card. 2@S was a 5-5 hand with 5-6 losers|pg||
nt|petergill: Strip black suits then play @D how?|pg||
nt|petergill: how about low @D towards queen, so that bare king has to give ruff and discard?|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ain't 2@S to hard if Michals? An obvious X and bid or if needed re open.|pg||
nt|petergill: After Indonesia win this title, tomorrow they start the Zone 6 Playoffs for Bermuda Bowl and Venice Cup|pg||
pc|c4|nt|woozle: EW need a diamond ruff to beat 5S|pg||
pc|d5|pc|cT|nt|rodal f: B25 ended =|pg||
nt|twcho: the 1N rebid probably shows 18-20 bal|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: 17-19:)|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|twcho: a tie bd|pg||
nt|twcho: OK, tks|pg||
nt|petergill: Passing puts all your eggs in one basket, that 2@S will be as good a contract as any. Although West is very weak, he has every right to be very weak at fav vul, so I think he ...|pg||
nt|petergill: simply completes the description of his hand by bidding 3@C. |pg||
pc|dT|nt|kiwibridge: top of the table clash between the two giants coming up|pg||
nt|twcho: luckily 5@c is also cold|pg||
nt|twcho: The overcall NT is of wider range spread and cover more distribution as well as you need more flexibility to cater for more hand types|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|petergill: Would you have inferred from North's faulure to bid 4NT opposite 4-5 in majors that @D6 opening lead was best?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|patricck: If I failed to take a bid on the east cards my partner would call a doctor to check my pulse|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|robbroy: if michaels as in other room can be weak or strong - East has a free bid of 3@H to show a better raise in one room but cramped here|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|nt|petergill: or should you cash @DA earlier, then if West drops bare @D king, use preserved @CQ to endplay West if West has @CK?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|petergill: Or lead @D8 toward @D ace in case West covers with J109x?|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|jjsb: ok so its no swing here again |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|petergill: On the club switch, one can play for AQ onside or for South to have Ax doubleton and be unable to get N on lead|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|sT|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@H showed 4522, so the actual hand was quite possible|pg||
pc|s9|nt|twcho: so we are moving to the last bd |pg||
nt|petergill: Here's a list of China's World Champions in 2010 (including their bridge team here). Bridge being below Model Ships on the list perhaps shows our place in the world as a sport. ...|pg||

pc|d3|pg||
nt|twcho: by ruffing the last @H|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|pc|c7|nt|petergill: Alas, EW have blocked their spades, and E disposed of a possibly-winning spade on the clubs - defending 1NT is not easy, even for experts |pg||
nt|petergill: I like "strip hand then play low @D"|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|petergill: China win Open and Ladies, Indonesia wins Seniors, Singapore or China in U26, and Australia leads U21 but has Singapore and China close behind|pg||
pc|h7|nt|petergill: the latter requires keeping N off lead - unlikety if N has @HK. |pg||

nt|petergill: Bd 31: Declarer's idea was that if North had @SK (as expected on the bidding) and South had @SJ, North would rise on the spade towards dummy's ten, so declarer does only -1|pg||
nt|ianmcc: but why cover @h?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h3|nt|petergill: Yes, covering @hQ was a major error, caused by the shock of finding South with the spade honours. Shock commonly causes "suspension of logic" at the bridge table|pg||

nt|andyv:  board 12 proved to be a disaster for the Kiwis|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Next round Indonesia - China  ( Ladies )|pg||
nt|andyv:  fun hand here, Perer|pg||
nt|andyv:  Peter|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Last board for today|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Thank you|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Last board for this set|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Thank you ALL|pg||
nt|patricck: a small swing to Chinese Taipei, but the match clearly in favour of Japan who will now be 2nd a long way ahead of 3rd, but still with a lot of work to do to catch China who are ...|pg||
nt|patricck: leading|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: next round after lunch Malaysia - Singapore (Open)|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Last board Thank you|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: next round start in 25 min|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Last board Thank you|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Next round after lunch|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: China Hong Kong - China macau|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Last board|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Next round start in 30 min|pg||
nt|by: I think I like leading @d8 from hand after stripping better :)|pg||
nt|petergill: At other table, Kamto did same play as this table|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Last Board Thank you|pg||
nt|woozle: flat board, but a missed opportunity for both NSs|pg||
nt|patricck: Thx for the usual efficient vu-graph operation Chayes|pg||
nt|woozle: EW down in 4H here...looks non-impressive|pg||
nt|patricck: and thx to all my fellow commentators for their valuable insights|pg||
nt|patricck: I think the West hand is a weak 2@S, not a 1@S opening|pg||
nt|twcho: so chances are there for both sides and defense finally emerged as the winner|pg||
nt|twcho: So we are now moving to the last board|pg||
nt|duncan8622:  5D reached on 29 at the other table for another 10 to Aus|pg||
nt|petergill: I think @D6 lead at Trick 1 is correct (looking at only 13 cards), not a double dummy lead. |pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Last board for today |pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Thank you|pg||
nt|petergill: But risky daring stuff is not the disciplined Japanese style at all|pg||
nt|petergill: which won them the 2008 World Championship|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 15: @HA is a good card, @SQ looks like a good card - he actually has quite a good hand , once partner's 2@S suggests @h shortage. Still, if 2@s is systemically non-forcing by ...|pg||
nt|petergill: discussion in advance, then it is East (or their bidding system) that erred|pg||
mb|1D|nt|vugraphzek: Australia - New Zealand (Lady)|pg||
nt|patricck: that is what drove EW to a poor game in the other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Last board |pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Thank you|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|nt|twcho: tks Chayes for the excellent work|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Indonesia - Chinese Taipei (Open)|pg||
nt|twcho: thanks to the excellent work by our wonderful operator, Chayes.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|petergill: Thanks to Chayes Luang-On, our operator who has done a great job, and to the people in Malaysia who make this broadcast from Kuala Lumpur possible|pg||
nt|rodal f: Last board. Ths to Chayes. Exelent vug job. Tks to the specs for all ure inputs. Make u be at the alert. Ths also to Gupta and Ebery by ure nice comments.|pg||
nt|jjsb: ty operator !!! let me take little tile to thank all our vugraph who does an awesome job !! |pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Next round start in 50 min|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Thailand - China Hong Kong (Open Team )|pg||
nt|jjsb: i can assure u (i did it sometimes) its more complicated as what u think.. players can just not play from like 5 minutes and then cards will literally throw on the table !! if ur ...|pg||
nt|jjsb: not ready !! |pg||
nt|vugraphzek: :)|pg||
nt|by: I think most people would instinctively play this way not realizeing that the ruff-and-sluff from Kx offside isn't enough|pg||
nt|by: I predict a push board |pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 15: Of the Aussies, I expect Gosney is a certainty to find the best play in 6@H, Delmonte, Hans  and Nunn almost certain to find the best play with the slight extra chance in ...|pg||
nt|petergill: the slam|pg||
nt|petergill: Perhaps tiredness set in at the other table on Bd 16|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 1@C Precision|pg||
nt|jjsb: moind u , Sout watched the vulnerability before doing that one :) |pg||
nt|petergill: Indonesia have reached 5@H on Bd 27, and look like losing trump control and going down|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Open|pg||
nt|patricck: ok, HL Chun thinks it is neither. I can sympathise but I don't agree, even when the hand isn't perfect I like to push my opponents around when I have spades|pg||
nt|duncan8622:  though it was a luck make, essentially needing doubleton J of Diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|offthebend: thx all |pg||
nt|rodal f: As the spec shall have the same by there comment putting us at the sharpness|pg||
nt|jjsb: but this can create a little problem actually ....|pg||
nt|petergill: which should make the score about 51-10 to Indo for Bds 1-9 and Bds 11-13, with 4 bds still to be scored |pg||
nt|twcho: and thanks to all for watching|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Last board Thank you all|pg||
nt|duncan8622:  lucky*|pg||
mb|4C|nt|petergill: Patrick Huang did well to find the heart ruff needed to beat 6@C at the other table|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ths for inviting me Chayes. Been nice together with u nice specs:)|pg||
nt|jjsb: to reach 3nt that is |pg||
nt|petergill: 1@D Precision, 11-15, could be short|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: China Hong Kong - China|pg||
nt|robbroy: hmmm|pg||
nt|patricck: Thx Chayes for the Vu-Graph operation and thx to everyone else for taking part|pg||
nt|petergill: Boring 4@S to finish|pg||
nt|duncan8622:  or Jxx with 4 or more clubs in the same hand|pg||
nt|twcho: Tks Chayes and all our spectators giving tips to assist my commenting.|pg||
nt|twcho: and Congratulation to China Ladies Team|pg||
nt|petergill: after about 8 days of solid bridge, errors start to happen  |pg||
nt|petergill: For Zone 6 Playoffs, Open = China - Japan and others (Singapore, Chinese Taipei, Hong Kong maybe). Ladies = China - Indo - Japan - Chinese Taiepi - Phillipines and perhaps another ...|pg||
nt|petergill: to playoff. |pg||
mb|p|nt|jjsb: can we considere that any of the EW player got a clear stopper? |pg||
nt|jjsb: not easy...|pg||
nt|rodal f: Seems as @H8765 is good enough for 3NT |pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like 4@s without interference from the opps|pg||
nt|petergill: 53-10 I think, Bds 1-9 being 41-1 to Indo|pg||
nt|rodal f: Tks for u exelent work Chayes, as well as the comment from u specs ( keeping us at the needel) and TKS Patrick leting me beenig ure co commentor. Lovly.:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: :)|pg||
nt|patricck: Last Board, thanx to Chayes for the excellent vu-graph operation, and to my fellow commentators for their instructive advice. And of course thanks to all the kibitzers. Without you ...|pg||
nt|patricck: we woldn't be here|pg||
nt|twcho: They have claimed the Championship|pg||
nt|petergill: Last board - thanks to Chayes who has been an incredibly consistent and excellent operator in Kuala Lumpur. |pg||
mb|5C|nt|petergill: South might have bid 3@S (not 2@S) at fav vul versus ctrong club (perfect conditions for maximal preempting) as 6-4 (or 6-5) shape is as good as a 7 card suit|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr:(|pg||
nt|twcho: this bd is more challenging for declarer|pg||
nt|petergill: The passed hand South's bid of 2@D at the other table is 100% forcing - with @d's, he would bid 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|robbroy: Kop Khun Karp Khum Chayes|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: :)|pg||
nt|robbroy: Khun|pg||
nt|robbroy: tight defence required|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Tomorrow First round China - Indonesia ( Ladies)|pg||
nt|petergill: EW didn't make a contract in these 16 boards, bad luck. Thanks Chayes for good operating as usual|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 1@C Precision|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@H = interesting - I would bid 1NT, but as they dbl on light values, they presumably like 1NT to be a bit stronger|pg||
nt|robbroy: bad start for Singapore|pg||
nt|rodal f: Why 2NT here? System faul? 1NT by 15 and....|pg||
nt|robbroy: they play a version of blue club|pg||
nt|twcho: of course this is everyone's expectation even before the tournament starts|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: B25 gave 1IMP for Indonesia.|pg||
nt|woozle: EW bid the routine game...now they have to make it|pg||
nt|twcho: But their performance surely match with their status of World Championship|pg||
nt|petergill: The titles are decided today. The Playoffs for places in Netherlands begin tomorrow. |pg||
pc|hT|nt|petergill: 2@D 5+ @D, 8+ HCP|pg||
nt|alok_daga: NV VS V North did not enter the auction?|pg||
nt|petergill: Perhaps this sort of thing - attention to detail - explains why Australia and China are at the top of the leaderboard. |pg||
nt|petergill: Patrick Huang would have played it right|pg||
nt|woozle: whether you win or duck the spade, you'll need the diamond finesse for the contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Last board|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Thank you|pg||
pc|h4|nt|petergill: and in my opinion N should remove bidding space early by raising spades directly, but his silence might prove golden, I guess|pg||
nt|petergill: and so it does!!!!|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit diferent style at OR and here. OR 2@S - 4@S. IMPs to Thailand|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: 10 imp for Thailand :)|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@S fast arrival, weak in GF auction|pg||
nt|duncan8622:  slight swing potential here if declarer loses only 1 diamond trick|pg||
nt|petergill: A club lead is best, though 3NT might fail on any lead|pg||
pc|hK|nt|petergill: Sucked them in. |pg||
nt|robbroy: open 1@S with weak hands or 4 card suits I believe|pg||
nt|twcho: strange that east didn't look for slam|pg||
nt|petergill: Deserved imps for Japan here|pg||
nt|petergill: I think the heart lead was right, because Axxx is often best avoided as a lead to 3NT or 1NT - the ace suit can provide the entry later. |pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|petergill: I think South can place North with @DQxx and might pass 3NT, even if she thinks there's a 4-4 @h fit|pg||
nt|henryb:  A less happy contract than 3N|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jjsb: sensible lead .. that give that contract |pg||
nt|jjsb: funny that both line reach a contract that both suppose to be down and that after all they ended up making it ! :) |pg||
nt|andyv:  N pretty limited by initial pass|pg||
nt|andyv:  so range was about 8-10 or maybe a bad 11 that didn't open|pg||
nt|petergill: NS will survive their bidding misadventure only if 3NT fails - how does 3NT go on a @d lead?|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks to Chayes for his usual great job as operator. |pg||
nt|twcho: with such a good hand|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|petergill: An interesting point for a partnership to agree on (in advance) - does 3@s allow South to bid 4@s over 4@H, or is the responder to the 2@S preempt in complete charge, with the 2@S ...|pg||
nt|petergill: preempter being a disciplined person who must pass 4@H? China clearly thinks the latter. |pg||
nt|petergill: I think East has bid his hand with 3@S and should Pass 4@S, not double it. Then West will bid 5@C.|pg||
nt|rodal f: B13 ended 4@H at OR as here|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Last board for today|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Thank You|pg||
pc|h6|nt|petergill: Win @DA, run @C9? |pg||
nt|henryb:  you own a lot of tricks: 3@c, 3@d, 2@s, 1@h for example|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@S, on patient defence, also fails |pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|twcho: so defense has gone wild|pg||
nt|twcho: if north goes up with the ace, south's @s will be established before west @c|pg||
nt|twcho: and there is no way for him to gather 9 tricks|pg||
pc|c2|nt|by: eh, ok, likely a dull board, but not flat ... |pg||
nt|petergill: Still on Bd 15: Given no !J lead from J109x, best play is @d8 towards dummy, duck if bare king appears, else rise with ace and elad low towards queen. I think.|pg||
nt|petergill: Well bid by EW. A bit unlucky that North chose to lad a low @h at other table|pg||
mc|11|nt|rodal f: Not as I've seen but u're might right.|pg||
nt|robbroy: 3@S to ask for @C but count was preferred so a guess for N now|pg||
nt|petergill: oops, I spoke too soon. |pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Thank you|pg||
nt|petergill: North might have tried a top @h to 3NT, warned by 3@C bid of likely source of tricks in dummy - when you have long suit in dummy, perhaps attack more, to try to get your tricks ...|pg||
nt|petergill: very quickly. |pg||
nt|petergill: Congratulations to Indonesia on winning the Championship|pg||

nt|petergill: so this weekend many of the teams going to Netherlands will be determined in the Zonals. |pg||
