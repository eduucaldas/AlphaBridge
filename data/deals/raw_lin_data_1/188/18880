nt|granguru:  hi all|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: Hi all - as every time there are problems before the first match - players has to find the right table and so on|pg||
mb|1C|an| |nt|pelu: not with odds - but better that a "Roland-slam"|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Pleased to see that South has a name, but I think I'll stick with 'South'|pg||
nt|granguru:  exchange black QÂ´s and it would have been a rock iron contract|pg||
mb|1S|an| |nt|pelu: we begin with a possible slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: Rodwell did open the N hand with 1NT???|pg||
mb|2N|an| |nt|peachy: Hi John|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  I would have done it if @CK|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think many in the field will bid this one|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|granguru:  NICE TO see u again Raija |pg||
nt|granguru:  11 tricks|pg||
nt|peachy: Convention cards are not available so unfprtunately we cannot explain bidding|pg||
nt|granguru:  at NT or any Moysean|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|pelu: and I would open 1@D 100% (=4+@d)|pg||
nt|paulg:  North has distribution and they have a lot of controls|pg||
nt|granguru:  4@C cue X @Cs|pg||
nt|granguru:  N could have xx to show second round ctrl|pg||
nt|pelu: when N open 1Nt then Meckstroth has no slam ambitions|pg||
nt|pelu: RD = 1. round control|pg||
nt|granguru:  but then it is more complicate to show @d ctrls|pg||
nt|granguru:  RD is second if 4@C was first|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|pelu: @H-lead - 2x@s and @C finess|pg||
mb|6D|nt|pelu: ok that makes life easyer for dsecl|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  If I would be forced to guess  1@C strong 1@S=4 ctrls 2N nat 19-21 3@D @C ctrl no @D ctrl|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|nt|paulg:  It is much easier for us, but can South have less than this to make a slam try with no heart control?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|peachy: lots of work in 6NT, not impossible I think, but rather aggressive|pg||
nt|granguru:  a passive lead is a must here|pg||
nt|peachy: I'm thinking E will lead club, that would be my choice|pg||
nt|granguru:  it seems 3@d was nat as N went on to 6@d|pg||
nt|peachy: but I am not in Hurd's class of player so we'll see|pg||
nt|granguru:  most passive is @D|pg||
nt|granguru:  the @D10 is a critical card (not here thou) so W has 4 critical suits|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|granguru:  N S expects that @S dont behave...|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|pelu: do u know players where cuebid are 1. control - to day 1. or 2.? back in the 50'es in US they only cuebid Aces - and lost to Italy every time :)|pg||
nt|peachy: that would have been my last choice of leads, Jxx nearly never right|pg||
nt|granguru:  I am wrong E leads|pg||
pc|s6|nt|granguru:  E has a clear @d lead|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sT|pc|s2|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h4|nt|peachy: perhaps there is something in the bidding that we are not privvy to, which induced the spade lead|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: dummy is a disappointment|pg||
pc|dT|nt|henryb:  Obviously Wortel suffers from the same problem against Flannery that so many Americans suffer against Multi: the feeling that you are getting robbed gets you to bid on at best marginal hands|pg||
pc|dK|nt|roswolf: good comment henry|pg||
nt|eggy: well if x shows diamonds, surely you are worth a bid aren't you Henry?|pg||

pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|henryb:  Ben Thompson wrote on Bridge Winners: First double shows cards, second double is takeout, third and later are penalty. Don't bid on marginal hands. Either you will get another chance or it doesn't much matter|pg||

nt|henryb:  Yes, I was more referring to the first double|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i would play x as a general t/o withh at least 4 diamonds and 2@S as constuctive natural - therefore i think west is wrong to pass with a singleton spade|pg||

nt|brolucius: Jeffrey Allerton and Frances Hinden (who is playing at the other table) are a couple, and have won the prestigious Gold Cup (Britain's top knock-out) together.|pg||
nt|brolucius: So far as I know, Hinden has never played women's bridge. She is a top executive for an oil company.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: what do we know about their systems?|pg||
nt|brolucius: E/W were playing straightforward stuff against Russia. I assume that the French play the standard French system, near enough. It will be good kibitzing.|pg||
nt|granguru:  but it is a good idea that the very first control is A (or KQ)|pg||
nt|pelu: no|pg||
nt|granguru:  not vul sorry only 22!|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|granguru:  would like to hear your arguments...I am open minded :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|granguru:  kibz might enjoy an expert view on the matter|pg||
nt|paulg:  I don't think cue bidding first and second round controls equally makes a huge difference to bidding slams, a lot of it still comes down to judgement|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  i think the italians beat the americans so often because they had practised partnerships and better bidding methods|pg||
nt|granguru:  being an  expensive deparment players try to reduce judgement and increase accuracy|pg||
nt|granguru:  good advice...on all contracts under 6NT|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|granguru:  agree paul|pg||
nt|paulg:  this hand has another debatable point .. how do you break transfers?|pg||
nt|pelu: too difficult to start a cue bid if only A, a cue is an invitation for slam and often u will miss that - and bidding economy also tell u to start with the lovers cue bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Since there were so many small boards in the first half, I was hoping that all the spectacular stuff had been saved for the second half. False hopes...|pg||
nt|granguru:  from 6NT on the strategy changes|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Murat|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hello everyone :)|pg||
nt|pelu: 5 toptricks for defense, but not easy to take them|pg||
nt|paulg:  i dislike showing a weak doubleton and telling them what to lead|pg||
nt|granguru:  at top level players almost always lead the right card|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|nt|granguru:  so it is better to bid accurately|pg||
pc|hA|nt|brolucius: East has found a strong lead.|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|pelu: now 7 tricks for Tokay|pg||
nt|pelu: prob 3@C dont show about @Cs but only maxz and 3 card support|pg||
nt|paulg:  but i approve of breaking the transfer with only 3-card support, when you are so suitable|pg||
nt|granguru:  once hamman erred a gran slam lead...20 years the hand was appearing in the news|pg||
nt|peachy: running scores Round 3 (this round) http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/orrrunda3.html|pg||
pc|dT|nt|granguru:  And he used Judgement..with 2 aces he led the shortest one..(wrong)|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|MolvaM: running a long suit usually creates problems for the defence|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|pc|cQ|nt|brolucius: Now a club ruff will beat it.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: -1 with best defence. a @c switch now|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  @h9 ?|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  looks to ask for @d|pg||
nt|brolucius: Failing that, a trump misguess by declarer.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and in that case possibilities to -2|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  E isn't willing to ask for a @c switch, not knowing what partner has in @c I think|pg||
nt|brolucius: South was declarer, after a transfer response to 1@C, at the other table.|pg||
nt|brolucius: We thought, in the match against Russia, that they seemed to be playing reverse suit-preference. So, maybe she has asked for a club.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But if there is any possibility to defeat, it must be a @c ruff by E. Declarer can have @sKQJ|pg||
nt|pelu: in CR EW missed the defense against 4@S - played by S: @H to K, @D to A Now @CK to A, @S to 8 and Q, @CJ to Q - but not @C again|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|pelu: now 9|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|h3|nt|pelu: well played by W - he set up a trap - and N fall in|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and looking happily for the 10th|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|pc|d6|nt|granguru:  looks that there is no way to win...no entry to dummy|pg||
nt|granguru:  @DK ?|pg||
nt|peachy: There are 15 groups of 8 teams each, the top three (I think) will advance to the Swiss, from where top teams advance to KO etc|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|granguru:  what about small @d ?|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|nt|peachy: from each group|pg||
pc|c5|nt|brolucius: So the chance is missed.|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|brolucius: Ralf's analysis is good. It does seem that a club switch was indicated.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s9|pc|s4|pg||
nt|granguru:  at 6NT the reason is not to give the 12th trick ...normally declarer coudnt find a suit to play...so usually no long suit..if 12 tricks there, there is nothing to lose...but if just 11 you must be carefull not to give 1 trick on the lead.|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|d|mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|eggy: I suppose that is possible that they forgot to check what 2D meant and thought it was a multi?|pg||

nt|granguru:  garozzo had another saying..when you have a singleton, lead it...|pg||
nt|granguru:  obviously at suit contracts|pg||
nt|peachy: It is one of his famous "Rules"|pg||
nt|granguru:  in general, it made life easier for the defense...if you didnt lead a singleton..you didnt have it...|pg||

nt|paulg:  his line did have a lot of play|pg||

nt|granguru:  as I said at the beginning ..probably @S finesse instead of a @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: Mahaffey won the first match 17-13 against a team from Romania (with Bocchi-Maddala!?), Aspe lost 10-20 to a strong team from England|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h3|nt|roswolf: this looks straightforward|pg||
nt|henryb:  no good, you have promoted the @s9 with two high @d ruffs|pg||
nt|han: I believe bigtrain is correct, west's trump doesn't get promoted as he has to underruff at trick 12|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|pc|hT|pg||

nt|eggy: S will play a club to the Ace intending to play back to the 7 should West play 9 or T|pg||
nt|han: I am not sure south should do that after seeing east holding 4 spades and 5 hearts|pg||
nt|han: almost impossible for east to hold 4 clubs as well|pg||

nt|MolvaM: so 1@s probably shows 3 card spades?|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry - prob support x in @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: I don't know that 1@H was right when East had indicated the majors.|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  maybe it was also meant to show real @c|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  unsure though|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3@h is for me a strong 3@s rise and an invite to 4@s|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and baldurson dbl is kind of a support dbl?|pg||
nt|pelu: ok he was down 2 - but recived a gift|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Allerton may have misread 3@H but East can correct.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Anyway, this is the sort of board we were looking for, after so much drab stuff.|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  he has a pretty good hand, in context|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but you agree with the strong rise David?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|granguru:  under this premise I agree fully..the same philosophy of the 6NT lead..dont give tricks away to declarer on the initial lead.|pg||
nt|granguru:  when you have points in all side suits normally declarer has a solid trump suit...|pg||
pc|cK|nt|brolucius: Presumably intended as that. Since 1@S shows very little, as I see it, East might also consider 3@S.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but the best with this bidding is that W has shown his @h honour|pg||

nt|rcerreto:  could W consider his hand balanced?|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  then open 1NT (or rebidding, if 1NT is weak)?|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@C was presumably non-forcing, so it is hard to see how East had enough to look for an 11-trick game.|pg||
nt|granguru:  well he treated the  hand as a croos ruffing type|pg||
nt|granguru:  and protected potential @d tricks|pg||

nt|han: 2D?|pg||
nt|han: and then push some more?|pg||
nt|dburn: he should probably bid 2@d for the moment, I guess|pg||
nt|roswolf: rehi all|pg||
nt|han: I would also have passed with Kamil's hand in first seat, any openers?|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|dburn: he could bid 3@s, I suppose, but he would prefer a fourth club for that |pg||
nt|eggy: what would 3S be?|pg||
nt|eggy: I seem to be 3rd in line on that one :)|pg||
nt|han: not only that, he is much stronger than partner would ever expect|pg||
nt|dburn: still, it's what he's gone for - he must be confident that 3NT isn't the last making game|pg||
mb|p|nt|han: now Kamil knows the big fit in clubs|pg||
nt|roswolf: is slam in the picture here it might well be|pg||
nt|dburn: I should think Kamil could just about bid it now|pg||
nt|han: if partner has x AKxxx xxx AJxx slam is very good|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes opposite a splinter raise his hand is enormous|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|han: Kamil does not agree|pg||
mb|6C|nt|eggy: He may not be as enchanted by a spade shortage, but will expecct a 4th club|pg||
nt|roswolf: cluck cluck i think|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|eggy: but Weinstein doesn;t :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|han: perhaps they play that 5C is somewhat positive?|pg||
nt|roswolf: but south is there - itrust there are no ethical issues|pg||
nt|han: the fact that north did not bid 3NT is good news for Weinstein|pg||
pc|dT|nt|han: this is almost a claimer|pg||
nt|eggy: I suppose from South's point of view, N is very likely to be a 2 suiter on this auction, as he was a past hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|peachy: Kamil's team is listed as transnational, not USA, in the event|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  S multi 2@D|pg||
nt|paulg:  good result for Meckwell in the other room (probably not the last time we'll say that in this championship)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|paulg:  I've noticed many pairs treat the Multi 2@d as weak with spades when it comes to their 2nd seat defence|pg||
nt|pelu: and 5@H close to make on a small @S-lead |pg||
nt|paulg:  it's rare to see that in the UK, but would work here|pg||
nt|paulg:  3@h from North?|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk3: No credit for my hy-phen?|pg||
nt|pelu: for D = balanced 12-15 or any 16+|pg||

nt|peachy: really light third-seater here|pg||

mb|3D|nt|paulg:  that is the norm in the UK too|pg||
mb|4D|nt|paulg:  4@d will be 'bid your major' (4@c would have been transfer to your major)|pg||
nt|granguru:  yes many play 2@D x= short in @S |pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: wd by West|pg||
nt|granguru:  and 2@d - 2@h 5+ @H|pg||
nt|paulg:  this is similar to the situation in the Open Room, where West doubled|pg||
nt|pelu: forcing pass in N?|pg||
mb|5H|nt|brolucius: Be careful because jtr is watching.|pg||
nt|granguru:  now a correct flag in W ...thanks Michal|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: ??? dbl from me as E|pg||
nt|paulg:  surely not a forcing pass situation|pg||
mb|6C|nt|pelu: but East help him, in on @CK he played @D - ruff, @C to A @S to 10 and duck - and now endplayed - East sh play @C back and no endplay|pg||
mb|p|nt|rcerreto:  a cheap save on 4@h|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@S has escaped a double, but the cards lie well for declarer so the lack of a double will not cost E/W much.|pg||
nt|granguru:  In the meanwhile NS surpassed the safet level of 5@C|pg||
nt|granguru:  is 6@C makeable?|pg||
nt|granguru:  after A GAROZZO's lead|pg||
nt|peachy: on the surface, looks like just lose a spade, whether the tricks are there is another matter|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: but still a dbl....|pg||
nt|granguru:  2 discards on reds|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|pelu: why not - u have bid game Red against green |pg||
pc|dA|nt|pelu: its for me a good standard rule|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s4|pg||
nt|brolucius: Had the cards lain differently, not doubling might have waved goodbye to 500 or so.|pg||
nt|brolucius: East may have feared a third-hand opener, but her side was vulnerable.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a thirs hand opening, but I can take 170 extra if declarer makes|pg||
nt|brolucius: West does not know that partner holds 10 points, so he cannot double 4@S even with an extra value or so. |pg||
nt|ralfwil: but shouldn´t E?|pg||
nt|pelu: now N can make 1NT - topplay @Hs and only 6 tricks for EW|pg||
nt|granguru:  3 discards on reds sorry|pg||

nt|rcerreto:  should she risk -420 to get 100 instead of 50?|pg||
nt|dburn: risk? what risk?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Better to risk a double in the first place.|pg||
nt|Walddk3: An excellent 6@D now|pg||
nt|dburn: declarer could have the singleton king of clubs only if she had about ten cards rather than thirteen|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  can declarer have one more @d one less @c?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@d on NS - a nice contract|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  N was declarer, I think|pg||
nt|Walddk3: In theory, there is a club ruff, but fortunately for declarer, the defender with the singleton club also has @DA|pg||
nt|brolucius: An interesting bidding test. If they bid it, I will applaud.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 6@C is more tricky and that might be reached.|pg||
nt|Walddk3: They may arrive in 6@C, though|pg||
nt|Walddk3: With problems on a spade lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: can they make 1C after a @c lead? I doubt|pg||
nt|brolucius: This is the sort of board we were hoping for. No-one wants these matches to be decided on small margins after some drab boards.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry @s lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@c after a @s lead....|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|brolucius: If one side wins after doing better on the big boards, then good luck to them - (even if they are not from England)|pg||
nt|murat: that was unexpected|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the contract went both ways during play and finally declarer came out as the winner|pg||
nt|paulg:  Seeing your partner pass when you have a balanced zero count is never good|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|pelu: 34 HCP - I exp slam with most tables|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@s now from South?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|ralfwil: If declarer plays @d before havinc cleaned trumps, another @s will set up a trumph trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: D'Ovidio has started well by emphasizing the diamonds before supporting clubs.|pg||
nt|granguru:  NS has a score sheet we all like to bring to the comparison table...all NS scores|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk3: 6@C in the closed room|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Waiting for the lead|pg||
nt|Walddk3: @SQ|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: but not so easy to bid the Grand|pg||
nt|granguru:  7@D should be|pg||
mb|2N|nt|brolucius: Ouch!|pg||
nt|murat: would you also prefer 2@s ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Imagine winning the board with 3NT.|pg||
nt|brolucius: A spade lead would not beat 3NT if clubs were 3-2.|pg||
nt|brolucius: not beat 6@C, I mean|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ralfwil: true!|pg||
nt|paulg:  tougher when you have not shown your 5-card support for partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: roller-coaster :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: this is interesting|pg||
nt|murat: Tokay should work some |pg||
nt|MolvaM: has to keep south out|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  Even if that doesnt mean anything, usually it is a good sign...|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|peachy: Declarer does not know how hearts sit so he might duck one, but as it is, does not matter|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|nt|pelu: would u X in West or bid 2Nt?|pg||
nt|paulg:  i would have started with 2@d (inverted) personally, even if showing your 4-card major first seems to be growing in popularity|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|d6|nt|pelu: but then u would mis a 4-4 fit in @H - pd could be 4-4-3-2|pg||
pc|d8|nt|murat: dbl i guess|pg||
nt|pelu: for 100% 2NT|pg||
nt|MolvaM: I would bid 2nt|pg||
nt|pelu: 2NT = 16-19, D + 2Nt = 20+|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|nt|MolvaM: whenever I double, lefty bids 4@h and pd bids 4@s with 4 cards|pg||
pc|h5|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|murat: i prefer 2NT with 15-17 |pg||
nt|murat: bad 18|pg||
pc|dT|nt|peachy: Doubledummy = seeing all four hands, ducking is wrong. Not seeing all four hands, it is a normal play|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|h2|pc|s6|pg||
nt|pelu: many play that 1@D - 2@D = no 4 card major|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|brolucius: So, 20+ IMPs swing due to a 4-1 break. Well, that's part of the game. Hard to take, though.|pg||
nt|murat: he was afraid of Q@c |pg||
pc|sK|nt|pelu: @cQ and @S back and Tokay will regret that he used his only entry to dummy|pg||
nt|MolvaM: kibs are shocked... to play clubs from hand is purely double dummy. he cant do that|pg||
nt|pelu: but against storng defense his plan sh fail|pg||
nt|MolvaM: he can hope that @cA is with north but very hard to play for both honors to be there|pg||
nt|pelu: if S has showed distrbution in the black suits - and easy defense for N|pg||
nt|MolvaM: well some days even 2 club tricks could be enough|pg||
nt|MolvaM: he could catch the @dQ|pg||
nt|murat: he's hopeless now|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|han: I think so too, even if partner has 3 spades it isn't clear whether 4S is better|pg||
nt|han: and by bidding a direct 3NT you give less information to the opponents|pg||
nt|roswolf: defence could get 2@H +2@D +@S|pg||
nt|han: double dummy declarer can easily make it|pg||
nt|han: by cashing clubs and spades and exiting in hearts|pg||

nt|roswolf: east thinking -why - just return pards suit|pg||
