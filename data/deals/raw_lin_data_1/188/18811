nt|roswolf: rehi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this will be interesting my longtime partner is sitting north and Sandra Penfold has been my teammate in open competition|pg||
nt|roswolf: rehi all|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi john|pg||
nt|granguru:  :) |pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but i have lost some weight:)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|roswolf: classic weak2 by east|pg||
nt|psyck: website shows 37 for Harding instead of the 42 here...|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:   Hi Geoff, hi everyone|pg||
mb|3D|nt|granguru:  hehehe|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have 3NT     can they reach it|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|granguru:  me too...|pg||
nt|granguru:  35 pounds|pg||
nt|granguru:  protein diet|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1nt is beleieved to be a transfer to @C|pg||
nt|riccho:  hi everybody :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: looks like 4@h makes with the @c double finesse, but EW have a cheap 4@s sacrifice.|pg||
nt|ady: hi John|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: hi all|pg||
nt|roswolf: rehi all|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|roswolf: can n/s avoid anything stupid -perhaps not|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would double as south if i was to do anything|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thats quite a good hand in e after 3d|pg||
nt|ady: hi Geoffrey|pg||
pc|hA|nt|roswolf: n/s system is steam age ACOL (4CM) + many gadgets|pg||
nt|roswolf: a simple 4@S TO BID|pg||
nt|hajru:  Welcom back.|pg||
nt|hajru:  I don't have convention cards for NS, but it looks like they play limited opeing bids.|pg||
nt|hajru:  Welcome Riccho|pg||
nt|arno11: good afternonn everyone|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Looks like this is making even without getting the @d right|pg||
pc|h5|nt|hajru:  Did we just get new players?|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|spooky: Both teams had a good start of the swiss, Brogeland scored 24 and Penfold 24 VP in the first match of the day|pg||
nt|roswolf: a gentle enough bd to start|pg||
nt|granguru:  weak long @Cs|pg||
nt|roswolf: on a very good day slam may be on from west's point of view -nut no heroics are needed at the moment|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  is there a safety play against 4-0 either side?|pg||
nt|ady: was a difficult opportunity for Vriend to make up some ground|pg||
pc|h7|nt|roswolf: the players will have the correct names shortly|pg||
nt|roswolf: GOOD TRUMP LEAD|pg||
pc|hK|nt|roswolf: their nt is weak normally but they may have varied that|pg||
nt|spooky: Tor directly in a 4-3 fit.|pg||
nt|roswolf: WELL THE WEST HAND SHOULD MAKE SOME TRICKS IN THIS CONTRACT|pg||
nt|arno11: noon*|pg||
nt|riccho:  after 14 Boards is Finland leading by a single imp (24-23)|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h6|pg||
nt|djneill:  hi all|pg||
nt|granguru:  making 10 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello John, Dan and Geoffrey|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi Dan|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|granguru:  hi |pg||
pc|dA|nt|roswolf: west kept his powder dry sensing no doubt that any + score would likely to be good|pg||
nt|roswolf: odd play trying a subterfuge|pg||
pc|d5|nt|arno11: we see a very close match 1 imp difference after the 1st half http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/r32runda1.html|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jcomyn: well the point is when 30imps down you have to do something and it is hardly foolhardy|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|roswolf: this could be ugly|pg||
nt|hedyg: good afternoon :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: Michal will post the names asap|pg||
nt|roswolf: just the right players names to be put in|pg||
nt|pelu: a lot of bidding to come to 4@h|pg||
nt|hajru:  This makes more sense: 3@C some kind of bergen raise (6-9, 4 trumps), 3@D a range check,|pg||
nt|hajru:  3@s a cuebid which looks like an overbid to me|pg||
nt|hajru:  but we ended up in a safe contract, with declarer about to make 11 tricks.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  cashing the A could have been wrong if South was void|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|d3|nt|psyck: looks like W can manoeuver a @c ruff though|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|roswolf: HMM NOT quite the best defence|pg||
nt|roswolf: well 3nt is on the club finesse and i think should have been bid|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|nt|hajru:  Declarer will win the 2nd trick, knock out the HA and end up with 9 winners|pg||
nt|riccho:  no idea where they come from, but the names sound bulgarian|pg||
nt|hajru:  Well, yes, they sound south-east european to me too|pg||
nt|arno11: NS are from russia|pg||
nt|riccho:  IÂ´va been told that that NS come from russia :) thatÂ´s why I hate guessing :) |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|psyck: in 4@h by winning @hK 1st round|pg||
pc|h9|nt|odysseus69: West had much more than East was expecting|pg||
pc|h2|pc|dJ|nt|hajru:  We start with an easy contract|pg||
nt|hajru:  Does anybody know where the NS team is from?|pg||
nt|riccho:  yes, but with this short matches here (28 bds) every imps can be decisive|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|c4|nt|yorkbeach:  safe to take the @h finese for 10 unless you think North has both missing @d|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  not so safe having crossed to dummy|pg||
nt|roswolf: hardly likely on the play to date|pg||
nt|blum1956: There were no reason to duck a diamond unless  the declarer was going to take a heart finesse|pg||
pc|c8|nt|hajru:  losing an imp or two against the 4H contract at the other table|pg||
nt|jcomyn: have noticed a great deal of ultra cautious bridge inh this event|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|roswolf: i dont think so -2?|pg||
nt|roswolf: not much hope for the defence|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair point|pg||
pc|s7|nt|yorkbeach:  a 3-card @d lead was rather unlikley on this auction - could probably tell from the spot cards as well|pg||
pc|s2|mc|11|nt|jaapfr: gm all|pg||
nt|psyck: @s punches also would have worked in 4@h|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/frunda1.html|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: http://www.poznan2011.pl/|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm i think that west must have a long solid suit for jumping otherwise he could just bid 2@D|pg||
nt|jcomyn: agree after p passed|pg||

nt|rcerreto: not going for a special brilliancy prize|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rcerreto: "overbidding" is an underbid|pg||

nt|rcerreto: yes|pg||
nt|jcomyn: Hearts|pg||
nt|rcerreto: 3NT looked pretty normal to me|pg||
nt|rcerreto: N is likely thinking of a possible ruff in @h|pg||

nt|roswolf: -2 for 6 imps to the norwegian team|pg||
nt|roswolf: no it didnt actually:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: trump again lo|pg||
nt|riccho:  so finland quadrupled their lead|pg||
nt|jbgood: Good morning all|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  9 on top in 3NT|pg||
mb|1C|nt|djneill:  push|pg||
nt|hajru:  No, don't think so.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  will be doing well to bid it|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Walddk4: East is  Arnolds     West is   Bakkeren|pg||
nt|roswolf: he is hardly pre-empting opposite a pard who didnt bid over 1@C|pg||
nt|odysseus69: in this era of weak jumps I am sure that West would bid 3D on less|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this plays well for ns|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H looks best game|pg||
mb|3C|nt|roswolf: will north bid his own suit?|pg||
nt|roswolf: a diversionary effort from tor?|pg||
nt|roswolf: this may be interesting|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
nt|hajru:  Good morning everybody|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|roswolf: HERE the bidding had reached 3@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: rubbish weak2M|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  looks like it :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not much of an effort from w - great opportunity to psyche|pg||
nt|roswolf: is not 5@C cheap|pg||
mb|4C|nt|hajru:  Not sure what happened here as it appeared that EW had 7 tricks|pg||
nt|odysseus69: probably 4H now but maybe something stronger|pg||
mb|p|nt|spooky: a very weak 1@S from Tor|pg||
nt|roswolf: psyche from tor|pg||
nt|roswolf: north passed - really|pg||
nt|roswolf: amazing|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3@S @HA @SA|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3@C|pg||
nt|hajru:  Yes, that is true.  |pg||
nt|hajru:  OK, did we really have a French person open a weak NT here?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And South's name has an  I  in the middle instead of an  O|pg||
nt|blum1956: hi all|pg||
nt|roswolf: VERY DIFFICULT FPR N/S|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  If North overcalls 3@c, South will be bidding on|pg||
mb|4H|nt|hajru:  I think we have the wrong board in front of us|pg||
nt|roswolf: we are off Holland v France/Monaco|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure|pg||
nt|roswolf: PASS BY NORTH NOT UNREASONABLE|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  something North knows, which is why he wanted a better suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: SOUTH MUST PROTECT SURELY|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi michael|pg||
nt|Walddk4: d'OVIDIO|pg||
nt|roswolf: AND NOW 3NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: far too optimistic - too much dutch courage for breakfast?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I doubt that EW are in 3NT|pg||
nt|blum1956: Bakkeren in 3@s|pg||
nt|pelu: as I remember W was in 3@s|pg||
nt|roswolf: well east had bid 3@H and 3nt looks ok then by west|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok i concede the contract is probably 3@S by west|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I am not sure EW are too pleased with the Russia flags they have, but of course they don't know|pg||
nt|blum1956: Probably making if West starts with hearts|pg||
nt|hajru:  That makes more sense|pg||
nt|roswolf: this depends on the @H guess at first blush but the trump break is inconvenient|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 2 imps for an extra undertrick in 2@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: heart support?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes this is bd 2 perhaps bd 1 fits:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: a steal by the dutch|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 2@H is ROUTINE BYT NORTH MAY BID ON|pg||
nt|roswolf: a high level adventure wont work out too good on this layout|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe 3@c can be weaker for them...generally stronger game forcing hand|pg||
nt|odysseus69: probably a waste of time to bid 4C|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|djneill:  I wonder if South will be able to show this strong a hand?!|pg||
nt|roswolf: all very mysterious|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2@s should be at least 1 down|pg||
nt|roswolf: on bd 1 3nt bid with no difficulty by the french|pg||
nt|odysseus69: whats best here? ruff and heart to king then play on spades - that certainly works|pg||
pc|h3|nt|spooky: NS had to many HCP to believe Tors opening|pg||
nt|roswolf: brian and sandra come from Yorkshire - a region known for its blunt way of speaking|pg||
nt|roswolf: competent bidding|pg||
nt|spooky: with everything right for declarer, they will make 12 tricks|pg||
nt|pelu: yes the bidding fit B1|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Benedicte Cronier playing at both tables, interesting|pg||
nt|roswolf: feisty auction this|pg||
nt|hajru:  East is Carla Arnolds, a long time player on the dutch women's team, who has won a lot over the years, including a world championship in 1994|pg||
pc|c7|nt|roswolf: ty:)|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|roswolf: sorry the caps key is having a life of its own:(|pg||
nt|roswolf: i understand bidding 2@S but i dont like it|pg||
nt|jcomyn: morning who's e and w|pg||
nt|roswolf: that looks good to me|pg||
pc|h5|nt|roswolf: north reluctantly passes|pg||
nt|roswolf: pass missed out|pg||
nt|riccho:  yes looks a bit weird; |pg||
nt|riccho:  but as bad as the play was; the bidding in the other room was even worse|pg||
nt|arno11: 10 from top|pg||
nt|psyck: other table got to 6@c after a similar 3@c rebid, another reason not to jump with W's hand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I think South is   D'Ovidio|pg||
pc|hA|nt|roswolf: yes lots of tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: well i would like it better if the @ss split better :(|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|hajru:  West is Ton Bakkeren, who used to be on the Dutch open team until last year.  His best result this year was 2nd in the Dutch open teams|pg||
nt|hajru:  NS we have Philippe Cronier and Catherine d'Ovidio, who have both played on French teams for ages|pg||
nt|odysseus69: easy when we see all the cards|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hedyg: anyhow this should make nicely with the 10@s dropping and A@H in S|pg||
nt|jaapfr: she is long time champ:)|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@S seemed natural or even a raise to 4@H was possible - passing seems very wet|pg||
nt|blum1956: Alas! Fair 21-HCP vulnerable 2NT missing|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hajru:  Yes, earlier Benedicte was playing with Zimmermann|pg||
nt|Walddk4: she is|pg||
nt|hajru:  Operator, please check!|pg||
nt|pelu: and give ud board 1|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup would be cool|pg||
pc|c9|nt|spooky: this lead didn't scare North|pg||
nt|roswolf: i am told 3cl...mimimum....3nt stiff spade|pg||
pc|cT|nt|arno11: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=14419   south|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|sA|nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
pc|s2|nt|djneill:  ok thanks geoff|pg||
nt|riccho:  good search :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ady: with Q@D right looks as though will make whichever line|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|nt|Walddk4: Shut down and start again pls|pg||
nt|Walddk4: we have wrong board numbers|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Pls do it now|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: ups...|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Walddk4: shut down and reconnect to the open room|pg||
nt|hedyg: the @d lead might have been made on the assumption that if pd ,who surely has lots of hcps ,passed it must be because he has openers suit|pg||
nt|hedyg: at some tables N might bid 1@s over 1@d|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|odysseus69: all well now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: as Carl Mathieson said yesterday. He was amazing at finding the right line and then said easy when you see all 4 hands|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|yorkbeach:  if NS had the bidding to themselves, South might show 12-14 balanced and North might pot game|pg||
pc|s8|nt|roswolf: true|pg||
nt|riccho:  finesse is wothout risk |pg||
pc|d8|pc|c2|pg||
nt|arno11: :) guess the rest is without picture|pg||
pc|s9|nt|roswolf: this is a huge bd for the french who may now be uncatchable|pg||
nt|ady: Vriend  well overboard OR|pg||
nt|jcomyn: clearly either pushing in other room or pushed|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jaapfr: ok 1 imp loss|pg||
pc|h8|nt|djneill:  3-2@h split slam cold, even 4-1@h onside may be ok, is that a good slam? but 5-0 offside not going to work|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|jcomyn: did she fall or was she pushed|pg||
nt|roswolf: probably a bit of both|pg||
nt|ady: had the chance to double 6@C for 800   chose to try 6@H|pg||
mc|11|nt|yorkbeach:  most of the top players open aggressively, doubt South was planning to pass|pg||

nt|rcerreto: very difficult|pg||

nt|rcerreto: but then, 3@d?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rcerreto: more likely an opening in @d , yes|pg||

nt|djneill:  I open South's hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: i might too|pg||
nt|arno11: there is north http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=10968|pg||
nt|roswolf: on bd 2 e/w in the other room is in 2@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: on bd 17 an overtrick imp to vriend|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  even better for the Dutch|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: everything lying right|pg||
nt|odysseus69: bidding thin games - finding tight doubles - stopping short of game when you think they are going to be in a thin one- but not bidding dubious slams- ways to recover a large ...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: deficit over 16 boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Helness  with only one  L|pg||
nt|spooky: Some strong NT I guess|pg||
nt|roswolf: first blood to the Dutch|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/frunda1.html|pg||
nt|hajru:  Yes, let's end the match now ;-)|pg||
nt|roswolf: south really passed?|pg||
nt|roswolf: EXCEPT FOR THE PSYCHE|pg||
mb|1N|nt|roswolf: 1nt probably precision 13-15|pg||
nt|jaapfr: E will bid|pg||
nt|ady: sorry   6@C never bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  hi all witam|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would look at my screen-mate and decide|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sorry not expecting a 1@S by N|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: yes|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  share Geoff's disbelief|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  must have miscounted|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks a straightforward 4@S|pg||
mb|2H|nt|granguru:  zarfans: 10+8+2+2=22 far from an opening bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1nt is stultifying|pg||
nt|granguru:  10+8+3+2=23 sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: i think gf actually|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome John|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi john|pg||
nt|hajru:  Specs, NS has to win by 2 imp's or more to reach the next round.|pg||
nt|roswolf: well n/s have found their fit|pg||
nt|roswolf: this could end with blood on the carpet|pg||
nt|pelu: I exp that the x only show 4 card @S, so 2@D from S = reverse values|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah better|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Tarjei Eck Hansen|pg||
nt|jaapfr: would any of us:)?|pg||
nt|riccho:  ahh there is the 7th trick in bd 15 :)|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: sry|pg||
nt|psyck: lucky @c44|pg||
nt|psyck: & @s fin on|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  will be ctaching up now :)|pg||
nt|ady: was cue bid by Vriend|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: bergen raise here|pg||
nt|hedyg: that N hand is not really worth 17 hcps, is it?|pg||
nt|hajru:  I would not, but then again, I usually play a system where 1H is limited to about 17, rather than the 21 in |pg||
nt|hajru:  a natural system.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: even then never 1@S|pg||
nt|hajru:  If you had to bid, what would you bid then?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: pass or pass or pass:)|pg||
nt|blum1956: This is allready doubleable|pg||
mb|3N|nt|teckh:  hi all|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2nt =23+ bal|pg||
nt|hedyg: so downgraded to the 2@H replay|pg||
nt|hedyg: reply*|pg||
nt|roswolf: true michael|pg||
nt|roswolf: well they avoided 6@D which was possible i suppose|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  10 on top on normal breaks... but breaks are not normal|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: she said that she didn't see ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|riccho:  np; I guess its very tricky to get the informations across to you from the table, if they are not interested :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|roswolf: south scared into passing - how could 4@C be wrong|pg||
nt|roswolf: the bludegeon shouldnt work on this deal|pg||
nt|djneill:  I like the 3NT bid, whenever I bid 2NT, it seems to make no difference - it makes 3, or goes down 1, whatever I do|pg||
nt|roswolf: spades 3-3 gives some hope i suppose|pg||
mb|p|nt|riccho:  is there a tiebreaker rule in the unlikely event of a draw? |pg||
nt|hajru:  I'm sure there is. |pg||
nt|arno11: might make 4 can pitch @C loser on @D after finessing against N|pg||
mb|p|nt|teckh:  well bid, I think|pg||
nt|granguru:  hi geoffrey|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@D might be the majority choice|pg||
nt|hajru:  Downloading the conditions of contest as we speak.|pg||
nt|roswolf: pass is favorite|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: now S even get slam ideas (sorry this is monday morning bidding:)|pg||
nt|psyck: still a good game as those are the chances if @d fin off|pg||
nt|pelu: in Or Beb Vriend jump to 3@D|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|arno11: after @C lead this might not work anymore|pg||
nt|roswolf: this will play quite well despite the 4-1 trump break|pg||
nt|roswolf: bad news|pg||
nt|blum1956: she better should not discover that Ace before the bidding ended))|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: just the 2 aces if played open|pg||
nt|ady: west could false card in trumps  to try and convince declarer of 109 stiff|pg||
pc|c5|nt|spooky: All about @HJ now|pg||
nt|spooky: with this lead she has enough entries to misguess it... |pg||
pc|c3|nt|yorkbeach:  oops|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|hajru:  Opposite SQxxx and a red ace, 6S has a chance, and it is not clear if N would cooperate over 4D|pg||
nt|jaapfr: pls check operator if N will say afterwards as sweet as possible: sorry pd:)?|pg||
nt|pelu: a overbid with @HK stiff in front of the @H overcall|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|yorkbeach:  GIB says that East needed to keep all her @s|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|roswolf: by e/w certainly - 3@D seemed to confuse the opps|pg||
nt|roswolf: certainly would be in my club|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|granguru:  S arriving fast to acomplish his promess|pg||
nt|pelu: I like Ss bidding here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 50 imps in 13 boards is a large but not quite impossible task- but it needs swingy boards to have any chance|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pelu: now NS in 4@S in OR??????|pg||
nt|roswolf: optimism gone mad|pg||
nt|hajru:  That must be a very rare misunderstanding from NS|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  and that cashing the 3rd @d is a mistake|pg||
nt|blum1956: certainly she had to keep them all but know the ball is back|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  defenders are going to gte 3@s 1@d + 1 other trick|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes instructive little errors |pg||
pc|d9|nt|yorkbeach:  will not work but looks right to play @c|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  4@c 1@h gives declarer the 5 more tricks he needs|pg||
pc|dK|nt|roswolf: her the ladies sit south and east|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|roswolf: sandra is a very competent decarer and mis guessing is not her forte|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: no|pg||
nt|hajru:  Does anybody know what carding EW play?|pg||
nt|hajru:  They have been playing as a pair for at least 30 years|pg||
nt|jcomyn: according to other room details 6c was bid in the slammish hand|pg||
pc|c8|nt|granguru:  declarer is now stacked in dummy|pg||
nt|riccho:  anyone knows the link to see the other table as well?|pg||
nt|pelu: good news for NS in OR: they are nv and no X :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes hope for 4@C + a @H|pg||
pc|cA|nt|roswolf: presumably semi-natural but minimum|pg||
nt|granguru:  her sorry*|pg||
nt|hajru:  No, it does work, Arno.  |pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|ady: not knowing  where the hearts are  south not confident yet|pg||
pc|d5|nt|riccho:  no @d finesse anymore|pg||
pc|d2|nt|granguru:  good point|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes she will paly a heart up|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|hajru:  Other table on the top right of the screen|pg||
nt|arno11: yes if you do it immediately but not after @S Ace|pg||
pc|sK|nt|riccho:  iots still possible but would risk the contract|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  time to try @s again|pg||
nt|roswolf: NOW DEFENCE CASH OUT|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  presumably West's @s at trick one encouraged the suit|pg||

nt|granguru:  In Europe it is the common practice to do so|pg||

nt|hedyg: quite a downgrade!|pg||

nt|vugraphpl8: http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/br.html|pg||
nt|hajru:  Tie break: if tied after 28 boards, play 4 extra, if still tied, play another 4, if still tied, play 1 board at the time until there is a difference|pg||
nt|riccho:  finland still 6 Imps (summed up) in front|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: now it is 30-24 for Finland|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5 or so imps to the french|pg||
nt|roswolf: did he really make that?|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: yeah|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  might have been clearer if West dropped the @sK but not sure whether that was safe|pg||
nt|roswolf: this certainly has swing potential|pg||
nt|jcomyn: ah a minor slam|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this has potential|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: more imps to the mythological creatures of the woods|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: http://www.poznan2011.pl/|pg||
nt|arno11: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=16359  west|pg||
nt|roswolf: defence got too clever there|pg||
mb|1C|nt|hedyg: 2@H= weak 2 suiter|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  counting points might have enable East to place West with the @sK, signals or not|pg||
nt|roswolf: good point|pg||
nt|ady: A@D  with east last hand was good for declarer    gave time |pg||
mb|2N|an|.|nt|roswolf: muilderg strikes again|pg||
nt|granguru:  In America it is N and E for men|pg||
nt|roswolf: now this has potential for a swing|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/swrunda5.html|pg||
nt|granguru:  2@C for majors|pg||
nt|roswolf: majors oor multi-landy something no doubt|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/swleaderb.html|pg||
nt|odysseus69: have now right sided 6C - East cant lead a trump|pg||
nt|roswolf: probably shows the reds|pg||
mb|d|nt|djneill:  ok so South sees 14 HCP opposite 15-17, and shortness in hearts - East having most of the opposing honors, South knows there is a minor slam if North has a fit|pg||
nt|granguru:  landy, garozzo, woolsey, multilandy or something|pg||
nt|roswolf: west has an interesting problem -how high to bid?|pg||
nt|roswolf: probably worth a double!?|pg||
nt|granguru:  5@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes the real man's bid:)|pg||
nt|hajru:  Weak NT by north, probably all pass|pg||
mb|r|nt|roswolf: good lead|pg||
nt|granguru:  no more blackwood, redwood, voidwood, roman KCB, etc..|pg||
nt|djneill:  I still think South should rebid 4@c, get a fit, and bid 6|pg||
nt|roswolf: pass is the mouse's bid|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and makes|pg||
nt|arno11: East http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=4813|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/r32runda1.html|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I am guessing that the EW are playing reverse attitude, so the 8 looked discouraging|pg||
nt|roswolf: a firm 1NT no doubt:)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: problemwith 2nt is 6-3 s fit may no be found|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3 of a red suit doubled perhaps?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: xx - you choose - maybe it also suggests spades|pg||
mb|4C|nt|roswolf: north risks a large penalty|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and the swanny beckons|pg||
nt|jcomyn: or is it swanee|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: we dont know if 2@H could be with @s and 2@s would be p/c then|pg||
nt|roswolf: but escapes with a scratch|pg||
nt|roswolf: the light shines on the lady|pg||
nt|psyck: 4@h will be interesting|pg||
nt|blum1956: 4@h looks natural but fails after a diamond lead or switch|pg||
nt|roswolf: no 4@C:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@D now?|pg||
mb|4D|nt|granguru:  4@H should have been  the minimum...problem is that it might lead to a wrong lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: does that agree @C|pg||
nt|roswolf: LOOKS LIKE IT DOES|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|roswolf: this auction will peter out in some partscore -2@H!?|pg||

nt|arno11: auction hard to believe|pg||
nt|riccho:  maybe X showed some WK NT Hand? |pg||
nt|hajru:  Yes.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: will bid slam now for sure|pg||
nt|ady: they  will get there now|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Operator, could you please enter scores on 21 and 22 manually?|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i would bid game on this sequence but i suppose north is entitled to overbid after the first few bds|pg||
nt|hedyg: overtake and play J@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@S LOOKED NATURAL AND CONSTRUCTIVE|pg||
nt|roswolf: last train!?|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is doomed|pg||
nt|odysseus69: undo|pg||
nt|jcomyn: ah e got the message|pg||
mb|4S|nt|spooky: looks like a walsh aucon, East not bidding her 4crd @S|pg||
nt|hedyg: it all depends on their agreements i would think?|pg||
nt|jbgood: this will be a quick downer with the di ruff|pg||
nt|hajru:  That should be 1 off after this lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@S MIGHT BE INSPIRED|pg||
nt|odysseus69: did East really bid 4S?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: better|pg||
mb|d|mb|6C|nt|spooky: auction*|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks like 6@C now|pg||
nt|psyck: correct play in majors will only lose 1 trick in them & they could have made an o/t in 4@h if they got there|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: W doesn't know what's going on?|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: !!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 5@C probably showed no spade control|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/swrunda5.html|pg||
nt|roswolf: south might chicken out with some justification|pg||
nt|djneill:  the @dT, or @sT would make a big difference here for N-S|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair point|pg||
nt|psyck: 1@h was 3 or less @h i guess...2@c=who knows...|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: If you don't know the codes, give me contract, declarer and number of tricks and I will give you the codes|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this needs a good guesser|pg||
nt|djneill:  beautiful|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 6s now???|pg||
nt|jcomyn: YES must do somthing|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|roswolf: this is a cakewalk|pg||
nt|roswolf: a deal to ponder in the post mortem|pg||
nt|roswolf: the play isnt that straightforward either but this will make i bet|pg||
nt|granguru:  backward finesse in @D permits not to lose a @D trick|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this is the final nail in the dutch coffin i feel|pg||
nt|odysseus69: now it does look all over|pg||
nt|jcomyn: indeed i think that 2nt bid misguided|pg||
nt|jcomyn: can almost declare|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk4: Thank you|pg||
nt|Walddk4: By the way, N-S are from France (flags)|pg||
nt|spooky: with @CKJ in south declarer shouldn't have any problems|pg||
nt|roswolf: this layout is far too kind|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: pokerface of E|pg||
nt|psyck: actially, % play in @s is low to J & then Q...so would lose 2@s tricks, so will have to get @d right|pg||
nt|jbgood: even withot the ruff S would have to find the club queen to make 10|pg||
pc|s2|nt|roswolf: yes the norsemen (and women) have sprung into a big lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: this contract is pretty unlucky|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|hedyg: personally i play that 2@h can be weak with ANY suit, incl @s|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes and declarer will play west for the long@D|pg||
nt|granguru:  E would have led @SK with @SQ(10)|pg||
nt|roswolf: from the bidding|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West does not have an opening bid in my book|pg||
nt|odysseus69: same bid next doorr- but here Multon solved all problems with 4C bid - |pg||
pc|dT|nt|teckh:  will she go for split A,K@d |pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|roswolf: BTW in this sequence i would have played a double by west as PENALTY|pg||
nt|roswolf: suggest a heart wanted?|pg||
nt|roswolf: well since east has no trumps he could|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|teckh:  He now see KQ, and A@s will materialize, then W has noe Q@H|pg||
nt|jaapfr: discarding not @C in N is confusing a bit|pg||
nt|roswolf: err dont think so|pg||
pc|s7|nt|blum1956: And the declarer still needs the @c guess to come to down 1|pg||

pc|s3|pc|c2|pg||

nt|granguru:  Katarzina Dufrat is a pretty young polish girl who started on 2009|pg||
nt|roswolf: a hard earned 3 imps|pg||
nt|hajru:  I can hardly imagine that she took the first @h with the A|pg||
nt|pelu: 1Nt - 2NT?|pg||
nt|roswolf: some potential here for disaster|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  you can upgrade for the good @d but the rest of the hand is yuk|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  incredible|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  even the top players find defence difficult|pg||
nt|roswolf: and now a flat game hand|pg||
nt|ady: 31 imps to Zimmerman so far   so it was possible to make up the deficit   |pg||
nt|jcomyn: nice break in s so 3nt loks best|pg||
mb|1C|nt|roswolf: more meat on this hand|pg||
nt|jbgood: my guess is that S really did play the heart king |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: -200 is quite a big scratch|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3NT is likely to be bid here|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3nt makes here 4@H a tad more challenging to make|pg||
nt|hajru:  So, instead of scoring +100 in 1@c!, south scores -100 in 2@c|pg||
nt|arno11: shld have been -2 |pg||
nt|riccho:  here the just-intime-scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/r32runda1.html|pg||
nt|roswolf: any 2 suiter or just the Minors|pg||
nt|hajru:  Wow, I knew Carla likes to bid but had not expected 2N from her|pg||
nt|roswolf: ?|pg||
nt|pelu: 3 or 4@h|pg||

nt|jcomyn: or higher|pg||
mb|1D|nt|djneill:  hot stuff, West ducked that smoothly|pg||
nt|hajru:  But first, EW are in trouble after their weak NT|pg||
nt|jaapfr: mb even to challenging (needs opps to help)|pg||
nt|blum1956: 4@h will be down 1 or 2|pg||
nt|roswolf: the dutch had red meat for breakfast it seems|pg||
nt|hajru:  I don't know what they are playing, EW are not a regular pair and I've never played against them|pg||
mb|1S|nt|hedyg: 200 is always painful|pg||
nt|arno11: as they could not have made anything not a big problem for NS|pg||
nt|roswolf: on bd 3 the dutch in the other room drifted -4 in 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: i am told 6@S reached in the other room by the dutch|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: 2@C X no disaster EW|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: lebensohl|pg||

mb|1N|nt|roswolf: brian joins in with an off centre 1nt|pg||
nt|jaapfr: down 1 i think so big win EW|pg||
nt|hajru:  Yes, pass by south and lead a small club. |pg||
nt|roswolf: the axe falls|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  much will depend upon the lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|hajru:  This is interesting: when I look up my name in worldbridge.org, I find somebody with my name|pg||
nt|hajru:  and playernumber, who participated in an event back in 1997.  However, I'm sure it wasn't me, it was|pg||
nt|riccho:  but ist not your data than? |pg||
nt|hajru:  my brother|pg||

mb|3N|nt|spooky: I expect Tor to bid 4@S now|pg||
nt|roswolf: this should be finis|pg||
nt|teckh:  that E was too much|pg||
nt|roswolf: i suspect tor knows gunn's style|pg||
nt|roswolf: but will east pass?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hajru:  Yes, looks like 7 tricks to EW for a 10 imp gain|pg||
nt|jaapfr: difficult to lead from QTx|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@D down 1 - but fine investment|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/frunda1.html|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: the @D10 is priceless here|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: i hate to think what would happened if W passed 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|spooky: You were right :)|pg||
nt|riccho:  probably they guessed the fuel name from the list (someone with guessing capabilities like me...) |pg||
nt|jbgood: N didnt bid 4@h - perhaps S should hear the alarm clocks ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: can you concede halfway through a session!?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: shows once again that 4-4 is overrated|pg||
pc|h5|nt|spooky: 3@S is down already...|pg||
nt|granguru:  michal nowosadzki has also started on 2009|pg||
nt|roswolf: I DOUBT A DIAMOND|pg||
pc|h7|nt|teckh:  he will play for club and eventually it will make with the spade and blockage|pg||
nt|roswolf: he needs at least 1 spade trick|pg||
nt|roswolf: even if the clubs came in|pg||
nt|roswolf: no he doesnt - icant count early in the morning:)|pg||
nt|teckh:  Tor knows he has a single spade in front and 3 on his back|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  superficially declarer might lose just 1@h 1@d and @c but too much work to do|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer can come to hand and throw 2@d on the @s but then has a dilemma|pg||
pc|h9|nt|riccho:  the 4@s from W sounds like that W didnt understand it either|pg||
nt|arno11: I see your point:)|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|riccho:  full|pg||
nt|hajru:  I'm not sure if I understand the 2s! bid|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if she cashes a second @h, East can play a third @h when in with the @dA|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|hedyg: i think EW would make 8 tricks on best defense|pg||
nt|pelu: JOn: 3@D could be a 5 card suit, so N cant bid 4@H |pg||
nt|blum1956: yes as now EW will collect 200 to 500, more probably 200 after this start|pg||
nt|blum1956: maybe @cA and a club?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hedyg: running scores and results : http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/swrunda3.html|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 1@S2@H2@D and 1 @C loser not to avoid specs|pg||
nt|jbgood: with a little more help this will not be expensive though - was the @s ace mandatory?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|roswolf: really?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if not, West will get to ruff a @d with the @hJ|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|roswolf: that looked odd|pg||
nt|granguru:  http://www.msc.com.pl/cezar1/index.php?s=&mycl=0&tmt=5&p=21&r=4662&s_r=0&s_nz=nowosadzki&s_off=0|pg||
nt|jaapfr: for the optimists who think 2@C can or could be made|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good question i have seen it happen in trials but this is probably different|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|pelu: B¤ NS in 3Nt - also down after @D lead|pg||
nt|pelu: B4|pg||
nt|jbgood: Peter - N might bid wit a good fit. that was my point...|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|pg||
pc|d9|nt|blum1956: after taking discard|pg||
pc|d5|nt|hajru:  This gets rid of the @c loser but creates a @h loser|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|d6|nt|pelu: S dont need "good" fit - but @Hs 2-2|pg||
nt|pelu: 3-2|pg||
nt|jbgood: very unlikely after the bidding|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR Benedicte C pass over 1NT - the 2Nt was a close call|pg||
nt|hajru:  Even with the @h 3-2, he still has to play the spade for 2 losers, which is hard if E ducks the first round|pg||
nt|blum1956: South still may expect that West has only 4 hearts|pg||
nt|jbgood: yes - it was a brave move by Arnolds|pg||
nt|pelu: so 4@h - no x in OR|pg||
nt|jbgood: if hearts are 4-1 E would have gotten a spade ruff long ago|pg||
nt|roswolf: this i think could well end up -2|pg||
nt|blum1956: If hearts are 4-1 this is an easy win|pg||
nt|roswolf: no not with this declarer|pg||
nt|blum1956: no more than -1 whatever South does|pg||
nt|pelu: no still hard work - and a possible @S-ruff as Jon said|pg||
nt|blum1956: no more no less|pg||
nt|roswolf: i am just glad i am not playing it:):(|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d8|nt|pelu: @SA cost a trick|pg||

nt|jaapfr: 4|pg||
nt|riccho:  but 2@d wasnt probably natural either|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but east fell from grace|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  French will be hoping for a gain there|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  the 1NT call won the board, as the other room overcalled 2@d, and could not reopen safely over 2@h - East too was too flat|pg||
nt|arno11: as N could not have overcalled 2@D the entire auction was wrong|pg||

nt|granguru:  6@C should be the final point...|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  with the @SK and @cA onside, this is making|pg||
nt|roswolf: on 20 the french in the other roomare in with a chance with making 3nt which went -2 here|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 1nt?|pg||
nt|roswolf: denying 3 hearts|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and 5 or 6 losers|pg||
nt|roswolf: no doubt a bergen raise|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@C= minimum!?|pg||
nt|blum1956: even 6 is makeable probably|pg||
mb|p|nt|spooky: @C back, @SK @C, @DQ @CQ @D away?|pg||

nt|jcomyn: now there's a grotty 8 count for you. |pg||
nt|jcomyn: it doesnt get any grottier|pg||

pc|s5|nt|teckh:  i still dont like to lead from J|pg||

nt|granguru:  hard to get there after north showed 5-5 in mjaors|pg||
nt|granguru:  majors*|pg||

nt|vugraphpl8: http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/swrunda5.html|pg||
nt|riccho:  team lavazza is struggling: 35 Imps behind  with 12 to play|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|spooky: South bid @C and played @H4...|pg||
pc|s7|nt|roswolf: n/s brushed it aside easily enough|pg||
nt|arno11: at least they picked their opponent themselves|pg||
nt|hajru:  Operator: did they explan 2@d|pg||
nt|riccho:  2@d probybly some BAL wothout 4cM and 10+ or so|pg||
pc|sA|nt|roswolf: nor me|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Please adjust 24 to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: and he only promises 10-15 anyhow|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk4: 4SS=|pg||
nt|hajru:  I'm not sure if I can follow Cronier there.  She leads the @h ace, gets a positive signal and switches?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: udca?|pg||
nt|arno11: bal? and then N bids 4@C?|pg||
nt|eamongall: got the favourable but relatively normal lead |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|roswolf: east might well play north for short diamonds here|pg||
nt|blum1956: Take the diamond lead, spade to the King and Ace, two heart ruffs, 4 clubs and finally a trump|pg||
nt|hajru:  So, who do you think underbid on this hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/frunda1.html|pg||
nt|blum1956: but of course in 4@s the plan may differ|pg||
nt|odysseus69: much as I dislike 1C on balanced 11 counts, I disike the 1S overcall 10 times more-I usually get lot of messages disagreeing but i can take it|pg||
pc|c2|nt|riccho:  I guessed before the 4@c bid :) |pg||
nt|hajru:  I have no idea why you'd call the S hand balanced in a strong club context|pg||
nt|arno11: as NS are playing a kind of polish club, the bid was either 1. 2@C  or 2. it showed @C|pg||
pc|c9|nt|granguru:  6@H is also possible to win..|pg||
nt|roswolf: well they have reached the slam|pg||
nt|granguru:  I think...|pg||
nt|roswolf: need to take a good view of the spade suit|pg||
nt|granguru:  interesting that W can only overruff @s with @HK|pg||
nt|riccho:  maybe S wanted to emphasize the "good" @d-suit?|pg||
nt|riccho:  2@d = @c sounds a bit funny|pg||
nt|riccho:  anyway: the contract is not very convincing, but successful|pg||
nt|hajru:  I think we can only guess at this stage|pg||
nt|arno11: if North takes the @C finesse we will come to 12 tricks via 4@C 4@D 3@H and the @S Ace|pg||
pc|cA|nt|granguru:  a lucky situation|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|nt|roswolf: hmm west made an interesting play|pg||
nt|hajru:  Why would you play the 7 from Q765 then?|pg||
nt|ady: even wirh the nice lay in clubs  may be 2 down|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|riccho:  say: probably convincing; the @c-finesse is not nadatory|pg||
nt|roswolf: probably north - south didnt know about the @D control|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I agree on both counts victor|pg||
pc|c5|nt|granguru:  noooo|pg||
nt|riccho:  mandatory|pg||
nt|odysseus69: it shows our age|pg||
nt|roswolf: it is almost impossible to counter with any sane argument|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes juniors would never agree|pg||
pc|s6|nt|roswolf: not going well|pg||
pc|c8|nt|granguru:  W was afraid to duck @c because of @S danger|pg||
nt|djneill:  North can't imagine South has the @hA and did not raise to 2@s with 3 spades|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmmm - idee fixee|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|jcomyn: as the late Pat Walshe used to say : Is there game on ; No, then shut up|pg||
nt|roswolf: just a 3 imp loss probably|pg||

nt|spooky: 30-3 already for team Brogeland..|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Hi|pg||
nt|granguru:  sorry  I was keeping the girl for myself....|pg||
nt|roswolf: not much here|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: fast play|pg||
nt|hajru:  That is a good line of play, partner won't be worried about missing slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: solid result|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: hi peter|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3NT looks cold|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North too good to open 2NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|blum1956: must open smth semiforcing|pg||
mb|1D|nt|roswolf: another bits and pieces bd|pg||
nt|hajru:  And another 1NT contract :)|pg||
nt|riccho:  probably claimed for 12 tricks|pg||
nt|jcomyn: might be competition here|pg||
nt|roswolf: west is deflated - this is the time for a 1@S opening:)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|teckh:  will they try for game in spade or clubs|pg||
nt|roswolf: a possible slam here but not one you would wish to be in:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: sandra could have a punt here|pg||
nt|teckh:  S thinks she know where N singleton is|pg||
nt|spooky: this 6@S is making|pg||
nt|roswolf: finis|pg||
nt|hajru:  No, Benedicte spoils it.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Standard French is similar to Benjamin, 2@d is the big bid|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: the second singleton is more relevant|pg||
nt|hajru:  12 tricks, I guess|pg||
nt|hajru:  And 1 imp can be important here.|pg||
nt|roswolf: well 3nt looks certain now|pg||
mb|3S|nt|roswolf: clubs is my guess|pg||
nt|roswolf: an educated try|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: now it is 33-24 for finland|pg||
nt|eamongall: there appears to be only 9 tricks in @Ss but doubt @Ss will ever be trumps at this tage |pg||
nt|ady: 5@D  or 3NT for n/s  assuming getting diamond right|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3/4@S would make it interesting|pg||
mb|4D|nt|jaapfr: for herself:)|pg||
nt|eamongall: stage|pg||
nt|eamongall: maybe Hanlon will bid them now |pg||
nt|roswolf: this seems pretty normal|pg||
mb|4S|nt|granguru:  buy willing to share with you nice people|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but the @SJ is golden|pg||
nt|psyck: if EW get to 4@s now, @d's need to be attacked at the earliest|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm east sticks her neck out|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and thats far from certain|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 5S x is 800 - better chance to defend 5D and hope|pg||
mb|5D|nt|roswolf: 5 of a minor here - i trust no slam adventure|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Thank you. It is always nice to share|pg||
nt|psyck: Which will not be difficult with that dummy|pg||
nt|eamongall: yes Krishna you are very right ... but I doubt they can reach 4@S here |pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  though I do not know whether NS are playing Standard French - no system cards for this event|pg||
nt|roswolf: but brushed aside|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think they are Julian|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East knows that North is ready for a @h lead|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  so considering alternatives|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  a @d will be safe :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: but should lead one anyway|pg||
nt|roswolf: south might overbid to 6@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  pretty disappointing here, for East, but at least the @dK is onside, and @c are 3-3|pg||
nt|jaapfr: even -1 is a push|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and mb mb she makes|pg||
nt|roswolf: NORTH|pg||
nt|roswolf: BUT NO|pg||
mb|d|nt|teckh:  she has to play for the lone KJ in heart|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  agreed|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @h10 and an entry|pg||
mb|p|nt|spooky: EW could sacrifice in 7@C here, impossible to find tho|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: yup brian co-operates with a cue - best bid hand material:)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  or one of the @h pictures may be all you need partner to have|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  everything else is more speculative|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: nice judgment by Gunn|pg||
nt|roswolf: great judgment by north|pg||
nt|psyck: couple of o/t's on major lead|pg||
pc|cA|nt|roswolf: no other chance but to hope the jearts set up|pg||
nt|hajru:  4@s makes, so a good decision by Elsinen|pg||
pc|c3|nt|roswolf: east - the ladies siyt south and east|pg||
nt|roswolf: hearts|pg||
nt|roswolf: the heart weakness is clearly pinpointed|pg||
nt|arno11: same 6N reached at the other table on a spade lead his @S intermediates are so good that N will not need the @C suit and also make 6NT|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|pg||
nt|roswolf: will need some flair from Tor but as a world champion i expect it|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @H7|pg||
nt|jcomyn: whats the betting|pg||
nt|odysseus69: double ok - this may persuade declarer that the d king is not singleton |pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugraphpl8: http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/r32runda1.html|pg||
nt|roswolf: on 20 cronier made 3nt|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ady: would east double with void diamond|pg||
pc|c6|nt|yorkbeach:  although we have a France v Netherlands final, the conditions of contest did not make it a certainty we would have two different European teams|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|teckh:  he know that clubs are with S, and then its hust to be careful|pg||
nt|granguru:  should make 1@S 2@D 2@H 2@c|pg||
nt|jbgood: di return normal?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|hedyg: time for coffee?|pg||
nt|psyck: aah, S found a 2@d bid last deal other room to fetch 11 imps|pg||
nt|roswolf: nope|pg||
pc|s9|pc|hT|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup -like the "just"|pg||
nt|hajru:  Looks as if north couldn't read the @h 5|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i love this swindle|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|vugraphpl8: W is disappointed|pg||
pc|d9|nt|odysseus69: would he double with singleton king|pg||
nt|jcomyn: she|pg||
nt|roswolf: 14 IMPS ON 1 CARD|pg||
nt|ady: who knows    e/w desperate for points|pg||
nt|odysseus69: she - sorry - did it again|pg||
pc|d2|nt|granguru:  so it conducts to the corresponding lead|pg||

nt|ady: flat   |pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: i sympathise with declarer - |pg||
mb|p|nt|teckh:  4@c over 3@h here?|pg||
nt|djneill:  6@d making other table wow|pg||
nt|roswolf: good result for goldcat in the other room|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ppp?|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: http://www.poznan2011.pl/|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 1@H-p-?|pg||
nt|blum1956: very strange diamond return - does the @c10 lead not inform South that West has at least three clubs?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but hardly with other pair in 6|pg||
mb|1S|nt|roswolf: 2 or 3 nt ?|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes getting weaker by the minute..|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: 7-2 to the CR|pg||
nt|hajru:  2@c is 11-14, 6@c or 5@c with a 4 card M|pg||
nt|hajru:  Giving north a problem what to bid|pg||
nt|ady: this looks a push|pg||
nt|roswolf: on bd 6 here it is currentlty scored as 2nt -1 - i thought it was 3nt -2!?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: it was 3nt-2|pg||
mb|p|nt|spooky: another 3rd hand Light opener|pg||
nt|roswolf: different tempo to this auction|pg||
nt|roswolf: doubt whether they will get close to a slam|pg||
nt|arno11: teams full of star players like Lavazza, Brogeland or Gottlieb on their way out |pg||
nt|hajru:  3@d probably invitational with a good 6 card suit|pg||
nt|hajru:  I guess it will end there|pg||
nt|psyck: he will be more dissaponted when he finds they made 4@s other table that deal|pg||
nt|hajru:  2@s transfer to clubs|pg||
mb|3D|nt|roswolf: now that is a preempt which only a young man can make|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: of course|pg||
nt|roswolf: shows a fit|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this really is a flat game|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3 imps more to teamZ - not that it will matter|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  undisciplined opening by W|pg||
nt|roswolf: probably reach 5@D|pg||
nt|psyck: they got the same trump lead in 4@s other room|pg||
mb|4S|nt|roswolf: support with support|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this is action bridge - where will the music stop?|pg||
nt|djneill:  example of how usually the weaker hand with a long suit plays better - honors from the strong hand are still relevant, but not if West declares - East's @d not so hot then|pg||
nt|hajru:  In the other room, west tried 1@s, not sure what that meant, but it got them to a playable contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|teckh:  both major and 11 is an opening allways these days |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: yup the courtesy raise|pg||
nt|teckh:  i didnt think Tor opened partnering his wife|pg||
nt|granguru:  -1|pg||
pc|s4|nt|roswolf: surely he is allowed to even in a liberated scandavian household:)|pg||
nt|hajru:  No, Lebedeva has other thoughts.  |pg||
nt|arno11: EW in 4@H on bd 21 so 5 Imps coming for the russians |pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: http://www.poznan2011.pl/|pg||
nt|riccho:  rehi sry was dropped by my interent conn|pg||
nt|hajru:  I don't know what they lead from 109x but then still the @d doesn't make much sense to me|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed|pg||
nt|blum1956: this one is easy|pg||
nt|pelu: I prefer 2Nt = no fit and 3@C = fit|pg||
nt|ady: can make an overtrick   not that it will help|pg||
pc|s3|nt|spooky: a lack of aces here...|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@D SEEMS INDICATED|pg||
nt|roswolf: west will/should pass now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @D6-4-K might seduce N|pg||
nt|hajru:  Welcome back|pg||
nt|hajru:  This gives the contract a chance|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: I think E is very tired she forgot about lead..|pg||
nt|psyck: unavoidable to get to game here if you play light openings, unfortunately no chances as cards are here|pg||
nt|psyck: even if he contrives to endplay W, that will only push his trick total from 8 to 9|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  solid 3NT on 24|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think the dutch have been chastened into a more cautious approach|pg||
pc|sK|nt|roswolf: and a lack of a double:(|pg||
nt|teckh:  I think Gunn bid once to much|pg||
nt|hedyg: push EW to slam?|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|roswolf: west decides now|pg||
nt|roswolf: 6@D is a very fair contract|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  GIB says 12 tricks are possible|pg||
pc|dK|nt|roswolf: 11 more imps to goldcat|pg||
pc|d6|nt|spooky: 3@C was quite a lot indeed...|pg||
nt|roswolf: the vul penalty may be good compensation|pg||
nt|granguru:  or -2|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes 6@d roughly needs South to have one diamond honour|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  and friendly breaks|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|pg||
nt|roswolf: club switch looks attractive|pg||
nt|teckh:  I think Tor is too lucky now, 23 and a bunsch of J, and hte only value worth talking of is his spade|pg||
nt|roswolf: luck follows the big battalions|pg||
nt|teckh:  he lacks no guts|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|hajru:  no, ns can take their 7 tricks then|pg||
nt|jbgood: so we are on disagreeing terms again, Peter:)|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s5|pg||
nt|hedyg: started with an oops|pg||
nt|roswolf: on 7 agaonst 4@H in the other room north led @SA and continued spades|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|roswolf: horror show|pg||
nt|jaapfr: true|pg||
nt|arno11: 3@D was forcing as S bid on on minimum values|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  If East had made an aggressive fourth suit rebid, they would have got there|pg||
pc|h5|nt|roswolf: he is a BERMUDA BOWL winner|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but we see but E and N can not know that|pg||
nt|riccho:  still difficult to collect enough tricks here|pg||
nt|hajru:  Goldwater's rule: always accept a lead out of turn.  If they don't know who should lead, they probably don't know what to lead|pg||
nt|hajru:  Why, if you have no fit, then your honnors are in the other suits and you don't want to be dummy|pg||
pc|h7|nt|hajru:  If you take the @d a in the first round, you better know what to return|pg||
nt|jaapfr: doubt N was thinking much:)|pg||
nt|psyck: a tight match with very swingy boards so far|pg||
nt|ady: needed diamond lead to hold to 4   or club and diamond switch|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|roswolf: should make an overtrick now|pg||
nt|roswolf: he has clues to the spade layout|pg||
nt|hajru:  That will still be -1 on 7.|pg||
nt|blum1956: In Russia we play 2@s response as "clubs or NT raise" so 3@c from the opener means just maximum|pg||
pc|h4|nt|arno11: defence shld be able to lock declarer in dummy|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||

nt|jbgood: do you really care?|pg||
nt|hajru:  sorry girls :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe std but wrong at this level|pg||
nt|blum1956: Not the best idea to open 1NT with 14HCP out of 15 in two suits (if the alternative opening bid is available)|pg||
nt|roswolf: good quality final - would be decent in an open event as well|pg||
nt|jbgood: yes - strong teams playing well|pg||

nt|roswolf: this looks like a n/s 3nt in these aggressive days|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: at least this looks normal|pg||
nt|blum1956: 2NT is OK, 3 fails|pg||
nt|ady: same start to the auction OR   but no double of 1NT  so passed out|pg||
mb|2H|nt|hedyg: some might go for 3NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: and go down|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps but i expect most to play 4@S|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: that is typical brian|pg||
nt|granguru:  EW have a clear advantage up to now..|pg||
nt|roswolf: very quick in this room|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphpl8: http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/frunda1.html|pg||
nt|roswolf: a good conservative view|pg||
nt|hajru:  I would not move over 1NT|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  wonder whether this is a situation where 4@h is stronger than 3@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|teckh:  strange bid wiht a single @c|pg||
nt|spooky: friendly lead, but don't exepct it to come in|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3nt no coffee time|pg||
mb|2S|nt|granguru:  6 boards in advance|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  will be doing well to avoid @s from here|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed|pg||
mb|d|nt|hajru:  I guess she now makes 9 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/frunda1.html|pg||
nt|ady: if partner has doubled 1NT  I think it right for south to double 2 hearts|pg||
nt|ady: sorry   she has|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no way out of this mess|pg||
nt|ady: once west elected to take action  should have just stuck with 1NTX |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 27+5 qualify for the Round of 32 tomorrow after five rounds of Swiss today. 27 from Swiss A and 5 from B|pg||
nt|pelu: this is standard frence bidding - whats wrong with that?|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: i'd have expected 3@h instead of 2, but no problems getting to 4 anyway here|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  a jump to 6@h would end proceedings|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  more likely to go via 4NT|pg||
nt|odysseus69: if I was looking for points on West I would pass 1 club for sure and hope to get a chance of a penaly- it wouldnt have happened here although not the carnage they are achieving|pg||
pc|s2|nt|blum1956: 4@h should be the @hA|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hope there are no children watching this|pg||
pc|s4|nt|hedyg: thanks Roland !|pg||
nt|roswolf: absolutely nothing|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  agreed|pg||
pc|s5|nt|arno11: I guess reaching 3NT on bd 23 is not that easy many will go down in high @D contracts|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|roswolf: brian has distinct views in the bidding and this is one of them - there are many negative inferences from the acol base|pg||
nt|granguru:  other room just finished nr.24...a tie|pg||
nt|roswolf: restart scheduled in another hour|pg||
nt|roswolf: have they agreed a suit as trumps?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @s but when South bids 6@h North should pass|pg||
nt|roswolf: spades it appears|pg||
nt|blum1956: no as North demonstrates the trump Queen|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|nt|spooky: Dummy is usesless now|pg||
nt|roswolf: THAT WAS ALWAYS LIKELY|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  so mst be @s as North has the @sQ but not the @hQ|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  time to trust partner|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|roswolf: alert defence|pg||
nt|blum1956: They probably play 15-17 NT so d'Ovidio knows the maximum is 24|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmmmmmmmm it is a Mixed teams|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  nicely judged|pg||
nt|roswolf: but he has and a good score for the french here|pg||

pc|d7|nt|roswolf: restartin 30 mins or so|pg||
nt|teckh:  thx all|pg||

nt|jaapfr: @H5 now|pg||
nt|hajru:  Back, wow, why wouldn't you bid 3@h over 2@s|pg||
nt|jaapfr: do not ask me pls|pg||
nt|hajru:  aren't we supposed to be the experts and explain this?  ;)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Suitplay says the right play in @s is low to the 10, so I suspect 6@s would have failed|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  do not think a trump coup would be available to recover the position|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not what u would call an inspired lead|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jaapfr: how to show @H now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: she will get a second chance but then he plays @HK|pg||

nt|vugraphpl8: http://www.poznan2011.pl/|pg||
nt|hajru:  I'm still not sure why east rebid 3NT.  It looks like there are 2 ways to bid the north hand: stayman, then|pg||
nt|jaapfr: N|pg||
nt|hajru:  3@s (or 3@h smolen) over 2@d, or transfer, then 3@h. In both cases, south picks the right contract from |pg||
nt|hajru:  3nt, 4@h or 4@s. |pg||
pc|d2|nt|roswolf: one of them is south is unlikely to have 5 cards in her suit|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|hajru:  That is not the way to defeat 3NT|pg||
nt|jaapfr: E hopes are that pd has @DJ|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h7|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jaapfr: good thinking but wrong result|pg||
pc|h4|nt|roswolf: declarer will be disappointed when she sees the heart break|pg||
nt|hedyg: on her way down now|pg||
nt|hedyg: it will break her heart?|pg||
nt|roswolf: i hope not 2 matches to go:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is a good win for goldcat|pg||
nt|hajru:  I still don't quite understand the ew carding.  Would he really lead the @d6 from J6xx(x)?|pg||
nt|hajru:  With all those soft values, I don' think that N will go slamming on 23.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|roswolf: bye all for today see you all tomorrow|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  declarer then has to guess whether to play West for the @sK or East for the @dK|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: a little break|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  EW may be playing some two-suited overcalls|pg||

nt|jaapfr: @CA @DA and x@D|pg||
nt|psyck: if he finesses @dJ, can make on non @s lead|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  was worth the wait for the French supporters - Cronier made 12 tricks|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the point is - you can never be sure so keep trying|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: cant see 90 imps coming from this hand|pg||
mb|1H|nt|pelu: 2@H with @Hs 4-1 also down 1 in OR|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: but board 16 may be dynamite|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: academic but do we agree with 1 diamond|pg||
nt|roswolf: the score this set is 70-5 and both dutch pairs will know they have lost|pg||
pc|d5|nt|roswolf: 2@S= REAL @C?|pg||
nt|jbgood: inv. + in @c?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  NS have the sensible agreement that the 1NT rebid shows a hand too strong to open 1NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: no i dont|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pelu: Hi Henk, jon and Geoffrey the spects dont like us - we have 450 and there over 2200 in OR ;(;(;(|pg||
nt|roswolf: spade lead!?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|pelu: :(:(:(|pg||
nt|hajru:  Yes, shows clubs.  X = 4 or 5 @s, 1@s is 6-9, 0-3@s, 2@h is weak with long @s.  |pg||
nt|roswolf: OH WELL WE ARE THE QUALITY NOT THE WIDTH:)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Don't fret you are doing a good job|pg||
nt|hajru:  At least, that is how the open team plays it.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I know a few kamikaze players who rebid 1NT with 12-14 on this type of auction :)|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|jbgood: quite common these days, actually|pg||
nt|odysseus69: geoffrey always with me - good to have company|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|nt|blum1956: that will be a struggle...|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I have bit more sympathy for Verbeek's decision not to lead her suit this time|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|nt|yorkbeach:  at least she is consistent|pg||
nt|roswolf: in which case leading a spade is i think best neither n/s bid them|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  bid (or show) @h but lead @c|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|pc|h8|nt|jbgood: heading for multiple overtricks now - will soon wish he was in 6@c:)|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes if South has the values to raise 1Nt to 3NT, she also has the values to X 1@h to show 4@s |pg||

nt|roswolf: We are now on the last board of the set. Thanks to our operator, Michal - Great Job! Our appreciation to all the organisers for ensuring that this fine event is brought to BBO ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: vugraph. Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentators David, Victor and John for their company and perceptive comments and to our specs whose contributions keep us on our ...|pg||

nt|jcomyn: agreed kibs have been excellent today|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|nt|yorkbeach:  vulnerability will put a dampener on this board|pg||
nt|roswolf: restart in 55 mins approx from now|pg||

mb|1H|nt|blum1956: thx all, spectators, Joeffrey and Julian|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South is happy to show a two-suited hand knowing she has the values to bid again|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: andf Michel is brilliant|pg||
mb|1S|nt|blum1956: sorry Geoffrey))|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South might check on aces but 5@s is safe|pg||
nt|roswolf: south will show her second suit|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  better to cue 4@c|pg||
nt|blum1956: I am for  Blackwood|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes 4@c probably is her second suit rather than a cue bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes michael has a lot to commend it|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  but still gives north the chance to cue a red ace if he has one|pg||
nt|odysseus69: wel time to congratulate the Zimmermann team on a convincing performance for the gold medal and the 10milion euros first prize - or whatever sum is awarded|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: south goes michael's way:)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West X to check whether NS have agreement but handling a X :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: yes a very creditable performance throughout the whole event|pg||
nt|odysseus69: commiserations for the Vriend team who had a bad day against a team in form |pg||
pc|dK|nt|blum1956: the heart weakness discovered...|pg||
nt|pelu: also from a spec tx to Michal (operator) he had a hard job from start :)|pg||
nt|hajru:  Yes, thanks Michal.|pg||
nt|roswolf: the heart lead is telegraphed against 3nt - can east find the @HK?|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: not so bad|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|blum1956: The NS probably will prefer 5@c or 4@s|pg||
nt|pelu: nice to find the @H-weakness - but if s over 2@D just bid 3Nt then a snall @H in lead|pg||
nt|hajru:  We'll never know|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@C or 4@S?|pg||
nt|jbgood: 5 @c an interesting contract|pg||
pc|d5|nt|yorkbeach:  no mistake|pg||

nt|blum1956: only the very special plan brings this home|pg||
nt|pelu: a bet? - I know I owe u 1-2 cokes Jon :)|pg||
nt|hajru:  The @h lead looks obvious and then west can play @h at every opportunity|pg||
nt|blum1956: you're right Jon|pg||
