mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|roswolf: i expect aggressive bidding from e/w|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: and we have it already i think 3nt by east is far too aggressive|pg||
nt|MolvaM: after 7 rounds, we shall have 7 rounds of swiss. then the knock-outs will start with 32 teams|pg||
pc|hK|nt|roswolf: however n/s need to be careful|pg||

nt|granguru:  funnily if  opens the hand (1N) there is a good chance to arrive at 6@C|pg||
nt|paulg:  could be worth a couple of imps if it is played by West in the other room|pg||
nt|chmitty: I must say that I never met the pair sitting EW ... not been introduced to Mister West nor Mister East|pg||

nt|roswolf: he was guessing/hoping - you need to be gentle with the cards -otherwise they bite you|pg||
nt|roswolf: muilderberg strikes|pg||
mb|4S|nt|roswolf: north will brush this aside|pg||
nt|MolvaM: by 5@c? or an enterprising 6@c?|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@C is standard!?|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|jr7: 5 :S is better|pg||
nt|roswolf: dbl is fair too|pg||
nt|jr7: @S|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: yup conservatism is best on this hand at least|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c6|pc|cT|pc|c7|pg||

nt|granguru:  another potential slam here|pg||
nt|granguru:  a better one thou|pg||
nt|pelu: only need to play @s-siut with no loser|pg||
nt|granguru:  still it  needs @s 2-2 or stiff honor in E and a good guess|pg||
nt|granguru:  hi all|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|pelu: Hi all - as every time there are problems before the first match - players has to find the right table and so on|pg||
nt|chmitty: 3NT or 5@c both cold here|pg||
nt|chmitty: not an easy bid for North|pg||
nt|chmitty: Can our operator disclose the names of the players sitting EW ??|pg||
nt|chmitty: oh yes :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: ty|pg||
nt|peachy: He might go for the practical 3NT if this were MPs, not so sure IMPs|pg||
mb|5C|nt|pelu: not with odds - but better that a "Roland-slam"|pg||
mb|5D|nt|paulg:  Pleased to see that South has a name, but I think I'll stick with 'South'|pg||
nt|granguru:  exchange black QÂ´s and it would have been a rock iron contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: we begin with a possible slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: Rodwell did open the N hand with 1NT???|pg||
nt|chmitty: Difficult for South to imagine he has so many defensive tricks !|pg||
nt|chmitty: Will North x now ?|pg||
nt|chmitty: Hope for him there was not too much of an hesitation behind the screen|pg||
nt|peachy: I think S might have doubled. Vul versus notvul, N had great expectations of making, the colors tell he was not preempting|pg||
nt|chmitty: I agree 100% Raija|pg||
mb|d|nt|peachy: Hi John|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  I would have done it if @CK|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think many in the field will bid this one|pg||
nt|chmitty: he must protect the score of his pair|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|granguru:  NICE TO see u again Raija |pg||
nt|granguru:  11 tricks|pg||
nt|peachy: Convention cards are not available so unfprtunately we cannot explain bidding|pg||
nt|granguru:  at NT or any Moysean|pg||
nt|chmitty: Next door bidding started 2@s (E) 4@s ... NOrth thinking|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|pelu: and I would open 1@D 100% (=4+@d)|pg||
nt|paulg:  North has distribution and they have a lot of controls|pg||
nt|granguru:  4@C cue X @Cs|pg||
nt|granguru:  N could have xx to show second round ctrl|pg||
nt|pelu: when N open 1Nt then Meckstroth has no slam ambitions|pg||
nt|pelu: RD = 1. round control|pg||
nt|granguru:  but then it is more complicate to show @d ctrls|pg||
nt|granguru:  RD is second if 4@C was first|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|pelu: @H-lead - 2x@s and @C finess|pg||
pc|dK|nt|pelu: ok that makes life easyer for dsecl|pg||
pc|dA|nt|granguru:  If I would be forced to guess  1@C strong 1@S=4 ctrls 2N nat 19-21 3@D @C ctrl no @D ctrl|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|pg||
nt|paulg:  It is much easier for us, but can South have less than this to make a slam try with no heart control?|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|nt|peachy: lots of work in 6NT, not impossible I think, but rather aggressive|pg||
nt|granguru:  a passive lead is a must here|pg||
nt|peachy: I'm thinking E will lead club, that would be my choice|pg||
nt|granguru:  it seems 3@d was nat as N went on to 6@d|pg||
nt|peachy: but I am not in Hurd's class of player so we'll see|pg||
nt|granguru:  most passive is @D|pg||
nt|granguru:  the @D10 is a critical card (not here thou) so W has 4 critical suits|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c7|pg||
pc|h6|nt|granguru:  N S expects that @S dont behave...|pg||
pc|h3|nt|pelu: do u know players where cuebid are 1. control - to day 1. or 2.? back in the 50'es in US they only cuebid Aces - and lost to Italy every time :)|pg||
nt|peachy: that would have been my last choice of leads, Jxx nearly never right|pg||
nt|granguru:  I am wrong E leads|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|granguru:  E has a clear @d lead|pg||
nt|chmitty: Versace will not escape 800 |pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pc|h9|pc|h7|pg||
nt|peachy: perhaps there is something in the bidding that we are not privvy to, which induced the spade lead|pg||
nt|peachy: To watch multiple tables, http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php.  Open a new window for each additional table.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|granguru:  :) true|pg||

mb|d!|nt|MolvaM: up to 4@c available for ew|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think the double borders on the crazy|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and 3@h for NS|pg||
nt|roswolf: it is only a 5 count oppaosite a @C hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: i assume it is not a strong @C btw|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but whats the alternative?|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|roswolf: pass!?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hard to pass with dumbovich hand|pg||

mb|4D|nt|roswolf: i axe most of the time - that phiosophy is poor unlee there are hcp to back it up|pg||
nt|MolvaM: dombi's double shows what? supportX?|pg||
nt|roswolf: magical mystery tour as most hungarian auctions are|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: a juicy penalty may come n/s way now|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jr7: not good Ø/V |pg||
nt|MolvaM: 4c previous round would have ended it probably|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well 5@C will drift down - e/w were just too busy|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 2 down if they can find their @d ruff|pg||
nt|MolvaM: to get 6 imps|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jr7: I dont like Dbl from Dombi - 4@C must be the bid|pg||
pc|h5|nt|roswolf: but i agree 4@C might well be passed out|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pg||
nt|roswolf: agree jorgen|pg||
nt|MolvaM: does @hK send the @dA message?|pg||
nt|roswolf: it would for me|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|cJ|pc|s5|pc|c8|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dJ|pc|d4|nt|MolvaM: I would suggest contributing the @hQ|pg||
nt|MolvaM: that could stop the @h continuation perhaps?|pg||
nt|roswolf: good suggestion|pg||
nt|MolvaM: in the meantime he still must find the jack|pg||
nt|MolvaM: of @s|pg||
pc|dA|pg||

nt|brolucius: Jeffrey Allerton and Frances Hinden (who is playing at the other table) are a couple, and have won the prestigious Gold Cup (Britain's top knock-out) together.|pg||
nt|brolucius: So far as I know, Hinden has never played women's bridge. She is a top executive for an oil company.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: what do we know about their systems?|pg||
nt|brolucius: E/W were playing straightforward stuff against Russia. I assume that the French play the standard French system, near enough. It will be good kibitzing.|pg||
nt|granguru:  but it is a good idea that the very first control is A (or KQ)|pg||
nt|pelu: no|pg||
nt|granguru:  not vul sorry only 22!|pg||
nt|peachy: aah, by the end of tha match, maybe I learn some French by osmosis :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: and me some English|pg||
mb|2D|an| |nt|chmitty: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chmitty: 2@d both majors ?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|chmitty: seems so|pg||
nt|peachy: Long time ago, we used to call those bids Polish two suiters, nowadays there are several variations and names for them|pg||
nt|peachy: Hungarian kib tells it is 5@h-4@s, or 4414 or 4405, 11-15HCP|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  would like to hear your arguments...I am open minded :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chmitty: So Lauria will probably reject the option of double ... which could be effective in front of a @s lenght|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  kibz might enjoy an expert view on the matter|pg||
nt|paulg:  I don't think cue bidding first and second round controls equally makes a huge difference to bidding slams, a lot of it still comes down to judgement|pg||
pc|cA|nt|paulg:  i think the italians beat the americans so often because they had practised partnerships and better bidding methods|pg||
nt|granguru:  being an  expensive deparment players try to reduce judgement and increase accuracy|pg||
nt|granguru:  good advice...on all contracts under 6NT|pg||
nt|peachy: There are no convention cards available for us (or anyone) so appreciate kib help in interpreting bids|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d4|nt|granguru:  agree paul|pg||
nt|paulg:  this hand has another debatable point .. how do you break transfers?|pg||
nt|pelu: too difficult to start a cue bid if only A, a cue is an invitation for slam and often u will miss that - and bidding economy also tell u to start with the lovers cue bid|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|brolucius: Since there were so many small boards in the first half, I was hoping that all the spectacular stuff had been saved for the second half. False hopes...|pg||
nt|granguru:  from 6NT on the strategy changes|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Murat|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hello everyone :)|pg||
nt|pelu: 5 toptricks for defense, but not easy to take them|pg||
nt|paulg:  i dislike showing a weak doubleton and telling them what to lead|pg||
nt|granguru:  at top level players almost always lead the right card|pg||
pc|cT|pc|s5|nt|granguru:  so it is better to bid accurately|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|brolucius: East has found a strong lead.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|pelu: now 7 tricks for Tokay|pg||
nt|pelu: prob 3@C dont show about @Cs but only maxz and 3 card support|pg||
nt|paulg:  but i approve of breaking the transfer with only 3-card support, when you are so suitable|pg||
nt|granguru:  once hamman erred a gran slam lead...20 years the hand was appearing in the news|pg||
nt|peachy: running scores Round 3 (this round) http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/orrrunda3.html|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|granguru:  And he used Judgement..with 2 aces he led the shortest one..(wrong)|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c4|pg||
nt|chmitty: Great decision by Lauria : 5@c would be at least 2 off when 4@h is down|pg||
nt|peachy: I did find a fairly recent card for EW http://www.archiviobridge.it/lauria-versace.pdf|pg||
pc|h9|nt|MolvaM: running a long suit usually creates problems for the defence|pg||
nt|peachy: NS basic system is Strong Club|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|hK|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now a club ruff will beat it.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: -1 with best defence. a @c switch now|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  @h9 ?|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  looks to ask for @d|pg||
nt|brolucius: Failing that, a trump misguess by declarer.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and in that case possibilities to -2|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  E isn't willing to ask for a @c switch, not knowing what partner has in @c I think|pg||
nt|brolucius: South was declarer, after a transfer response to 1@C, at the other table.|pg||
nt|brolucius: We thought, in the match against Russia, that they seemed to be playing reverse suit-preference. So, maybe she has asked for a club.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But if there is any possibility to defeat, it must be a @c ruff by E. Declarer can have @sKQJ|pg||
nt|pelu: in CR EW missed the defense against 4@S - played by S: @H to K, @D to A Now @CK to A, @S to 8 and Q, @CJ to Q - but not @C again|pg||
pc|s3|nt|pelu: now 9|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|sT|pg||
nt|pelu: well played by W - he set up a trap - and N fall in|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and looking happily for the 10th|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|sJ|pc|s9|pg||
nt|granguru:  looks that there is no way to win...no entry to dummy|pg||
nt|granguru:  @DK ?|pg||
nt|peachy: There are 15 groups of 8 teams each, the top three (I think) will advance to the Swiss, from where top teams advance to KO etc|pg||
nt|peachy: This isnt quite making, I think|pg||
mc|9|nt|granguru:  what about small @d ?|pg||

nt|granguru:  garozzo had another saying..when you have a singleton, lead it...|pg||
nt|granguru:  obviously at suit contracts|pg||
nt|peachy: It is one of his famous "Rules"|pg||
nt|granguru:  in general, it made life easier for the defense...if you didnt lead a singleton..you didnt have it...|pg||
nt|peachy: Another one of Garozzo's: "Must have a very good reason for not leading trump"|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|rcerreto:  openings are getting lighter and lighter, these days|pg||
nt|paulg:  his line did have a lot of play|pg||
mb|2D|nt|granguru:  well if @H behave he could have made it..but that would have mean @S were also 1-1 and the line should have been different|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|pelu: top-players dont like the @d-suit :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: 2@d must be relay for clarification, and 3@c shows no major probably|pg||
nt|chmitty: Will south bid 3NT with 3 small spades ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: 2C prob Precision style, 5-6 clubs with possible 4-card major|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rcerreto:  tough lead|pg||

mb|p|nt|pelu: Mahaffey won the first match 17-13 against a team from Romania (with Bocchi-Maddala!?), Aspe lost 10-20 to a strong team from England|pg||

nt|ralfwil: but he needed @dJ on dummy|pg||
nt|granguru:  or 3. very low level, doubled contracts|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chmitty: next anyhow|pg||
mb|1C|nt|pelu: ok NS play transfer over 1@c|pg||
nt|peachy: This is what commentator slang calls "coffee hand". No problems, everyone go refill your drink of choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|rcerreto:  that's why she bid 3 :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Maybe 2@D?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ralfwil: how many @s from W? I vote for 3@s|pg||
nt|paulg:  i expect double shows the majors|pg||
nt|pelu: nice play to get 7 tricks in 2@c|pg||
nt|peachy: There certainly are very good reasons not to lead trump, but if one cant find one, then...trump|pg||
nt|granguru:  aaah yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|rcerreto:  a good partner has the J|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rcerreto:  oops, sorry|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  he bid|pg||
nt|ralfwil: anyone with me?|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  with 2@d?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Closer to 3@S than 1@S, perhaps.|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  1@s looks a little timid to me|pg||
nt|pelu: strange take out X by Baldurson|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: a 6-card suit @hK and a stiff @d|pg||
nt|brolucius: Spade game needs to be bid.|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  good sacrifice in 5@d|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so 1@s probably shows 3 card spades?|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry - prob support x in @H|pg||
mb|2C|nt|brolucius: I don't know that 1@H was right when East had indicated the majors.|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  maybe it was also meant to show real @c|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  unsure though|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3@h is for me a strong 3@s rise and an invite to 4@s|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and baldurson dbl is kind of a support dbl?|pg||
nt|pelu: ok he was down 2 - but recived a gift|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Allerton may have misread 3@H but East can correct.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Anyway, this is the sort of board we were looking for, after so much drab stuff.|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  he has a pretty good hand, in context|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but you agree with the strong rise David?|pg||
nt|peachy: Strong 1C, probable 0-7 or some such 1D|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  under this premise I agree fully..the same philosophy of the 6NT lead..dont give tricks away to declarer on the initial lead.|pg||
nt|granguru:  when you have points in all side suits normally declarer has a solid trump suit...|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Presumably intended as that. Since 1@S shows very little, as I see it, East might also consider 3@S.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but the best with this bidding is that W has shown his @h honour|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  maybe their standard for free bids is higher than yours and mine|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|pelu: Easr didnt read the X from West as @hs|pg||

pc|h8|nt|brolucius: Although we may quibble with the odd bid or two, it seems that the players have judged it very well around the table. |pg||
nt|rcerreto:  anyway, they succeeded in bidding the par|pg||
nt|brolucius: The term 'free bid' was responsible for a lot of awful bidding many decades ago.|pg||

nt|granguru:  @C would have best|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s2|pc|hK|nt|peachy: Good play trick 1, lead smelled like singleton (maybe doubleton) so retaining finessing opetion to clubs toward hand|pg||

nt|granguru:  EW has 3 5-2 ones|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|brolucius: 4@D made against the 300 here, so a big swing to Badger.|pg||

mb|p|nt|pelu: again 1Nt with a 5 card @S - |pg||
mb|2C|nt|murat: and now ?|pg||
nt|peachy: 1NT 12-16 1st and 2nd seat|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: North was in 3NT at the other table, doubled and ran to 4@D.|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@h will be hearts and a minor, so North asks|pg||
nt|chmitty: 1NTx was sort of +380 but Soith escapes|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat: not the best lead|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3d could be makable but tokay wasnt sure about 5 cards @d|pg||
nt|granguru:  NS guessing can win 3@D|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|rcerreto:  do EW play transfer?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Transfers opposite 1@C are popular.|pg||
nt|granguru:  we will see a good fight here|pg||
nt|granguru:  as 2@S is a difficult contract to win|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: With four aces missing, it seems that the three-level may be high enough.|pg||
nt|pelu: that the problem with 1@D opening - partner dont know if u have 2 or 5 :)|pg||
nt|pelu: some play for 4@s - but US never found the @s-fit|pg||
nt|granguru:  mmm|pg||
nt|granguru:  Does S have nothing clear  to lead?|pg||
mb|p|nt|chmitty: and Lauria does not give up|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|peachy: Not knowing their system, North's Pass might have included better hands, and wek hands run immediately via Rdbl, that is one way of playing|pg||
pc|c3|nt|brolucius: Obviously East had read West for a much better hand than he holds.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ralfwil: and I can´t see why...|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cJ|nt|brolucius: Such a shame to lose IMPs unnecessarily when there are so many other ways of losing IMPs.|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  could W consider his hand balanced?|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  then open 1NT (or rebidding, if 1NT is weak)?|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@C was presumably non-forcing, so it is hard to see how East had enough to look for an 11-trick game.|pg||
nt|granguru:  well he treated the  hand as a croos ruffing type|pg||
nt|granguru:  and protected potential @d tricks|pg||
nt|peachy: Protected diamond tricks I think|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ralfwil: If 1@s is´nt spades, 1nt from W looks normal for me |pg||

nt|Walddk3: Both losing semifinalists are awarded bronze medals. There is no playoff for third place (a good decision in my view)|pg||
nt|brolucius: East hoping for a heart ruff.|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  yes, 3rd-4th place finals are dull|pg||
nt|brolucius: But neither team has a bronze medal in their sights at this moment.|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  winning A and playing a @h back would have forced S to play trumps but...|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  this way has a chance to discard a @h on @s|pg||
nt|pelu: why sh he X?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rcerreto:  a very good chance now|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|pc|c6|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|cA|nt|pelu: score now 13-1 for Lavazza|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|s5|pg||

pc|sT|nt|brolucius: 2NT was just made on the deal where E/W went two down in 4@C, so 8 IMPs to Zimmermann.|pg||

nt|MolvaM: baldursson has too many high cards and has to defend carefully to avoid being thrown in|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: after RKcb reveals all the missing controls it will be hard to be certain of where the 13th trick will come from|pg||

mb|5C|mb|p|nt|MolvaM: hmm this looks like they lost their way|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|roswolf: for the grand maybe|pg||

nt|roswolf: 5nt can you bid the grand?|pg||
nt|roswolf: for me @H are agreed as trumps|pg||
nt|MolvaM: even 4H would have been better than the 3H that zaleski chose|pg||

mb|6C|nt|MolvaM: I think he will just bid 6 and close the files|pg||

nt|Walddk3: Can you stand another nail-biter, David?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, I have taken my pills.|pg||
nt|pelu: sorru on East|pg||
nt|granguru:  panski is trying to cash all defensive tricks bfore it is too late|pg||
nt|chmitty: a nice "challenge the champs" deal here|pg||
nt|chmitty: 7@h = 20/20|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Kamil's team is listed as transnational, not USA, in the event|pg||
mb|1C|nt|granguru:  S multi 2@D|pg||
nt|paulg:  good result for Meckwell in the other room (probably not the last time we'll say that in this championship)|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  I've noticed many pairs treat the Multi 2@d as weak with spades when it comes to their 2nd seat defence|pg||
nt|pelu: and 5@H close to make on a small @S-lead |pg||
nt|paulg:  it's rare to see that in the UK, but would work here|pg||
nt|paulg:  3@h from North?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk3: No credit for my hy-phen?|pg||
nt|pelu: for D = balanced 12-15 or any 16+|pg||
nt|pelu: for me|pg||
nt|granguru:  Amoil played for SA in the world teams in bermuda 2000 |pg||
nt|peachy: really light third-seater here|pg||
nt|vugraphplb: i thought that he is from Usa becouse he doesn't exist in EBL base|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  that is the norm in the UK too|pg||
mb|2H|nt|paulg:  4@d will be 'bid your major' (4@c would have been transfer to your major)|pg||
nt|granguru:  yes many play 2@D x= short in @S |pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: wd by West|pg||
nt|granguru:  and 2@d - 2@h 5+ @H|pg||
nt|paulg:  this is similar to the situation in the Open Room, where West doubled|pg||
nt|pelu: forcing pass in N?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|brolucius: Be careful because jtr is watching.|pg||
nt|granguru:  now a correct flag in W ...thanks Michal|pg||
nt|peachy: and another 16+ 1C here, maybe they have additional agreements on what constitutes a 1C opening that we do not know about |pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: ??? dbl from me as E|pg||
nt|paulg:  surely not a forcing pass situation|pg||
mb|4H|nt|pelu: but East help him, in on @CK he played @D - ruff, @C to A @S to 10 and duck - and now endplayed - East sh play @C back and no endplay|pg||
mb|p|nt|rcerreto:  a cheap save on 4@h|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@S has escaped a double, but the cards lie well for declarer so the lack of a double will not cost E/W much.|pg||
nt|granguru:  In the meanwhile NS surpassed the safet level of 5@C|pg||
nt|granguru:  is 6@C makeable?|pg||
nt|granguru:  after A GAROZZO's lead|pg||
nt|peachy: on the surface, looks like just lose a spade, whether the tricks are there is another matter|pg||
nt|peachy: Kib who knows NS style says they love to surprise opps with frequent tactical bids|pg||
mb|4S|an| |mb|p|nt|ralfwil: but still a dbl....|pg||
nt|granguru:  2 discards on reds|pg||
nt|chmitty: as long as they do not surprise themselves that's fine :)|pg||
mb|5H|nt|pelu: why not - u have bid game Red against green |pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: its for me a good standard rule|pg||
nt|chmitty: Full brakes on, from North's standpoint|pg||
nt|chmitty: South has a lot ... can he give up ?|pg||
nt|peachy: 6 controls opposite strong club, he just cant pass|pg||
mb|5S|an| |mb|p|nt|brolucius: Had the cards lain differently, not doubling might have waved goodbye to 500 or so.|pg||
nt|brolucius: East may have feared a third-hand opener, but her side was vulnerable.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a thirs hand opening, but I can take 170 extra if declarer makes|pg||
nt|brolucius: West does not know that partner holds 10 points, so he cannot double 4@S even with an extra value or so. |pg||
nt|ralfwil: but shouldn´t E?|pg||
nt|pelu: now N can make 1NT - topplay @Hs and only 6 tricks for EW|pg||
nt|granguru:  3 discards on reds sorry|pg||
nt|granguru:  one @S given up|pg||
mb|5N|an| |mb|p|nt|Walddk3: The contract is doubled at both tables in the other match|pg||
nt|granguru:  so just one ruff needed|pg||
nt|peachy: It is also possible that 4S was RKC|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Quite right.|pg||
nt|chmitty: May be 4@s was kind of blackwood|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: it does make|pg||
nt|granguru:  not even garozzo beats 6@c here|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: WD White House team|pg||
nt|peachy: It would be nice if in a competition of this level, there were convention cards available|pg||
nt|chmitty: true :(|pg||
nt|chmitty: True also that there are many pairs in competition : huge job|pg||
nt|peachy: It makes kibitzing so much nicer, to know what the auction means|pg||
pc|d3|nt|chmitty: a suggestion could be that the players had to fill themselves an "electronic convention card" before the championship|pg||
pc|dA|nt|chmitty: that will come soon, I'm sure|pg||
pc|d2|nt|murat: he should played the Ace @h|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|hK|nt|paulg:  it is a good standard rule for me too, but not when one hand has pre-empted|pg||
pc|h7|nt|brolucius: Now East may grab @CA.|pg||

nt|rcerreto:  should she risk -420 to get 100 instead of 50?|pg||
nt|dburn: risk? what risk?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Better to risk a double in the first place.|pg||
nt|Walddk3: An excellent 6@D now|pg||
nt|dburn: declarer could have the singleton king of clubs only if she had about ten cards rather than thirteen|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  can declarer have one more @d one less @c?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@d on NS - a nice contract|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  N was declarer, I think|pg||
nt|Walddk3: In theory, there is a club ruff, but fortunately for declarer, the defender with the singleton club also has @DA|pg||
nt|brolucius: An interesting bidding test. If they bid it, I will applaud.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 6@C is more tricky and that might be reached.|pg||
nt|Walddk3: They may arrive in 6@C, though|pg||
nt|Walddk3: With problems on a spade lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: can they make 1C after a @c lead? I doubt|pg||
nt|brolucius: This is the sort of board we were hoping for. No-one wants these matches to be decided on small margins after some drab boards.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry @s lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@c after a @s lead....|pg||
nt|peachy: In "real" championships, I think that is how it is done, these championships are open to anybody who wants enter from anywhere in the world, no qualification required|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|brolucius: If one side wins after doing better on the big boards, then good luck to them - (even if they are not from England)|pg||
nt|murat: that was unexpected|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the contract went both ways during play and finally declarer came out as the winner|pg||
nt|paulg:  Seeing your partner pass when you have a balanced zero count is never good|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|pelu: 34 HCP - I exp slam with most tables|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@s now from South?|pg||
nt|peachy: And teams can have members from any country = all transnational|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|ralfwil: If declarer plays @d before havinc cleaned trumps, another @s will set up a trumph trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: D'Ovidio has started well by emphasizing the diamonds before supporting clubs.|pg||
nt|granguru:  NS has a score sheet we all like to bring to the comparison table...all NS scores|pg||
mb|2N|nt|Walddk3: 6@C in the closed room|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Waiting for the lead|pg||
nt|Walddk3: @SQ|pg||
nt|chmitty: 2NT forcing asking for clarifications|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: but not so easy to bid the Grand|pg||
nt|granguru:  7@D should be|pg||
mb|3N|nt|brolucius: Ouch!|pg||
nt|murat: would you also prefer 2@s ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Imagine winning the board with 3NT.|pg||
nt|brolucius: A spade lead would not beat 3NT if clubs were 3-2.|pg||
nt|brolucius: not beat 6@C, I mean|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ralfwil: true!|pg||
nt|paulg:  tougher when you have not shown your 5-card support for partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: roller-coaster :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: this is interesting|pg||
nt|murat: Tokay should work some |pg||
nt|MolvaM: has to keep south out|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  Even if that doesnt mean anything, usually it is a good sign...|pg||
nt|chmitty: Lauria could hold : Kx KQ10xxx x Kxxx whixh would produce an excellent slam|pg||
pc|s3|nt|peachy: Declarer does not know how hearts sit so he might duck one, but as it is, does not matter|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|nt|pelu: would u X in West or bid 2Nt?|pg||

nt|peachy: there are 15 groups of 8 teams each|pg||
nt|chmitty: only danger to consider|pg||
nt|chmitty: ha can : a) play Ace @h and @h or b) play small @h to retain an extra entry in dummy or c) unblock @s ace and run Q @h|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pelu: but then u would mis a 4-4 fit in @H - pd could be 4-4-3-2|pg||
pc|h7|nt|murat: dbl i guess|pg||
nt|pelu: for 100% 2NT|pg||

nt|pelu: 2NT = 16-19, D + 2Nt = 20+|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s6|nt|MolvaM: whenever I double, lefty bids 4@h and pd bids 4@s with 4 cards|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c4|nt|brolucius: So, 20+ IMPs swing due to a 4-1 break. Well, that's part of the game. Hard to take, though.|pg||
nt|murat: he was afraid of Q@c |pg||
pc|cA|nt|pelu: @cQ and @S back and Tokay will regret that he used his only entry to dummy|pg||
nt|MolvaM: kibs are shocked... to play clubs from hand is purely double dummy. he cant do that|pg||
nt|pelu: but against storng defense his plan sh fail|pg||
nt|MolvaM: he can hope that @cA is with north but very hard to play for both honors to be there|pg||
nt|pelu: if S has showed distrbution in the black suits - and easy defense for N|pg||
nt|MolvaM: well some days even 2 club tricks could be enough|pg||
nt|MolvaM: he could catch the @dQ|pg||
