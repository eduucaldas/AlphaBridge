nt|henryb:  have you taken a session off, Jan?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Weichsel asks "what's your opening bid style?" B & R: "light - we open most 11's and some 10's. Weichsel: "you open balanced 11?" "some, not all"|pg||
nt|vugraphpl4: hello, they are in the middle of a board, we will skip after they finish|pg||

mb|p|nt|kit: Boyd chose to make light response|pg||
nt|baardolav: Hey Andreas|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kit: Double is support double|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ... - not now|pg||
nt|stc: Most E will open 2@s, giving the good lead|pg||
nt|hajru:  Welcome to the quarter finals of the european mixed|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Round of 32 rather|pg||
nt|andreasw:  hi Baard:-)|pg||
mb|p|nt|tihana: hi everyone, fast start!|pg||
nt|ntmon: welcome to last set of Swiss stage of Mixed Teams, Euro 2011, Poznan|pg||
mb|2C|nt|henryb:  and pass is "I don't have much"|pg||
nt|ntmon: X show 15+ with @c|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Markku Pekkinen|pg||
nt|ntmon: N believes in 7 @C quick tricks, an Ace and trick in dummy for her free bid|pg||
nt|runnerup: hi all|pg||
nt|ntmon: hi Markku|pg||
nt|tihana: hi everybody!|pg||
nt|ntmon: 5th and 6th team of actual standings meet here|pg||
nt|vugraphpl4: http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/swleaderb.html|pg||
nt|ntmon: hi everyone|pg||
nt|ntmon: quiet board for starter|pg||
nt|Walddk1: 2 segments o 14 boards|pg||
nt|ppiglett: The mandatory trump lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|kit: 3NT cold -- they should get there -- probably 3@H from Lair, 3NT from Weishel|pg||
nt|kit: 3@C conservative -- now Weichsel has a problem|pg||
nt|henryb:  Lair has a problem|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would have tried 2N as Weichsel|pg||
nt|kit: sorry, had that backwards -- missed a bid|pg||
nt|kit: I agree Henry, Weichsel could have tried 2NT|pg||
nt|henryb:  we are all sleepy: earlier Kerri Sanborn tried to analyze a hand played counter-clockwise|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: That would be a new sort of bridge, wouldn't it? Counter-clockwise play - maybe clockwise on even numbered boards and counter-clockwise on odd?|pg||
nt|baardolav: The bidding is near the limits now all ways and ended in 3@d NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: if you guess hearts 5 @d makes ew but difficult to bid|pg||
mb|2N|nt|kit: Auction started exactly same way, but South bid 2NT and cold game was reached|pg||
nt|jaapfr: gm all|pg||
mb|p|nt|andreasw:  5 @d makes but not to bid:-)|pg||
nt|baardolav: Two single red kings onside|pg||
mb|p|nt|riccho:  hi everybody; hope to see some exciting boards here|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: so this is good save anyway |pg||
nt|ntmon: 3@D showed fit but @CQ seems useless, so no further interest by E|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kit: 9 of diamonds discouraging, so likely will find heart shift to hold to 4.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|baardolav: yes 5@d make doubledummy, find the single @d king|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|pg||
nt|tihana: nice lead directing 3@C|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 9 tricks for sure|pg||
nt|hajru:  This looks like a cold 3NT.  |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|henryb:  The drawback to responding with Boyd's hand is the few hands where it goes 1@d-1@h-2N-P-P-X|pg||
nt|snorre: Hi all and welcome to 1st round Robin EU from Poznan, Poland. |pg||
pc|c8|nt|kit: pretty rare to get doubled in 2NT Henry|pg||
nt|henryb:  the advantage is that sometimes the opponents miss a game|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Weichsel went to the bathroom while he was dummy so we're now waiting for him |pg||
nt|henryb:  There was a creative player in NY by the name of Larry Edwards who believed strongly that the auctions 2N-P-P and 1X-1Y-2N-P-P should always be doubled|pg||
nt|baardolav: 3@d should make easaly, prob +1|pg||
nt|riccho:  in the first session only the last three boards from team "Zimmermann" prevented them from being far behind|pg||
pc|c5|nt|hajru:  Is east mrs. Duboin?  |pg||
nt|vugraphpl4: we need to shut down|pg||
nt|vugraphpl4: we will back in the moment|pg||
nt|blum1956: the best lead by Anna Gulevich, the contract must go 1 off|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|mamos: hello all|pg||

pc|hT|pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ntmon: 5@D requires getting @H correctly|pg||
pc|sT|nt|runnerup: looks like -3 imps -ew really bid they game,but misguessed  @h  i think|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|pg||
mc|6|nt|snorre: At the end of the Round-robin the first  3 teams from each group in the open will qualify for Swiss A and the other teams for Swiss B|pg||

mb|p|nt|rv: in my view watching, playing and commenting on these contracts is to test temparament of respective folks:)|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|rv: excellent little slam|pg||
mb|1H|nt|riccho:  the void in @h vs Qxxx is good enough to be in 6|pg||
mb|d!|nt|riccho:  the higher E jumps the higher is the probability that NS reaches slam|pg||
mb|4H|nt|rv: double by North is negative usually promising 4@S|pg||
mb|5H|nt|riccho:  Now S sould be very proud of his hand... |pg||
nt|riccho:  should|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: Intonti's bid should propel N-S to slam, maybe North will bid 5n as choice of slam?|pg||
nt|riccho:  N has a lot of stuff but no aces|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|riccho:  He offers 6@d in a plain way, but I like the idea of 5NT|pg||
nt|rv: North has 3+ (@SK, @sq, @DK and possibly @DQ) cover/working cards, he will surely bid slam on 5@h|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|riccho:  maybe 5@h was already agreeing fit in @s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|nt|rv: declarer should tackle @cs before playing 3rd round of @s on @HA, West should duck first @c smoothly to give declarer losing option|pg||
nt|riccho:  intonti is a young and promising italian, who already won the junios WC in 1999|pg||
nt|rv: I suspect declarer will play @c to @CJ after 1 round of trump ending in dummy, if it wins he will play second round of trump to dummy and play another @C|pg||
nt|rv: in that line even if either opponent ruffs second @c, declarer should be home |pg||
nt|riccho:  as long as the finesse works...|pg||
nt|rv: West's best chance is to duck first @c finesse smoothly to give declarer a losing option|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|s4|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|rv: Intonti is doing what any good declarer will do, taking time before playing to first trick to plan out play, he is catering to scenarios where one or both black suits break badly|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|riccho:  in that case decl should ruff 2 @h in his hand|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|c7|pc|c9|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|pc|d9|pc|d3|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
mc|12|nt|riccho:  not the most testing defense here, but after declarer decided this way, EW couldnÂ´t do a thing|pg||
nt|rv: not sure if this line workd if @s had broken badly|pg||
pg||
qx|c2|st||md|4SAJ94HDA73CAQJ854,S53HAKT95D864CKT3,SKQT7HQ42DKQJ5C72,S862HJ8763DT92C96|sv|n|nt|henryb:  So John Lowenthal set a trap for him once, passing partner's 2N opening with a balanced 11|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Weichsel is back - asked about the result and then "is 3N cold?" Lair: "yes" Weichsel: "what was your hand" Lair told him|pg||
nt|runnerup: bad slam ,but makes -so should be 4 @h +2|pg||
nt|ntmon: this is Euro 2011, Mixed Teams, Swiss stage, Rd  3|pg||
nt|ntmon: teams corrently 5th and 6th met here |pg||
nt|riccho:  a simple board to start with; at the tabel I always appreciate this :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: 1 IMP for Lavazza|pg||
nt|tihana: slamish hands on NS|pg||
nt|tihana: and unfortune break in hs|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Hello Tihana, Jon and Vladimir. Have fun|pg||
mb|1C|nt|snorre: The Norwegians play transfers after opening 1@c, so 1@d show 4+ @h's|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jbgood: hi|pg||
mb|d|nt|kit: Weichsel will have to bid 2@H -- then what?|pg||
nt|henryb:  he redoubled for 1230|pg||
nt|kit: Probably 2NT by Lair|pg||
nt|andreasw:  here close 28-29|pg||
nt|mamos: big hands for NS|pg||
nt|kastan88: slam time|pg||
nt|mamos: slam in Blacks|pg||
nt|snorre: Dbl= 4+ @s's|pg||
mb|3H|nt|stc: efficient bid by N|pg||
nt|tihana: even 3 sp is too high|pg||
nt|tihana: hi|pg||
nt|jbgood: unlucky in a way to locate the heart fit|pg||
nt|ntmon: hi Jon|pg||
nt|jbgood: 3@s now?|pg||
nt|tihana: how many tricks in hs make?|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|kit: good decision to pass -- and now E-W may get in trouble|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Strange 1 NT - open 1 @D and bid @C|pg||
nt|baardolav: pony 29, calandra 28|pg||
nt|andreasw:  2 nt showing - 15-17?|pg||
nt|baardolav: not sure, they might play strong club too|pg||
mb|4N|nt|henryb:  North passed, East bid 2H|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  back up Jan|pg||
nt|ntmon: S may feel too strong for a simple splinter|pg||
nt|riccho:  NS are two wellknown players from france; both of them winning numerous national and international titles. |pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  @H-shift holds to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|stc: 5@d : -500, so a good save|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But only South bid @D...|pg||
nt|stc: :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Another reason to open1 @D|pg||
nt|stc: 5@s by N is also cold|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not with @H-shift, I told you, morning|pg||
nt|ntmon: actually 12 tricks depends on @D suit, bidding slam is not totally out of question|pg||
nt|ntmon: many will prefer 1NT by N|pg||
nt|ntmon: that would lead to a partscore|pg||
nt|andreasw:  kibbitzers told me - they play Polish club|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Flat asa pancake - slam a mile off.|pg||
nt|snorre: Allan Livgaard (south) is captain for the Norwegian ladies Teams|pg||
nt|snorre: sry, this is his brother, henrik|pg||
mb|6S|nt|mcarroll: A lot depends on the lead here - a @S would set up discards.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: No hope now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i miss why W bids 2@S and not 1@S|pg||
nt|andreasw:  10-11 tricks|pg||
nt|baardolav: Sementa hit the best lead|pg||
nt|riccho:  EW are not known to me, but hopefully michael can held here ...|pg||
nt|riccho:  help; sry IÂ´m a typomaster ... :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: of course, game has 5 top losers|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes:-)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Particularly if Lair reopens with a double|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Better? My connection's been very good here, so I've stopped looking to make sure the passes register |pg||
nt|kit: This will not be pretty, that's for sure|pg||
nt|stc: yes, u r right|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: Robinson asks about signals: "standard but odd/even first discard"|pg||
nt|ntmon: 3NT non-serious?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hawe45:  Over - but West might even be single @H...|pg||
nt|jbgood: looks like it |pg||
nt|snorre: Great bidding by NS...|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ppiglett: Expect a diamond lead - J9xx usually give a trick in this situation|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kit: cashing ace of hearts seems clear|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: maybe not that clear?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think declarer can emerge with 6 tricks|pg||
nt|ntmon: N shows 18+ range, S might be interested|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if W shows only 4 card @S then why E 4@S:)?|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|tihana: Wild Griffins are on 5th place now, Jacob on 7th|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ntmon: there are variations of 2@D enquiry, some of them showing 4M5m - then bidding slam would be easier|pg||
nt|jbgood: of course 6@h is a good slam - only going down on a foul trump split|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|nt|jcomyn: oh a change|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|kit: 6 looks easy -- it is  7 I'm wondering about|pg||
nt|danilo1: Good morning all|pg||
nt|jcomyn: morning danilo|pg||
nt|mareczek: Hallo everybody from Poznan|pg||
nt|jaapfr: am I in the right room:)?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ntmon: 3NT non-serious says: i am not that strong for taking initiative, but i don't want rob you of space for investigation|pg||
nt|tihana: Yan is serious :)|pg||
nt|ntmon: taking initiative :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: he thought he could beat 6 NT too|pg||
nt|jbgood: not unreasonable|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||

nt|danilo1: :)|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 2 imp gain for Rossard here and the lead changes hands|pg||
nt|riccho:  thr lead made the contract comfortable for declarer|pg||
nt|mamos: one would expect a flat board at this level|pg||
nt|snorre: Excellent played by Mr. Versace..   South has to be careful now...|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|dK|nt|baardolav: nothing more now|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|c7|nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Markku Pekkinen|pg||
nt|ntmon: Yan on money|pg||
nt|jbgood: the light interference next door seems to have made it impossible for NS to find out they wer cold for slam on a decent layout...|pg||

nt|snorre: Open Teams Round Robin have both excellent teams, "normal" ones and teams where you and I can join...   |pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|hawe45:  But in fact, -650 is better for E/W than -620 - then they doÂ´nt think about the 500-sacrifice|pg||

nt|danilo1: 4@S may be inetersting ... but what will be really played?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: nver get there|pg||
nt|mamos: so yes  you are right snorre the standard will be varied but we have two top class teams here|pg||
mb|1H|nt|hawe45:  Or play themselves|pg||
nt|riccho:  interesting to see, that at bd1 N opened with 1@H. An opening that even in a limited system would be hardly everybodies choice|pg||
nt|riccho:  this contract is difficult to beat (but not impossible)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|kit: Question is how Lair should raise here|pg||
nt|runnerup: this is 4 @s with  @h guess once again ,but first you have to bid it|pg||
nt|andreasw:  4@s now for sure|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Very Baggy 4S bid with nine trick in the hand. |pg||
nt|riccho:  yes but dummy has no effective trick at all|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  why wouldn't Lair raise right away?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: this makes more sense|pg||
nt|henryb:  would 2@c be forcing here?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: EW may protect and get to a @S patrtscore?|pg||
nt|danilo1: 2@C as expected ... anyone for Dbling minors as North?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: double again|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 1@S - for the lead partner|pg||
nt|baardolav: Very light overbids|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes:-)|pg||
nt|baardolav: Not my style... |pg||
nt|andreasw:  lol|pg||
nt|baardolav: need to finesse the @d Q to make|pg||
nt|baardolav: and get rid of one club from the closed hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: so will probably reach the doomed 4@S contract|pg||
nt|henryb:  sorry, I missed the correction|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Weichsel writes that 2@h = limit raise and Boyd wrote something back that isn't where I can read it|pg||
nt|riccho:  @s 10 would be a nice-to-have-card at dummy|pg||
nt|snorre: I know these Norwegians. They are good, but they dont play at highest level in Noway..|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ntmon: 2@S nat game-forcing|pg||
nt|danilo1: he passed, so maybe best action after pd's Rdble is to Dble ... even if made, 2m is not bad|pg||
pc|cK|nt|runnerup: looks like partscore can be made both direction perhaps |pg||
nt|jbgood: one thing I know for sure - NS will not be bothered by the last board|pg||
nt|baardolav: Calandra have some thoughts about this... Spade need to be 2-2 or H single|pg||
pc|c4|nt|stc: can he guess the K@c ?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  After the bidding, he might - if East shows the @D Ace|pg||
nt|stc: yes, but he will play trump before @d|pg||
nt|ntmon: in my book X over 2@D would be T/O for @H but hand not strong enough|pg||
nt|jbgood: (neither will EW:))|pg||
nt|danilo1: 3@S at least North|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and 4 from s|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|kit: Of course, it isn't 100$ clear for Boyd to continue diamonds when he leads the ace|pg||
nt|henryb:  If 2N was natural, I would think that ten fifth of opener's suit would be a turnoff|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sure|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kit: I can picture hands where heart shift necessary.  But bidding might help him.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Lair: "good luck"|pg||
nt|kit: They do play udca, so 6 won't be readable|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes in club system no big problems to bid,but natural not so easy |pg||
nt|ntmon: 4@S is good contract, will require get @H right|pg||
pc|d5|nt|riccho:  Bd2: 4@s would have been a fairly good contract; I would expect the other tabel to be in 4@s|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|kit: Moment of truth right now|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jcomyn: aggressive|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not a good lead|pg||
nt|danilo1: well, Dble by Guido was expected ... but not sure about the lead|pg||
nt|jcomyn: making now with good guess|pg||
nt|danilo1: I still rather beleieve in down|pg||
nt|jcomyn: why look at it just play J|pg||
nt|danilo1: do not believe she can avoid 2 trump loosers as well as 2 red Aces|pg||
nt|jcomyn: maybe so|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but why the long pause when the j is mandatory|pg||
pc|c6|nt|riccho:  anyone has an idea whcih system EW play? |pg||
pc|d7|nt|stc: any making becuase of @h 4-2|pg||
nt|stc: anyway|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I agree|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Despite the combined 22 count this is not an easy contract - particularly on this @C lead|pg||
nt|tihana: and go down in both directions :)|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|tihana: hm|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mcarroll: so a lose-lose situation :)|pg||
nt|tihana: or win-win for the defence :)|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Carding for n-S very important now.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|henryb:  truth and concequences|pg||
pc|d9|nt|stc: and @d frienly, 3-3 with the 10 showing up|pg||
nt|baardolav: The first hand opening... have shown K of spade, QJ of club and |pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|kit: he got it right -- key was Weichsel's 2NT call -- would be unlikely with doubleton diamond|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mcarroll: glass half-full, half empty??|pg||
pc|cA|nt|baardolav: the @d Q... very well done|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|pg||
nt|riccho:  S ist not allowed to throw a heart|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|nt|hawe45:  East should be 6-2-3-2 now|pg||
nt|andreasw:  10 tricks wd|pg||
nt|riccho:  according to some kibs EW play some sort of polish club; 1@c is than a WK NT or medium club or strong any (some play it less than GF) |pg||
nt|blum1956: Ìàõ Êhven played for Russia many times, including the 2004 Olympiad (3th place). His partner (and wife) Anna Gulevich is 36-th rated in the rating-list (which includes men) and has ...|pg||
nt|blum1956: a Russian mixed teams wins to her credit|pg||
nt|blum1956: EW play the "Beriozka" system (based on Polish club) which is rather popular in Russia|pg||
nt|riccho:  typical polish style is that the 1NT rebid after the neg. 1@d is  a 18-20 BAL type of hand; with 12-14 in polish club they regularly are faking with 1@h or 1@s even with lesse than a 4carder|pg||
pc|c9|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|riccho:  <sgh> so I should have known EW than ... :(|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|pg||
pc|h3|nt|riccho:  Oh she can throw one|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ntmon: surprise|pg||
nt|blum1956: 1@c is weak NT (12-14) or strong (17-18+) any|pg||
pc|hT|nt|runnerup: so miss guessed -1|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|danilo1: West bid 2@C ... so he has 4 ... East who reopened therefore only 2 @C (possible single/double Q) - so @CJ has not been absolute mandatory ... however, good guess|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|cJ|nt|riccho:  so without the medium club stuff in it...|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|pg||
nt|riccho:  if partner plays @d|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ntmon: good @H return|pg||
nt|riccho:  well done|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Well done. These situations can go astray. Not at this level though.|pg||

pc|cT|pc|cA|pc|c9|pc|d4|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Weichsel: "I could have tried something else" Lair: "did you have 5 spades?" Weichsel: "yeah" Boyd: "3N is down 1 also"|pg||
nt|runnerup: so 200 it was a good  desision to pass 1 @h|pg||
nt|ntmon: @h lead is a natural killer, takes away the entry to club tricks|pg||
nt|tihana: 15:15 after two boards|pg||
mb|1C|nt|jbgood: so all of a sudden it is all square|pg||
nt|tihana: i loove this rooom|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Weichsel holds the rare AK EMPTY ninth|pg||
nt|jbgood: the comeback was fast and furious|pg||
mb|1D|nt|henryb:  but the doubleton @d is a good sign|pg||
nt|jbgood: E probaply decided to show a major 2 suiter rather than just her spades|pg||
nt|riccho:  Oh I c they lowered the req for str 1@c comparing to ploish club than.|pg||
nt|snorre: 3Nt possible to win here. |pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|tihana: i think both 3n and 5 cl make, yes?|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorre: Nice layout for EW...|pg||
mb|2N|nt|stc: NS may make games in both majors with some good guessing|pg||
nt|runnerup: brave 2 ! and + once again to ns|pg||
nt|tihana: @H and m i guess|pg||
nt|jbgood: NS have 29 hcp combined - and EW are already in 3@hs :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: polish style?|pg||
nt|danilo1: looks like NS playing kind of Polish @C |pg||
nt|andreasw:  looks like one down|pg||
nt|blum1956: 1@c starting from good 16|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Looked like it would be a dull board, but 4@S was doubled in other room |pg||
nt|ntmon: 1 NT upgraded? but 3NT normal contract|pg||
mb|3N|nt|runnerup: this loks like 3nt but even here 14+11 -some pairs might miss this game -clubs all well and dimonds badly .but 9 tricks|pg||
nt|ntmon: due to lucky @C position, 9 tricks ready without needing @D|pg||
nt|ntmon: do we agree with 2@H or prefer negative X passed out?|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  If you play fantan around the corner, that is a really good suit|pg||
nt|ntmon: 3NT best but North could not know about @H position|pg||
nt|tihana: hmm, auken goes strong|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|riccho:  how comfortable to commentate french players. every bid is cristal clear here |pg||
nt|mamos: never refuse an invitation|pg||
pc|hA|nt|riccho:  xcept sometimes... In the first segment there was a 2@hX contract, which succeeded but shouldnt|pg||
pc|h6|nt|stc: they need at least one good guess in @h@s|pg||
nt|hawe45:  If West later shows the @S Ace, East must have the @H Queen|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ThatÂ´s NO guess|pg||
nt|tihana: making 4?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mcarroll: proving yet again that bridge is a bidder's game|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|jbgood: seems as if NS should stay out of slams this set|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hawe45:  Another @C is correct defence|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Why help declarer?|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Might have killed K-10-x|pg||
nt|snorre: If EW play 15-17NT's, 2NT with 10 is hard.. At most 24 hcp. East liked his Q109 @h's|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|blum1956: which does not help to buy a makeable contract this time))))|pg||
pc|c2|nt|stc: A@s KQ@c and Q@h = 11|pg||
nt|ntmon: going for @D seems percentage action - bad luck |pg||
nt|runnerup: last board was plyed in 2nt inspite off 5-4 in @s but 180 was +6  imps because missguess here in 4 @s|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I prefer the neg X which may be passed out, but it may also lead to 3NT |pg||
nt|ntmon: seems that Auken explained herself the absence of 3NT bid by N as positive signal (no stopper, no vastage) |pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|riccho:  In Bd. 2 I was wrong with my prediction (they reached 4@s but they didnt play it) because EW found the "sacrifice" in 5@h |pg||
nt|riccho:  put away the "" from last sentence... |pg||
pc|h4|nt|danilo1: not good guess in @S|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|nt|stc: not now|pg||
nt|hawe45:  There is a rule: Only ONE opponent can have @S Ace...|pg||
nt|runnerup: y a common convention helps to bid if partner doesn't delive that south bid his cards allready  |pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|tihana: looks like missunderstanding on board 2 in other room|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mamos: declarer has nine tricks as everthing is well placed  i back him to make|pg||
nt|mamos: its not easy and these discards inconvenience him|pg||
nt|snorre: These hands are easier to play for us kib's. We see that all cards are well placed. Versace doesn't...|pg||
pc|d5|nt|stc: and the other the Q¨h|pg||
nt|runnerup: this time you make yhis anyway ,because clubs ao well|pg||
nt|ntmon: S doesn't have an entry for his high @D |pg||
nt|baardolav: one down it will be I belive|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h9|pg||
nt|danilo1: but logical ... after 1@C and 1@H by north and 2@S pass by South, more probable South has 3@S than North|pg||
pc|c4|nt|runnerup: east very much afraid ,but relieved in the end|pg||
nt|riccho:  @sQ|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ntmon: last train :)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|blum1956: no entries to collect everything|pg||
nt|riccho:  this hand: fairly normal to reach game; the EW hands are not very suitable placed|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mcarroll: Which may make - there are 9 tricks available but it is difficult for declarer to untangle the entries required|pg||
nt|baardolav: Gotart is not intending to do any mistakes and cashes the tricks|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jcomyn: and the poor-aul club suit gets buried again|pg||
nt|andreasw:  41-28 to Pony now|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pg||
pc|cA|nt|runnerup: east relives in the end-looked bad for her point of yiew|pg||

nt|chmitty: in french standard, they are not in slam zone|pg||
nt|chmitty: so ...|pg||
nt|riccho:  agree with 1@c? I find it peculiar that a french player opens v-vs this hand|pg||
nt|riccho:  another edgy contract|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kit: I'm surprised Weichsel didn't bid 3@S, unless he feared that would show 3.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Probably does not expect partner to have such robust majors for 3@d|pg||
nt|ntmon: S afraid of T/O X expecting to be passed out|pg||

pc|dK|nt|kit: If they do stumble into slam, a lot will ride on the lead|pg||

nt|runnerup: yes 8 only -beacuse  @h ruff so some chances to make 9 in clubs so-|pg||
nt|baardolav: well even easier... now I would like +2 |pg||
pc|cT|nt|kit: 5@D is really a pretty poor contract compared to 3NT, but it will make|pg||
nt|kit: I agree Henry.  Both took unclear views -- Weichsel might have bid 2@C instead of 3@C, Lair might have bid 3NT instead of 3@D, and Weichsel might have bid 3@S instead of 4@C.|pg||
nt|danilo1: no entries for @C lead ... but on any lead, declarer has enought time to develop 2@S tricks - so allways making ... |pg||
nt|jcomyn: and like the club, d opening denies d suit by the looks of things|pg||
nt|danilo1: good choice 3NT instead 4@H, may be swing board|pg||
pc|c4|nt|hawe45:  Tries the @C-suit, but wins through the @S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This seems wrong. Try @C 3-3 - and then @S. By starting with @D, opponents might just take their 5 tricks|pg||
nt|hawe45:  starting with @S... sry|pg||
nt|runnerup: 4 spades you seems to have too bad suit and too much defensive values|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|c6|pc|c5|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mcarroll: depends on how @H are played - but no real choice - so yes it makes|pg||
nt|andreasw:  rest now:-) |pg||
nt|mamos: yes just thinking I might organise coffee :)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|stc: start with @s is normal, the A@S may be an entry for @d|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Never seen so bad play - with such a good result. Now even an end-play against West|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|stc: the play is bad only if E has exactly ADxxx of @d|pg||
nt|jbgood: look at Versace's 1 spade inbid on   2 - and you will see why this match is swingy|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sJ|nt|ntmon: 7 tricks only becauseof 2 @D S entries - well defended|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|riccho:  the edgy contract of 4@s in Bd. 3 a this table earned 10 imps for the russian team|pg||

nt|riccho:  some sort of partscore - overtrick relaxing here |pg||
mb|1D|mb|2D!|mb|d|an| |nt|riccho:  good 4@h contract reached by the closed room|pg||
nt|rv: 2@d is michaels here showing majors, many play it as split range (either <11 or > 15)|pg||
mb|r|nt|riccho:  the vuln. may shade the quality of the S hand a bit|pg||
nt|rv: maybe North could bid 3@h as mixed raise or 3@c as showing @c values with fit for a major|pg||
mb|p|nt|riccho:  at the other tabel 2@d just showed the @s with another suit (5+5+)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|riccho:  table...|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: North has taken a different route here, not sure if I will consider XX here|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: 4@h is hardly cold and likely to go down on accurate defense|pg||
nt|riccho:  may ask for 2nd suit (if 2nd suit is unknown) or better suit (if 2@d already showed both M)|pg||
nt|riccho:  Now Iversen shouldnt give them a chance to get back in game bidding|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: with West's @s length he will lead a @h and I don't see 4@h making even if declarer takes a @d pitch on top @Cs|pg||
mb|p|pc|h3|nt|rv: on double dummy defense of @hA, cash 2 top @ds and @h back even 9 tricks may be difficult|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|riccho:  yes even 3@h will go off now|pg||
nt|rv: Tempo will open their account here irrespective of the result on this board|pg||

nt|henryb:  but it would only have turned a quick hand into a slow one|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @H-lead would have been interesting|pg||
nt|ntmon: something N has to have finally|pg||
nt|tihana: i got some comments regarding w 1nt, i think it is ok, you?|pg||
nt|danilo1: @S9 is entry too late ... since @C is then 9th trick ... so declarer would on @C lead need only 1 @S trick|pg||
nt|jcomyn: righto all|pg||
nt|andreasw:  13 tricks from the very beginning:-)|pg||
nt|snorre: 10 tricks?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|stc: as I said, starting with @c may establish the 5th trick for defense with @d 4-3|pg||
nt|andreasw:  41-35|pg||
nt|snorre: First IMP to Norway maybe?|pg||
mb|2D!|an|!s and other 55|nt|kit: Will certainly get to 3NT, but if overcall gets heart lead things could get interesting|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Lair: "did you have a jump shift partner?" Weichsel: "a light jump shift" Lair: "very light" Weichsel: "not really, because I made it because of the spots" Boyd: "true"|pg||
nt|ntmon: no problem with 1NT|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i did say maybe|pg||
nt|mamos: imp rather tha imps snorre?|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: well defended ,but board still cost you 9 because your team mates were too aggressive|pg||
nt|runnerup: slam zone -this time  @c easyest|pg||
nt|baardolav: polish club from N|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes|pg||
nt|snorre: I said "IMP", didn't I ?  :)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mamos: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|baardolav: is this ending in 6nt? on 32 hp...|pg||
nt|andreasw:  6 clubs makes... but not easy to bid|pg||
nt|riccho:  and 2@h from W is no common bid here either|pg||
nt|vugraphpl4: sorry|pg||
nt|ppiglett: True - I play against those sort of hoodwinkers too|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jbgood: not the worst bid I have seen...|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Surely South didn't pass. Undo?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Tough choice for Robinson on opening lead, particularly in light of 1@C opening|pg||
nt|henryb:  I guess he is cold now|pg||
nt|kit: he is?  are you sure?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Weichsel: "I hope you're not banking on my club suit"|pg||
nt|henryb:  3@h, 3@d and 3 black tricks|pg||
nt|kit: does he really have 3 hearts?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Weichsel has gone out of the room and there's no one to turn the dummy - Robinson suggests I ask one of you to do it please|pg||
nt|ntmon: 7 or 8 tricks doesn't mean a difference|pg||
nt|runnerup: here ew has to stay low 1 nt looks ok|pg||
nt|tihana: would y bid sth else?|pg||
nt|baardolav: 6nt too|pg||
nt|baardolav: North hand|pg||
nt|riccho:  2NT nat.? vs an unlimited opener of 1@c looks a bit... well ....|pg||
nt|chmitty: hummm ... indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|tihana: strange bid 3cl, should south show strong balance?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: a David Bird deal-em-again hand|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes - good spades...|pg||
nt|ppiglett: No prob |pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: game should be reached|pg||
nt|mamos: defence should prevail here|pg||
nt|mamos: trump leads are best |pg||
nt|snorre: I like to play Michaels in this positions as "Weak or strong". NS have no idea of how strong (or weak) pd is|pg||
nt|snorre: If strong, have to bid once more. Then North can bid 2@h and end there...|pg||
pc|c4|nt|stc: misfit but enough points|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Good lead - for declarer|pg||
nt|stc: and the most friendly lead|pg||
nt|ntmon: multi-purpose club and transfer responses in use|pg||
pc|c7|nt|stc: now many tricks|pg||
nt|ntmon: NS helped opps to devaluate their hands here|pg||
nt|jbgood: this may well be a push|pg||
nt|andreasw:  2@h relay probably|pg||
pc|c8|nt|henryb:  I think so|pg||
nt|ntmon: X for penalty|pg||
nt|andreasw:  46-35|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|kit: okay, now he is cold|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Especially, if E/W duck another @D|pg||
nt|runnerup: well north wked up -is it right ? -perhaps -200 |pg||
nt|andreasw:  4 NT quantitative ?|pg||
nt|riccho:  np; this operating stuff is very difficult to do|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ppiglett: The singelton ten fo spades is a huge card. A little luck for N-S.|pg||
pc|c9|nt|runnerup: jump in clubs doent look the way to desripe this hand all thought it make it easy to bid 6--but is it forcing even|pg||
nt|chmitty: next door, it will start 1@c 1@d 1@s but what next ? 2NT 3@d 3NT ... or 2NT 3NT|pg||
nt|riccho:  and the lead of the @sJ is sth I wouldnt have found either|pg||
nt|chmitty: in any case I suspect they will end up in 3NT|pg||
pc|d7|pc|c2|pg||
nt|henryb:  How do you prevent 3 heart tricks, Kit?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Oh - wasÂ´nt ducked|pg||
nt|andreasw:  6 clubs now - but why not bid 4 @d?|pg||
nt|baardolav: 750 on stake... pass or 6@c|pg||
nt|andreasw:  what is 2@c on 1 @c??|pg||
nt|baardolav: natural I belive|pg||
nt|chmitty: I like @sJ|pg||
nt|blum1956: 2NT is just too weak for the hand of that type, the few-pointed 3NT will be often missed|pg||
nt|mamos: this is not a good start for the defence|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kit: so 10 very badly needed IMPs for Lynch|pg||
nt|tihana: my gib says it will make :)|pg||
nt|baardolav: pos 8+HP and 5+ @c|pg||
nt|blum1956: I guess EW play 1@c-2@d as GF|pg||
nt|riccho:  just what N needed without it 4@h would probably a better contract|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Yes much better.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kit: I guess you really can't|pg||
nt|tihana: got explanation: NS plays kind of Polish club so 3@c shows 17+ with 5+@c and 0-2@s|pg||
nt|mcarroll: looks like @C set as trump, now will they go for the pairs 6NT or the safer 6@C?|pg||
nt|tihana: 6CL, wanna bet?|pg||
nt|runnerup: ns can not be a choice 6  @h perhaps can|pg||
nt|runnerup: nt -not really sensibal|pg||
nt|danilo1: good @CK position ... so EW need to cash @H to hold declarer on 7 tricks|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes - but points? nevermind - slam is on:-)|pg||
nt|baardolav: 1@d is 0-7|pg||
nt|andreasw:  46-37|pg||
nt|andreasw:  kibb told med - 2 clubs is game force|pg||
nt|baardolav: Natural gf yeah|pg||
nt|andreasw:  me|pg||
nt|chmitty: the theory is : against limited hands (2NT shows that) your lead should be neutral|pg||
nt|snorre: Worst lead for EW....|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ntmon: looks -2|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I agree|pg||
nt|tihana: shit|pg||
nt|tihana: sorrrry|pg||
nt|runnerup: even this can go off|pg||
pc|cT|nt|tihana: ok, at least we will have a swing|pg||
nt|baardolav: well done|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ntmon: EW will negotiate @H ruff but not much more|pg||
nt|andreasw:  heart lead?|pg||
nt|baardolav: 1370 it is should be made in one flash when the @c finesse make... and K drops. There is not a play for 1390 because of single @d in east|pg||
nt|riccho:  the lead is interesting in a positive way. |pg||
pc|s4|nt|ntmon: this may not be good - defensive ruffs available|pg||
nt|baardolav: @d lead|pg||
nt|andreasw:  youre right Baard!!!|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|kit: nice 7 of diamonds play if he really did it, which he might well have done|pg||
nt|runnerup: so 300 with rosruffes|pg||
nt|tihana: my gib says he didnt find|pg||
nt|mamos: and East needs to defend carefully now|pg||
pc|s3|nt|henryb:  so 460|pg||
pc|s7|nt|danilo1: well, 8 tricks now|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|chmitty: good for you !|pg||
nt|snorre: Hammans 2nd rule: "If u have a singelton, lead it.."|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|nt|Vugraphzfb: short break|pg||
nt|henryb:  The ladies' match is over. Joel leading by 84.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: indeed|pg||
pc|s5|nt|riccho:  the 2NT is interesting in a negative way (at least thats my feeling about that...)|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|tihana: hmm|pg||
nt|mamos: oops   i think this will make now|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|hT|nt|jbgood: a clever return - now it is at least 1 down|pg||
pc|d9|nt|chmitty: agrre lol :)|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|nt|snorre: Board 4 ended like I supposed in Open: 1@c-1@d-1@s-1NT..   balanced 24hcp normally down i 3NT, but not this time. Antother 9 IMP for Italy|pg||
pc|h6|nt|chmitty: agree|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mcarroll: Yes this is a nervy one, needs 4 tricks from Majors so must finesse, @H more dangerous and @S a 2 way guess - on the theory of vacant spaces - trusting W for longer @Ds than E, it ...|pg||
nt|mcarroll: looks right to play E for the @SQ - which works|pg||
nt|runnerup: perhaps J @d woud have helped to avoid this acsident (spade switch)|pg||
pc|sK|pc|hJ|nt|mamos: It's also true that after a "two-suiter auction"  that a trump lead will  be required - Club lead seemed odd here |pg||

nt|chmitty: actually 7@d may be not so great|pg||
nt|chmitty: you can't ruff a Spade AND cash the 4 @c tricks|pg||
nt|chmitty: so you are down to the @s finesse more or less|pg||
nt|riccho:  so u have to rely on the @s finesse|pg||
nt|riccho:  :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: or some king of squeeze|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: but EW might doubled at 5th level  already if they find clubs|pg||

nt|snorre: spades from west when he win clubs, and east can not be endplayed..|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|hawe45:  Now 450|pg||

pc|s4|pg||
nt|mcarroll: the curse of the commentator|pg||
nt|jbgood: looks like an attempt to present declarer with a Greec gift|pg||

nt|andreasw:  not any longer|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mcarroll: will do now - continuing Trumps might have worked better|pg||

nt|ntmon: the contract goes back and forth|pg||
nt|andreasw:  board 20 a tie...|pg||
nt|mamos: thats the second game in two boards that might have gone off - |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: classic passed out deal|pg||
nt|chmitty: interesting hand again : better avoid 5@c and play 3NT|pg||
mb|1C|nt|stc: even 3NT may win|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes it is bad contrack.but it cant be if it makes -can it?|pg||
nt|ntmon: huge lead, 25:4 so far|pg||
nt|ppiglett: A bit of action here I suspect!|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  This is the board, where you can - bis mistake - bid 3 NT. Easy make|pg||
nt|ntmon: five push boards in a row|pg||
nt|riccho:  looks a bit like a bridge world challenge the champs hand ...|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mcarroll: lots of action elsewhere but pretty mundane here|pg||
nt|ntmon: strong clubs system :)|pg||
nt|snorre: "might" is a kind word...   :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: this looks like partscore battle -ew 10 in clubs-ns less in @h|pg||
nt|ntmon: a treatment now|pg||
nt|mareczek: South has the obvious opening|pg||
nt|oosb: that's some push! a lot of pairs stopped short of slam|pg||
nt|ppiglett: East will be wondering how big a number this could be when the board comes through!|pg||
mb|1N|nt|hawe45:  Oups|pg||
nt|ntmon: interesting how the bidding would develop w/o interference|pg||
nt|ntmon: now 2@S ?|pg||
nt|danilo1: do not believe ... North, East or South may open|pg||
nt|blum1956: Willard's overcall helps to stop in 3NT|pg||
nt|riccho:  true|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  I'm a crawling Stayman bidder|pg||
nt|stc: and the ideal lead|pg||
nt|mcarroll: another Hamman hand?|pg||
nt|riccho:  even v-vs a heavy loaded 5@D "preempt"|pg||
nt|mamos: ty :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: 4@D ?|pg||
nt|chmitty: form East point of view that 2NT shows @h ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: 1@S already implied @D ?|pg||
nt|ntmon: bid in the same second|pg||
nt|tihana: is 4h by Sabine an option?|pg||
nt|mareczek: better to stay silent and be thought a fool than open your mouth and remove all doubt|pg||
nt|jcomyn: with the object of either going down or scoring 90|pg||
nt|mamos: I did think of typing might/should|pg||
nt|snorre: east knew pd had two spades at most, so of course he should have kept three of them...|pg||
nt|mamos: The Norwegians look like defeating 3@h on Board 6   so may be on the way to taking the lead here|pg||
nt|snorre: Find some more coffee, mamos..  A calm 1NT here... |pg||
nt|mamos: I'm a simple soul I'd have lead @d3 by now|pg||
pc|d3|nt|hawe45:  Switch to the @D King...|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 1 @H alerted - transfer, 2@C not alerted bur cannot be natural, |pg||
nt|chmitty: which is not good news for a @c slam|pg||
nt|riccho:  vs a WK NT hand the E hand doesnt look like a slaminviter anyway|pg||
pc|d7|nt|andreasw:  heart lead ? |pg||
nt|oosb: seems like a very reasonable contract|pg||
nt|blum1956: certainly|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jcomyn: who said that marek|pg||
nt|mareczek: "all in" lead by North|pg||
nt|jcomyn: you or aristotle|pg||
nt|oosb: cant lead @s after the 2@S bid|pg||
nt|andreasw:  spade bid prevented spade lead|pg||
nt|oosb: perfectly logical @h lead, just unlucky|pg||
nt|oosb: more than one way to get to 9 tricks now|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|kit: Should Lair pass 2@D?  I think so.  4 diamonds more likely than 2.|pg||
nt|snorre: Think one down if EW play club after four times @d's.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|stc: Q@s, 10@h, K@d and KQ@c, FIVE key cards on side !|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Bidding like this, you need it|pg||
nt|stc: but passing to the state of the match|pg||
nt|ntmon: theory (Garozzo i think said it) - against strong club, be as soon as possible at 3@S|pg||
nt|mareczek: both rooms opened 1@h with East|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ntmon: good competitive decision by W|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mcarroll: good sacrifice|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 8 tricks on top and little prospect of a 9th?|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|runnerup: well found -minors are not easy to be found because they can be sorter than 4 when opened|pg||
nt|oosb: but @D 9 seems best|pg||
nt|snorre: or this way...   |pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|nt|andreasw:  yes.much better|pg||
nt|baardolav: No direct entries for the @d suit|pg||
nt|oosb: but no entries now|pg||
nt|oosb: he actually wanted @D to lose, so he can set up a nice 2nd finesse and entry :) |pg||
nt|andreasw:  there will be|pg||
pc|s9|nt|henryb:  Earlier in this match Boyd- Robinson couldn't get out of 1N because they play puppet (I think) and went -100 in 1N with 3@s made at the other table|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|s7|nt|hawe45:  Oups|pg||
nt|ntmon: preempting apparently works here w/o need to bid 4@H|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ntmon: with actual score, Couples shifted to the 1st place|pg||
nt|ntmon: helping lead|pg||
nt|oosb: this works |pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|stc: %play knowing 4@h in S|pg||
nt|jbgood: 27 teams from the A-Swiss and 5 from the B go on to the KO stages - follow the exciting finish of this last round here: http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/swrunda5.html|pg||
nt|danilo1: looks  very possible third hand ... personally I would pass as North and East, but I would open as South|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Suit preference card - the 10 of clubs.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|riccho:  N should hav an easy task now to hold the @hq|pg||
pc|s6|nt|snorre: We are still waiting for Running score from all matches. A lot of teams, so they need some time to set up everything..   |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|cT|nt|hawe45:  N/S or E/W?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes:-)'|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mcarroll: this would not work if W had anything in @Hs|pg||
nt|tihana: if Jacob switches to !J after club holds?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|henryb:  Its a question, I think, of how likely opener is to have two major suit doubletons|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|tihana: diamond jack|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hawe45:  S - OK|pg||

nt|riccho:  another quick play lead...|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Guaranteed to wrongside 3NT, and he succeeds|pg||

nt|snorre: 3@h down 2 vs 4@h made on board 6....  11 for Norway|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: lol|pg||
nt|ntmon: so why do not do something in systems to recover?|pg||
nt|danilo1: 1 looks correct, but at this voulnerabilities, 4 may be rite action|pg||
nt|riccho:  presumably a 12-14 BAL or 16+ 1@c opener|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosb: other room played 3@S in 21|pg||
mb|2N|nt|runnerup: ns has points but west distribution so perhaps 2 spades |pg||
nt|blum1956: As opposite to the previous hand, EW must play 5@c here|pg||
nt|blum1956: not 3NT|pg||
nt|chmitty: we can see there are some good reasons to do so from East's perspective|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: 4@D might well make|pg||
nt|henryb:  Many of us are not convinced of 3N gambling as a good bid, because if 3N is right the wrong person will be playing it|pg||
nt|henryb:  I open 1@c with Steve's hand|pg||
nt|kit: Not sure what Weichsel is thinking -- maybe of raising, maybe wondering if 4@D is conventional|pg||
nt|riccho:  :) I c  the point |pg||
nt|snorre: and more to come for Norway on B7...|pg||
nt|mamos: these ten board matches fly past  - our penultimate board after about an hour|pg||
mb|3N|nt|henryb:  and rebid 2@c and 3@c|pg||
nt|henryb:  or 4@c if indicated|pg||
nt|henryb:  to show the solid suit|pg||
nt|kit: I don't know what Boyd is thinking of doing|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: He's definitely thinking about something|pg||
nt|danilo1: opps, srry ... missed Bd Nr. (thought Sout dealer) |pg||
nt|jcomyn: might have been interesting if vul reversed|pg||
nt|chmitty: 2@s x : support other suits|pg||
nt|blum1956: redouble showing the Ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: and that must have been what|pg||
nt|stc: S noticed that all cards are good for declarer in this match|pg||
nt|riccho:  5@d can be a very expensive save|pg||
nt|chmitty: the french also stopped at 2NT at board 6 ... but with some reason, South overcalling !!|pg||
nt|blum1956: Max may expect that Anna has not that long diamonds (she seems to keep 4 spades|pg||
nt|chmitty: 3@c : my hand is interesting, although I passed 2@s ... so good support for red suits, with no doubt|pg||
nt|riccho:  with the S Hand? boah...|pg||
nt|riccho:  for sure - if they didnt switch systems since last round... :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosb: 3NT from North is comfy|pg||
nt|chmitty: passed 2@c sry|pg||
nt|blum1956: Certainly Anna will bid 5@c|pg||
nt|blum1956: and NS should take a save|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  If I opened 1@c the auction would go 1@c-1@h-2@c-3N and we would get a low diamond lead|pg||
nt|kit: Interesting -- maybe right, but still .....|pg||
nt|mr murray: talk to u later. Going out to play poker now. Took me all day to get ready to go out and play a few hours. No energy in my body at all :)|pg||

pc|s6|nt|blum1956: wow!|pg||
nt|riccho:  inviting to a phantom sacrficie|pg||
nt|snorre: not an easy 3NT to win... |pg||
nt|mamos: 3 clubs 3 spades two + one|pg||
nt|snorre: North can win first club, play spades, duck next @c and declearer can't reach dummy...|pg||
nt|mamos: blow  |pg||
pc|sK|nt|Vugraphzfb: Boyd: "all that for me, eh?" Robinson: "surprise"|pg||
nt|henryb:  Well, would North really bid 2@d after 1@c-1@h?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: He did in the othe room :)|pg||
nt|runnerup: in this vulnerability -this looks normal bidding seqwence |pg||

pc|c2|nt|blum1956: The save in 5@d costed  800 but...|pg||
nt|chmitty: and now ladies and gentlemen ....|pg||
nt|riccho:  6@c looks a bit offroad|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ntmon: good decision by Yan to overrule partner's suit|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|riccho:  and will be a make now...|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|henryb:  opposite a passed partner?|pg||

qx|c10|st||md|4S7HA962DQJT86CA83,SQJT3HQT875D3C654,SK542HK4DK942CQT2,SA986HJ3DA75CKJ97|sv|b|nt|henryb:  yes, and surely if Boyd had the @dA he would have drawn trump, crossed to the @dA to take his pitch|pg||
nt|kit: right -- declarer would (should) never have played that way with ace of diamonds|pg||
nt|henryb:  after ruffing out the heart|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Boyd: "you might have something - might have some distribution - might have the J of @ss. I had an opening bid, you had an opening bid, why should we defend 4@d. I don't know if we ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: beat 4@d"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Weichsel: "we haven't discussed what that means in balancing seat" Lair: "I thought we played better minor for Majors" a little more discussion|pg||
nt|ntmon: lst hand of the set|pg||
nt|Walddk7: 27+5 qualify for the Round of 32 tomorrow after five rounds of Swiss today. 27 from Swiss A and 5 from B|pg||
nt|runnerup: 1 @c -etc..|pg||
nt|jbgood: these teams are of course safe to go on to the round of 32 |pg||
nt|blum1956: Anna could use Blackwood (normally we play 14 30 responses in Russia)|pg||
nt|riccho:  maybe S should have lead @cA to "have a look"|pg||
mb|1C|nt|stc: OR also played the lucky 3NT, 11+12=26|pg||
mb|1D|nt|kit: Weischel has choice of declaring 2NT or 1@C it looks like|pg||
nt|henryb:  2N does better|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Robinson: "did you have a diamond stopper?" Boyd: "I had K doubleton ... I had a stopper from my side, not from yours"|pg||
nt|ntmon: last hand of Swiss |pg||
nt|oosb: Its going well for Pony so far|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ntmon: finally a turnaround board  18 - EW allowed to 5@D|pg||
nt|riccho:  @s lead (as a kib mentions) was certainly not very well thought|pg||
mb|2D|nt|jbgood: last one now - hope you have enjoyed as much as I have:)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes, calandra needs a swing|pg||
nt|chmitty: in these situations, lead the @c Ace seems to be an obligation|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: Weichsel asks about the lead: "standard from feser than 4, or promises the J if from 4 or more"|pg||
nt|kit: he has down 1, but may take heart finesse trying to make and go down many|pg||
nt|tihana: tiny 3N?|pg||
nt|danilo1: waw ... both rooms played 4@S |pg||
mb|p|nt|oosb: In other scores .. Brogeland trailing De Botton 22 imps to 60 !|pg||
nt|oosb: Heres the link to live scores: http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/r32runda1.html|pg||
mb|d|nt|andreasw:  3 nt is on...|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: here ns must avoid 4 @s 4 @h or 3nt has chances|pg||
nt|mcarroll: If they declare a @H contract, E will have a nasty surprise for them|pg||
nt|ntmon: even in 4@S a lot to do for declarer|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ntmon: 3NT has good chance to be bid after 3@C from S|pg||
nt|tihana: lot of 10s|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: thx to our operator in Poznan - Lukasz|pg||
mb|p|nt|andreasw:  will be bid now:-)|pg||
nt|oosb: wow|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosb: nice bid|pg||
nt|andreasw:  wd|pg||
pc|d2|nt|runnerup: but even if bid it is not made yet|pg||
nt|ntmon: 3@D to find 5th spade i think|pg||
nt|mcarroll: good pass ny N|pg||
nt|baardolav: A little bit lucky 3nt:)|pg||
nt|oosb: after that lead, you're all in|pg||
nt|chmitty: another difficult hand to bid here|pg||
nt|riccho:  E promised the @sA already; so the danger of a @s lead should have been obvious|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dQ|nt|kit: At this point, Weichsel has in essence exposed his entire hand|pg||
nt|ntmon: but whole bidding a bid murky now|pg||
nt|ntmon: bit*|pg||
nt|ppiglett: South might have come in 2S as East is a limited hand and both the club and H honour are probably well placed. Anyway I am an aggressive 2S bidder. Stopping Partner bidding 4 is ...|pg||
nt|ppiglett: the problem!|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|mcarroll: by|pg||
nt|oosb: close your eyes and finesse|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes west knows|pg||
pc|h3|nt|tihana: bi|pg||
nt|chmitty: 3@h sounds like : I have a stopper problem|pg||
nt|chmitty: but in which suit ?|pg||
nt|chmitty: 2@d being 100 % artificial forcing|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|nt|ntmon: 3NT isn't pretty|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|runnerup: now diamond lead gives chances in this|pg||
nt|ntmon: S can shed a @h on 3rd diamond|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ntmon: @DJ and @CQ well placed for declarer|pg||
pc|d5|nt|snorre: Last board in this room. Next match starts in 25 min. 15.45. Welcome back..|pg||
pc|d6|nt|runnerup: so is it possible for ns to open + imps|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jcomyn: i love that lead|pg||
pc|sK|nt|oosb: next.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|andreasw:  wd next|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mcarroll: easy to get overboard |pg||
nt|danilo1: good stop ... 5@H may be in danger - especially with @HA lead|pg||
nt|baardolav: Have to see if @c q drops first|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|nt|oosb: He will play it out for @C|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|kit: Perhaps he should not have cashed high heart first, just led spade to dummy, led jack of hearts, and seen if he got a cover|pg||
nt|riccho:  S needs a successful @C guess now; this is espec difficult after such a bd just before|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|h8|nt|henryb:  He might go up with the @hK on the theory that 1@c is 2 down and either the @hQ drops and he makes 3 or it does not and he is only 1 down|pg||
nt|chmitty: terrible set for Multon Willard so far : 4@s made by opps, a frightening 50% grand slam not bid, 6cx made, and now 3NT 2 off|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Then again you probably would have made 4S.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mcarroll:  yes - 2nd worst game contract - 4@S is the only game with any real prospect|pg||
nt|ntmon: down 4|pg||
nt|oosb: incase some one unguards|pg||
nt|riccho:  the 2!opener peempts both sids and you canot expect to do it right every time|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|ntmon: so an opportunity for rossard to equal the score|pg||
nt|ntmon: all boards played here, looking for last comparison|pg||
nt|ntmon: thx for watching, thx operator for fine job|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Playing 4@S in OR|pg||
nt|ntmon: see you all next round |pg||
nt|ntmon: bye|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|tihana: vwdone to avoid heart fit |pg||
pc|s5|nt|oosb: right Baard|pg||
pc|c7|nt|andreasw:  3nt bid|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mamos: West competed aggressively over 2@d|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ntmon: 4@S is questionable because if S did not opened 2@S, she is around 7 HCP and implied bad @S suit|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h9|pg||
pc|dT|pc|c4|pc|d9|nt|tihana: with 2 balanced hands|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|stc: not best defense|pg||
nt|andreasw:  sry private|pg||
pc|d8|pc|c5|nt|jbgood: yes - may be a Lavazza win on this one |pg||
nt|tihana: thank you all, see y tomorrow|pg||
nt|jbgood: bye all - thanks for your insightful inputs:)|pg||
nt|ntmon: thx my fellow commentators and specs for thier input|pg||
nt|ntmon: bye all|pg||
pc|s4|nt|runnerup: not easy here --other table in 3nt=so ew won this match a lot |pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|cA|nt|andreasw:  might gain some points here|pg||
nt|oosb: its possible|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s3|pc|cT|pc|cK|pg||
pc|s9|nt|runnerup: even this looked difficult to get + ,but little help needed at got it -lead .. |pg||
nt|tihana: thank you all and see y soon|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes tx bye|pg||
pc|c8|pc|sT|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|snorre: +100 is a good score for NS..  plus is plus...|pg||
