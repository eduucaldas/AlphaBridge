mb|2S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Even 1NT contracts are interesting at matchpoints|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not sure that David agrees|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|brolucius: E/W have 3NT available and perhaps South was tempted to make life more difficult for them.|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: I do not agree, it goes without saying. I rarely follow the play in 1NT, nor write on such contracts.|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|pelu: even some play for 4@h |pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@H will show positive values (the Lebensohl convention).|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pauleger: 3@h propably a better hand than 2NT|pg||
nt|pauleger: :)|pg||
mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|pauleger: on a @s lead I see some chances|pg||
nt|brolucius: Without Lebensohl responses to a double of a weak 2, it is impossible to bid many hands such as these.  |pg||

pc|s9|pc|sJ|pc|sT|pc|s8|pg||
nt|pauleger: guess the @cQ|pg||

nt|pelu: @s9|pg||
nt|brolucius: Auken and Bocchi on 43%. Wow.   |pg||
nt|pelu: DD u can make 4@H but diffucult a the table|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h4|pc|d5|pg||
nt|brolucius: North turns his card quickly... 'The 5 from me'.|pg||
nt|pelu: look at the 3. pairs in bottom - they could all win the tournament|pg||
nt|pelu: Running score : http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxp/fa.html|pg||
nt|pauleger: when N is in with @dK , he can play a @s and force dummy. Solid @hs in S|pg||
nt|brolucius: I was interested to see that Bill Frisby, a frequent (and very good) BBO commentator finished top of Semi-Final B and therefore qualified for the main final.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|cT|pc|c6|pg||
nt|pelu: Soulet-Willanrd, 2xDhondy and Madala-Rimstedt the bottom 3 - could be top 3 also :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxp/fa.html|pg||

mb|2C!|mb|d|mb|2S|mb|3H|nt|pauleger: 4@h is on here|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: 3@H may look a bit of an underbid, but the normal advice is not to strain for close games at Pairs.|pg||
nt|pauleger: 4@s on an intrafinesse?|pg||
nt|pauleger: ìf E/W don´t find their @c ruff|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer will expect West to hold at least 3 spades for his double.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk2: The intra-finesse indeed, if you have the entries for it|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d6|pc|d2|pg||

pc|h4|nt|pauleger: not that you want to be in 4@s :)|pg||

mc|9|nt|brolucius: The play of the @HA was hard to understand. Partner had bid hearts and then led a low one.|pg||
nt|brolucius: If the card might have been from x-x-x-x-x, that is a flaw in the method. Anyway, odds-on to hold the @HQ.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's also percentage, in isolation, and a priori|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The intra-finesse that is|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A priori = from the beginning = when the cards were dealt|pg||
nt|brolucius: +140 is 98% at the moment. East's underbid did not work well. It was a 4@H bid, really.|pg||
nt|pauleger: Leaders are N/S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, a married couple from Sweden|pg||

mc|6|nt|brolucius: 630s already on the board|pg||
nt|brolucius: West could not tell how strong East was. It was East who knew that his side had game values.|pg||
nt|pelu: her|pg||
nt|brolucius: Against that West held a maximum and two spade stoppers, enough for game facing the re-opening double. It seems that he should have bid 3NT.|pg||
nt|pelu: the X was take out - good rule: when u partner make a take out: bid!!|pg||
nt|pauleger: one pair even made it to 4NT, going down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And the gold medal winners in the mixed teams E-W now, Benedicte Cronier - Pierre Zimmermann|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so they are back from their extended lunch break|pg||
nt|brolucius: I once wrote a book for a new company and their editor said 'Would you like me to change half the 'he' and 'his' words into 'she' and 'her'?  My 'No!!!' would be heard across the ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: South of England.  But keep to this standard for so many decades does mean the occasional error in this regard on BBO.|pg||
nt|pauleger: There is an interesting interview with Pierre Zimmermann in today´s bulletin. |pg||
nt|pelu: Bocchi-Auken has just killed Cronier - Ovidio - 2 x 90%|pg||
nt|pelu: all players now here :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Anyway, the BBO software should automatically correct any such understandable lapses. Does it not know that South and East are women in a Mixed Pairs?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They asked for directions at the restaurant, in French, and were sent in the wrong direction|pg||
nt|pelu: but first board for Zimmermann - Cronie only 25% - they sh have waited for 1 morre 40-60%|pg||
nt|Walddk2: French is not spoken much in Poland|pg||
nt|pauleger: :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: If they asked for directions in French, they were lucky the restaurant did not bring them another course to eat.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So in fairness, the waiter should have been awarded 40%, not the players|pg||
nt|brolucius: Waiters normally get 10%|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not referring to tips|pg||

mb|1H|mb|1N|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: The last board was very instructive at matchpoints. Do not look for a NV penalty when you have a good chance of a vulnerable 3NT. |pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  i expect they 2@d as game-forcing checkback and this is the invitational sequence|pg||
nt|brolucius: South denies four hearts (or three spades) and North's 3@H now shows five hearts. The strength is up to partnership agreement.|pg||

pc|s2|nt|brolucius: Some lead a trump when they hold declarer's first suit strongly (spades, here). That is not necessarily right because perhaps partner can overruff. The time to lead a trump is when ...|pg||

mc|10|nt|brolucius: Probably around an average board, with good play all round. |pg||
nt|brolucius: On North has stopped in 2@H, but only made 140 anyway. |pg||
nt|paulg:  average at the moment, but no-one else made 10|pg||
nt|brolucius: Verbeek/Bertens, it was.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Running scores at  http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxp/fa.html|pg||
nt|paulg:  Scores at the top remain very close, no-one is running away with this and it will be a tense final session|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 570 was not even 90%, that is a surprise|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 88.25|pg||
nt|paulg:  Sylvie Willard, winner of the Mixed Teams|pg||
nt|paulg:  Must be very difficult to play today, after winning last night|pg||

mb|1C!|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|3C|mb|3S|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  the perfect fit means 4@s makes and NS may have to save .. or double!|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  at this level, you normally assume that EW would have bid their game if there was a chance of it making, so 4@c is unlikely to push them into it|pg||
