nt|pelu: u are dreaming|pg||
nt|brgpro: i dont know their carding method...|pg||
nt|pelu: no u dont|pg||
nt|cenglund:  He should take the trick and shift to hearts, I suppose Jansma gave count in spades|pg||
nt|brgpro: maybe they play right side up when showing count|pg||
nt|dburn: well, they can't be giving any sort of count if he played @h2 first from an even number and @s2 now from an odd number|pg||
nt|pelu: if u have given count in 3 suits - u dont need to give in the 4. suit :)|pg||
nt|brgpro: but pd is not always awake|pg||
nt|brgpro: especially in a long tournament|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed, especially since he also played the two on the first round of clubs|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe he just doesn't like twos|pg||

nt|dburn: which is understandable, though not always very helpful|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
