mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|riccho:  the offshape 3@s opening may prevent Ew from reaching their 44@h Fit|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|riccho:  at least the 3@s opening "directed" S to the worst possible lead|pg||
nt|riccho:  E is thinking about ducking the @s probably; this would be correct if N would have a 7carder|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||

nt|Walddk6: Welcome to Roberto|pg||
nt|ybob: Hi Roland , hi everyone :)|pg||
nt|riccho:  Hi Roberto :) |pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|nt|riccho:  E knows now that N has 60 in the MAJ. The minors are still unclear though|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d3|pg||
nt|riccho:  as usual: probably the best way of handling the hand :) |pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|pc|d9|pc|d8|pg||
nt|riccho:  another @s will complicate the contract even more. The @d makes is fairly easy to handle the trumps|pg||
