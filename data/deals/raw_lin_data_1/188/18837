pc|h3|pg||
nt|danilo1: -100 may bi vital for NS ... and great score (lot of 170 expected) ... -300 may not be so good ... |pg||

nt|danilo1: Y ... srry - forgort east may ruff @C ... not clear why declarer did not play third trump|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2C|mb|d|mb|p|nt|danilo1: despite voulnerability, S will probably bid @C|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|rv: South will surely bid 3@c if colors were reversed|pg||
nt|rv: at these colors, South had choice of pass or bidding 2@c, I would have passed here|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|danilo1: West will surely try slam ... best via 3@D if Forcing|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C!|mb|p|nt|danilo1: 4@C now|pg||
mb|4H|nt|rv: in conventional bidding, West would have bid 2@d which is F1, I presume this E-W pair reverse of negative double and free bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|danilo1: 4NT Key card ?|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|nt|danilo1: wd|pg||

nt|danilo1: thk @D single was rather obvious (North did not Dble @D - nor 6@H for the lead !) |pg||
nt|rv: is the Bulgarian fixed at this table|pg||
nt|danilo1: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|danilo1: I like 1@D (and not 2NT)|pg||

mb|3C|nt|danilo1: 3@C at those voulnerability |pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: @d lead best|pg||
pc|d5|nt|danilo1: not so many def. tricks for Dble after 2@D (and @SAJ are placed poorely) ... not sure I would not consider even pass|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hA|pg||
nt|rv: 3@d could be well-judged, even 2 down is fine since 3@c makes for N-S|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|sT|pc|s6|pg||
nt|danilo1: West knows he is voulnerable, NS probably in missfit ... and 3@D may therefore be bad (if -200)|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|nt|rv: typical MPs auction|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hQ|pg||

nt|danilo1: and to note ... if West decides to open 2NT - he would hit jackpot ... probably all pass and at least 7 tricks|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|h8|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|rv: difference between 1 and 2 down would be huge in this form of scoring, if West goes 2 down for -200 they will score atbest 20-25%, 1 down should be worth 65+%|pg||
nt|danilo1: still not necessarily very good score for EW ... guess will be around average|pg||
nt|vugraphplf: EW scored a 67% for this.|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|rv: South won't fancy double of 4@h here even at MPs, too random|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|rv: @dA, @D ruff and couple of @h tricks available for defense |pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|pg||
nt|danilo1: great lead ... -1 now ... |pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|h2|pc|d5|pg||
nt|rv: at times in MPs form of scoring you double borderline contracts especially with bad breaks, this is not one such instance|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|danilo1: to note that North knew pd has @D ruff ... still, well done|pg||
nt|rv: here South is lucky to find both @h honors with East, if North had a @h honor, defensive prospects won't be too good |pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||

nt|rv: how much did N-S score in last deal my guess is about 60%|pg||
nt|danilo1: NS German-Canadian combination, EW China|pg||
nt|danilo1: 70%|pg||
nt|rv: is 4@s good save against 4@h?|pg||
nt|danilo1: guess so ... cannot see way for -4|pg||
nt|rv: tough for E-W to get in and find save|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|rv: I suspect E-W will score 80+% if they can find save|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|danilo1: books saying it it often good to bid 4@S over  1@H-4@H if possible ... but here 1@H-4@H will probably not come|pg||
nt|rv: as expected, Sun didn't find it prudent to get into auction|pg||
pc|c6|nt|rv: I presume if folks play MPs more often, a few more will double with West hand on 1@H-2@c as to of @hs at these colors|pg||
pc|cA|nt|danilo1: now East has lead problem ... ev. @S is overtrick|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|pg||
nt|rv: as t/o of @hs|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d6|pc|d9|pg||
pc|s8|mc|10|nt|danilo1: Dble on 2@C would not be good (if I decide to bid in MPs, I would bid 2@D ... ops are in forcing situation ... so not so terrible risky) ... |pg||
nt|danilo1: ... Dble on 2@C may invite @S lead later |pg||
nt|vugraphplf: 46% for NS|pg||

mb|1N!|nt|rv: Yan's 1n is 14-16?|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|danilo1: South probably cannot bid 2@D natural (System)|pg||
nt|vugraphplf: Forgive me for no alerts, there were some.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|danilo1: well, started to write too fast (wasn t is pass there before?)|pg||
nt|vugraphplf: Yep, i made  a few mistakes on this one|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphplf: Yuen understood 2@D as majors at first, as it seems.|pg||
nt|rv: way too aggressive by both North and South, possibly North took South 2@d as something other than natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|danilo1: NS obviousle play constructive overcalls, still cannot understand North's agressiviti (esp. in MPs)|pg||
nt|rv: Yan was considering double, decided to pass since this is likely to very good score even w/o double|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugraphplf: TD called.|pg||
nt|vugraphplf: Running scores from final A at http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxp/fa.html|pg||
nt|vugraphplf: NS system agreement on 2@D is "majors"|pg||
nt|rv: did E-W call director, I suspect director will rule result stands|pg||
nt|danilo1: thk Yan is forbidden to Dble (exc. if AKQ in @D :)) - she opened 1NT ... but pd maybe could|pg||

nt|rv: I don't think E-W will get more redress |pg||
nt|vugraphplf: EW 1NT 15-17|pg||
nt|danilo1: actually, I am surprised by no action by West over 2@D (MPs) ... maybe 2@D - at least at one side of the screen explained differently|pg||
nt|rv: if 1n is 15-17, then West could have doubled 2@d as t/o if it was told as natural|pg||
pg||

nt|rv: to that extent, E-W has more chance of redress if 1n is 15-17 especially if they play double of natural 2@d as t/o with non Inv values|pg||
nt|danilo1: for all West knows, 2@D all pass is surely poor score ... thk obvious action in MPs if 2@D natural|pg||
nt|danilo1: independent of NT range (includes 14)|pg||
nt|rv: I still wouldn't like to give E-W too much redress on last deal|pg||

mb|5C!|an|1|nt|rv: even 5 level is not safe here|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|nt|rv: on South's 3@s, North could have cued, he bid 4@s, maybe South should have passed especially at MPs|pg||

mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: on this auction, some play serious/non-serious 3n from North side to show mild interest in slam|pg||
