mb|2D!|nt|paca1987: they are playing 3 sets of 16 boards |pg||
mb|p|mb|2S!|nt|fabsayc: mexican 2@D or multi with mexican extra|pg||
mb|p|nt|paca1987: 2@d = 18-19 bal|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|paca1987: 2@s = relay to 2N|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|paca1987: 3@c = Stayman |pg||
nt|fabsayc: then 3@C is stayman|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|paca1987: This gadget is preety common beetween the Italian players|pg||
mb|p|nt|paca1987: I think Versace and Lauria are using it |pg||
pc|s6|nt|fabsayc: except some use 2@C opening for this range|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s9|nt|paca1987: Looks like a swing for Singapore|pg||

pc|s5|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@S-1nt-2nt for example can show 64 hands|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|paca1987: looks like you can make 6@c|pg||
nt|granguru:  EW can win 6@C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we only get on the table for xmas parties|pg||
nt|paca1987: the point its, how do you bid to reach the slam?|pg||
mb|d|nt|fabsayc: forcing stayman can do it perhaps|pg||
nt|paca1987: maybe im wrong, but 2@d looks to be forcing stayman |pg||
nt|paca1987: :)|pg||
nt|granguru:  1N 2@C 2@D 3@C(more) 3@h(4@C) 4@C(RKCB)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|fabsayc: was part of original precision, which is so old it predates wide spread use of transfers|pg||

nt|paca1987: lovely, using also 2@c gladiator|pg||
nt|granguru:  4333|pg||
nt|paca1987: i think the jump in 3N would make W think his pd has some points in @d's|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps they modify the responses after the double|pg||
nt|granguru:  So, W could imagine @SaXX @h?XX @dhXX 1@cakXX |pg||
nt|paca1987: Likely to pass|pg||
mb|4C!|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|paca1987: not a good prediction :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@C presumably sets trumps, and 4@D shows ace, but i am guessing|pg||
nt|paca1987: E has the best hand ever for a @c slam |pg||
nt|fabsayc: he could have one more jack|pg||
nt|paca1987: only a 15 count, but it looks like a 18 count|pg||
nt|paca1987: for @c's|pg||
nt|granguru:  4@c MIGHT BE rOMAN KEYCARD SUPERGERBER  4@d 0-4|pg||

nt|twcho: I think declarer better plays the @dJ or 9 instead of the 6 at 1st trick|pg||
nt|twcho: this likely clarify which defender holds the @d Q|pg||
nt|twcho: and he may opt for the other route to reach his 10th trick instead of resorting on 33 @h break|pg||
nt|twcho: another wild hand|pg||
nt|twcho: south 8410 and north 6520|pg||
nt|twcho: hard to predict the final contract here|pg||
nt|twcho: anything can happen|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ups:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzej: claim loose club|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: it seems to me the 2NT is NF so the raise to game by east is a bit aggressive|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: so 4@d is middle of the road action imo|pg||
nt|twcho: east will probably balanced with 4@h|pg||
mb|1S|nt|twcho: but anyway, east did a good job of shifting to @s to hold declarer to 9 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: ok, north add one more|pg||
mb|1N|nt|vugraphzej: if 7@Dx E lead club :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: but one should be more courageous in bidding game especially when vulnerable as the imp scale definitely favors it|pg||
nt|twcho: so buy the contract cheaply|pg||
mb|2C|nt|twcho: 1N is 14-16|pg||
nt|twcho: can have 5M or 6m|pg||
nt|twcho: as @h10 will win the trick, it all depends on how declarer play the @c suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|twcho: the only way to make here is ruffing finesse in @c|pg||
mb|2S|nt|twcho: if he opts to finesse west, he will be rewarded with an overtrick as the card lies while if he chooses the other way round, he may well go down|pg||
nt|twcho: so again the prize went to the bold bidder|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: but it will fail |pg||
nt|twcho: and west will return his trump|pg||
nt|twcho: south can settle for only one down by ruffing this card|pg||
nt|twcho: but if he wants to make his game, he has to finesse|pg||
nt|rodal f: EW at an interesting fight here. I @S give a trick it's OK. Else it's NS at @C|pg||
mb|3C|nt|twcho: With the lucky lie of red cards and @s not running for defenders, 3NT will roll home easily|pg||

nt|twcho: so probably he can test @h first and then finesse in @c|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|nt|twcho: he doesn't know defenders' @s is not running|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphzej: E play 3 @S :(|pg||
nt|twcho: looks like better to me to test @h before @c finesse|pg||
nt|twcho: both I and our excellent operator, Chayes are biased, but to different sides. :)|pg||
nt|twcho: so probably the play has finished.|pg||
nt|twcho: 9 tricks I supposed, right?|pg||

mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|twcho: west can double or make a 2@h jump imo|pg||

nt|petergill: At other table, the good 1@C opening guided West to the good club lead - it's a bidder's game, especially if you have a good suit. |pg||
nt|rodal f: No 10 is home|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|twcho: OR east opened 1@c and partner did not have any difficulty to find the right lead|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
pc|hA|nt|twcho: very effective defense here|pg||
nt|rodal f: Was a nice lead from W.|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s8|nt|twcho: holding declarer to 9 tricks|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|twcho: I shd say, it is good to keep the opponent to below 2 imps per bd and very good if it is below 1.5 imps|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|d8|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d3|pg||
nt|petergill: Without @D10, South would not have opened 1@S (he liked having two good suits with good texture) and then 4@s would not have been reached. |pg||

nt|twcho: so NZ and FP will play 4 segments to decide the berth to the Netherlands?|pg||

nt|twcho: interesting contract in OR|pg||
nt|rodal f: B12 ended 6NT      6@S here so a push.|pg||

nt|fabsayc: would you believe precision?|pg||
nt|paca1987: some kind of prec|pg||
nt|fabsayc: patrick practically invented it|pg||
nt|paca1987: for the 2@c response |pg||
nt|paca1987: i mean 2@d|pg||
pc|s9|nt|fabsayc: a modern addition|pg||
nt|paca1987: look like he can make 10 tricks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1966 patrick started played precision, 1971 still a junior he was star of taipei team that finished second in bermuda bowl, the birth of precision to the world|pg||

nt|twcho: a possible slam here but fail due to the bad break in @H|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|twcho: 5@s can be defeated at the other table but NS buy the insurance and go one more|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|twcho: but of course 5@s may still be made if defense can't find the @d ruff, not a certainty to any measures|pg||

nt|petergill: NZ situation is something like http://nzbridge.co.nz/international/Bulletin%20OpenTeam%20Malaysia%20&%20Reserve%20Pairs.pdf - also might depend on whether Newell and Reid are ...|pg||
nt|petergill: available for Nettherlands|pg||
nt|twcho: so NS ended safely in the major game|pg||
pc|hK|nt|twcho: natural looking|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: breaks the transfer|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@D = @h and |pg||
nt|vugraphzej: 3+@S|pg||
nt|petergill: alert is that 1@S denies 3 hearts|pg||
nt|twcho: OK, so with 4@s and 3@h, north will respond 1@h first, right?|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: Michael Ware and Geo Tislevoll|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|h5|nt|vugraphzej: Next round start in 20 min|pg||
nt|twcho: which match?|pg||
nt|petergill: in 2009 in Sao Paulo, the other two teams from Zone 6 (Japan and Chinese Taipei) both finished about 11th of the 22 teams in the Bermuda Bowl. Similar results would be expected ...|pg||
nt|petergill: this year. |pg||
nt|twcho: Australian squad this year shd be stronger than that in 2009|pg||
nt|petergill: North could not see the EW cards, so he (reasonably?) thought a club was less likely to be overruffed than a @D|pg||
nt|twcho: but I think the two US teams are both very strong and favourite to claim the title|pg||
nt|petergill: Based on those results and results here in KL, Australia is a chance to make top eight in BB|pg||
