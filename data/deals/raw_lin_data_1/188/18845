mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h7|nt|rensph: far from the worst spot to end up in. Some auctions might end a bit higher.|pg||
nt|rensph: EW will have to go about this quite delicately not to give declarer too many tricks, but I suspect they'll be forced into playing spades or diamonds at some point.|pg||
nt|sybarra: declarer may play @D's  |pg||

nt|rensph: playing diamonds doesn't offer a great prospect of overtricks though - you'll have to play clubs at some point, might as well do it right away|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: what else to attack? result may be duplicated at many tables|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rensph: scores so far range from 7 to 10 tricks in NT|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
nt|oliverc: looks like 7 here|pg||
nt|rensph: one rather unfortunate W led a small club. Gave away a trick and tempo to set up the hearts.|pg||
