nt|brolucius: Jeffrey Allerton and Frances Hinden (who is playing at the other table) are a couple, and have won the prestigious Gold Cup (Britain's top knock-out) together.|pg||
nt|brolucius: So far as I know, Hinden has never played women's bridge. She is a top executive for an oil company.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: what do we know about their systems?|pg||
nt|brolucius: E/W were playing straightforward stuff against Russia. I assume that the French play the standard French system, near enough. It will be good kibitzing.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|d|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Since there were so many small boards in the first half, I was hoping that all the spectacular stuff had been saved for the second half. False hopes...|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Murat|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hello everyone :)|pg||
nt|pelu: 5 toptricks for defense, but not easy to take them|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|c4|nt|brolucius: East has found a strong lead.|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|pelu: now 7 tricks for Tokay|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|MolvaM: running a long suit usually creates problems for the defence|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|pc|c8|nt|brolucius: Now a club ruff will beat it.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: -1 with best defence. a @c switch now|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  @h9 ?|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  looks to ask for @d|pg||
nt|brolucius: Failing that, a trump misguess by declarer.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and in that case possibilities to -2|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  E isn't willing to ask for a @c switch, not knowing what partner has in @c I think|pg||
nt|brolucius: South was declarer, after a transfer response to 1@C, at the other table.|pg||
nt|brolucius: We thought, in the match against Russia, that they seemed to be playing reverse suit-preference. So, maybe she has asked for a club.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But if there is any possibility to defeat, it must be a @c ruff by E. Declarer can have @sKQJ|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|pelu: now 9|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|mc|9|nt|pelu: well played by W - he set up a trap - and N fall in|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|pelu: top-players dont like the @d-suit :)|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|rcerreto:  tough lead|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  nothing appeals, @d looks normal|pg||
nt|MolvaM: I know about 3700 people who would bid 2nt with east hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rcerreto:  leading the longest suit is always an option|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d5|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|rcerreto:  David, would you lead small or an honour?|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|nt|pelu: if 1Nt = 12-14 I know as mynu who would pass - 12-14 + 10 = 22-24 and no spec fit|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to our second Murat, Anter|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the results page is here http://www.poznan2011.pl/results but since the event just started there is nothing in so far|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|s2|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rcerreto:  Ralf?|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|dburn: I guess I would lead low - some danger of a blockage if partner has @dJx, for example|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|c3|nt|brolucius: I am in the middle of writing a book that involves computer analysis of opening leads. We have found that leading the top honour is generally right.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||
pc|h3|nt|brolucius: More often than the old text-books suggest.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|nt|ralfwil: an honour, if dummy has a middle @d|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  computer analysis could change several paradigms|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3nt could be reached on this board in the open room|pg||

nt|rcerreto:  true|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  well judged|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but he needed @dJ on dummy|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|pelu: ok NS play transfer over 1@c|pg||
mb|d|nt|rcerreto:  that's why she bid 3 :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Maybe 2@D?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ralfwil: how many @s from W? I vote for 3@s|pg||
mb|d|nt|rcerreto:  a good partner has the J|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rcerreto:  oops, sorry|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  he bid|pg||
nt|ralfwil: anyone with me?|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  with 2@d?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Closer to 3@S than 1@S, perhaps.|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  1@s looks a little timid to me|pg||
nt|pelu: strange take out X by Baldurson|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: a 6-card suit @hK and a stiff @d|pg||
nt|brolucius: Spade game needs to be bid.|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  good sacrifice in 5@d|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so 1@s probably shows 3 card spades?|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry - prob support x in @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: I don't know that 1@H was right when East had indicated the majors.|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  maybe it was also meant to show real @c|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  unsure though|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3@h is for me a strong 3@s rise and an invite to 4@s|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and baldurson dbl is kind of a support dbl?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|brolucius: Allerton may have misread 3@H but East can correct.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Anyway, this is the sort of board we were looking for, after so much drab stuff.|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  he has a pretty good hand, in context|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but you agree with the strong rise David?|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Presumably intended as that. Since 1@S shows very little, as I see it, East might also consider 3@S.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but the best with this bidding is that W has shown his @h honour|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  maybe their standard for free bids is higher than yours and mine|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: Easr didnt read the X from West as @hs|pg||
nt|pelu: saved by S|pg||
nt|murat: good afternoon all :)|pg||
nt|pelu: wellcome now we hace 2 x Murat :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|brolucius: Although we may quibble with the odd bid or two, it seems that the players have judged it very well around the table. |pg||
nt|rcerreto:  anyway, they succeeded in bidding the par|pg||
nt|brolucius: The term 'free bid' was responsible for a lot of awful bidding many decades ago.|pg||
nt|murat: guess one of the most common names of Turkey :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rcerreto:  in a difficult board|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  yes, indeed|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d5|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
nt|pelu: as Peter in Denmark :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rcerreto:  free-bid is something very different today|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h9|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|nt|brolucius: I am told that 4@S failed at one table of the other semi. Do four round of clubs and a ruff with the king, leave declarer with some sort of guess?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sJ|pc|s6|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|pelu: we dont have contact to the Open room, but Board 3 _ the 3NT with 5 toptricks out - gave 10 IMPs to Lavazza|pg||
mc|9|pg||

nt|rcerreto:  felt unhappy afterward, I presume|pg||
nt|pelu: as expectet (not Murat) also 1 NT in OR in Board 4|pg||
mb|1D|nt|MolvaM: that usually means our vugraf operator will soon close this table and reopen it to establish the link to the other table|pg||
mb|2D|nt|MolvaM: what shld tokay do? dbl?|pg||
mb|d|mb|2H|nt|brolucius: 4@D made against the 300 here, so a big swing to Badger.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|murat: and now ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: North was in 3NT at the other table, doubled and ran to 4@D.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|murat: not the best lead|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3d could be makable but tokay wasnt sure about 5 cards @d|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|nt|rcerreto:  do EW play transfer?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Transfers opposite 1@C are popular.|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|brolucius: With four aces missing, it seems that the three-level may be high enough.|pg||
nt|pelu: that the problem with 1@D opening - partner dont know if u have 2 or 5 :)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|pc|d7|nt|brolucius: Obviously East had read West for a much better hand than he holds.|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and I can´t see why...|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cQ|pc|d8|nt|brolucius: Such a shame to lose IMPs unnecessarily when there are so many other ways of losing IMPs.|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  could W consider his hand balanced?|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  then open 1NT (or rebidding, if 1NT is weak)?|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@C was presumably non-forcing, so it is hard to see how East had enough to look for an 11-trick game.|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If 1@s is´nt spades, 1nt from W looks normal for me |pg||
nt|murat: 9 tricks i guess|pg||

nt|brolucius: FIFA do not follow that advice.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so there is no restriction in countries and anybody can play with anybody from any country|pg||
nt|MolvaM: totally open event|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and even though its a European event, its open to people from other continents|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Some might play a weak-strong 2NT on the East cards, to differentiate between strong and distributional 3@D hands.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rcerreto:  no way to play trumps from N|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  then it should make|pg||
nt|murat: anybody dbl with east hand ?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|rcerreto:  even misguessing @d|pg||
nt|MolvaM: not me|pg||

nt|pelu: no|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|rcerreto:  oops|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  they found the way|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Both losing semifinalists are awarded bronze medals. There is no playoff for third place (a good decision in my view)|pg||
nt|brolucius: East hoping for a heart ruff.|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  yes, 3rd-4th place finals are dull|pg||
nt|brolucius: But neither team has a bronze medal in their sights at this moment.|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  winning A and playing a @h back would have forced S to play trumps but...|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  this way has a chance to discard a @h on @s|pg||
nt|pelu: why sh he X?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|rcerreto:  a very good chance now|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|s4|pg||

nt|MolvaM: baldursson has too many high cards and has to defend carefully to avoid being thrown in|pg||

pc|s4|nt|pelu: but East help him, in on @CK he played @D - ruff, @C to A @S to 10 and duck - and now endplayed - East sh play @C back and no endplay|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rcerreto:  a cheap save on 4@h|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@S has escaped a double, but the cards lie well for declarer so the lack of a double will not cost E/W much.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but still a dbl....|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|pc|h8|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|brolucius: Had the cards lain differently, not doubling might have waved goodbye to 500 or so.|pg||
nt|brolucius: East may have feared a third-hand opener, but her side was vulnerable.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a thirs hand opening, but I can take 170 extra if declarer makes|pg||
nt|brolucius: West does not know that partner holds 10 points, so he cannot double 4@S even with an extra value or so. |pg||
nt|ralfwil: but shouldn´t E?|pg||
nt|pelu: now N can make 1NT - topplay @Hs and only 6 tricks for EW|pg||

nt|rcerreto:  should she risk -420 to get 100 instead of 50?|pg||
nt|dburn: risk? what risk?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Better to risk a double in the first place.|pg||
nt|Walddk3: An excellent 6@D now|pg||
nt|dburn: declarer could have the singleton king of clubs only if she had about ten cards rather than thirteen|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  can declarer have one more @d one less @c?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@d on NS - a nice contract|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  N was declarer, I think|pg||
nt|Walddk3: In theory, there is a club ruff, but fortunately for declarer, the defender with the singleton club also has @DA|pg||
nt|brolucius: An interesting bidding test. If they bid it, I will applaud.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 6@C is more tricky and that might be reached.|pg||
nt|Walddk3: They may arrive in 6@C, though|pg||
nt|Walddk3: With problems on a spade lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: can they make 1C after a @c lead? I doubt|pg||
nt|brolucius: This is the sort of board we were hoping for. No-one wants these matches to be decided on small margins after some drab boards.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry @s lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@c after a @s lead....|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: If one side wins after doing better on the big boards, then good luck to them - (even if they are not from England)|pg||
nt|murat: that was unexpected|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the contract went both ways during play and finally declarer came out as the winner|pg||
mb|2H|mb|d|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|ralfwil: If declarer plays @d before havinc cleaned trumps, another @s will set up a trumph trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: D'Ovidio has started well by emphasizing the diamonds before supporting clubs.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|Walddk3: 6@C in the closed room|pg||

nt|murat: would you also prefer 2@s ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Imagine winning the board with 3NT.|pg||

mb|p|nt|ralfwil: true!|pg||

nt|brolucius: So, 20+ IMPs swing due to a 4-1 break. Well, that's part of the game. Hard to take, though.|pg||
nt|murat: he was afraid of Q@c |pg||
pc|dT|nt|pelu: @cQ and @S back and Tokay will regret that he used his only entry to dummy|pg||
nt|MolvaM: kibs are shocked... to play clubs from hand is purely double dummy. he cant do that|pg||
nt|pelu: but against storng defense his plan sh fail|pg||
nt|MolvaM: he can hope that @cA is with north but very hard to play for both honors to be there|pg||
nt|pelu: if S has showed distrbution in the black suits - and easy defense for N|pg||
nt|MolvaM: well some days even 2 club tricks could be enough|pg||
nt|MolvaM: he could catch the @dQ|pg||
nt|murat: he's hopeless now|pg||

mb|d|nt|MolvaM: for kibs who ask|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the other table scores are unreachable|pg||
nt|murat: Lavazza should get the comfortable lead|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Multon won the diamond at trick 2 and paused for a while before he played another spade|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: E/W fighting bravely, but hard to imagine that it will be successfully.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: that looked like broadcasting a football match on radio :)|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|brolucius: All good pairs will know what to do after intervention over 4NT (in theory....)|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|s7|pg||
nt|Walddk3: The official site has a score of 30-27 in this match. Not easy to know what to believe|pg||
nt|brolucius: Cronier may fear a diamond ruff in 6@S, because he has offered the lower-scoring slam with excellent spade support.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: many thanks to our commentators peter lund, and murat anter|pg||
