nt|granguru:  a better one thou|pg||

nt|granguru:  still it  needs @s 2-2 or stiff honor in E and a good guess|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|pelu: Hi all - as every time there are problems before the first match - players has to find the right table and so on|pg||
mb|1S|nt|pelu: not with odds - but better that a "Roland-slam"|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Pleased to see that South has a name, but I think I'll stick with 'South'|pg||
nt|granguru:  exchange black QÂ´s and it would have been a rock iron contract|pg||

mb|p|nt|pelu: Rodwell did open the N hand with 1NT???|pg||

mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|pelu: and I would open 1@D 100% (=4+@d)|pg||
nt|paulg:  North has distribution and they have a lot of controls|pg||
nt|granguru:  4@C cue X @Cs|pg||
nt|granguru:  N could have xx to show second round ctrl|pg||
nt|pelu: when N open 1Nt then Meckstroth has no slam ambitions|pg||
nt|pelu: RD = 1. round control|pg||
nt|granguru:  but then it is more complicate to show @d ctrls|pg||
nt|granguru:  RD is second if 4@C was first|pg||

nt|brolucius: Jeffrey Allerton and Frances Hinden (who is playing at the other table) are a couple, and have won the prestigious Gold Cup (Britain's top knock-out) together.|pg||
nt|brolucius: So far as I know, Hinden has never played women's bridge. She is a top executive for an oil company.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: what do we know about their systems?|pg||
nt|brolucius: E/W were playing straightforward stuff against Russia. I assume that the French play the standard French system, near enough. It will be good kibitzing.|pg||
nt|granguru:  but it is a good idea that the very first control is A (or KQ)|pg||
nt|pelu: no|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|granguru:  would like to hear your arguments...I am open minded :)|pg||
mb|3C|an| |mb|p|nt|granguru:  kibz might enjoy an expert view on the matter|pg||
nt|paulg:  I don't think cue bidding first and second round controls equally makes a huge difference to bidding slams, a lot of it still comes down to judgement|pg||
mb|3H|nt|paulg:  i think the italians beat the americans so often because they had practised partnerships and better bidding methods|pg||
nt|granguru:  being an  expensive deparment players try to reduce judgement and increase accuracy|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|granguru:  agree paul|pg||
nt|paulg:  this hand has another debatable point .. how do you break transfers?|pg||
nt|pelu: too difficult to start a cue bid if only A, a cue is an invitation for slam and often u will miss that - and bidding economy also tell u to start with the lovers cue bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Since there were so many small boards in the first half, I was hoping that all the spectacular stuff had been saved for the second half. False hopes...|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Murat|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hello everyone :)|pg||
nt|pelu: 5 toptricks for defense, but not easy to take them|pg||
nt|paulg:  i dislike showing a weak doubleton and telling them what to lead|pg||
nt|granguru:  at top level players almost always lead the right card|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|granguru:  so it is better to bid accurately|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: East has found a strong lead.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|pelu: now 7 tricks for Tokay|pg||
nt|pelu: prob 3@C dont show about @Cs but only maxz and 3 card support|pg||
nt|paulg:  but i approve of breaking the transfer with only 3-card support, when you are so suitable|pg||
nt|granguru:  once hamman erred a gran slam lead...20 years the hand was appearing in the news|pg||
pc|cA|nt|granguru:  And he used Judgement..with 2 aces he led the shortest one..(wrong)|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c6|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|MolvaM: running a long suit usually creates problems for the defence|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|pc|d7|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now a club ruff will beat it.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: -1 with best defence. a @c switch now|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  @h9 ?|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  looks to ask for @d|pg||
nt|brolucius: Failing that, a trump misguess by declarer.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and in that case possibilities to -2|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  E isn't willing to ask for a @c switch, not knowing what partner has in @c I think|pg||
nt|brolucius: South was declarer, after a transfer response to 1@C, at the other table.|pg||
nt|brolucius: We thought, in the match against Russia, that they seemed to be playing reverse suit-preference. So, maybe she has asked for a club.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But if there is any possibility to defeat, it must be a @c ruff by E. Declarer can have @sKQJ|pg||
nt|pelu: in CR EW missed the defense against 4@S - played by S: @H to K, @D to A Now @CK to A, @S to 8 and Q, @CJ to Q - but not @C again|pg||

pc|d4|pc|s3|pc|d8|pg||

nt|paulg:  his line did have a lot of play|pg||

nt|ralfwil: 3@h is for me a strong 3@s rise and an invite to 4@s|pg||

nt|ralfwil: but you agree with the strong rise David?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|brolucius: Presumably intended as that. Since 1@S shows very little, as I see it, East might also consider 3@S.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but the best with this bidding is that W has shown his @h honour|pg||

nt|brolucius: East may have feared a third-hand opener, but her side was vulnerable.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a thirs hand opening, but I can take 170 extra if declarer makes|pg||

nt|bigtrain: was wondering about the missing result myself|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|bigtrain: 1NT is semi-forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: yes, 4@H-1 by E -can you enter this into the movie operator!?|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|vugraphplE: done|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: 1nt looks the normal contract - which wont be possible now|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@C is generally 4+ because they usually pass with 5332s - with a hand that bids over 2NT they treat 1NT as forcing and bid 2@C (or 2@D)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|roswolf: thank you pawel:)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: IMO meck would have passed with the N hand (or opened 1NT) :)|pg||

nt|ralfwil: another slam|pg||
nt|brolucius: So, Allerton-Leslie will think that they may have had a very big board.|pg||
nt|pelu: same did N :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  i would be bidding hearts on the next round|pg||
nt|granguru:  I think it is the correct way |pg||
nt|pelu: yes and that would show @H-stopper and bad @ss|pg||
nt|pelu: the problem - at boprt tables was Ss bold @s-bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|brolucius: A question of RKCB when the spade fit comes to light.|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: for kibs who ask|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the other table scores are unreachable|pg||
nt|murat: Lavazza should get the comfortable lead|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but lavaza leads by a comfortable margin of approx 30 imps|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 4@c from me as W|pg||
nt|Walddk3: So Zimmermann by 6 in a minute|pg||
nt|pelu: sory a solid win for Lawazza - my calculations (:)) 37-1|pg||
mb|2C|an| |nt|Walddk3: Multon won the diamond at trick 2 and paused for a while before he played another spade|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: E/W fighting bravely, but hard to imagine that it will be successfully.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: that looked like broadcasting a football match on radio :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|pelu: a very normal way to bid on Ns hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  I played Mahaffey on vugraph in last year's Rosenblum ... luckily Meckwell were in Nickell's team on that occasion|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: All good pairs will know what to do after intervention over 4NT (in theory....)|pg||
nt|Walddk3: The Vriend team on their way to the final; 32-9 after a slam swing on board 23, like here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|murat: :)|pg||
nt|pelu: same contract in OR|pg||
pc|d2|nt|pelu: 10 tricks|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the open event at this stage consists of short matches of 10 boards|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so this is the last hand of the segment|pg||
pc|d8|nt|paulg:  I think 1NT as semi-forcing is quite popular, where North might pass 1NT?|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d6|pg||
nt|Walddk3: The official site has a score of 30-27 in this match. Not easy to know what to believe|pg||
nt|brolucius: Cronier may fear a diamond ruff in 6@S, because he has offered the lower-scoring slam with excellent spade support.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: many thanks to our commentators peter lund, and murat anter|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and our operator michal |pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|MolvaM: and our kibitzers|pg||

nt|MolvaM: the next segment starts soon|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|nt|Walddk3: I trust our operators until proven wrong|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bigtrain: meckwell play semi-forcing...  generally speaking meck passes all 5332s while eric bids on with 5332 maxs|pg||

nt|MolvaM: unofficial score is 37-1 lavazza|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but better check later with the website|pg||
nt|MolvaM: http://www.poznan2011.pl/results|pg||
nt|bigtrain: for instance here, 2@C generally shows 4+ for meck and 3+ for roddy :)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|paulg:  interesting difference in styles|pg||
nt|paulg:  I thought these top pairs/teams were supposed to simulate these situations and get a consensus|pg||
nt|pelu: how do they explai that on CC?|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|c5|nt|bigtrain: its a matter of style|pg||
pc|c8|pc|s6|pg||
nt|paulg:  well, kokish at least|pg||
nt|bigtrain: note i said generally speaking|pg||
nt|pelu: but their opp sh have that information|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|d5|pg||
nt|pelu: general style = agreement = on CC|pg||
nt|bigtrain: they treat the 1NT as semi-forcing and announce it that way...  what they do as individuals is just my observation|pg||
