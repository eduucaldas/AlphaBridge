nt|eamongall: but unlikely NS score more than 10% |pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@S a good sac over 4@H unless EW can find their @C ruff|pg||
nt|desert: 2N is surely an INV+ heart raise...|pg||
mb|5C|mb|d|nt|desert: wow...thats aggressive....|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: not a good sac....|pg||
nt|eamongall: aggressive and vulnerable ... |pg||

nt|desert: But east opened the bidding.....|pg||
nt|eamongall: of course so play for @SK there |pg||
nt|desert: exactly...|pg||
nt|sharkey: always easier from here....|pg||
nt|eamongall: Brown McGann managed to persuade opps to double them in 4@Hs on board 2 |pg||
nt|eamongall: sorry board 1 |pg||
nt|sharkey: Spec suggests Janice shud have tried intrafinesse as @SK "surely" with W on bidding... Not sure as East has shown opener and West probably minimum a limit raise...|pg||
nt|sharkey: Perhaps this has merits as W most likely wud bid 4@H if @SK and @SJ were exchanged|pg||
nt|eamongall: 3NT+2 was as much as 25% for Pepsi /Misz|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxp/fa.html|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Short break after each round of 2 boards|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 10 rounds in this session|pg||
nt|desert: B10x, ABxx, DBxxx, x is a 4 @H bid after 1 @H (2@C)? I dont think so.....(especially thinking about modern opening bids (look at the actual one :-))|pg||

pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|cJ|pc|c3|pg||
