nt|Gerben42:  if it starts 1@C 4@H, what does S bid?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  4NT perhaps|pg||
nt|bagman: but E has a hand where she can prevent NS from changing that information. After 1@C, E can bid 4@H and then?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  esp. tough if 1@C can be short (3 or even 2 cards)|pg||
nt|bagman: if 4NT shows primary diamonds and secondary clubs then it's the bid|pg||

nt|bagman: I wouldn't be surprised if there are some other agreements for the meaning of 4NT|pg||
nt|bagman: or no agreements :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  this is an area where regular partnerships are ahead of the game|pg||

nt|bagman: 3rd hand opening might have only 4 decent spades|pg||
nt|eamongall: paul gipson points out .. East might be concerned that West would pass a responsive double|pg||

nt|bagman: or N might consider the spades as 4-carder|pg||
nt|bagman: In 4@S declarer can afford to take the @H-finesse; in 3NT the declarer must do the same even with the risk of going down in the contract|pg||
