nt|twcho: given that there is no need to preempt|pg||

nt|twcho: I think declarer better plays the @dJ or 9 instead of the 6 at 1st trick|pg||
nt|twcho: this likely clarify which defender holds the @d Q|pg||
nt|twcho: and he may opt for the other route to reach his 10th trick instead of resorting on 33 @h break|pg||
nt|twcho: another wild hand|pg||
nt|twcho: south 8410 and north 6520|pg||
nt|twcho: hard to predict the final contract here|pg||
nt|twcho: anything can happen|pg||
mb|4D|an|8+!D|nt|twcho: it seems to me the 2NT is NF so the raise to game by east is a bit aggressive|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: so 4@d is middle of the road action imo|pg||
nt|twcho: east will probably balanced with 4@h|pg||
mb|5D|nt|twcho: but anyway, east did a good job of shifting to @s to hold declarer to 9 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: ok, north add one more|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|twcho: but one should be more courageous in bidding game especially when vulnerable as the imp scale definitely favors it|pg||
nt|twcho: so buy the contract cheaply|pg||
pc|hA|nt|twcho: 1N is 14-16|pg||
nt|twcho: can have 5M or 6m|pg||
nt|twcho: as @h10 will win the trick, it all depends on how declarer play the @c suit|pg||
pc|d6|pc|hT|pc|h6|pg||
nt|twcho: the only way to make here is ruffing finesse in @c|pg||
pc|cK|nt|twcho: if he opts to finesse west, he will be rewarded with an overtrick as the card lies while if he chooses the other way round, he may well go down|pg||
nt|twcho: so again the prize went to the bold bidder|pg||
pc|c4|nt|twcho: but it will fail |pg||
nt|twcho: and west will return his trump|pg||
nt|twcho: south can settle for only one down by ruffing this card|pg||
nt|twcho: but if he wants to make his game, he has to finesse|pg||
pc|d2|nt|twcho: With the lucky lie of red cards and @s not running for defenders, 3NT will roll home easily|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|d7|pc|h4|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|d3|pc|c8|pg||
nt|twcho: so there are two alternative lines for declarer|pg||
nt|twcho: trying the @c finesse or test @h for 33|pg||
nt|twcho: so probably he can test @h first and then finesse in @c|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dT|pc|c3|pc|d9|pg||
nt|twcho: he doesn't know defenders' @s is not running|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphzej: E play 3 @S :(|pg||
nt|twcho: looks like better to me to test @h before @c finesse|pg||
nt|twcho: both I and our excellent operator, Chayes are biased, but to different sides. :)|pg||
nt|twcho: so probably the play has finished.|pg||
nt|twcho: 9 tricks I supposed, right?|pg||
nt|vugraphzej: +1|pg||
nt|twcho: so he decided that it is quite impossible for east not rising with @cA if he has it|pg||
nt|twcho: and he is right|pg||
mc|10|nt|twcho: that's a bonus|pg||
nt|vugraphzej: :)|pg||

pc|d4|nt|twcho: given the @s lead, declarer will probably go down because the normal play in @h will yield two tricks for the defenders and it is difficult for declarer to come to 9 tricks before ...|pg||

nt|vugraphzej: 4|pg||
nt|twcho: so NZ and FP will play 4 segments to decide the berth to the Netherlands?|pg||
nt|twcho: the 2nd last bd|pg||
nt|twcho: interesting contract in OR|pg||
mb|2S|nt|twcho: so the Taipei team can't handle the multi it seems and have a complete mixed up|pg||
mb|3S!|an|ask stop|nt|twcho: this may be fatal to them|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|twcho: Has Australia grabbed a berth already?|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: So the 3NT at bd 11 has earned HK another 11 imps and now the gap is 25 imps|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|twcho: 3NT cold here|pg||
nt|twcho: so a possible 12 imps to Japan|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sJ|nt|petergill: This Zone 7 playoff is for a spot in Netherlands. So is Japan vs Singapore via Zone 6. Then loser of Japan - Singapore plays winner of Chinese Taipei - Hong Kong for other Zone 6 ...|pg||
nt|petergill: spot in Bermuda Bowl|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kiwibridge: no they all play each other|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, China (1st) and Aus (top Z7 team yesterday) already in Bermuda Bowl|pg||
nt|twcho: and this board is decisive|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dJ|nt|twcho: tks Peter for the info|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||

nt|twcho: a possible slam here but fail due to the bad break in @H|pg||
nt|twcho: so 4@h is probably the limit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|twcho: 5@s can be defeated at the other table but NS buy the insurance and go one more|pg||
mb|1S|mb|3H|mb|4H|nt|twcho: but of course 5@s may still be made if defense can't find the @d ruff, not a certainty to any measures|pg||
mb|5C|mb|5S|nt|twcho: 1@d shows @h|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|twcho: why is there an alert in 1@s?|pg||
nt|petergill: NZ situation is something like http://nzbridge.co.nz/international/Bulletin%20OpenTeam%20Malaysia%20&%20Reserve%20Pairs.pdf - also might depend on whether Newell and Reid are ...|pg||
nt|petergill: available for Nettherlands|pg||
nt|twcho: so NS ended safely in the major game|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: natural looking|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: breaks the transfer|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@D = @h and |pg||
nt|vugraphzej: 3+@S|pg||
nt|petergill: alert is that 1@S denies 3 hearts|pg||
nt|twcho: OK, so with 4@s and 3@h, north will respond 1@h first, right?|pg||
nt|twcho: confirmed|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: So it is up to south to find the killing defense|pg||
nt|twcho: not an easy job|pg||
pc|c8|nt|twcho: this end the defense|pg||
nt|twcho: and another pick up by Japan. So congratulation to Japan|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: Michael Ware and Geo Tislevoll|pg||
