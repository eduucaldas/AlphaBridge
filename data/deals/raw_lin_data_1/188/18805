nt|petergill: understandable. |pg||
nt|duncan8622:  bd 32: if 3C shows clubs and a 4card major then clearly West should bid something other than 3NT|pg||
nt|petergill: I think I would ahve eld @H3, but with dummy advertising a source of tricks in clubs and Noerth'|pg||
nt|duncan8622:  3D then 4C over 3S|pg||
nt|vugraphzej: sry|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: we have no closed room for comparisons :(|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|d|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|petergill: Indonesia needs 10 or more VPs to win the Championship. A 9-21 loss would give the title to their opponents. Ref http://www.2011apbf.com/Rrr2_S.pdf for current scores. |pg||

nt|petergill: Will try not to crash the other table this time :)|pg||
nt|duncan8622:  true, but East played carelessly|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|ianmcc: what do we lead to 3NT from North?|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 31: Declarer's idea was that if North had @SK (as expected on the bidding) and South had @SJ, North would rise on the spade towards dummy's ten, so declarer does only -1|pg||
nt|ianmcc: but why cover @h?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h3|nt|petergill: Yes, covering @hQ was a major error, caused by the shock of finding South with the spade honours. Shock commonly causes "suspension of logic" at the bridge table|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|pc|h5|pg||
nt|twcho: west must be regretting when he sees dummy but sigh a big relief after @hJ score|pg||
nt|ianmcc: it afflicts me often|pg||
