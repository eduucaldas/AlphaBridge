nt|mamos: Ns will bid 3NT   in any language|pg||
nt|jcomyn: agreed but they didnt look as if they would find a major fit|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Rather easy boards to start with here|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|grebrof: 3@s is not an underbid|pg||
nt|jcomyn: especially vul very aggressive stuff|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|danilo1: Double -dummy 3NT ... but guess would not find @DK|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: will they get to 6 here ?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  If so - 6 @H D is free for 1100|pg||
nt|hawe45:  7 the 1400 and 1 IMP|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Difficult to find out, how bad slam is|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mamos: defence to 4@h not trivial|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: playing 4@s wouldnt be either|pg||
nt|grebrof: missing the AK of trumps, not always fun|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well ca ruff and h ak|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes|pg||
nt|jcomyn: see the one earlier missing ak of trumps slam|pg||
nt|mamos: S probably has to rise with @hA  and play Club|pg||
nt|grebrof: I actually played 6@hs with single A vs my Ps single K|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Team NONACO might be M-onaco|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: hello|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|mamos: yes the Slam missing AK of trumps was the result of RKCB and a 5@s response which pinpointed two missing KC when the agreed suit was @h|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: It is, sry for that|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Z = Zimmermann...|pg||
nt|danilo1: mini NT ... North is still not giving up slam ...  ... need not to go over 4NT|pg||
mb|4H|nt|grebrof: can give ruff?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: uses will bid this in two bids but maybe we are oldfashioned. They take 9 bids to get to the most unobvious contract u ever saw|pg||

nt|jcomyn: yep. One of my many most embarassing moments|pg||
nt|eamongall: good evening kacper |pg||
nt|danilo1: well ... if South decides to open .. in nat. system, may not be so easy for North to stop ... here ... mini NT and relays should have advantage ... seems North not using them|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|nt|eamongall: strong NT and transfer and probably play 2@S ... or as it is 1NT |pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Probably in board 2, 6 @C is the best slam|pg||
nt|eamongall: personally I would attempt to play 2@S but I am not in Poznan |pg||
mb|2N|nt|mamos: i cannot see any way to make 4@h on this board even if the defence fail to get a Spade ruff|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i am not bidding 2c on that hand to let opps have a cheap bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|grebrof: 3nt doesnt make either|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h2|nt|hawe45:  North could even have hands, where 4 @S had a play - and where 1 NT was a bad spot|pg||

nt|jcomyn: so if you nplay in nt you are vul and in spades not vul - interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: good bid :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|hawe45:  Very good lead this - also|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East will take the Ace - and play a @D, IÂ´m sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|danilo1: probable 1NT by South ... so will probably end in 3NT |pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|vugraphpl9: running scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/orrleaderb.html|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mamos: quick hand?|pg||
nt|grebrof: not so quick in the start|pg||
nt|mamos: will be good for EW because inevitably some pairs will not find NT|pg||
mb|p|pc|dK|nt|danilo1: probably -1|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|nt|sunsamvar: Great work by our operator Kacper from the venue|pg||

pc|c4|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Great working with u Hans|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Very logical - and good - from East, The @H Queen proves, that Wests @H need no help|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hawe45:  South should have covered the @S Queen - West i the dangerous hand|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sunsamvar: Tx to all the specs for ur comments and for watching|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c5|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jcomyn: fun discarding|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|grebrof: discarding IS funny|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d2|nt|hawe45:  At the other table West led he @H 10, so East cintinued @H...|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|nt|vugraphpl9: :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: I guess S understands she has to hold @hs at least now|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|danilo1: in OR ... North never mentined @C bd. 26 ... so it has been  al ittle difficult for South to find 6@C|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sunsamvar: and finally Tx to the organisers, BBO and Roland for bringing this vugraph to us|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Monaco has been solid in this room and are deserving winners|pg||
