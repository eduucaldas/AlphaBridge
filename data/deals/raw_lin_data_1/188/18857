mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfk: Hi all, back finally...live from DEeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeetroit.|pg||

mb|p|nt|wygbe1: should have 9 tricks now - 3 sp, 3 diam, 1h, 2c|pg||
nt|timmy5:  now declarer is forced to find the diamond queen to protect king of hearts|pg||
nt|jjsb2: le jeux de la carte ne pose pas de problème apparemment |pg||
nt|timmy5: south is hussein sherief and he is even nore handsome than Omar el sheried|pg||
pc|h7|nt|gavin:  if you have unlimited entries|pg||
nt|dilipgidwa: experts hate to lead from unsupported 4 card suits |pg||
nt|jjsb2: pour une nouvelle égalité|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|gavin:  the best way to play the suit|pg||
nt|gavin:  is to lead low to the queen|pg||
nt|gavin:  its better than playing the Jack in case south has singleton king|pg||
nt|gavin:  so she will be evaluating if she can afford to do so|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|timmy5: good lead and and i expect positive score for Egypt|pg||
pc|h5|nt|dilipgidwa: hence no @h lead |pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|gavin:  things are getting a little hairy with that losing finesse|pg||
nt|gavin:  in order to come to 9 tricks she needs 3@S 1@H 3@D and 2@C|pg||
nt|gavin:  she still doesnt know how many @H tricks|pg||
nt|wygbe1: club is good shift, may need to lead h after winning second club and before leading spade|pg||

pc|cT|pc|c7|pc|c5|pc|cA|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c8|pc|cK|pg||
pc|hT|nt|gavin:  now north played very quickly|pg||
nt|gavin:  may have been worried their partner had KJTx of clubs|pg||
nt|gavin:  establishing clubs isnt serving a purpose with no more entries|pg||
nt|wygbe1: winning the h and playing back the nine, as spec points out, may have beaten this|pg||
nt|gavin:  now levin pretty much knows she is making|pg||
nt|wygbe1: ace and a spade now, results in 9 tricks|pg||

pc|c2|nt|jmbw: oui....certains jouent ce 2@s semi-constructif :)|pg||

pc|c5|nt|dilipgidwa: east on lead|pg||
nt|timmy5:  this can still make if declarer finds the queen of clubs|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|nt|gavin:  east is considering throwing away a diamond here to avoid being shortened|pg||
nt|gavin:  it looks obvious to ruff but with the preempt over her a bad trump break very possible|pg||
nt|gavin:  when thinking about it, she must assume they will continue leading spades (if trumps are breaking badly)|pg||
nt|gavin:  and figure out if she can handle a 5-0 split|pg||

nt|timmy5: WE Need 30 imps now to win |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|gavin:  but its commonly played only up until a 3C overcall|pg||

pc|d7|nt|newmoon: in MPs, it may be right to go back to @Hs by North|pg||
nt|tec123: a club partial will be a good stop here, but South may try again over a 3C raise|pg||
pc|d2|nt|gavin:  this contract had its chances but we can see the club finesse is offside (rather expected)|pg||
nt|gavin:  but still can be a good sacrifice|pg||
nt|gavin:  4S can go down|pg||
nt|gavin:  by leading a diamond and using the ace of hearts entry to get a ruff|pg||
nt|jmbw: 2@s dans l'autre ligne est envisageable...|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||

nt|gavin:  now if east doesnt cover the ace will drop the king|pg||
nt|gavin:  if east does cover then you win the ace and lead towards the ten|pg||
nt|gavin:  however that would not work if east has Q9x and west has Kx|pg||

nt|gavin:  then if west has Honor doubleton they can fly up|pg||

nt|gavin:  and if they dont fly their honor will drop under the ace|pg||
nt|wygbe1: moment of truth coming up - knows w has 5s, so might play w for the shortness|pg||

pc|h7|pc|h3|pc|h9|pc|hT|pg||

nt|tec123: might be some blood now|pg||
nt|newmoon: remember 1@D denied 4-card major.  So 3@H must be longer @Cs?|pg||
nt|tec123: True, but a simple t/out dbl would have been lower and carried a similar message|pg||
nt|newmoon: if it COULD be, North must pass the x, and South will 4@C|pg||

nt|fann4: What a huge difference in evaluation here. In the CR, E made a weak jump shift response of 3@D.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|fann4: I don't say it's necessarily correct - with a void in partner's suit and a suit missing the top 4 honours, and vul too.|pg||
nt|fann4: I far prefer East's decision here.|pg||
mb|d|nt|fann4: N may pass now, which in their style would show some game interest.|pg||
nt|fann4: Clearly the right cards opposite would give a play for game, but S did pass originally.|pg||
mb|p|nt|fann4: It's close but I think the hand is worth a mild try.|pg||
nt|fann4: Which he has done.|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|fann4: Is E now envisaging a possible game, with his partner short in @S and presumably 3 suited.|pg||

mb|p|nt|fann4: I don't - how did he know his partner was going to take further action?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|fann4: E must apply the axe now.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: considering match situation seems automatic|pg||
nt|fann4: He knows he may have no @D tricks, but he has great trumps. Plus, S is a passed hand and N took a slow route|pg||
nt|fabsayc: unless thinking of bigger things with5@D|pg||
nt|fann4: Well, if he is thinking of bigger things, then for sure he should have done so before. His partner passed 4@D|pg||
nt|fann4: I don't quite understand West's double though. He had a 2 suiter.|pg||
nt|fann4: A nice hand for Good/Bad, where 2NT shows a good(or bad) single or 2 suited hand, and 3@C here the opposite.|pg||

nt|tec123: Much discussion on whether to open a weak 2 with a side 4 card major - I do , but you need a system where is pard is good enough to proceed you can show the 4 card major so a fit ...|pg||

nt|newmoon: 2@H = trf = good raise, Tim?|pg||
nt|glensa: I prefer a 4club opening showing a strong 4h hand myself, but 1 heart is certainly not wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|glensa: I don't know what east is thinking. The shape and high card positioning is wrong for a double|pg||

nt|newmoon: 3NT = max and 2 stoppers in @S.   Presumably 2@C stayman shows values |pg||
mb|p|nt|glensa: it is always subject to partnership agreement, but I play this as 9 tricks with some defense|pg||

mb|p|pc|sT|nt|newmoon: was 4@S unilateral?|pg||

mb|p|nt|newmoon: in OR, EAST opens 1@H.  They settle in 4@H|pg||
nt|tec123: With 2 quick tricks East should pass rather than bale out to 4@C despite lack of @S stopper - potentially a very good result for Tunisia|pg||

nt|tec123: 4@H should make as well though as @H are 3-3 and the same club suit is equally useful|pg||
nt|newmoon: and, in 3rd seat, at these colours (favourable) 3NT is very descriptive|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|c2|nt|newmoon: Tim - I expected more swingy boards - something like the set you had against the Italians in the quarters of the BB some 4 years ago(?) where 3 slam swings won the match|pg||
nt|tec123: The 4-3 fit will play well here though I would have chosen 3@C rather than 2@S as the 1@H bid rather than double denied spades|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|pc|cA|pg||

nt|newmoon: Mostafa is back|pg||
mb|p|nt|glensa: the spade split is very rude for declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: and yes, Tim, bd 16 could have been a wash in 3@Dx both rooms.    Really, was that a 3@D bid, vul, 1st seat?|pg||

nt|tec123: In the modern style (Every hand an Adventure and bid whenever you can) it was a 3@D opener|pg||

nt|glensa: 2nt must be conventional|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h2|nt|newmoon: in OR, South 1NT, North 3NT, swish|pg||
nt|tec123: A spade lead can beat 3N provided E snatches his aces when a minor suit is played|pg||
pc|h4|nt|newmoon: possible dble-swing now.   200 here + 100 from OR = 300 = 7 IMPs to Tunisia             provided they get 3@H here -2|pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: J10x hardly seems ideal to accept game try, maybe punt with 3@H|pg||
