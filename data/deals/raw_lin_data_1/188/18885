mb|p|nt|MarekW: http://www.poznan2011.pl/|pg||
nt|rcerreto: also @s after the lead could provide a discard|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rcerreto: 3NT would have asked for a @h lead|pg||
nt|rcerreto: to set|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|daman: a lovely 1NT opener    good thing Kokish isn't watching|pg||
mb|1S|nt|hedyg: 1 other table played 3NT and got a K@D lead for 11 tricks and top score|pg||
nt|jbgood: and I wouldnt be surprised if NS play Polish Club...|pg||
nt|vugraphplf: Polish club likely here|pg||
nt|bobholl: 9 tricks in NT|pg||
nt|vugraphplf: NS are playing Polish Club|pg||
nt|bobholl: and 5 in @C so pushed board probably|pg||
nt|rcerreto: what's your choice Bob with N cards?|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2N|nt|rcerreto: would you open 1@c or what?|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2@C and then 3@C but i play that as semi and 2@D as the biggest bid|pg||
nt|rcerreto: 2NT shows 4+ card support in @s and a good hand|pg||
nt|vugraphplf: There was an alert on W side for the 2NT bid, which was lacking on the EN side|pg||
mb|3N|nt|hedyg: balanced hand :) no voids!|pg||
nt|daman: words cannot express how I feel about that 1NT bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: feel similar about the 4@H bid?|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: ditto|pg||
nt|vugraphplf: Or at least i missed it|pg||
nt|bobholl: n doesn't know S also had @H so brave it is :)|pg||
nt|rcerreto: 4@s would be a worthwhile sacrifice|pg||
nt|rcerreto: but then N can bid 5@c|pg||
nt|vugraphplf: Running scores at http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/orrrunda4.html|pg||

mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|jbgood: a kib insists that 2@d is 12+ artificial - so...|pg||
nt|april7: in this case, they might settle for 7@D and not 7NT|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|jbgood: my kib says: it is natural AND 12+|pg||
nt|vugraphplf: 2@D was 12+ GF with 5+@D|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|jbgood: sry about my attempt to mislead the audience...|pg||
nt|april7: and what is 5@C??|pg||
nt|april7: so 3@D was BW???|pg||
nt|vugraphplf: 2NT 17-18 BAL|pg||

nt|vugraphplf: 4@S 0/3|pg||
nt|april7: what about Q of @D asking??|pg||
nt|jbgood: tu Michael!|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
nt|daman: 10 tricks for EW|pg||

nt|rcerreto: he chose one of the wrong ones|pg||
nt|vugraphplf: Each one was wrong|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|bobholl: as akib remarks every lead helps :(|pg||
nt|rcerreto: maybe @c didn't hurt|pg||
nt|vugraphplf: Oh, true, missed that.|pg||
nt|bobholl: he'd better duck the @H one exit less needed|pg||
nt|rcerreto: but I think it always makes|pg||
nt|rcerreto: S has a very bad time any time he gets the lead|pg||
nt|murat: yes true. even on club lead he makes|pg||
nt|rcerreto: the @s will provide some discards, in due time|pg||
nt|bobholl: but not losing a@S at all helps :)|pg||
nt|rcerreto: oh yes :)|pg||
nt|vugraphplf: Do i see right, or the declarer makes 11 if S doesn't cut off one of the dummy entries now?|pg||
nt|rcerreto: think so|pg||
nt|bobholl: that's rigth so one of the K's necessary now|pg||
