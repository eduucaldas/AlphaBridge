nt|twcho: I think declarer better plays the @dJ or 9 instead of the 6 at 1st trick|pg||
nt|twcho: this likely clarify which defender holds the @d Q|pg||
nt|twcho: and he may opt for the other route to reach his 10th trick instead of resorting on 33 @h break|pg||
nt|twcho: another wild hand|pg||
nt|twcho: south 8410 and north 6520|pg||
nt|twcho: hard to predict the final contract here|pg||
nt|twcho: anything can happen|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ups:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzej: claim loose club|pg||
nt|petergill: S needed that extra trump in dummy to keep control of the hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: it seems to me the 2NT is NF so the raise to game by east is a bit aggressive|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: so 4@d is middle of the road action imo|pg||
nt|twcho: east will probably balanced with 4@h|pg||
nt|rodal f: An ugly one for NS|pg||
mb|2N|nt|twcho: but anyway, east did a good job of shifting to @s to hold declarer to 9 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: ok, north add one more|pg||
nt|petergill: As Ian predicted, the play was very interesting indeed, being an almost textbook example of how trump control can be retained by NOT ruffing clubs in dummy|pg||
mb|3D|nt|vugraphzej: if 7@Dx E lead club :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: but one should be more courageous in bidding game especially when vulnerable as the imp scale definitely favors it|pg||
nt|twcho: so buy the contract cheaply|pg||
mb|3H|nt|twcho: 1N is 14-16|pg||
nt|twcho: can have 5M or 6m|pg||
nt|twcho: as @h10 will win the trick, it all depends on how declarer play the @c suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|ianmcc: 4@h looks to fail|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: the only way to make here is ruffing finesse in @c|pg||
mb|4H|nt|twcho: if he opts to finesse west, he will be rewarded with an overtrick as the card lies while if he chooses the other way round, he may well go down|pg||
nt|twcho: so again the prize went to the bold bidder|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: but it will fail |pg||
nt|twcho: and west will return his trump|pg||
nt|twcho: south can settle for only one down by ruffing this card|pg||
nt|twcho: but if he wants to make his game, he has to finesse|pg||
nt|rodal f: EW at an interesting fight here. I @S give a trick it's OK. Else it's NS at @C|pg||
nt|rodal f: And gere we go?|pg||
nt|rodal f: My opening would have been 3@D|pg||
nt|rodal f: Even with those 4 @Ss|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: With the lucky lie of red cards and @s not running for defenders, 3NT will roll home easily|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 3NT would fail on a top spade lead (recommended), but makes on any 4th best black card lead|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rodal f: *If @S give one trick..... Sr|pg||
pc|s8|nt|petergill: 4@H should fail, assuming no club switch|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rodal f: A result by the light opening.|pg||
nt|rodal f: B22 3NT at bought rooms|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sQ|pc|sJ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|twcho: so there are two alternative lines for declarer|pg||
nt|twcho: trying the @c finesse or test @h for 33|pg||
nt|twcho: so probably he can test @h first and then finesse in @c|pg||
pc|s7|nt|petergill: I like West's @SJ on the 2nd spade, as suit pref "nothing in clubs"|pg||
pc|h9|pc|s3|pc|s9|pg||
nt|twcho: he doesn't know defenders' @s is not running|pg||
nt|ianmcc: good way to play|pg||
nt|ianmcc: must hook @c|pg||
nt|petergill: I think @S6 at Trick 1 might have been count, so E knew W could not have 5 spades. |pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphzej: E play 3 @S :(|pg||
nt|twcho: looks like better to me to test @h before @c finesse|pg||
nt|twcho: both I and our excellent operator, Chayes are biased, but to different sides. :)|pg||
nt|twcho: so probably the play has finished.|pg||
nt|twcho: 9 tricks I supposed, right?|pg||
nt|vugraphzej: +1|pg||
nt|twcho: so he decided that it is quite impossible for east not rising with @cA if he has it|pg||
nt|twcho: and he is right|pg||
pc|c6|nt|twcho: that's a bonus|pg||
nt|vugraphzej: :)|pg||
nt|twcho: normally declarer can take only 9 tricks|pg||
nt|twcho: and minimize his loss to down 1|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|petergill: Not best play by North ....|pg||

nt|twcho: strange to overtake the @h10|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hQ|pc|h4|pc|h8|pg||
nt|petergill: North needs @HQ to drop singleton or doubleton, so N should play @HAK, then !KD, !AD, third @D and if E has @CK and @DQxx, East is endplayed|pg||

mb|p|mb|3H|nt|rodal f: Wasn't 2@H free now? Having semi in @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: the bad slam in bd 2 has earned Japan 13 imps and the aggressive preempt to 4@s being doubled for bd 5 at the OR has yielded another 9 imps to Japan|pg||
nt|twcho: so the gap has widened considerably|pg||
nt|twcho: not the best lead|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|cK|pg||

nt|vugraphzej: 7@Cx-1|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y :( Correct|pg||
nt|petergill: Slow hearts (have AK to knock out) indicate NS gets in while @H suit is set up, but if partner has QJxx in clubs, have to suggest 3NT - perhaps West might put it back to 4@H?|pg||
nt|petergill: Tough decisions for both E and W in bidding|pg||

nt|rodal f: Can't see how it at all can go down.|pg||
nt|rodal f: The 7@C.|pg||
nt|petergill: Best play might be: @HJ to king, then run @D9 - if North covers with king, try low heart to nine, hoping South ducks?|pg||
nt|petergill: @H8 now|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|nt|twcho: either @s or the other 2 suits, i.e. the minors|pg||

mb|1H|nt|twcho: :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: you were right about  5|pg||

nt|rodal f: Not best @Cs Iv'e seen at fit but else it seems OK for EW in @H|pg||

nt|vugraphzej: :)|pg||
nt|twcho: so likely 11 tricks|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|nt|twcho: showing less than 4@s (similar to forcing 1N)|pg||

pc|cQ|pg||
nt|twcho: another aggressive game by NS that will likely fail|pg||
nt|petergill: At more suitable vulnerabilites (e.g. nil), North would risk bidding 2@S over 2@H, or t/o dbl of 2@H|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|twcho: but the favorable lead may alters the situtation|pg||
nt|twcho: did east know that the 1@s bid is conventional|pg||
nt|twcho: if this is not alerted on his side|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|nt|twcho: I shd say this is unlucky|pg||
pc|h5|nt|twcho: given the @s lead, declarer will probably go down because the normal play in @h will yield two tricks for the defenders and it is difficult for declarer to come to 9 tricks before ...|pg||
nt|twcho: defenders get their 5 tricks|pg||
pc|s3|pg||

nt|twcho: but it may be the case that south has forgotten their agreement that Kaplan Inverse is OFF for passed hand then there is no obligation for north to alert east|pg||
nt|twcho: so it actually depends on their agreement but this is not shown in their CC|pg||
nt|twcho: unfavorable for the Sinagpore pair because Director will rule against them then|pg||

nt|twcho: It seems that 6@s fares better here|pg||
nt|twcho: So it demonstrates how difficult bridge is|pg||

nt|rodal f: Lovly cards at S and W|pg||
nt|petergill: I don't like playing against pairs who use this "weak raise via 1NT" method, which implies that it might be a good method (if it makes an opponent uncomfortable)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|twcho: any method for them to show M two suiters|pg||
nt|twcho: if not, simply transfer to 3@s and then bid 4@h|pg||

nt|twcho: but then south will probably superaccept|pg||
nt|twcho: in @s|pg||
nt|twcho: Anyway, they will play in 4@s|pg||
nt|rodal f: So -1 and a push|pg||
nt|ianmcc: point taken|pg||
mb|2C|nt|twcho: did east call the director?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzej: No|pg||
nt|twcho: He should|pg||

nt|rodal f: Was that       M     ;)|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 1@C Precision, 1@D negative|pg||
nt|petergill: With NS able to make 2@s or 3@S, Bd 10 was OK for EW|pg||
nt|ianmcc: it was hard to get into auction|pg||
nt|petergill: Most experts nowadays open shapely hands like South's hand. 20 years ago, people who opened the South hand were regarded as maniacal bidders. |pg||
nt|petergill: North has hopes for 6@H|pg||
nt|ianmcc: ands in 1945 they would have cancelled it (at pairs)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|twcho: when he see only 3 cards of S in table|pg||

nt|petergill: 2@C = @D or both majors, 3@S pass or correct|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@H in which @SQ has to be picked, but 6@S is better. |pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4N|nt|twcho: he is too gentleman I think|pg||
nt|rodal f: I agree with west. If E bid freely when W can balace she need to have cards.|pg||
nt|petergill: The bad breaks in @C and @h should make this a substantial penalty|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: this is his rights|pg||
mb|5H|nt|twcho: any line adopted by declarer will succeed|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@H forcing, 4@h minimum  - void in partner's suit is bad - |pg||
nt|petergill: 5@H 2 keycards and no @HQ ---> now North thinks ...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: on their way|pg||
nt|petergill: that if @HQ is missing, perhaps we are better off in @S?|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|nt|twcho: with the favorable lie of trump, east will make this contract for sure|pg||
nt|petergill: North innocently gives preference, not realizing that South has bid her shorter suit first|pg||
nt|rodal f: Anyway they got what they hoped for it seems.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: In 6@S, you can pitch away the @H losers, but still have problems getting your 12th trick|pg||
nt|petergill: On a non trump lead, a complete crossruff works.  |pg||
pc|d2|nt|petergill: On a trump lead, your problems are over as @SQ is picked up for you|pg||
nt|petergill: Many many ways to play 6@S - one way is: Take 5 side winners and cross ruff |pg||
nt|petergill: I think declarer should take about 5 minutes before he plays on - there is much to think about|pg||
nt|petergill: Ian, what do you think about how to play 6@S?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I'd rather be in 6@h - less stressful|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|nt|ianmcc: ruffa @d pitch @ds finesse @s |pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|nt|twcho: east opt for the ruff in @d rather than trump finesse|pg||
nt|twcho: a better line perhaps|pg||
pc|s5|pc|d3|pg||
nt|petergill: Perhaps South should bid 3@C over 2@C, as @H can conveniently be bid later when EW bid @D, the suit they seem (to S) to have|pg||
pc|sA|nt|twcho: certainly declarer doesn't need the finesse in C|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rodal f: Hi Perter and tks for joining:)|pg||

nt|twcho: anyway, both lines lead to the same result|pg||
pc|c6|nt|rodal f: *Peter|pg||

nt|twcho: he is certainly under pressure|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s9|pg||
nt|petergill: He's hoping clubs are 4-4|pg||
pc|sT|nt|petergill: When E discards on @C, West can count that South has 6 clubs, thus only 5 @h, so shortening S's hearts is good defence|pg||
nt|petergill: -3, could have been -4 (or -5) on forcing defence that shortens South's trumps|pg||

mb|p|nt|ianmcc: Hi Frank|pg||
nt|petergill: as Ian pointed out, playing 6@S could be stressful after 10 days of bridge with so many options to pick from|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|twcho: I think the line is a bit risky by finessing in the 1st round|pg||
nt|petergill: Other table is in 3@D on Bd 27, so it will be about 9 imps to Japan|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@S or 3@S now?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|twcho: this must be a flat bd|pg||
nt|twcho: nothing to the bid and play|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: west is trying to configure whether slam is possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: and decide that it is too remote and rest at game|pg||
nt|rodal f: 03-14 it seems.|pg||
nt|rodal f: 14 -03 is better if minor comes as the quest.|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: West knows East is minimum, as East did not bid 3@H over 2@S|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|petergill: 4@H is playable, with the well-fitting EW cards|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s5|pg||
nt|twcho: since east didn't call director for bd 10, Singapore has secured the 10 imps for that one|pg||
nt|rodal f: W wondered a 4@H. This time it was right but often u pan ure pard who open at 3rd hand.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: but @d fit good, if 1@d showed them|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rodal f: 5@H ask, and 6@D=K|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. @Sq+@DK|pg||
pc|h8|nt|twcho: for a good declarer, when the contract looks easy, he will try to cater for the bad break|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|twcho: it will be too late to call. They have lost their rights|pg||
pc|sK|nt|petergill: Perhaps East could have bid 3@H over 2@S - East expects @s shortage opposite, and has nice shape. |pg||
pc|s8|pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
nt|twcho: I think the @c3 return looks like a short suit to me, so much better to rise with A and draw trumps and later finesse in @c to bring home the contract|pg||
nt|rodal f: B10 a swing to come.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|twcho: so he would take his time especially on the 1st trick|pg||

nt|twcho: their NT is 14-16|pg||
nt|twcho: south will do better to discard|pg||
nt|twcho: but then west will be able to trump coup him|pg||
nt|twcho: at the end|pg||
nt|twcho: so still 11 tricks|pg||
nt|rodal f: Missed the QXX@D at W and 800 for a payout|pg||
nt|petergill: Perhaps declarer, after winning @DA at Trick 2, should have played a heart. |pg||
nt|petergill: Yes - good suit and OK shape.  And you?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: timid|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: and they played prepared club|pg||
nt|twcho: so he can't open 1@d with only 3 cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: so 1@c|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|twcho: west can double or make a 2@h jump imo|pg||
nt|twcho: 1@h is not ideal|pg||
nt|twcho: so both N opt to open 1@h instead of a strong 2 opening|pg||
nt|twcho: and this makes the slam bidding easier|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@D splinter|pg||
nt|petergill: I think he is wondering whether to bid 5@c voidwood|pg||
nt|petergill: i.e. RKCB excluding @CA|pg||
nt|twcho: do they have this in their arsenal?|pg||
nt|petergill: They will surely reach at least 6@H - the only problem is to avoid 7@H|pg||
nt|twcho: OK, confirmed from our NZ spectator|pg||
nt|twcho: I don't like this 2NT overcall|pg||
nt|twcho: partner is a passed hand and you are red|pg||
nt|twcho: nothing will gain and likely give away the distribution to the declarer|pg||

nt|twcho: and additionally, the minors are broken|pg||
nt|rodal f: So lost 5IMP but should win 3IMP. It cost|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|twcho: So this should be much better than 4N|pg||
nt|petergill: I like to play that there's no such thing as a cue bid at the 5 level - if 4NT is bypassed, it's voidwood|pg||
nt|twcho: 3@c shows LR+ in @h|pg||
nt|twcho: 3@d looks like a cue bid|pg||
nt|twcho: the match is really tight. Only 4 imps difference|pg||
nt|petergill: That would have made South's task harder, but 4@S would still fail|pg||
nt|ianmcc: short auction|pg||
pc|c5|nt|twcho: or game try|pg||

nt|twcho: with one ace, you still not certain about whether you have the right ace|pg||

pc|h3|nt|petergill: NS is Chinese Taipei's very strong pair|pg||
pc|h4|nt|petergill: 5@C = one keycard, 1430|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Cornell not Ware :)|pg||
nt|twcho: but chance likely favors not holding the @dA|pg||

nt|vugraphzej: :)|pg||
nt|petergill: which is basically how she played 6@H|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|twcho: but with trumps not breaking and double finesse in @d off, chance are slim unless there are some defensive slips|pg||
nt|petergill: majors|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|petergill: Most experts nowadays open East's hand 1@C, liking the good club suit and two tens|pg||
nt|twcho: agree|pg||
nt|petergill: Now that South aggresively opens 1@S, 4@s will be reached|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 13: 5@DX save would have been 500|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: this is a very low scoring match|pg||
nt|twcho: normally this is the sign of good bridge|pg||
nt|rodal f: Some interesting major contracts at NS.|pg||
nt|petergill: If South can penalty dbl 1NT, I'm not sure how much NS can get from 1NTX or 2@CX|pg||
mb|2H|nt|twcho: 7: 15 so far in this segment|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Forcing, I guess?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rodal f: checkback not needed|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: sorry, have something to do now. Bye|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@C shortage - is this a clue for West to find club lead?|pg||
nt|twcho: can't think of a way that north will stop short of game|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|twcho: and the total is only 101 to 104|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Press on for -1 it seems|pg||
pc|d4|nt|petergill: I teach Intermediate Players  that "when the opponents are not bidding, a new suit is forcing unless any of the 4 players has ever bid 1NT, in which case you have to jump in the ...|pg||
nt|petergill: new suit to force" |pg||
pc|dK|nt|twcho: both teams keep the opponent below 2 imps per bd, still very good|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@CX by East is 500 on a trump lead, less on a non-trump lead|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|rodal f: OY. Got the help so fare.|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d9|pc|d6|nt|twcho: you can see the value of opening 1@c as just mentioned by Peter|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|petergill: At other table, the good 1@C opening guided West to the good club lead - it's a bidder's game, especially if you have a good suit. |pg||
nt|rodal f: No 10 is home|pg||
nt|petergill: Thus, to me 2@H there is not forcing due to the 1NT bid. To me, 1NT bids reverse forcingness - and that is the basic principle of bidding on which all bidding is based, in my ...|pg||
nt|petergill: opinion. |pg||
nt|ianmcc: 420 surely|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ain't it a good ruul: That if u have not been at pass it's force?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|nt|twcho: OR east opened 1@c and partner did not have any difficulty to find the right lead|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|dT|nt|twcho: very effective defense here|pg||
nt|rodal f: Was a nice lead from W.|pg||
nt|petergill: Spade finesse - even an amazing @HQ play doesn't seem to give the defence any chance|pg||
pc|d5|nt|petergill: If NS play 2@CXX (boldly? recklessly?), East needs to lead a major to beat it|pg||
pc|d8|nt|twcho: holding declarer to 9 tricks|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|twcho: I shd say, it is good to keep the opponent to below 2 imps per bd and very good if it is below 1.5 imps|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|petergill: 1NTX is not so bad - probably only 300, perhaps better than that for EW|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|pc|sT|nt|ianmcc: the @d lead gave him an entry problem - well solved|pg||
mc|10|nt|petergill: Without @D10, South would not have opened 1@S (he liked having two good suits with good texture) and then 4@s would not have been reached. |pg||

mb|1H|mb|2C|nt|twcho: Has Australia grabbed a berth already?|pg||
nt|petergill: Frank, you can play bridge that way, if you want ... but I don't bid that way, e.g. 1@S from my (dealer) partner, 1NT (15-18) overcall on my right, I want 2@H by me to be ...|pg||
nt|petergill: nonforcing. In my rule, 2@H is nonforcing. In your rule, 2@H is forcing|pg||
mb|4H|nt|twcho: So the 3NT at bd 11 has earned HK another 11 imps and now the gap is 25 imps|pg||
