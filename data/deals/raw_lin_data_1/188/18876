nt|henryb:  have you taken a session off, Jan?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Weichsel asks "what's your opening bid style?" B & R: "light - we open most 11's and some 10's. Weichsel: "you open balanced 11?" "some, not all"|pg||
nt|vugraphpl4: hello, they are in the middle of a board, we will skip after they finish|pg||

nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Markku Pekkinen|pg||

nt|ntmon: hi everyone|pg||
nt|ntmon: quiet board for starter|pg||
nt|Walddk1: 2 segments o 14 boards|pg||
nt|ppiglett: The mandatory trump lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: 3NT cold -- they should get there -- probably 3@H from Lair, 3NT from Weishel|pg||
nt|kit: 3@C conservative -- now Weichsel has a problem|pg||
nt|henryb:  Lair has a problem|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would have tried 2N as Weichsel|pg||
nt|kit: sorry, had that backwards -- missed a bid|pg||
nt|kit: I agree Henry, Weichsel could have tried 2NT|pg||
nt|henryb:  we are all sleepy: earlier Kerri Sanborn tried to analyze a hand played counter-clockwise|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: That would be a new sort of bridge, wouldn't it? Counter-clockwise play - maybe clockwise on even numbered boards and counter-clockwise on odd?|pg||
nt|baardolav: The bidding is near the limits now all ways and ended in 3@d NS|pg||
nt|mamos: rehi|pg||
nt|kirp:  hi everyone, looks like a simle 3N to make|pg||
pc|h5|nt|runnerup: if you guess hearts 5 @d makes ew but difficult to bid|pg||
nt|MarekW: http://www.poznan2011.pl/|pg||
nt|snorre: Hi all and welcome to 2nd RR, EU Poznan|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kit: Auction started exactly same way, but South bid 2NT and cold game was reached|pg||
nt|jaapfr: gm all|pg||
pc|hA|nt|andreasw:  5 @d makes but not to bid:-)|pg||
nt|baardolav: Two single red kings onside|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|riccho:  hi everybody; hope to see some exciting boards here|pg||
nt|mamos: a nice easy 3Nt  while you all settle down  get your drinks organised  settle the cat down or whatever|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|runnerup: so this is good save anyway |pg||
nt|ntmon: 3@D showed fit but @CQ seems useless, so no further interest by E|pg||
nt|snorre: Running score all matches: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/orrrunda2.html|pg||
nt|snorre: 1st Round: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/orrleaderb.html|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kit: 9 of diamonds discouraging, so likely will find heart shift to hold to 4.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|baardolav: yes 5@d make doubledummy, find the single @d king|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|s2|nt|tihana: nice lead directing 3@C|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 9 tricks for sure|pg||
nt|hajru:  This looks like a cold 3NT.  |pg||
pc|s4|nt|henryb:  The drawback to responding with Boyd's hand is the few hands where it goes 1@d-1@h-2N-P-P-X|pg||
nt|snorre: Hi all and welcome to 1st round Robin EU from Poznan, Poland. |pg||
pc|sT|nt|kit: pretty rare to get doubled in 2NT Henry|pg||
nt|henryb:  the advantage is that sometimes the opponents miss a game|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Weichsel went to the bathroom while he was dummy so we're now waiting for him |pg||
nt|henryb:  There was a creative player in NY by the name of Larry Edwards who believed strongly that the auctions 2N-P-P and 1X-1Y-2N-P-P should always be doubled|pg||
nt|baardolav: 3@d should make easaly, prob +1|pg||
nt|riccho:  in the first session only the last three boards from team "Zimmermann" prevented them from being far behind|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|hajru:  Is east mrs. Duboin?  |pg||
nt|vugraphpl4: we need to shut down|pg||
nt|vugraphpl4: we will back in the moment|pg||
nt|blum1956: the best lead by Anna Gulevich, the contract must go 1 off|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Weichsel is back - asked about the result and then "is 3N cold?" Lair: "yes" Weichsel: "what was your hand" Lair told him|pg||

nt|Walddk7: Hello Tihana, Jon and Vladimir. Have fun|pg||
nt|mamos: slam making here|pg||
mb|1D|nt|snorre: The Norwegians play transfers after opening 1@c, so 1@d show 4+ @h's|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: hi|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kit: Weichsel will have to bid 2@H -- then what?|pg||
nt|henryb:  he redoubled for 1230|pg||
nt|kit: Probably 2NT by Lair|pg||
nt|andreasw:  here close 28-29|pg||
nt|mamos: big hands for NS|pg||
nt|kastan88: slam time|pg||
nt|mamos: slam in Blacks|pg||
nt|snorre: Dbl= 4+ @s's|pg||
nt|kirp:  thx to 2 2 trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: efficient bid by N|pg||
nt|tihana: even 3 sp is too high|pg||
nt|tihana: hi|pg||
nt|jbgood: unlucky in a way to locate the heart fit|pg||
nt|ntmon: hi Jon|pg||
nt|jbgood: 3@s now?|pg||
nt|tihana: how many tricks in hs make?|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|kit: good decision to pass -- and now E-W may get in trouble|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Strange 1 NT - open 1 @D and bid @C|pg||
nt|baardolav: pony 29, calandra 28|pg||
nt|andreasw:  2 nt showing - 15-17?|pg||
nt|baardolav: not sure, they might play strong club too|pg||
nt|mamos: yeah not sure you want to bid it  but ten board matches |pg||
nt|mamos: mean to win you need to go for it|pg||
mb|4C|nt|henryb:  North passed, East bid 2H|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  back up Jan|pg||
nt|ntmon: S may feel too strong for a simple splinter|pg||
nt|riccho:  NS are two wellknown players from france; both of them winning numerous national and international titles. |pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  @H-shift holds to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|stc: 5@d : -500, so a good save|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But only South bid @D...|pg||
nt|stc: :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Another reason to open1 @D|pg||
nt|stc: 5@s by N is also cold|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not with @H-shift, I told you, morning|pg||
nt|ntmon: actually 12 tricks depends on @D suit, bidding slam is not totally out of question|pg||
nt|ntmon: many will prefer 1NT by N|pg||
nt|ntmon: that would lead to a partscore|pg||
nt|andreasw:  kibbitzers told me - they play Polish club|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Flat asa pancake - slam a mile off.|pg||
nt|snorre: Allan Livgaard (south) is captain for the Norwegian ladies Teams|pg||
nt|snorre: sry, this is his brother, henrik|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mcarroll: A lot depends on the lead here - a @S would set up discards.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: No hope now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i miss why W bids 2@S and not 1@S|pg||
nt|andreasw:  10-11 tricks|pg||
nt|baardolav: Sementa hit the best lead|pg||
nt|riccho:  EW are not known to me, but hopefully michael can held here ...|pg||
nt|riccho:  help; sry IÂ´m a typomaster ... :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: of course, game has 5 top losers|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes:-)|pg||
nt|snorre: My rule is this one: "I bid all the slams that make.."|pg||
nt|kirp:  4@H by S in some partnerships would be Last Train, not Q|pg||
nt|snorre: North must go on with heart-controll...  south is unlimited|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Particularly if Lair reopens with a double|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Better? My connection's been very good here, so I've stopped looking to make sure the passes register |pg||
nt|kit: This will not be pretty, that's for sure|pg||
nt|stc: yes, u r right|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: Robinson asks about signals: "standard but odd/even first discard"|pg||
nt|ntmon: 3NT non-serious?|pg||
nt|snorre: on other hand: kxx i worst holding. pd dont need to have Q|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hawe45:  Over - but West might even be single @H...|pg||
nt|jbgood: looks like it |pg||
nt|snorre: Great bidding by NS...|pg||
nt|kirp:  thats why Last Train was invented, to show extras|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ppiglett: Expect a diamond lead - J9xx usually give a trick in this situation|pg||
nt|mamos: not bid in OR we see|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kit: cashing ace of hearts seems clear|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: maybe not that clear?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think declarer can emerge with 6 tricks|pg||
nt|ntmon: N shows 18+ range, S might be interested|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if W shows only 4 card @S then why E 4@S:)?|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|tihana: Wild Griffins are on 5th place now, Jacob on 7th|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ntmon: there are variations of 2@D enquiry, some of them showing 4M5m - then bidding slam would be easier|pg||
nt|jbgood: of course 6@h is a good slam - only going down on a foul trump split|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|nt|jcomyn: oh a change|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|kit: 6 looks easy -- it is  7 I'm wondering about|pg||
nt|danilo1: Good morning all|pg||
nt|jcomyn: morning danilo|pg||
nt|mareczek: Hallo everybody from Poznan|pg||
nt|jaapfr: am I in the right room:)?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ntmon: 3NT non-serious says: i am not that strong for taking initiative, but i don't want rob you of space for investigation|pg||
nt|tihana: Yan is serious :)|pg||
nt|ntmon: taking initiative :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: he thought he could beat 6 NT too|pg||
nt|jbgood: not unreasonable|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|nt|kirp:  N overbid slightly with 3@S jump and then pulled back|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|henryb:  can I worry about eight?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jcomyn: dunno are u|pg||
nt|danilo1: :)|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 2 imp gain for Rossard here and the lead changes hands|pg||
nt|riccho:  thr lead made the contract comfortable for declarer|pg||
nt|mamos: one would expect a flat board at this level|pg||
nt|snorre: Excellent played by Mr. Versace..   South has to be careful now...|pg||
nt|snorre: I have seen MANY mistakes by using last train. Slam and opp starts with AK. Only Exclusion Blackwood has made worse disasters|pg||

nt|tihana: y, and unfort you cant run to 6d from 6h|pg||
nt|jbgood: running scores: http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/swrunda5.html|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not a good contract obviously hands too flat|pg||
nt|andreasw:  30-28 now|pg||
nt|mamos: wel done all|pg||
nt|snorre: Open Teams Round Robin have both excellent teams, "normal" ones and teams where you and I can join...   |pg||
nt|kirp:  agree with you somewhat|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  But in fact, -650 is better for E/W than -620 - then they doÂ´nt think about the 500-sacrifice|pg||
nt|stc: strange things...|pg||
nt|ntmon: perhaps now (@H partscore)|pg||
nt|tihana: 0 scores there, are they playing or what?|pg||
nt|kirp:  Actually 3N by S, assuming that is forcing would be better bid|pg||
nt|mamos: but Exclusion errors are usualy more amusing  -- lol for others|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ntmon: as many as 15IMP|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and the now-normal 4-1 break. seems to me these days you have to cater for a 4-1 break and bid accordibly|pg||
nt|snorre: At the end of the Round-robin the first  3 teams from each group will qualify for Swiss A and the other teams for Swiss B|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: here NS must open the @Ds quite fast|pg||
nt|danilo1: 4@S may be inetersting ... but what will be really played?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: nver get there|pg||
nt|mamos: so yes  you are right snorre the standard will be varied but we have two top class teams here|pg||
mb|2S|nt|hawe45:  Or play themselves|pg||
nt|riccho:  interesting to see, that at bd1 N opened with 1@H. An opening that even in a limited system would be hardly everybodies choice|pg||
nt|riccho:  this contract is difficult to beat (but not impossible)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Question is how Lair should raise here|pg||
nt|runnerup: this is 4 @s with  @h guess once again ,but first you have to bid it|pg||
nt|andreasw:  4@s now for sure|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Very Baggy 4S bid with nine trick in the hand. |pg||
nt|riccho:  yes but dummy has no effective trick at all|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  why wouldn't Lair raise right away?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: this makes more sense|pg||
nt|henryb:  would 2@c be forcing here?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: EW may protect and get to a @S patrtscore?|pg||
nt|danilo1: 2@C as expected ... anyone for Dbling minors as North?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: double again|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 1@S - for the lead partner|pg||
nt|baardolav: Very light overbids|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes:-)|pg||
nt|baardolav: Not my style... |pg||
nt|andreasw:  lol|pg||
nt|baardolav: need to finesse the @d Q to make|pg||
nt|baardolav: and get rid of one club from the closed hand|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kit: so will probably reach the doomed 4@S contract|pg||
nt|henryb:  sorry, I missed the correction|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Weichsel writes that 2@h = limit raise and Boyd wrote something back that isn't where I can read it|pg||
nt|riccho:  @s 10 would be a nice-to-have-card at dummy|pg||
nt|snorre: I know these Norwegians. They are good, but they dont play at highest level in Noway..|pg||
nt|snorre: 4@s can maybe win here, but normal to stop in partscore...|pg||
nt|kirp:  keep it simple, is a good rule for Balckwood|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ntmon: 2@S nat game-forcing|pg||
nt|danilo1: he passed, so maybe best action after pd's Rdble is to Dble ... even if made, 2m is not bad|pg||
pc|dA|nt|runnerup: looks like partscore can be made both direction perhaps |pg||
nt|jbgood: one thing I know for sure - NS will not be bothered by the last board|pg||
nt|baardolav: Calandra have some thoughts about this... Spade need to be 2-2 or H single|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|stc: can he guess the K@c ?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  After the bidding, he might - if East shows the @D Ace|pg||
nt|stc: yes, but he will play trump before @d|pg||
nt|ntmon: in my book X over 2@D would be T/O for @H but hand not strong enough|pg||
nt|jbgood: (neither will EW:))|pg||
nt|danilo1: 3@S at least North|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and 4 from s|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kit: Of course, it isn't 100$ clear for Boyd to continue diamonds when he leads the ace|pg||
nt|henryb:  If 2N was natural, I would think that ten fifth of opener's suit would be a turnoff|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sure|pg||
nt|snorre: If south goes for games with these hands, they will go down in numbers of contracts...|pg||
nt|snorre: end with 9 tricks, I think|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kit: I can picture hands where heart shift necessary.  But bidding might help him.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Lair: "good luck"|pg||
nt|kit: They do play udca, so 6 won't be readable|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes in club system no big problems to bid,but natural not so easy |pg||
nt|ntmon: 4@S is good contract, will require get @H right|pg||
pc|h7|nt|riccho:  Bd2: 4@s would have been a fairly good contract; I would expect the other tabel to be in 4@s|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kit: Moment of truth right now|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jcomyn: aggressive|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not a good lead|pg||
nt|danilo1: well, Dble by Guido was expected ... but not sure about the lead|pg||
nt|jcomyn: making now with good guess|pg||
nt|danilo1: I still rather beleieve in down|pg||
nt|jcomyn: why look at it just play J|pg||
nt|danilo1: do not believe she can avoid 2 trump loosers as well as 2 red Aces|pg||
nt|jcomyn: maybe so|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but why the long pause when the j is mandatory|pg||
pc|c2|nt|riccho:  anyone has an idea whcih system EW play? |pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|stc: any making becuase of @h 4-2|pg||
nt|stc: anyway|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I agree|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Despite the combined 22 count this is not an easy contract - particularly on this @C lead|pg||
nt|tihana: and go down in both directions :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|tihana: hm|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mcarroll: so a lose-lose situation :)|pg||
nt|tihana: or win-win for the defence :)|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Carding for n-S very important now.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|henryb:  truth and concequences|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|stc: and @d frienly, 3-3 with the 10 showing up|pg||
nt|baardolav: The first hand opening... have shown K of spade, QJ of club and |pg||
pc|dK|nt|kit: he got it right -- key was Weichsel's 2NT call -- would be unlikely with doubleton diamond|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mcarroll: glass half-full, half empty??|pg||
pc|hT|nt|baardolav: the @d Q... very well done|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|c6|nt|riccho:  S ist not allowed to throw a heart|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|nt|hawe45:  East should be 6-2-3-2 now|pg||
nt|andreasw:  10 tricks wd|pg||
nt|riccho:  according to some kibs EW play some sort of polish club; 1@c is than a WK NT or medium club or strong any (some play it less than GF) |pg||
nt|blum1956: Ìàõ Êhven played for Russia many times, including the 2004 Olympiad (3th place). His partner (and wife) Anna Gulevich is 36-th rated in the rating-list (which includes men) and has ...|pg||
nt|blum1956: a Russian mixed teams wins to her credit|pg||
nt|blum1956: EW play the "Beriozka" system (based on Polish club) which is rather popular in Russia|pg||
nt|riccho:  typical polish style is that the 1NT rebid after the neg. 1@d is  a 18-20 BAL type of hand; with 12-14 in polish club they regularly are faking with 1@h or 1@s even with lesse than a 4carder|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|pc|s9|nt|riccho:  <sgh> so I should have known EW than ... :(|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|nt|riccho:  Oh she can throw one|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ntmon: surprise|pg||
nt|blum1956: 1@c is weak NT (12-14) or strong (17-18+) any|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|runnerup: so miss guessed -1|pg||
pc|sA|nt|danilo1: West bid 2@C ... so he has 4 ... East who reopened therefore only 2 @C (possible single/double Q) - so @CJ has not been absolute mandatory ... however, good guess|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s4|nt|riccho:  so without the medium club stuff in it...|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|riccho:  if partner plays @d|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ntmon: good @H return|pg||
nt|riccho:  well done|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Well done. These situations can go astray. Not at this level though.|pg||

nt|runnerup: so 200 it was a good  desision to pass 1 @h|pg||

mb|p|nt|jbgood: so all of a sudden it is all square|pg||

mb|1D!|nt|henryb:  but the doubleton @d is a good sign|pg||

nt|riccho:  Oh I c they lowered the req for str 1@c comparing to ploish club than.|pg||
nt|snorre: 3Nt possible to win here. |pg||
nt|mamos: not much excitement so far to be true|pg||
mb|d|mb|1S|nt|tihana: i think both 3n and 5 cl make, yes?|pg||

nt|kirp:  2 or 3@Hs with S ' hand|pg||
mb|2H|nt|snorre: Nice layout for EW...|pg||

nt|tihana: @H and m i guess|pg||
nt|jbgood: NS have 29 hcp combined - and EW are already in 3@hs :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: polish style?|pg||
nt|danilo1: looks like NS playing kind of Polish @C |pg||
nt|andreasw:  looks like one down|pg||
nt|blum1956: 1@c starting from good 16|pg||
nt|kirp:  ??|pg||
mb|4H|nt|kit: Looked like it would be a dull board, but 4@S was doubled in other room |pg||
nt|ntmon: 1 NT upgraded? but 3NT normal contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: this loks like 3nt but even here 14+11 -some pairs might miss this game -clubs all well and dimonds badly .but 9 tricks|pg||
nt|ntmon: due to lucky @C position, 9 tricks ready without needing @D|pg||
nt|ntmon: do we agree with 2@H or prefer negative X passed out?|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  If you play fantan around the corner, that is a really good suit|pg||
nt|ntmon: 3NT best but North could not know about @H position|pg||
nt|tihana: hmm, auken goes strong|pg||
mb|p|pc|s3|nt|riccho:  how comfortable to commentate french players. every bid is cristal clear here |pg||
nt|mamos: never refuse an invitation|pg||
nt|mamos: 3@h for me|pg||
nt|kirp:  11 or 12 trix|pg||
pc|s2|nt|riccho:  xcept sometimes... In the first segment there was a 2@hX contract, which succeeded but shouldnt|pg||
nt|mamos: but close|pg||
pc|s5|nt|stc: they need at least one good guess in @h@s|pg||
nt|hawe45:  If West later shows the @S Ace, East must have the @H Queen|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ThatÂ´s NO guess|pg||
nt|tihana: making 4?|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|mcarroll: proving yet again that bridge is a bidder's game|pg||
nt|kirp:  thats what you get when you underlead A, no one can figure it out|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jbgood: seems as if NS should stay out of slams this set|pg||
pc|h9|nt|hawe45:  Another @C is correct defence|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Why help declarer?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hawe45:  Might have killed K-10-x|pg||
nt|snorre: If EW play 15-17NT's, 2NT with 10 is hard.. At most 24 hcp. East liked his Q109 @h's|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|nt|blum1956: which does not help to buy a makeable contract this time))))|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|stc: A@s KQ@c and Q@h = 11|pg||
nt|ntmon: going for @D seems percentage action - bad luck |pg||
nt|runnerup: last board was plyed in 2nt inspite off 5-4 in @s but 180 was +6  imps because missguess here in 4 @s|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I prefer the neg X which may be passed out, but it may also lead to 3NT |pg||
nt|ntmon: seems that Auken explained herself the absence of 3NT bid by N as positive signal (no stopper, no vastage) |pg||
pc|cK|nt|riccho:  In Bd. 2 I was wrong with my prediction (they reached 4@s but they didnt play it) because EW found the "sacrifice" in 5@h |pg||
nt|riccho:  put away the "" from last sentence... |pg||
pc|c3|nt|danilo1: not good guess in @S|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|stc: not now|pg||
nt|hawe45:  There is a rule: Only ONE opponent can have @S Ace...|pg||
nt|runnerup: y a common convention helps to bid if partner doesn't delive that south bid his cards allready  |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|tihana: looks like missunderstanding on board 2 in other room|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mamos: declarer has nine tricks as everthing is well placed  i back him to make|pg||
nt|mamos: its not easy and these discards inconvenience him|pg||
nt|snorre: These hands are easier to play for us kib's. We see that all cards are well placed. Versace doesn't...|pg||
pc|c5|nt|stc: and the other the Q¨h|pg||
nt|runnerup: this time you make yhis anyway ,because clubs ao well|pg||
nt|ntmon: S doesn't have an entry for his high @D |pg||
nt|baardolav: one down it will be I belive|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|c6|nt|danilo1: but logical ... after 1@C and 1@H by north and 2@S pass by South, more probable South has 3@S than North|pg||
pc|s6|nt|runnerup: east very much afraid ,but relieved in the end|pg||
nt|riccho:  @sQ|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ntmon: last train :)|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|blum1956: no entries to collect everything|pg||
nt|riccho:  this hand: fairly normal to reach game; the EW hands are not very suitable placed|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cT|nt|mcarroll: Which may make - there are 9 tricks available but it is difficult for declarer to untangle the entries required|pg||
nt|baardolav: Gotart is not intending to do any mistakes and cashes the tricks|pg||
pc|dT|nt|jcomyn: and the poor-aul club suit gets buried again|pg||

nt|henryb:  Probably does not expect partner to have such robust majors for 3@d|pg||
nt|ntmon: S afraid of T/O X expecting to be passed out|pg||
nt|tihana: 2N by W would be scrambling?|pg||

nt|jcomyn: what happend the tried and trusted longest and strongest|pg||
nt|snorre: South can be much weaker, so west thought of entering the bidding...|pg||
nt|mamos: South busy thanking North for his dummy:)|pg||
nt|snorre: when I have D108x behind declearer and pd has a strong NT, I stand on table doubling!!!|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kit: If they do stumble into slam, a lot will ride on the lead|pg||
nt|henryb:  and it will depend on whether they play in a minor or NT|pg||
nt|kit: I think they are in slam after this Q-bid|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Interesting - on the previous hand 3@H went down one in OR|pg||
nt|mamos: 1NT balancing  not necessary strong|pg||
nt|snorre: even a weak one...|pg||
nt|snorre: 1NT 4th hand: 11-14 it seams. |pg||
nt|kirp:  also helps pard on defense, knowing you have something|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|stc: friendly @s and blocked @ds help a lot|pg||

pc|h3|nt|andreasw:  no q@s|pg||
nt|ppiglett: I really like 4D - showing source of tricks for pard and giving help to judge the hand if ops save at fav vul.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|stc: playing on @s looks better, the 10 may be short|pg||

nt|kirp:  this was a nice chance for EW|pg||
nt|kirp:  Dummy's red 9's are now important|pg||
nt|snorre: Board 14: Lost of nice rele-bidding in closed room. Ending i 5@h, told opp the lead and down one for -11..   |pg||
nt|mamos: Dutch NS got to 5@h on 14 and after a @D lead lost three tricks and ten imps  maybe too much exitement|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kit: Lair went conservative|pg||
nt|henryb:  we are looking at 4 hands, Kit. I am surprised they got pat 3N|pg||
nt|ntmon: 8 tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|ntmon: W in other rooms was more dynamic|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes 8 only -beacuse  @h ruff so some chances to make 9 in clubs so-|pg||
nt|baardolav: well even easier... now I would like +2 |pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|kit: 5@D is really a pretty poor contract compared to 3NT, but it will make|pg||
nt|kit: I agree Henry.  Both took unclear views -- Weichsel might have bid 2@C instead of 3@C, Lair might have bid 3NT instead of 3@D, and Weichsel might have bid 3@S instead of 4@C.|pg||
nt|danilo1: no entries for @C lead ... but on any lead, declarer has enought time to develop 2@S tricks - so allways making ... |pg||
nt|jcomyn: and like the club, d opening denies d suit by the looks of things|pg||
nt|danilo1: good choice 3NT instead 4@H, may be swing board|pg||
pc|c7|nt|hawe45:  Tries the @C-suit, but wins through the @S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This seems wrong. Try @C 3-3 - and then @S. By starting with @D, opponents might just take their 5 tricks|pg||
nt|hawe45:  starting with @S... sry|pg||
nt|runnerup: 4 spades you seems to have too bad suit and too much defensive values|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||
nt|kirp:  still looks like down 3 or maybe more|pg||
nt|kirp:  S went quietly in OR, passed 1N |pg||
pc|d5|nt|kirp:  now maybe more|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|mcarroll: depends on how @H are played - but no real choice - so yes it makes|pg||
nt|andreasw:  rest now:-) |pg||
nt|mamos: yes just thinking I might organise coffee :)|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|stc: start with @s is normal, the A@S may be an entry for @d|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Never seen so bad play - with such a good result. Now even an end-play against West|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dJ|nt|stc: the play is bad only if E has exactly ADxxx of @d|pg||
nt|jbgood: look at Versace's 1 spade inbid on   2 - and you will see why this match is swingy|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d4|pg||
nt|ntmon: 7 tricks only becauseof 2 @D S entries - well defended|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kirp:  2@C looked hopeless to me, after passed pard, and 2-2 in red suits|pg||
pc|cK|nt|riccho:  the edgy contract of 4@s in Bd. 3 a this table earned 10 imps for the russian team|pg||
pc|c8|pc|h6|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cT|nt|stc: but think at @d 4-3 and @c 4-2, loosing 3@d 1@s 1@c|pg||
nt|jcomyn: c,c,c and maybe the s 9 is an entry|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h5|pg||
nt|mcarroll: this needs an endplay for the 9th trick|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|henryb:  Steve would have done better to return a @s|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jbgood: just part of the reason of course...|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|hawe45:  No - suppose West has the @C-lenght, what should you loose by checking the @C-suit - and you might have 9 ice-cold tricks|pg||

nt|henryb:  but it would only have turned a quick hand into a slow one|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @H-lead would have been interesting|pg||
nt|ntmon: something N has to have finally|pg||
nt|tihana: i got some comments regarding w 1nt, i think it is ok, you?|pg||
nt|danilo1: @S9 is entry too late ... since @C is then 9th trick ... so declarer would on @C lead need only 1 @S trick|pg||
nt|jcomyn: righto all|pg||
nt|andreasw:  13 tricks from the very beginning:-)|pg||
nt|snorre: 10 tricks?|pg||
nt|kirp:  ucky, it could have been worse with dble card|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: as I said, starting with @c may establish the 5th trick for defense with @d 4-3|pg||
nt|andreasw:  41-35|pg||
nt|snorre: First IMP to Norway maybe?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Will certainly get to 3NT, but if overcall gets heart lead things could get interesting|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Lair: "did you have a jump shift partner?" Weichsel: "a light jump shift" Lair: "very light" Weichsel: "not really, because I made it because of the spots" Boyd: "true"|pg||
nt|ntmon: no problem with 1NT|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i did say maybe|pg||
nt|mamos: imp rather tha imps snorre?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|runnerup: well defended ,but board still cost you 9 because your team mates were too aggressive|pg||
nt|runnerup: slam zone -this time  @c easyest|pg||
nt|baardolav: polish club from N|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes|pg||
nt|snorre: I said "IMP", didn't I ?  :)|pg||
nt|mamos: it was certainly ucky|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mamos: :)|pg||
mb|2N|nt|baardolav: is this ending in 6nt? on 32 hp...|pg||
nt|andreasw:  6 clubs makes... but not easy to bid|pg||
nt|riccho:  and 2@h from W is no common bid here either|pg||
nt|vugraphpl4: sorry|pg||
nt|ppiglett: True - I play against those sort of hoodwinkers too|pg||
nt|kirp:  usually bad to trap with a 8-card fit at 2-level, but here is an exception|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: not the worst bid I have seen...|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Surely South didn't pass. Undo?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|kit: Tough choice for Robinson on opening lead, particularly in light of 1@C opening|pg||
nt|henryb:  I guess he is cold now|pg||
nt|kit: he is?  are you sure?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Weichsel: "I hope you're not banking on my club suit"|pg||
nt|henryb:  3@h, 3@d and 3 black tricks|pg||
nt|kit: does he really have 3 hearts?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Weichsel has gone out of the room and there's no one to turn the dummy - Robinson suggests I ask one of you to do it please|pg||
nt|ntmon: 7 or 8 tricks doesn't mean a difference|pg||
nt|runnerup: here ew has to stay low 1 nt looks ok|pg||
nt|tihana: would y bid sth else?|pg||
nt|baardolav: 6nt too|pg||
nt|baardolav: North hand|pg||
nt|riccho:  2NT nat.? vs an unlimited opener of 1@c looks a bit... well ....|pg||
nt|chmitty: hummm ... indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|tihana: strange bid 3cl, should south show strong balance?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: a David Bird deal-em-again hand|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes - good spades...|pg||
nt|ppiglett: No prob |pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: game should be reached|pg||
nt|mamos: defence should prevail here|pg||
nt|mamos: trump leads are best |pg||
nt|snorre: I like to play Michaels in this positions as "Weak or strong". NS have no idea of how strong (or weak) pd is|pg||
nt|snorre: If strong, have to bid once more. Then North can bid 2@h and end there...|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: misfit but enough points|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Good lead - for declarer|pg||
nt|stc: and the most friendly lead|pg||
nt|ntmon: multi-purpose club and transfer responses in use|pg||
nt|mamos: 2NT = showing three card Spades support?|pg||
nt|kirp:  and good raise|pg||
pc|d7|nt|stc: now many tricks|pg||
nt|ntmon: NS helped opps to devaluate their hands here|pg||
nt|jbgood: this may well be a push|pg||
nt|andreasw:  2@h relay probably|pg||
nt|kirp:  good lead, low from dblton|pg||
nt|snorre: lots of work to do here for Muller...|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|henryb:  I think so|pg||
nt|ntmon: X for penalty|pg||
nt|andreasw:  46-35|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kit: okay, now he is cold|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Especially, if E/W duck another @D|pg||
nt|runnerup: well north wked up -is it right ? -perhaps -200 |pg||
nt|andreasw:  4 NT quantitative ?|pg||
nt|riccho:  np; this operating stuff is very difficult to do|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|ppiglett: The singelton ten fo spades is a huge card. A little luck for N-S.|pg||
nt|kirp:  things lie well, but still handling problems|pg||
nt|mamos: yep not great as cards lie|pg||
pc|d8|nt|runnerup: jump in clubs doent look the way to desripe this hand all thought it make it easy to bid 6--but is it forcing even|pg||
nt|chmitty: next door, it will start 1@c 1@d 1@s but what next ? 2NT 3@d 3NT ... or 2NT 3NT|pg||
nt|riccho:  and the lead of the @sJ is sth I wouldnt have found either|pg||
nt|chmitty: in any case I suspect they will end up in 3NT|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|nt|henryb:  How do you prevent 3 heart tricks, Kit?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Oh - wasÂ´nt ducked|pg||
nt|andreasw:  6 clubs now - but why not bid 4 @d?|pg||
nt|baardolav: 750 on stake... pass or 6@c|pg||
nt|andreasw:  what is 2@c on 1 @c??|pg||
nt|baardolav: natural I belive|pg||
nt|chmitty: I like @sJ|pg||
nt|blum1956: 2NT is just too weak for the hand of that type, the few-pointed 3NT will be often missed|pg||
nt|mamos: this is not a good start for the defence|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|kit: so 10 very badly needed IMPs for Lynch|pg||
nt|tihana: my gib says it will make :)|pg||
nt|baardolav: pos 8+HP and 5+ @c|pg||
nt|blum1956: I guess EW play 1@c-2@d as GF|pg||
nt|riccho:  just what N needed without it 4@h would probably a better contract|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Yes much better.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kit: I guess you really can't|pg||
nt|tihana: got explanation: NS plays kind of Polish club so 3@c shows 17+ with 5+@c and 0-2@s|pg||
nt|mcarroll: looks like @C set as trump, now will they go for the pairs 6NT or the safer 6@C?|pg||
nt|tihana: 6CL, wanna bet?|pg||
nt|runnerup: ns can not be a choice 6  @h perhaps can|pg||
nt|runnerup: nt -not really sensibal|pg||
nt|danilo1: good @CK position ... so EW need to cash @H to hold declarer on 7 tricks|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes - but points? nevermind - slam is on:-)|pg||
nt|baardolav: 1@d is 0-7|pg||
nt|andreasw:  46-37|pg||
nt|andreasw:  kibb told med - 2 clubs is game force|pg||
nt|baardolav: Natural gf yeah|pg||
nt|andreasw:  me|pg||
nt|chmitty: the theory is : against limited hands (2NT shows that) your lead should be neutral|pg||
nt|snorre: Worst lead for EW....|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ntmon: looks -2|pg||
nt|mamos: Spades are favorable but ..|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mcarroll: I agree|pg||
nt|tihana: shit|pg||
nt|tihana: sorrrry|pg||
nt|runnerup: even this can go off|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|tihana: ok, at least we will have a swing|pg||
nt|baardolav: well done|pg||
nt|kirp:  thats about all that is|pg||
nt|kirp:  think E overbid here, with q@H|pg||
nt|kirp:  and bad trumps|pg||
nt|snorre: he has some trick in spades and @h Ace..  Don't think that will be enough for ten of them.|pg||
nt|mamos: and perhaps West's raise was not sooooo good|pg||
nt|kirp:  somesort of game try in @Cs maybe would have worked better|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ntmon: EW will negotiate @H ruff but not much more|pg||
nt|andreasw:  heart lead?|pg||
nt|baardolav: 1370 it is should be made in one flash when the @c finesse make... and K drops. There is not a play for 1390 because of single @d in east|pg||
nt|riccho:  the lead is interesting in a positive way. |pg||
pc|s8|nt|ntmon: this may not be good - defensive ruffs available|pg||
nt|baardolav: @d lead|pg||
nt|andreasw:  youre right Baard!!!|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|kit: nice 7 of diamonds play if he really did it, which he might well have done|pg||
nt|runnerup: so 300 with rosruffes|pg||
nt|tihana: my gib says he didnt find|pg||
nt|mamos: and East needs to defend carefully now|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|henryb:  so 460|pg||
nt|kirp:  N is not sure, a trump or @H, as endplay coming for S|pg||
nt|kirp:  ruff a @D and S to play?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|danilo1: well, 8 tricks now|pg||
nt|snorre: well done so far by Muller...|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|nt|chmitty: good for you !|pg||
nt|snorre: Hammans 2nd rule: "If u have a singelton, lead it.."|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|snorre: endplayed for 1st time... more to come?|pg||
nt|mamos: South will do very well to get this down now|pg||
nt|mamos: has to exit Heart|pg||
nt|kirp:  a @D would have worked slightly better|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Vugraphzfb: short break|pg||
nt|henryb:  The ladies' match is over. Joel leading by 84.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: indeed|pg||
pc|h2|nt|riccho:  the 2NT is interesting in a negative way (at least thats my feeling about that...)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|tihana: hmm|pg||
nt|mamos: oops   i think this will make now|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jbgood: a clever return - now it is at least 1 down|pg||
pc|c8|nt|chmitty: agrre lol :)|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c6|pg||
pc|d5|nt|snorre: Board 4 ended like I supposed in Open: 1@c-1@d-1@s-1NT..   balanced 24hcp normally down i 3NT, but not this time. Antother 9 IMP for Italy|pg||
pc|dT|nt|chmitty: agree|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h3|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes this is a nervy one, needs 4 tricks from Majors so must finesse, @H more dangerous and @S a 2 way guess - on the theory of vacant spaces - trusting W for longer @Ds than E, it ...|pg||
nt|mcarroll: looks right to play E for the @SQ - which works|pg||
nt|runnerup: perhaps J @d woud have helped to avoid this acsident (spade switch)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kirp:  now 2 @C losers|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mamos: It's also true that after a "two-suiter auction"  that a trump lead will  be required - Club lead seemed odd here |pg||
nt|snorre: Muller now play for Axx in clubs by south|pg||
pc|h4|pc|sT|pg||

nt|runnerup: ns slam zone in @s but ew can then bid 7 clubs -ok not here and perhaps only teoria|pg||
nt|ntmon: trump lead indicated|pg||
nt|ntmon: my yesterday fellow commenator - a lady - told: we are going to see a lot of contract played by W and N|pg||
nt|danilo1: if 1@D 4 (looks like), why not?|pg||
nt|riccho:  Yesterday Id seen a russian pair which bid 1@c (p) 2@d with sth like x Axx KQJx Qxxxx (AFAIR)|pg||
nt|chmitty: actually 7@d may be not so great|pg||
nt|chmitty: you can't ruff a Spade AND cash the 4 @c tricks|pg||
nt|chmitty: so you are down to the @s finesse more or less|pg||
nt|riccho:  so u have to rely on the @s finesse|pg||
nt|riccho:  :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: or some king of squeeze|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|ntmon: but EW might doubled at 5th level  already if they find clubs|pg||

pc|h3|nt|henryb:  although both are simple|pg||

nt|oosb: some very exciting boards this set|pg||
nt|snorre: 3@h just preemptiv in my world...|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ntmon: from any holding :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: True - and effective|pg||
nt|blum1956: Just not enough HCP for 7@d|pg||

pc|hK|nt|danilo1: y mean North? ... Dble is OK ... he has max and M 4-cards|pg||
nt|riccho:  thats the simple way of avooding grand slam... |pg||

pc|s2|nt|ntmon: EW should scramble 8 tricks|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|runnerup: so something can happen in this board in many matches |pg||
nt|runnerup: really -how wrong i was|pg||
nt|riccho:  the lead will make the play fast at least|pg||
nt|ppiglett: I remamber days when the East hand was condered not good enough to open a weak 2! Pre-empts are for prempting is my view. Chacun a son gout!|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|jbgood: for the first time I have received comments from kibs supporting the seating rule - of course there are different opinions :)|pg||

nt|oosb: looks 2 down to me|pg||
pc|s4|nt|stc: 11 easy tricks now|pg||
pc|sK|nt|runnerup: perhaps wets should bid 2nt to show both minors|pg||
nt|oosb: 2@C 1@h to come|pg||
nt|andreasw:  club ruff|pg||
nt|snorre: spades from west when he win clubs, and east can not be endplayed..|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Now 450|pg||
nt|stc: if defense starts with 2 rounds of @h declarer will be very worried :(|pg||
nt|jcomyn: add up the hcp partner cant have anything|pg||
nt|snorre: North can tell by his spaded which suit he wants pd to play|pg||
nt|mamos: another test for NS|pg||
nt|kirp:  trump lead rated not to work here,|pg||
nt|mamos: North has played smallest Spades|pg||
nt|snorre: 34: Play clubs pls|pg||
nt|kirp:  awake or asleep?|pg||
nt|snorre: If pd has @d king and east EK clubs, @d is correct now|pg||
nt|snorre: A spade less and AKx @c's|pg||
nt|kirp:  if pard has @D K, he should have played higher spades|pg||
nt|mamos: yes Snorre that was what I was thinking   -- again South will deserve praise for Club here|pg||
nt|snorre: that is what I am trying to say...   :)|pg||
nt|mamos: well not just South  North too because we think he has beeen trying to help|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mcarroll: the curse of the commentator|pg||
nt|jbgood: looks like an attempt to present declarer with a Greec gift|pg||
nt|tihana: well, no matter what seating rules are, men can play more hands if they intend to. Seating rules cant change someone bidding 3N on every occasion possible.|pg||
nt|andreasw:  not any longer|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mcarroll: will do now - continuing Trumps might have worked better|pg||
nt|ntmon: at least will give E un unpleasant guess|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jcomyn: i have alwsays been told when you bid 1nt thats it|pg||
nt|mamos: yes the danger here for East  - whether he knew it or not was in being endplayed but EW have avoided that  and the contract should be -1|pg||

nt|ntmon: the contract goes back and forth|pg||
nt|andreasw:  board 20 a tie...|pg||
nt|mamos: thats the second game in two boards that might have gone off - |pg||
nt|snorre: these problems are simple for us kib's..   :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jcomyn: classic passed out deal|pg||
nt|chmitty: interesting hand again : better avoid 5@c and play 3NT|pg||
nt|kirp:  4@H and 5@S looks like|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: even 3NT may win|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes it is bad contrack.but it cant be if it makes -can it?|pg||
nt|ntmon: huge lead, 25:4 so far|pg||
nt|ppiglett: A bit of action here I suspect!|pg||
mb|4H|nt|hawe45:  This is the board, where you can - bis mistake - bid 3 NT. Easy make|pg||
nt|ntmon: five push boards in a row|pg||
nt|riccho:  looks a bit like a bridge world challenge the champs hand ...|pg||
nt|kirp:  now will S balance with 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: lots of action elsewhere but pretty mundane here|pg||
nt|ntmon: strong clubs system :)|pg||
nt|snorre: "might" is a kind word...   :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: this looks like partscore battle -ew 10 in clubs-ns less in @h|pg||
nt|ntmon: a treatment now|pg||
nt|mareczek: South has the obvious opening|pg||
nt|oosb: that's some push! a lot of pairs stopped short of slam|pg||
nt|ppiglett: East will be wondering how big a number this could be when the board comes through!|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Oups|pg||
nt|ntmon: interesting how the bidding would develop w/o interference|pg||
nt|ntmon: now 2@S ?|pg||
nt|danilo1: do not believe ... North, East or South may open|pg||
nt|blum1956: Willard's overcall helps to stop in 3NT|pg||
nt|riccho:  true|pg||
nt|kirp:  hooray for Netherlands|pg||
nt|kirp:  they need some cheering|pg||
nt|mamos: this was a system win I think  very hard for NS|pg||
nt|kirp:  dble game swing for Neth|pg||
pc|d4|nt|henryb:  I'm a crawling Stayman bidder|pg||
nt|stc: and the ideal lead|pg||
nt|mcarroll: another Hamman hand?|pg||
nt|riccho:  even v-vs a heavy loaded 5@D "preempt"|pg||
nt|mamos: ty :)|pg||
nt|kirp:  club lead would at least have beaten it|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ntmon: 4@D ?|pg||
nt|chmitty: form East point of view that 2NT shows @h ace|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ntmon: 1@S already implied @D ?|pg||
nt|ntmon: bid in the same second|pg||
nt|tihana: is 4h by Sabine an option?|pg||
nt|mareczek: better to stay silent and be thought a fool than open your mouth and remove all doubt|pg||
nt|jcomyn: with the object of either going down or scoring 90|pg||
nt|mamos: I did think of typing might/should|pg||
nt|snorre: east knew pd had two spades at most, so of course he should have kept three of them...|pg||
nt|mamos: The Norwegians look like defeating 3@h on Board 6   so may be on the way to taking the lead here|pg||
nt|snorre: Find some more coffee, mamos..  A calm 1NT here... |pg||
nt|mamos: I'm a simple soul I'd have lead @d3 by now|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Switch to the @D King...|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 1 @H alerted - transfer, 2@C not alerted bur cannot be natural, |pg||
nt|chmitty: which is not good news for a @c slam|pg||
nt|riccho:  vs a WK NT hand the E hand doesnt look like a slaminviter anyway|pg||
pc|hA|nt|andreasw:  heart lead ? |pg||
nt|oosb: seems like a very reasonable contract|pg||
nt|blum1956: certainly|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jcomyn: who said that marek|pg||
nt|mareczek: "all in" lead by North|pg||
nt|jcomyn: you or aristotle|pg||
nt|oosb: cant lead @s after the 2@S bid|pg||
nt|andreasw:  spade bid prevented spade lead|pg||
nt|oosb: perfectly logical @h lead, just unlucky|pg||
nt|oosb: more than one way to get to 9 tricks now|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kit: Should Lair pass 2@D?  I think so.  4 diamonds more likely than 2.|pg||
nt|snorre: Think one down if EW play club after four times @d's.|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|stc: Q@s, 10@h, K@d and KQ@c, FIVE key cards on side !|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Bidding like this, you need it|pg||
nt|stc: but passing to the state of the match|pg||
nt|ntmon: theory (Garozzo i think said it) - against strong club, be as soon as possible at 3@S|pg||
nt|mareczek: both rooms opened 1@h with East|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ntmon: good competitive decision by W|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mcarroll: good sacrifice|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 8 tricks on top and little prospect of a 9th?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|runnerup: well found -minors are not easy to be found because they can be sorter than 4 when opened|pg||
nt|oosb: but @D 9 seems best|pg||
nt|snorre: or this way...   |pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|mamos: We are told not to bid on weak hands over pre-emptive openings   and hard for North to act over 4@h  and indeed for South  West has a huge variety of hand sfor this action|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|andreasw:  yes.much better|pg||
nt|baardolav: No direct entries for the @d suit|pg||
nt|oosb: but no entries now|pg||
nt|oosb: he actually wanted @D to lose, so he can set up a nice 2nd finesse and entry :) |pg||
nt|andreasw:  there will be|pg||
pc|s7|nt|henryb:  Earlier in this match Boyd- Robinson couldn't get out of 1N because they play puppet (I think) and went -100 in 1N with 3@s made at the other table|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h9|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Oups|pg||
nt|ntmon: preempting apparently works here w/o need to bid 4@H|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ntmon: with actual score, Couples shifted to the 1st place|pg||
nt|ntmon: helping lead|pg||
nt|oosb: this works |pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|pc|c3|pg||
nt|stc: %play knowing 4@h in S|pg||
nt|jbgood: 27 teams from the A-Swiss and 5 from the B go on to the KO stages - follow the exciting finish of this last round here: http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/swrunda5.html|pg||
nt|danilo1: looks  very possible third hand ... personally I would pass as North and East, but I would open as South|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Suit preference card - the 10 of clubs.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|riccho:  N should hav an easy task now to hold the @hq|pg||
pc|d9|nt|snorre: We are still waiting for Running score from all matches. A lot of teams, so they need some time to set up everything..   |pg||
pc|dT|pc|s2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  N/S or E/W?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes:-)'|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mcarroll: this would not work if W had anything in @Hs|pg||
nt|tihana: if Jacob switches to !J after club holds?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|henryb:  Its a question, I think, of how likely opener is to have two major suit doubletons|pg||
pc|s4|nt|tihana: diamond jack|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|hawe45:  S - OK|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Mistake, forget|pg||

nt|riccho:  another quick play lead...|pg||

nt|snorre: 3@h down 2 vs 4@h made on board 6....  11 for Norway|pg||
mb|1C|nt|stc: lol|pg||
nt|ntmon: so why do not do something in systems to recover?|pg||
nt|danilo1: 1 looks correct, but at this voulnerabilities, 4 may be rite action|pg||
nt|riccho:  presumably a 12-14 BAL or 16+ 1@c opener|pg||
nt|mamos: 6@h not exactly the obvious Slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosb: other room played 3@S in 21|pg||
nt|kirp:  Looks like 7@D makes here, wonder why 6@Hs in OR|pg||
mb|1S!|an|!h|nt|runnerup: ns has points but west distribution so perhaps 2 spades |pg||
nt|blum1956: As opposite to the previous hand, EW must play 5@c here|pg||
nt|blum1956: not 3NT|pg||
nt|chmitty: we can see there are some good reasons to do so from East's perspective|pg||
mb|d|nt|kit: 4@D might well make|pg||
nt|henryb:  Many of us are not convinced of 3N gambling as a good bid, because if 3N is right the wrong person will be playing it|pg||
nt|henryb:  I open 1@c with Steve's hand|pg||
nt|kit: Not sure what Weichsel is thinking -- maybe of raising, maybe wondering if 4@D is conventional|pg||
nt|riccho:  :) I c  the point |pg||
nt|snorre: and more to come for Norway on B7...|pg||
nt|mamos: these ten board matches fly past  - our penultimate board after about an hour|pg||
nt|mamos: I think EW play relay methods|pg||
mb|p!|nt|henryb:  and rebid 2@c and 3@c|pg||
nt|henryb:  or 4@c if indicated|pg||
nt|henryb:  to show the solid suit|pg||
nt|kit: I don't know what Boyd is thinking of doing|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: He's definitely thinking about something|pg||
nt|danilo1: opps, srry ... missed Bd Nr. (thought Sout dealer) |pg||
nt|jcomyn: might have been interesting if vul reversed|pg||
nt|chmitty: 2@s x : support other suits|pg||
nt|blum1956: redouble showing the Ace|pg||
nt|vugraphpl4: i cant hear anything :/|pg||
nt|mamos: EW in OR  had to contend with a Muiderberg 2@S in OR|pg||
nt|vugraphpl4: Ilczuk undo his bid|pg||
nt|kirp:  if this is start of relay auction, wake me when its over|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: and that must have been what|pg||
nt|stc: S noticed that all cards are good for declarer in this match|pg||
nt|riccho:  5@d can be a very expensive save|pg||
nt|chmitty: the french also stopped at 2NT at board 6 ... but with some reason, South overcalling !!|pg||
nt|blum1956: Max may expect that Anna has not that long diamonds (she seems to keep 4 spades|pg||
nt|chmitty: 3@c : my hand is interesting, although I passed 2@s ... so good support for red suits, with no doubt|pg||
nt|riccho:  with the S Hand? boah...|pg||
nt|riccho:  for sure - if they didnt switch systems since last round... :)|pg||
nt|kirp:  Is this a Str @C auction|pg||
mb|2C!|an|!d|nt|oosb: 3NT from North is comfy|pg||
nt|chmitty: passed 2@c sry|pg||
nt|blum1956: Certainly Anna will bid 5@c|pg||
nt|blum1956: and NS should take a save|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  If I opened 1@c the auction would go 1@c-1@h-2@c-3N and we would get a low diamond lead|pg||
nt|kit: Interesting -- maybe right, but still .....|pg||
nt|mr murray: talk to u later. Going out to play poker now. Took me all day to get ready to go out and play a few hours. No energy in my body at all :)|pg||
nt|kit: Now Weichsel does have a problem -- who can make what?|pg||
nt|ntmon: taking a low road|pg||
nt|runnerup: now have to find  @h out|pg||
nt|runnerup:  @h said i not ace @h|pg||
nt|danilo1: very difficult task for Guido id declarer plays low @S especially|pg||
nt|riccho:  the save can be a good fortune for EW|pg||
mb|2D|nt|blum1956: wow!|pg||
nt|riccho:  inviting to a phantom sacrficie|pg||
nt|snorre: not an easy 3NT to win... |pg||
nt|mamos: 3 clubs 3 spades two + one|pg||
nt|snorre: North can win first club, play spades, duck next @c and declearer can't reach dummy...|pg||
nt|mamos: blow  |pg||
nt|kirp:  so 2@C shows better @Ds than @Hs?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: Boyd: "all that for me, eh?" Robinson: "surprise"|pg||
nt|henryb:  Well, would North really bid 2@d after 1@c-1@h?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: He did in the othe room :)|pg||
nt|runnerup: in this vulnerability -this looks normal bidding seqwence |pg||
nt|andreasw:  10 tricks|pg||
nt|oosb: dont think he can risk trying for overtricks|pg||
nt|andreasw:  no he wont|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|ntmon: interesting play after @C lead|pg||
nt|jbgood: big gain for China on the last one...|pg||
nt|jbgood: 5 @c by W was not a success|pg||
nt|mamos: plan B|pg||
nt|mamos: im told that East has shown his Red suit length |pg||
mb|3C!|nt|blum1956: The save in 5@d costed  800 but...|pg||
nt|chmitty: and now ladies and gentlemen ....|pg||
nt|riccho:  6@c looks a bit offroad|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: good decision by Yan to overrule partner's suit|pg||
nt|chmitty: 1540 is offroad indeed|pg||
mb|3H|nt|riccho:  and will be a make now...|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  opposite a passed partner?|pg||
nt|snorre: when ur pd opens a strong @c, you never bid the suits you have. That way the strong hand becomes declearer|pg||
nt|kirp:  once you know pard is 4333 with @ds or no 4-card major, and has @C K, 7 should be easy|pg||
nt|mamos: a spec has suggested that Tarzan is too hard for normal players EW  are not normal players :)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|kit: hard to see defense getting this wrong, so likely 3 IMPs for Lynch|pg||
mb|p|nt|danilo1: good leaving @SK ... (no @H finess possible|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|snorre: These hands are made for rele-systems...|pg||
nt|mamos: West continues to ask  and East to reply|pg||
nt|snorre: anyone for 2@s first time in north? Just to stop the releys..|pg||
mb|4D|nt|danilo1: still making (no options) ... develop @H and @Dto K|pg||
nt|kirp:  that would have been nice|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: no brainer|pg||
nt|kirp:  considerate not nice|pg||
mb|4H|nt|tihana: even if he continues with @Hs it is not easy for declarer|pg||
nt|runnerup: after this lead nothimg to do anyway-so lead was  critical point |pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: im told East has shown 2452 and 4 Controls A=2 K=1|pg||
nt|kirp:  wonderful!!|pg||
nt|snorre: still awake, Kirp?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|kit: 2 club entries in dummy, but not good enough|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: declarer :) - Boyd is playing this|pg||
nt|kirp:  sort of, in SA this would have been so easy and much shorter|pg||
mb|p|nt|riccho:  sometimes the best way is offroad :)|pg||
mb|5D|nt|snorre: 5@d show the @s 9?  :)|pg||
nt|mamos: specs point out those three Qs in East are key  any par that can find these deserve our utmost admiration|pg||
nt|kirp:  thars why i cant see whay W is in control|pg||
mb|p|nt|riccho:  @h is best now |pg||
nt|mamos: a pair playing these methods had a 17 bid against me recently   -- and bid the correct grand|pg||
mb|7N|nt|ppiglett: A heart switch to hold declaler to 8.|pg||

mb|p|nt|tihana: where you make 9 tricks?|pg||

pc|s5|nt|brgpro: as long as declarer abandons @s, he can make it|pg||
nt|runnerup: 10 @c and he could have made it|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pc|s9|pg||
nt|brgpro: even now|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes|pg||
nt|brgpro: can play @cA, then @c10|pg||
nt|brgpro: if E doesnt cover, let it run if E covers, win the K and play a @C|pg||

nt|kit: right -- declarer would (should) never have played that way with ace of diamonds|pg||
nt|henryb:  after ruffing out the heart|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Boyd: "you might have something - might have some distribution - might have the J of @ss. I had an opening bid, you had an opening bid, why should we defend 4@d. I don't know if we ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: beat 4@d"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Weichsel: "we haven't discussed what that means in balancing seat" Lair: "I thought we played better minor for Majors" a little more discussion|pg||
nt|ntmon: lst hand of the set|pg||
nt|Walddk7: 27+5 qualify for the Round of 32 tomorrow after five rounds of Swiss today. 27 from Swiss A and 5 from B|pg||
nt|runnerup: 1 @c -etc..|pg||
nt|jbgood: these teams are of course safe to go on to the round of 32 |pg||
nt|blum1956: Anna could use Blackwood (normally we play 14 30 responses in Russia)|pg||
nt|riccho:  maybe S should have lead @cA to "have a look"|pg||
nt|snorre: That is why north should bid 2@s first round. He is white vs red...|pg||
nt|snorre: Applause for netherland!!!|pg||
nt|mamos: I think that to bid as they did such a Grand with the certainty that you know the cards is awesome|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: OR also played the lucky 3NT, 11+12=26|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kit: Weischel has choice of declaring 2NT or 1@C it looks like|pg||
nt|henryb:  2N does better|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Robinson: "did you have a diamond stopper?" Boyd: "I had K doubleton ... I had a stopper from my side, not from yours"|pg||
nt|ntmon: last hand of Swiss |pg||
nt|oosb: Its going well for Pony so far|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: finally a turnaround board  18 - EW allowed to 5@D|pg||
nt|riccho:  @s lead (as a kib mentions) was certainly not very well thought|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jbgood: last one now - hope you have enjoyed as much as I have:)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes, calandra needs a swing|pg||
nt|chmitty: in these situations, lead the @c Ace seems to be an obligation|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: Weichsel asks about the lead: "standard from feser than 4, or promises the J if from 4 or more"|pg||
nt|kit: he has down 1, but may take heart finesse trying to make and go down many|pg||
nt|tihana: tiny 3N?|pg||
nt|danilo1: waw ... both rooms played 4@S |pg||
mb|p|nt|oosb: In other scores .. Brogeland trailing De Botton 22 imps to 60 !|pg||
nt|oosb: Heres the link to live scores: http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/r32runda1.html|pg||
mb|p|nt|andreasw:  3 nt is on...|pg||
pc|h2|nt|runnerup: here ns must avoid 4 @s 4 @h or 3nt has chances|pg||
nt|mcarroll: If they declare a @H contract, E will have a nasty surprise for them|pg||
nt|ntmon: even in 4@S a lot to do for declarer|pg||
nt|mamos: it will be interesting to look at the traveller   -- it represents a lot of practice and dedication|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ntmon: 3NT has good chance to be bid after 3@C from S|pg||
nt|tihana: lot of 10s|pg||
nt|kirp:  good lead, should beat this|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ntmon: thx to our operator in Poznan - Lukasz|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|andreasw:  will be bid now:-)|pg||
nt|oosb: wow|pg||
nt|snorre: The teams are divided in groups of  8 in the open and play a complete Round-robin of 10 boards.|pg||
nt|snorre: At the end of the Round-robin the first  3 teams from each group in the open will qualify for Swiss A and the other teams for Swiss B|pg||
nt|kirp:  guess down 2 but a lot to the play|pg||
pc|d2|nt|oosb: nice bid|pg||
nt|andreasw:  wd|pg||
pc|d8|nt|runnerup: but even if bid it is not made yet|pg||
nt|ntmon: 3@D to find 5th spade i think|pg||
nt|mcarroll: good pass ny N|pg||
nt|baardolav: A little bit lucky 3nt:)|pg||
nt|oosb: after that lead, you're all in|pg||
nt|chmitty: another difficult hand to bid here|pg||
nt|riccho:  E promised the @sA already; so the danger of a @s lead should have been obvious|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d3|pg||
nt|kit: At this point, Weichsel has in essence exposed his entire hand|pg||
nt|ntmon: but whole bidding a bid murky now|pg||
nt|ntmon: bit*|pg||
nt|ppiglett: South might have come in 2S as East is a limited hand and both the club and H honour are probably well placed. Anyway I am an aggressive 2S bidder. Stopping Partner bidding 4 is ...|pg||
nt|ppiglett: the problem!|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mcarroll: by|pg||
nt|oosb: close your eyes and finesse|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes west knows|pg||
pc|h3|nt|tihana: bi|pg||
nt|chmitty: 3@h sounds like : I have a stopper problem|pg||
nt|chmitty: but in which suit ?|pg||
nt|chmitty: 2@d being 100 % artificial forcing|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|pg||
nt|ntmon: 3NT isn't pretty|pg||
pc|hK|nt|runnerup: now diamond lead gives chances in this|pg||
nt|ntmon: S can shed a @h on 3rd diamond|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ntmon: @DJ and @CQ well placed for declarer|pg||
pc|s2|nt|snorre: Last board in this room. Next match starts in 25 min. 15.45. Welcome back..|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|runnerup: so is it possible for ns to open + imps|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|d5|nt|jcomyn: i love that lead|pg||
pc|d7|nt|oosb: next.|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|h6|nt|andreasw:  wd next|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mcarroll: easy to get overboard |pg||
nt|danilo1: good stop ... 5@H may be in danger - especially with @HA lead|pg||
nt|baardolav: Have to see if @c q drops first|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mamos: an exciting set -- well fought by the Polish NS against the really World Class Dutch team - who we would expect to see in the final stages of the competition  certainly potential ...|pg||
nt|mamos: winners|pg||
nt|kirp:  Neth have had a strong finish to this match|pg||
nt|snorre: Last board here. next round 17.30 (15 min) due to schedule. |pg||
nt|kirp:  Bye all|pg||
nt|snorre: This round was delayed by 10 minor so, so maybe a bit later than 17.30|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|oosb: He will play it out for @C|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kit: Perhaps he should not have cashed high heart first, just led spade to dummy, led jack of hearts, and seen if he got a cover|pg||
nt|riccho:  S needs a successful @C guess now; this is espec difficult after such a bd just before|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|nt|henryb:  He might go up with the @hK on the theory that 1@c is 2 down and either the @hQ drops and he makes 3 or it does not and he is only 1 down|pg||
nt|chmitty: terrible set for Multon Willard so far : 4@s made by opps, a frightening 50% grand slam not bid, 6cx made, and now 3NT 2 off|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Then again you probably would have made 4S.|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|mcarroll:  yes - 2nd worst game contract - 4@S is the only game with any real prospect|pg||
nt|ntmon: down 4|pg||
nt|oosb: incase some one unguards|pg||
nt|riccho:  the 2!opener peempts both sids and you canot expect to do it right every time|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ntmon: so an opportunity for rossard to equal the score|pg||
nt|ntmon: all boards played here, looking for last comparison|pg||
nt|ntmon: thx for watching, thx operator for fine job|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Playing 4@S in OR|pg||
nt|ntmon: see you all next round |pg||
nt|ntmon: bye|pg||
pc|s3|nt|tihana: vwdone to avoid heart fit |pg||
pc|s7|nt|oosb: right Baard|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|andreasw:  3nt bid|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dJ|nt|mamos: West competed aggressively over 2@d|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ntmon: 4@S is questionable because if S did not opened 2@S, she is around 7 HCP and implied bad @S suit|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
mc|5|nt|snorre: see you all|pg||
nt|mamos: ty all|pg||
nt|mamos: ty op|pg||
