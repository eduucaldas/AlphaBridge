mb|p|nt|Walddk4: East is  Arnolds     West is   Bakkeren|pg||
mb|3S|nt|roswolf: will north bid his own suit?|pg||
nt|roswolf: a diversionary effort from tor?|pg||
nt|roswolf: this may be interesting|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
nt|hajru:  Good morning everybody|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|roswolf: HERE the bidding had reached 3@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|hajru:  Not sure what happened here as it appeared that EW had 7 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|spooky: a very weak 1@S from Tor|pg||
nt|roswolf: psyche from tor|pg||
nt|roswolf: north passed - really|pg||
nt|roswolf: amazing|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3@S @HA @SA|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3@C|pg||
nt|hajru:  Yes, that is true.  |pg||
nt|hajru:  OK, did we really have a French person open a weak NT here?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And South's name has an  I  in the middle instead of an  O|pg||
nt|blum1956: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|hajru:  I think we have the wrong board in front of us|pg||
nt|roswolf: we are off Holland v France/Monaco|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure|pg||
pc|c5|nt|roswolf: SOUTH MUST PROTECT SURELY|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi michael|pg||
nt|Walddk4: d'OVIDIO|pg||
nt|roswolf: AND NOW 3NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: far too optimistic - too much dutch courage for breakfast?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I doubt that EW are in 3NT|pg||
nt|blum1956: Bakkeren in 3@s|pg||
nt|pelu: as I remember W was in 3@s|pg||
nt|roswolf: well east had bid 3@H and 3nt looks ok then by west|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok i concede the contract is probably 3@S by west|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I am not sure EW are too pleased with the Russia flags they have, but of course they don't know|pg||
nt|blum1956: Probably making if West starts with hearts|pg||
nt|hajru:  That makes more sense|pg||
nt|roswolf: this depends on the @H guess at first blush but the trump break is inconvenient|pg||
mc|9|nt|roswolf: 2 imps for an extra undertrick in 2@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: heart support?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes this is bd 2 perhaps bd 1 fits:)|pg||
pg||

nt|rv: shapely hands, but no fit and poor breaks for both sides|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|1H|mb|d!|mb|p|nt|rv: South's major suit values not pulling enough weight, if Vriend reverses with 2@d North should slow down auction by supporting @ds via lebensohl |pg||
nt|rv: if North had bid 1@s, then South's 2@d would be reverse, here South might have take stonger action |pg||
mb|3D|nt|Walddk2: Double would normally just show spades and nothing about diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: 1C was probably a Polish type club - either strong or weak NT- so 3D is the reverse maybe|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In that case 2@D is a reverse|pg||
nt|Walddk2: N-S do not play Polish Club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They are naturalists|pg||
nt|odysseus69: what would he do with strong hand with diamond suit|pg||
nt|mareczek: 2@d would show the hand 5@c4@d below reverse I was informed by the Dutch experts|pg||
nt|hawe45:  3 @D seems un-economical, what should that show? Not SO strong, the South-hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C alerted because it can be 2 cards|pg||
nt|rv: 3@d seems reasonable here|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Strange, I would play 3@D as a splinter for spades as 2@D is a natural reverse|pg||
nt|rv: in standard methods it is Inv and North can pass|pg||
mb|4S|nt|odysseus69: glad you are here Roland- so a natural system|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Standard, Victor...?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: See?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Maas interpreted 3@D as a splinter for spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: As would I|pg||
nt|odysseus69: time for doubling but very shy in mixed teams all week|pg||
nt|rv: playing Polish Club, Roland's expln makes more sense|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Double not allowed in first final-round...?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Partned BID vulnerable...!|pg||
nt|mareczek: Maas Vriend is the most experienced, long establishe mixed pair in the world|pg||
nt|mareczek: so we can assess how difficult position it had to be...|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|nt|hawe45:  Peopple try to convince me, that East could fear an escape in 5 @D - thatÂ´s a joke!|pg||
nt|rv: I presume Maas and Roland were on the same wavelength with respect to system, unfortunately Roland can't partner Maas in this event:)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no double no trouble is the popular phrase for this hand|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: Vriend thought Maas had shown diamonds as well with his double, hence the misunderstanding|pg||
nt|rv: cheap at 50 an undertrick could be another phrase|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So she thought she supported diamonds|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s6|pg||
nt|mareczek: probably the double of 1@h promised only spades|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|h2|pc|c2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: From Maas's chair, yes|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk2: and thereore 2@D is a reverse|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@D a splinter for spades|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i expected a trump lead but maybe this will work out better|pg||
nt|hawe45:  After 40 years as a mixed pair, it will slowly be the time for discussing this double...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They are not only a pair at the table|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Plenty of opportunities to discuss this|pg||
nt|odysseus69: did well to stop low in CR|pg||
nt|rv: 3@d is good stop, well judged since South's values in short suits need to be downgraded|pg||
nt|Walddk2: D'Ovidio bid a natural 2@D (reverse) and everything was fine after that|pg||
pc|sA|pc|d3|pc|c3|pg||
nt|rv: some specs are suggesting 2@h by South as another option on double, in my view it shows GF and South's hand is not so good for that action|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Non-vulnerable and undoubled, not a disaster|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 45 boards to go after this|pg||

mb|2H|nt|roswolf: i think gf actually|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome John|pg||

nt|hajru:  Specs, NS has to win by 2 imp's or more to reach the next round.|pg||
nt|roswolf: well n/s have found their fit|pg||
nt|roswolf: this could end with blood on the carpet|pg||
nt|pelu: I exp that the x only show 4 card @S, so 2@D from S = reverse values|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Tarjei Eck Hansen|pg||
nt|jaapfr: would any of us:)?|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: bergen raise here|pg||
nt|hedyg: that N hand is not really worth 17 hcps, is it?|pg||
nt|hajru:  I would not, but then again, I usually play a system where 1H is limited to about 17, rather than the 21 in |pg||
nt|hajru:  a natural system.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: even then never 1@S|pg||
nt|hajru:  If you had to bid, what would you bid then?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: pass or pass or pass:)|pg||
nt|blum1956: This is allready doubleable|pg||

nt|hedyg: so downgraded to the 2@H replay|pg||
nt|hedyg: reply*|pg||
nt|roswolf: true michael|pg||
mb|p|nt|riccho:  np; I guess its very tricky to get the informations across to you from the table, if they are not interested :)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|roswolf: south scared into passing - how could 4@C be wrong|pg||
nt|roswolf: the bludegeon shouldnt work on this deal|pg||
nt|djneill:  I like the 3NT bid, whenever I bid 2NT, it seems to make no difference - it makes 3, or goes down 1, whatever I do|pg||
nt|roswolf: spades 3-3 gives some hope i suppose|pg||
mb|p|nt|riccho:  is there a tiebreaker rule in the unlikely event of a draw? |pg||
nt|hajru:  I'm sure there is. |pg||
nt|arno11: might make 4 can pitch @C loser on @D after finessing against N|pg||
mb|p|nt|teckh:  well bid, I think|pg||
nt|granguru:  hi geoffrey|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@D might be the majority choice|pg||
nt|hajru:  Downloading the conditions of contest as we speak.|pg||
nt|roswolf: pass is favorite|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: now S even get slam ideas (sorry this is monday morning bidding:)|pg||
nt|psyck: still a good game as those are the chances if @d fin off|pg||
nt|pelu: in Or Beb Vriend jump to 3@D|pg||
pc|hA|nt|arno11: after @C lead this might not work anymore|pg||
nt|roswolf: this will play quite well despite the 4-1 trump break|pg||
pc|h2|nt|spooky: All about @HJ now|pg||
nt|spooky: with this lead she has enough entries to misguess it... |pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|pg||
nt|hajru:  Opposite SQxxx and a red ace, 6S has a chance, and it is not clear if N would cooperate over 4D|pg||
nt|jaapfr: pls check operator if N will say afterwards as sweet as possible: sorry pd:)?|pg||
nt|pelu: a overbid with @HK stiff in front of the @H overcall|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|pc|d5|nt|roswolf: by e/w certainly - 3@D seemed to confuse the opps|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: we dont know if 2@H could be with @s and 2@s would be p/c then|pg||
nt|roswolf: but escapes with a scratch|pg||
nt|roswolf: the light shines on the lady|pg||
nt|psyck: 4@h will be interesting|pg||
nt|blum1956: 4@h looks natural but fails after a diamond lead or switch|pg||
mb|4H|nt|granguru:  4@H should have been  the minimum...problem is that it might lead to a wrong lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: does that agree @C|pg||
nt|roswolf: LOOKS LIKE IT DOES|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: this auction will peter out in some partscore -2@H!?|pg||

nt|arno11: auction hard to believe|pg||
nt|riccho:  maybe X showed some WK NT Hand? |pg||
nt|hajru:  Yes.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Operator, could you please enter scores on 21 and 22 manually?|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i would bid game on this sequence but i suppose north is entitled to overbid after the first few bds|pg||
nt|hedyg: overtake and play J@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@S LOOKED NATURAL AND CONSTRUCTIVE|pg||
nt|roswolf: last train!?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|spooky: looks like a walsh aucon, East not bidding her 4crd @S|pg||
nt|hedyg: it all depends on their agreements i would think?|pg||
nt|jbgood: this will be a quick downer with the di ruff|pg||
nt|hajru:  That should be 1 off after this lead|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|spooky: auction*|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks like 6@C now|pg||
nt|psyck: correct play in majors will only lose 1 trick in them & they could have made an o/t in 4@h if they got there|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: W doesn't know what's going on?|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: !!!|pg||

nt|roswolf: 5@C probably showed no spade control|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/swrunda5.html|pg||
nt|roswolf: south might chicken out with some justification|pg||
nt|djneill:  the @dT, or @sT would make a big difference here for N-S|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair point|pg||
nt|psyck: 1@h was 3 or less @h i guess...2@c=who knows...|pg||
pc|d9|nt|Walddk4: If you don't know the codes, give me contract, declarer and number of tricks and I will give you the codes|pg||
pc|dK|nt|roswolf: this needs a good guesser|pg||
nt|djneill:  beautiful|pg||
pc|d6|nt|roswolf: this is a cakewalk|pg||
nt|roswolf: a deal to ponder in the post mortem|pg||
nt|roswolf: the play isnt that straightforward either but this will make i bet|pg||
nt|granguru:  backward finesse in @D permits not to lose a @D trick|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thank you|pg||
nt|Walddk4: By the way, N-S are from France (flags)|pg||
nt|spooky: with @CKJ in south declarer shouldn't have any problems|pg||
nt|roswolf: this layout is far too kind|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: pokerface of E|pg||
nt|psyck: actially, % play in @s is low to J & then Q...so would lose 2@s tricks, so will have to get @d right|pg||
nt|jbgood: even withot the ruff S would have to find the club queen to make 10|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|roswolf: yes the norsemen (and women) have sprung into a big lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: this contract is pretty unlucky|pg||
pc|h6|nt|hedyg: personally i play that 2@h can be weak with ANY suit, incl @s|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes and declarer will play west for the long@D|pg||
nt|granguru:  E would have led @SK with @SQ(10)|pg||
nt|roswolf: from the bidding|pg||
pc|h2|nt|teckh:  will she go for split A,K@d |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|d8|nt|roswolf: BTW in this sequence i would have played a double by west as PENALTY|pg||
nt|roswolf: suggest a heart wanted?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|teckh:  He now see KQ, and A@s will materialize, then W has noe Q@H|pg||
nt|jaapfr: discarding not @C in N is confusing a bit|pg||
nt|roswolf: err dont think so|pg||
pc|h3|nt|blum1956: And the declarer still needs the @c guess to come to down 1|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|teckh:  probably|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair points|pg||
nt|hedyg: for sure|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|sQ|nt|hedyg: no|pg||
nt|roswolf: my standing assumption when opps intervene over weak 2 suited bids is that this is a misfit hand and bid appropriately i.e DONT bid|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|roswolf: find the lady is the perennial problem|pg||
nt|roswolf: if so then west was very wet|pg||
nt|hedyg: E did not underruff!|pg||
nt|hedyg: Michal?|pg||
nt|hedyg: we have lost our operator :(|pg||
nt|hedyg: np|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w in the other room missed their 5-5 @H fit|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: 5-4|pg||
pc|s4|nt|granguru:  best line could be to endplay E with the second @D|pg||
pc|sA|nt|arno11: contract gets what it deserved|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|psyck: I'm told 1@h showed @h fit, so 2@c may have been meant as some range enquiry|pg||
pc|s8|nt|hajru:  That is a good return|pg||

nt|pelu: 3-2|pg||

nt|pelu: in OR Benedicte C pass over 1NT - the 2Nt was a close call|pg||
nt|hajru:  Even with the @h 3-2, he still has to play the spade for 2 losers, which is hard if E ducks the first round|pg||
nt|blum1956: South still may expect that West has only 4 hearts|pg||
nt|jbgood: yes - it was a brave move by Arnolds|pg||
nt|pelu: so 4@h - no x in OR|pg||
nt|jbgood: if hearts are 4-1 E would have gotten a spade ruff long ago|pg||

nt|hajru:  I have no idea why you'd call the S hand balanced in a strong club context|pg||

nt|riccho:  maybe S wanted to emphasize the "good" @d-suit?|pg||
nt|riccho:  2@d = @c sounds a bit funny|pg||
nt|riccho:  anyway: the contract is not very convincing, but successful|pg||
nt|hajru:  I think we can only guess at this stage|pg||
nt|arno11: if North takes the @C finesse we will come to 12 tricks via 4@C 4@D 3@H and the @S Ace|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|granguru:  a lucky situation|pg||

nt|hajru:  Why would you play the 7 from Q765 then?|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|riccho:  say: probably convincing; the @c-finesse is not nadatory|pg||

nt|roswolf: hmmm - idee fixee|pg||

mb|2S|nt|roswolf: 2 or 3 nt ?|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes getting weaker by the minute..|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: 7-2 to the CR|pg||
nt|hajru:  2@c is 11-14, 6@c or 5@c with a 4 card M|pg||
nt|hajru:  Giving north a problem what to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|spooky: another 3rd hand Light opener|pg||
nt|roswolf: different tempo to this auction|pg||
nt|roswolf: doubt whether they will get close to a slam|pg||
nt|arno11: teams full of star players like Lavazza, Brogeland or Gottlieb on their way out |pg||
nt|hajru:  3@d probably invitational with a good 6 card suit|pg||
nt|hajru:  I guess it will end there|pg||
nt|psyck: he will be more dissaponted when he finds they made 4@s other table that deal|pg||

mb|3C|nt|roswolf: support with support|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this is action bridge - where will the music stop?|pg||
nt|djneill:  example of how usually the weaker hand with a long suit plays better - honors from the strong hand are still relevant, but not if West declares - East's @d not so hot then|pg||
nt|hajru:  In the other room, west tried 1@s, not sure what that meant, but it got them to a playable contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|teckh:  both major and 11 is an opening allways these days |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: yup the courtesy raise|pg||

nt|roswolf: agreed|pg||
nt|blum1956: this one is easy|pg||
nt|pelu: I prefer 2Nt = no fit and 3@C = fit|pg||
pc|sA|nt|spooky: a lack of aces here...|pg||

nt|roswolf: west will/should pass now|pg||

nt|hajru:  This gives the contract a chance|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: I think E is very tired she forgot about lead..|pg||
nt|psyck: unavoidable to get to game here if you play light openings, unfortunately no chances as cards are here|pg||
nt|psyck: even if he contrives to endplay W, that will only push his trick total from 8 to 9|pg||
pc|s2|nt|roswolf: and a lack of a double:(|pg||

nt|jaapfr: but we see but E and N can not know that|pg||
nt|riccho:  still difficult to collect enough tricks here|pg||
nt|hajru:  Goldwater's rule: always accept a lead out of turn.  If they don't know who should lead, they probably don't know what to lead|pg||
nt|hajru:  Why, if you have no fit, then your honnors are in the other suits and you don't want to be dummy|pg||
pc|h9|nt|hajru:  If you take the @d a in the first round, you better know what to return|pg||

mb|p|nt|jbgood: and it is rightsided|pg||
nt|roswolf: unlikely lead from north|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jbgood: must admit I would show E's hand as a strong NT - and gone down in 3 NT|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|roswolf: north bid - spoilsport|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes N's blood when S can reach him?|pg||
nt|roswolf: identical auction at both tables|pg||

nt|blum1956: Not the best idea to open 1NT with 14HCP out of 15 in two suits (if the alternative opening bid is available)|pg||

mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: should be what?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|Walddk2: Vriend would also double after 3@S|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Operator, please - put Easts 3 @S-bid into the place, where it belongs = 1 round earlier...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Given his 4@H opening earlier, 2@S is perhaps a wee bit timid|pg||
nt|rv: possibly Cronier could have raised to 3@s in previous round to put more pressure|pg||
nt|rv: now Vriend will bid game here more easily|pg||

nt|jaapfr: @CA @DA and x@D|pg||

nt|pelu: also from a spec tx to Michal (operator) he had a hard job from start :)|pg||
nt|hajru:  Yes, thanks Michal.|pg||
nt|roswolf: the heart lead is telegraphed against 3nt - can east find the @HK?|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: not so bad|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: :)|pg||
mb|4C|nt|blum1956: The NS probably will prefer 5@c or 4@s|pg||
nt|pelu: nice to find the @H-weakness - but if s over 2@D just bid 3Nt then a snall @H in lead|pg||
nt|hajru:  We'll never know|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@C or 4@S?|pg||
nt|jbgood: 5 @c an interesting contract|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: only for us - not for S :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: must spurn the black finesses and end play W to win?|pg||

nt|pelu: a bet? - I know I owe u 1-2 cokes Jon :)|pg||
nt|hajru:  The @h lead looks obvious and then west can play @h at every opportunity|pg||
nt|blum1956: you're right Jon|pg||
