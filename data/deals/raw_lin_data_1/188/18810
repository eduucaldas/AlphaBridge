nt|Walddk2: 2@S = clubs we believe|pg||
nt|danilo1: 2@S is obviously @C transfer ... and 2NT shows good hand |pg||
nt|jbgood: or 2 NT club fit? |pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Pierre Schmidt|pg||
nt|chmitty: Hello:)|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|chmitty: 2NT shows both good hand and @c fit|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
nt|danilo1: 3NT probably shows @D shorthness, otherwise difficult to see the reason for transfer|pg||
nt|chmitty: and 1NT 2@s 3@c 3NT would show a singleton @d|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jbgood: lots of tricks if (when) she gets the clubs right|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c6|nt|chmitty: but not here, because 2@s could be with a limited hand that you raise to 3NT when you here the good news|pg||

nt|chmitty: for instance you bid 2@s with the actual hand but also with Jxx 10x xx KDxxxx (you would then pass 3@c)|pg||

nt|danilo1: why not with actual hand simply 1NT-3NT? ... suppose now 3@D would show singleton @D and slam try|pg||

nt|granguru:  :) |pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but i have lost some weight:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: classic weak2 by east|pg||

mb|3N|nt|granguru:  hehehe|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|granguru:  me too...|pg||
nt|granguru:  35 pounds|pg||
nt|granguru:  protein diet|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1nt is beleieved to be a transfer to @C|pg||
nt|riccho:  hi everybody :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: looks like 4@h makes with the @c double finesse, but EW have a cheap 4@s sacrifice.|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: hi all|pg||
pc|d5|nt|roswolf: can n/s avoid anything stupid -perhaps not|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would double as south if i was to do anything|pg||
pc|dT|nt|roswolf: n/s system is steam age ACOL (4CM) + many gadgets|pg||
nt|roswolf: a simple 4@S TO BID|pg||
nt|hajru:  Welcom back.|pg||
nt|hajru:  I don't have convention cards for NS, but it looks like they play limited opeing bids.|pg||
nt|hajru:  Welcome Riccho|pg||
nt|arno11: good afternonn everyone|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Looks like this is making even without getting the @d right|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|hajru:  Did we just get new players?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|spooky: Both teams had a good start of the swiss, Brogeland scored 24 and Penfold 24 VP in the first match of the day|pg||
nt|roswolf: a gentle enough bd to start|pg||
nt|granguru:  weak long @Cs|pg||
nt|roswolf: on a very good day slam may be on from west's point of view -nut no heroics are needed at the moment|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  is there a safety play against 4-0 either side?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|roswolf: the players will have the correct names shortly|pg||
nt|roswolf: GOOD TRUMP LEAD|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|roswolf: their nt is weak normally but they may have varied that|pg||
nt|spooky: Tor directly in a 4-3 fit.|pg||
nt|roswolf: WELL THE WEST HAND SHOULD MAKE SOME TRICKS IN THIS CONTRACT|pg||
nt|arno11: noon*|pg||
nt|riccho:  after 14 Boards is Finland leading by a single imp (24-23)|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|djneill:  hi all|pg||
nt|granguru:  making 10 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello John, Dan and Geoffrey|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi Dan|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|granguru:  hi |pg||
pc|c2|nt|roswolf: west kept his powder dry sensing no doubt that any + score would likely to be good|pg||
nt|roswolf: odd play trying a subterfuge|pg||
pc|s6|nt|arno11: we see a very close match 1 imp difference after the 1st half http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/r32runda1.html|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|roswolf: this could be ugly|pg||
nt|hedyg: good afternoon :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: Michal will post the names asap|pg||
nt|roswolf: just the right players names to be put in|pg||
nt|pelu: a lot of bidding to come to 4@h|pg||
nt|hajru:  This makes more sense: 3@C some kind of bergen raise (6-9, 4 trumps), 3@D a range check,|pg||
nt|hajru:  3@s a cuebid which looks like an overbid to me|pg||
nt|hajru:  but we ended up in a safe contract, with declarer about to make 11 tricks.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  cashing the A could have been wrong if South was void|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|psyck: looks like W can manoeuver a @c ruff though|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|roswolf: HMM NOT quite the best defence|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|hajru:  Declarer will win the 2nd trick, knock out the HA and end up with 9 winners|pg||
nt|riccho:  no idea where they come from, but the names sound bulgarian|pg||
nt|hajru:  Well, yes, they sound south-east european to me too|pg||
nt|arno11: NS are from russia|pg||
nt|riccho:  IÂ´va been told that that NS come from russia :) thatÂ´s why I hate guessing :) |pg||
pc|d8|pc|s7|pg||
nt|psyck: in 4@h by winning @hK 1st round|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s5|pc|cK|nt|hajru:  We start with an easy contract|pg||
nt|hajru:  Does anybody know where the NS team is from?|pg||
nt|riccho:  yes, but with this short matches here (28 bds) every imps can be decisive|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|c9|nt|yorkbeach:  safe to take the @h finese for 10 unless you think North has both missing @d|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  not so safe having crossed to dummy|pg||
nt|roswolf: hardly likely on the play to date|pg||
nt|blum1956: There were no reason to duck a diamond unless  the declarer was going to take a heart finesse|pg||
pc|s8|nt|hajru:  losing an imp or two against the 4H contract at the other table|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h5|pg||
nt|roswolf: i dont think so -2?|pg||
nt|roswolf: not much hope for the defence|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair point|pg||
pc|c8|nt|yorkbeach:  a 3-card @d lead was rather unlikley on this auction - could probably tell from the spot cards as well|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s2|nt|jaapfr: gm all|pg||
nt|psyck: @s punches also would have worked in 4@h|pg||

pc|h9|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|roswolf: discarding is better|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sA|pc|sT|pg||
nt|hedyg: these teams are for the moment in place 1 and 2|pg||
nt|roswolf: easy game|pg||
nt|granguru:  claim time|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|spooky: it didn't matter did it?|pg||
nt|spooky: she only needed to play a @C |pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|jaapfr: was in another room  re Henk:)|pg||
nt|hajru:  Yes, the operator confused me as well by changing the players.|pg||

nt|chmitty: South has some good news, and some bad news (minimum hand) ... will she bid ?|pg||
nt|danilo1: and bid 3@S ev.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chmitty: we have the answer|pg||
nt|jbgood: very difficult - if prd has a @s stop he also needs something good in @ds|pg||
pc|d7|nt|danilo1: if she can project 6 @C tricks + @HAK .. @S stop should be ninth trick|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|d3|pg||

nt|jbgood: they beat the CR|pg||

nt|danilo1: Noth's Dble on 1NT is probably not only 6 @C (and guess, free 3@C voulnerable should show 6-card suit|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk4: East is  Arnolds     West is   Bakkeren|pg||
mb|2S|an|.|nt|roswolf: will north bid his own suit?|pg||
nt|roswolf: a diversionary effort from tor?|pg||
nt|roswolf: this may be interesting|pg||

nt|hajru:  Good morning everybody|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|roswolf: HERE the bidding had reached 3@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: rubbish weak2M|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  looks like it :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hajru:  Not sure what happened here as it appeared that EW had 7 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|spooky: a very weak 1@S from Tor|pg||
nt|roswolf: psyche from tor|pg||
nt|roswolf: north passed - really|pg||
nt|roswolf: amazing|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3@S @HA @SA|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3@C|pg||
nt|hajru:  Yes, that is true.  |pg||
nt|hajru:  OK, did we really have a French person open a weak NT here?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And South's name has an  I  in the middle instead of an  O|pg||
nt|blum1956: hi all|pg||
nt|roswolf: VERY DIFFICULT FPR N/S|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  If North overcalls 3@c, South will be bidding on|pg||
mb|p|nt|hajru:  I think we have the wrong board in front of us|pg||
nt|roswolf: we are off Holland v France/Monaco|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure|pg||
nt|roswolf: PASS BY NORTH NOT UNREASONABLE|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  something North knows, which is why he wanted a better suit|pg||
pc|dT|nt|roswolf: SOUTH MUST PROTECT SURELY|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi michael|pg||
nt|Walddk4: d'OVIDIO|pg||
nt|roswolf: AND NOW 3NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: far too optimistic - too much dutch courage for breakfast?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I doubt that EW are in 3NT|pg||
nt|blum1956: Bakkeren in 3@s|pg||
nt|pelu: as I remember W was in 3@s|pg||
nt|roswolf: well east had bid 3@H and 3nt looks ok then by west|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok i concede the contract is probably 3@S by west|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I am not sure EW are too pleased with the Russia flags they have, but of course they don't know|pg||
nt|blum1956: Probably making if West starts with hearts|pg||
nt|hajru:  That makes more sense|pg||
nt|roswolf: this depends on the @H guess at first blush but the trump break is inconvenient|pg||
pc|d2|nt|roswolf: 2 imps for an extra undertrick in 2@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: heart support?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes this is bd 2 perhaps bd 1 fits:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: a steal by the dutch|pg||
pc|d8|nt|roswolf: 2@H is ROUTINE BYT NORTH MAY BID ON|pg||
nt|roswolf: a high level adventure wont work out too good on this layout|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe 3@c can be weaker for them...generally stronger game forcing hand|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|djneill:  I wonder if South will be able to show this strong a hand?!|pg||
nt|roswolf: all very mysterious|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2@s should be at least 1 down|pg||
pc|cT|nt|spooky: NS had to many HCP to believe Tors opening|pg||
nt|roswolf: brian and sandra come from Yorkshire - a region known for its blunt way of speaking|pg||
nt|roswolf: competent bidding|pg||
nt|spooky: with everything right for declarer, they will make 12 tricks|pg||
nt|pelu: yes the bidding fit B1|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Benedicte Cronier playing at both tables, interesting|pg||
nt|roswolf: feisty auction this|pg||
nt|hajru:  East is Carla Arnolds, a long time player on the dutch women's team, who has won a lot over the years, including a world championship in 1994|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|roswolf: ty:)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|roswolf: sorry the caps key is having a life of its own:(|pg||
nt|roswolf: i understand bidding 2@S but i dont like it|pg||
nt|jcomyn: morning who's e and w|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|roswolf: north reluctantly passes|pg||
nt|roswolf: pass missed out|pg||
nt|riccho:  yes looks a bit weird; |pg||
nt|riccho:  but as bad as the play was; the bidding in the other room was even worse|pg||
nt|arno11: 10 from top|pg||
nt|psyck: other table got to 6@c after a similar 3@c rebid, another reason not to jump with W's hand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I think South is   D'Ovidio|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: yes lots of tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: well i would like it better if the @ss split better :(|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|hajru:  West is Ton Bakkeren, who used to be on the Dutch open team until last year.  His best result this year was 2nd in the Dutch open teams|pg||
nt|hajru:  NS we have Philippe Cronier and Catherine d'Ovidio, who have both played on French teams for ages|pg||
pc|s4|nt|hedyg: anyhow this should make nicely with the 10@s dropping and A@H in S|pg||
nt|jaapfr: she is long time champ:)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|roswolf: 4@S seemed natural or even a raise to 4@H was possible - passing seems very wet|pg||
nt|blum1956: Alas! Fair 21-HCP vulnerable 2NT missing|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|hajru:  Yes, earlier Benedicte was playing with Zimmermann|pg||
nt|Walddk4: she is|pg||
nt|hajru:  Operator, please check!|pg||
nt|pelu: and give ud board 1|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup would be cool|pg||
pc|dA|nt|spooky: this lead didn't scare North|pg||
nt|roswolf: i am told 3cl...mimimum....3nt stiff spade|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s7|pc|d9|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk4: Shut down and start again pls|pg||
nt|Walddk4: we have wrong board numbers|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Pls do it now|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: ups...|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk4: shut down and reconnect to the open room|pg||
nt|hedyg: the @d lead might have been made on the assumption that if pd ,who surely has lots of hcps ,passed it must be because he has openers suit|pg||
nt|hedyg: at some tables N might bid 1@s over 1@d|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h6|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if NS had the bidding to themselves, South might show 12-14 balanced and North might pot game|pg||
pc|s6|nt|roswolf: true|pg||
nt|riccho:  finesse is wothout risk |pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|arno11: :) guess the rest is without picture|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jaapfr: ok 1 imp loss|pg||
pc|c3|nt|djneill:  3-2@h split slam cold, even 4-1@h onside may be ok, is that a good slam? but 5-0 offside not going to work|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  most of the top players open aggressively, doubt South was planning to pass|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|pbmarstr: Ja, er nok noe bedre enn hjerter|pg||
nt|psyck: they could be using 2N for stronger hand types here...of course that does not explain the bidding in other room|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|h4|nt|roswolf: yes but they stayed low|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|c4|pc|hT|pg||

mb|p|nt|granguru:  hi all witam|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would look at my screen-mate and decide|pg||

nt|vugraphpl8: yes|pg||

mb|3N|nt|granguru:  zarfans: 10+8+2+2=22 far from an opening bid|pg||

nt|roswolf: well n/s have found their fit|pg||
nt|roswolf: this could end with blood on the carpet|pg||
nt|pelu: I exp that the x only show 4 card @S, so 2@D from S = reverse values|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Tarjei Eck Hansen|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: bergen raise here|pg||
nt|hedyg: that N hand is not really worth 17 hcps, is it?|pg||
nt|hajru:  I would not, but then again, I usually play a system where 1H is limited to about 17, rather than the 21 in |pg||
nt|hajru:  a natural system.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: even then never 1@S|pg||
nt|hajru:  If you had to bid, what would you bid then?|pg||

nt|roswolf: true michael|pg||
nt|roswolf: well they avoided 6@D which was possible i suppose|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  10 on top on normal breaks... but breaks are not normal|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: she said that she didn't see ace|pg||
pc|sA|nt|riccho:  np; I guess its very tricky to get the informations across to you from the table, if they are not interested :)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|roswolf: south scared into passing - how could 4@C be wrong|pg||
nt|roswolf: the bludegeon shouldnt work on this deal|pg||
nt|djneill:  I like the 3NT bid, whenever I bid 2NT, it seems to make no difference - it makes 3, or goes down 1, whatever I do|pg||
nt|roswolf: spades 3-3 gives some hope i suppose|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|riccho:  is there a tiebreaker rule in the unlikely event of a draw? |pg||
nt|hajru:  I'm sure there is. |pg||
nt|arno11: might make 4 can pitch @C loser on @D after finessing against N|pg||
pc|d2|nt|teckh:  well bid, I think|pg||
nt|granguru:  hi geoffrey|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@D might be the majority choice|pg||
nt|hajru:  Downloading the conditions of contest as we speak.|pg||
nt|roswolf: pass is favorite|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jaapfr: now S even get slam ideas (sorry this is monday morning bidding:)|pg||
nt|psyck: still a good game as those are the chances if @d fin off|pg||
nt|pelu: in Or Beb Vriend jump to 3@D|pg||
pc|dA|nt|arno11: after @C lead this might not work anymore|pg||
nt|roswolf: this will play quite well despite the 4-1 trump break|pg||
nt|roswolf: bad news|pg||
nt|blum1956: she better should not discover that Ace before the bidding ended))|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
pc|s7|pg||

nt|spooky: with this lead she has enough entries to misguess it... |pg||
pc|d7|nt|yorkbeach:  oops|pg||
pc|c4|nt|hajru:  Opposite SQxxx and a red ace, 6S has a chance, and it is not clear if N would cooperate over 4D|pg||
nt|jaapfr: pls check operator if N will say afterwards as sweet as possible: sorry pd:)?|pg||
nt|pelu: a overbid with @HK stiff in front of the @H overcall|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  GIB says that East needed to keep all her @s|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|roswolf: by e/w certainly - 3@D seemed to confuse the opps|pg||
nt|roswolf: certainly would be in my club|pg||
pc|d5|nt|granguru:  S arriving fast to acomplish his promess|pg||
nt|pelu: I like Ss bidding here|pg||
pc|c6|nt|pelu: now NS in 4@S in OR??????|pg||
nt|roswolf: optimism gone mad|pg||
nt|hajru:  That must be a very rare misunderstanding from NS|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  and that cashing the 3rd @d is a mistake|pg||
nt|blum1956: certainly she had to keep them all but know the ball is back|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  defenders are going to gte 3@s 1@d + 1 other trick|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes instructive little errors |pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  will not work but looks right to play @c|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  4@c 1@h gives declarer the 5 more tricks he needs|pg||
pc|c8|nt|roswolf: her the ladies sit south and east|pg||
pc|c5|nt|roswolf: sandra is a very competent decarer and mis guessing is not her forte|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: no|pg||
nt|hajru:  Does anybody know what carding EW play?|pg||
nt|hajru:  They have been playing as a pair for at least 30 years|pg||

nt|roswolf: yes hope for 4@C + a @H|pg||

pc|hK|pg||
nt|riccho:  iots still possible but would risk the contract|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  time to try @s again|pg||
nt|roswolf: NOW DEFENCE CASH OUT|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Declared rose and played a diamond to the ace, East pitching a spade!?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|mb|1D|nt|chmitty: amazing that 3NT was allowed to make on @s lead in both rooms|pg||
mb|d!|nt|Walddk2: Both N-S pairs think they have a good board|pg||
nt|danilo1: both East and West would see table after @SQ lead ... so if 4-card at the table... East may refuse to unblock @SJ|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|3H|nt|henryb:  An interesting problem: how many @d to bid w/ Cronier's hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT a sound diamond raise presumably|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: THis is a dead horse regardless of lead|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|h5|pc|h4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The raise is strange opposite a passed partner|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 13 balanced|pg||
nt|henryb:  North has not such an easy time discarding on the @d|pg||
nt|jbgood: in a way it was right to bid - to flatten the board if 3 NT was on as they also bid it next door|pg||
nt|danilo1: thk should not be difficult for Maas to see that pd needs @CK to beat|pg||
nt|jbgood: @d to the ace and spade up?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think 5 rounds of diamonds|pg||

pc|h7|pg||

nt|chmitty: a @c still Ok I believe|pg||
nt|jbgood: or a small club|pg||
nt|chmitty: The fact is both North and South must keep 2@s|pg||

pc|c4|pc|dK|pc|s6|pg||
pc|d8|nt|henryb:  Both partners have to pitch a @h now|pg||
nt|chmitty: a @c by South still OK ... if North discards the ace !|pg||
nt|danilo1: since South will be now forced to discard @H ... North should know his exact cards ... (KJx i @C - why do not disc .@C?) ... maybe would be more difficult for North if declarer ...|pg||

nt|chmitty: ace of @c discard only winning card|pg||
nt|danilo1: why discarding @C ... South also knows pd has @CA|pg||
nt|chmitty: discard a @s : Cronier plays low @s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Or jettison the ace of clubs I think the term is|pg||
nt|chmitty: discard @h : Cronier unblocks the ace @h and plays @c|pg||
nt|danilo1: now North has to save the day discarding @CA|pg||
nt|jbgood: a worthy St. Anton discard|pg||
nt|chmitty: Cronier has full count ... he won't miss it if he is given a chance|pg||

mb|1S|nt|djneill:  ok so South sees 14 HCP opposite 15-17, and shortness in hearts - East having most of the opposing honors, South knows there is a minor slam if North has a fit|pg||
nt|granguru:  landy, garozzo, woolsey, multilandy or something|pg||

nt|roswolf: a firm 1NT no doubt:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: north risks a large penalty|pg||
mb|3N|nt|hedyg: we dont know if 2@H could be with @s and 2@s would be p/c then|pg||

nt|blum1956: 4@h looks natural but fails after a diamond lead or switch|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  4@H should have been  the minimum...problem is that it might lead to a wrong lead|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c9|pg||
nt|spooky: auction*|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks like 6@C now|pg||
nt|psyck: correct play in majors will only lose 1 trick in them & they could have made an o/t in 4@h if they got there|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: W doesn't know what's going on?|pg||

nt|djneill:  the @dT, or @sT would make a big difference here for N-S|pg||

pc|cT|nt|Walddk4: Thank you|pg||
nt|Walddk4: By the way, N-S are from France (flags)|pg||
nt|spooky: with @CKJ in south declarer shouldn't have any problems|pg||
nt|roswolf: this layout is far too kind|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: pokerface of E|pg||
nt|psyck: actially, % play in @s is low to J & then Q...so would lose 2@s tricks, so will have to get @d right|pg||

pc|c8|nt|roswolf: yes the norsemen (and women) have sprung into a big lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: this contract is pretty unlucky|pg||
pc|c6|nt|hedyg: personally i play that 2@h can be weak with ANY suit, incl @s|pg||

pc|s3|pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||

nt|roswolf: the axe falls|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  much will depend upon the lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|hajru:  This is interesting: when I look up my name in worldbridge.org, I find somebody with my name|pg||

mb|p|nt|hajru:  Yes, looks like 7 tricks to EW for a 10 imp gain|pg||

mb|p|nt|spooky: You were right :)|pg||
nt|riccho:  probably they guessed the fuel name from the list (someone with guessing capabilities like me...) |pg||
nt|jbgood: N didnt bid 4@h - perhaps S should hear the alarm clocks ?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|spooky: 3@S is down already...|pg||
nt|granguru:  michal nowosadzki has also started on 2009|pg||
nt|roswolf: I DOUBT A DIAMOND|pg||
pc|sK|nt|teckh:  he will play for club and eventually it will make with the spade and blockage|pg||
nt|roswolf: he needs at least 1 spade trick|pg||
nt|roswolf: even if the clubs came in|pg||
nt|roswolf: no he doesnt - icant count early in the morning:)|pg||
nt|teckh:  Tor knows he has a single spade in front and 3 on his back|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  superficially declarer might lose just 1@h 1@d and @c but too much work to do|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer can come to hand and throw 2@d on the @s but then has a dilemma|pg||
pc|s2|nt|riccho:  the 4@s from W sounds like that W didnt understand it either|pg||
nt|arno11: I see your point:)|pg||

nt|riccho:  full|pg||
nt|hajru:  I'm not sure if I understand the 2s! bid|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if she cashes a second @h, East can play a third @h when in with the @dA|pg||
pc|c2|nt|hedyg: i think EW would make 8 tricks on best defense|pg||
nt|pelu: JOn: 3@D could be a 5 card suit, so N cant bid 4@H |pg||
nt|blum1956: yes as now EW will collect 200 to 500, more probably 200 after this start|pg||
nt|blum1956: maybe @cA and a club?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|hedyg: running scores and results : http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/swrunda3.html|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 1@S2@H2@D and 1 @C loser not to avoid specs|pg||
nt|jbgood: with a little more help this will not be expensive though - was the @s ace mandatory?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|roswolf: really?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if not, West will get to ruff a @d with the @hJ|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|pelu: B¤ NS in 3Nt - also down after @D lead|pg||

nt|jbgood: Peter - N might bid wit a good fit. that was my point...|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s7|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|blum1956: after taking discard|pg||
pc|s4|nt|hajru:  This gets rid of the @c loser but creates a @h loser|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|s6|pg||
pc|d4|nt|pelu: S dont need "good" fit - but @Hs 2-2|pg||
nt|pelu: 3-2|pg||
nt|jbgood: very unlikely after the bidding|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR Benedicte C pass over 1NT - the 2Nt was a close call|pg||
nt|hajru:  Even with the @h 3-2, he still has to play the spade for 2 losers, which is hard if E ducks the first round|pg||
nt|blum1956: South still may expect that West has only 4 hearts|pg||
nt|jbgood: yes - it was a brave move by Arnolds|pg||
nt|pelu: so 4@h - no x in OR|pg||
nt|jbgood: if hearts are 4-1 E would have gotten a spade ruff long ago|pg||
nt|roswolf: this i think could well end up -2|pg||
nt|blum1956: If hearts are 4-1 this is an easy win|pg||
nt|roswolf: no not with this declarer|pg||
nt|blum1956: no more than -1 whatever South does|pg||
nt|pelu: no still hard work - and a possible @S-ruff as Jon said|pg||

nt|roswolf: yes but east fell from grace|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  French will be hoping for a gain there|pg||
mb|2N|nt|djneill:  the 1NT call won the board, as the other room overcalled 2@d, and could not reopen safely over 2@h - East too was too flat|pg||

pc|s6|nt|roswolf: the strength of vul opening bids is getting weaker all the time|pg||

nt|granguru:  hard to get there after north showed 5-5 in mjaors|pg||

nt|riccho:  2@d probybly some BAL wothout 4cM and 10+ or so|pg||
pc|c9|nt|roswolf: nor me|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Please adjust 24 to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: and he only promises 10-15 anyhow|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk4: 4SS=|pg||
nt|hajru:  I'm not sure if I can follow Cronier there.  She leads the @h ace, gets a positive signal and switches?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: udca?|pg||
nt|arno11: bal? and then N bids 4@C?|pg||
nt|eamongall: got the favourable but relatively normal lead |pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|roswolf: east might well play north for short diamonds here|pg||
nt|blum1956: Take the diamond lead, spade to the King and Ace, two heart ruffs, 4 clubs and finally a trump|pg||
nt|hajru:  So, who do you think underbid on this hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/frunda1.html|pg||
nt|blum1956: but of course in 4@s the plan may differ|pg||
pc|c4|nt|riccho:  I guessed before the 4@c bid :) |pg||
nt|hajru:  I have no idea why you'd call the S hand balanced in a strong club context|pg||
nt|arno11: as NS are playing a kind of polish club, the bid was either 1. 2@C  or 2. it showed @C|pg||
pc|c3|nt|granguru:  6@H is also possible to win..|pg||
nt|roswolf: well they have reached the slam|pg||
nt|granguru:  I think...|pg||
nt|roswolf: need to take a good view of the spade suit|pg||
nt|granguru:  interesting that W can only overruff @s with @HK|pg||
nt|riccho:  maybe S wanted to emphasize the "good" @d-suit?|pg||
nt|riccho:  2@d = @c sounds a bit funny|pg||
nt|riccho:  anyway: the contract is not very convincing, but successful|pg||
nt|hajru:  I think we can only guess at this stage|pg||
nt|arno11: if North takes the @C finesse we will come to 12 tricks via 4@C 4@D 3@H and the @S Ace|pg||
pc|c6|nt|granguru:  a lucky situation|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|nt|roswolf: hmm west made an interesting play|pg||
nt|hajru:  Why would you play the 7 from Q765 then?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|riccho:  say: probably convincing; the @c-finesse is not nadatory|pg||
nt|roswolf: probably north - south didnt know about the @D control|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|granguru:  noooo|pg||
nt|riccho:  mandatory|pg||
pc|dA|nt|roswolf: not going well|pg||
pc|d6|nt|granguru:  W was afraid to duck @c because of @S danger|pg||
nt|djneill:  North can't imagine South has the @hA and did not raise to 2@s with 3 spades|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmmm - idee fixee|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|h6|nt|roswolf: since west must have the spade ace for his opening - declarer is not in any danger|pg||

nt|arno11: teams full of star players like Lavazza, Brogeland or Gottlieb on their way out |pg||

mb|2N|nt|roswolf: support with support|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this is action bridge - where will the music stop?|pg||
nt|djneill:  example of how usually the weaker hand with a long suit plays better - honors from the strong hand are still relevant, but not if West declares - East's @d not so hot then|pg||

nt|vugraphpl8: I think E is very tired she forgot about lead..|pg||
nt|psyck: unavoidable to get to game here if you play light openings, unfortunately no chances as cards are here|pg||
nt|psyck: even if he contrives to endplay W, that will only push his trick total from 8 to 9|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  solid 3NT on 24|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think the dutch have been chastened into a more cautious approach|pg||
pc|s7|nt|roswolf: and a lack of a double:(|pg||
nt|teckh:  I think Gunn bid once to much|pg||
nt|hedyg: push EW to slam?|pg||

pc|s8|nt|roswolf: 11 more imps to goldcat|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||

nt|roswolf: the vul penalty may be good compensation|pg||
nt|granguru:  or -2|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  and friendly breaks|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|nt|roswolf: club switch looks attractive|pg||
nt|teckh:  I think Tor is too lucky now, 23 and a bunsch of J, and hte only value worth talking of is his spade|pg||

nt|jaapfr: but we see but E and N can not know that|pg||
nt|riccho:  still difficult to collect enough tricks here|pg||
nt|hajru:  Goldwater's rule: always accept a lead out of turn.  If they don't know who should lead, they probably don't know what to lead|pg||
nt|hajru:  Why, if you have no fit, then your honnors are in the other suits and you don't want to be dummy|pg||
pc|dT|nt|hajru:  If you take the @d a in the first round, you better know what to return|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|roswolf: should make an overtrick now|pg||
nt|roswolf: he has clues to the spade layout|pg||

nt|roswolf: well should have done|pg||
nt|roswolf: more exciting hands|pg||
nt|jaapfr: pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  could be landy, multilandy, woolsey, garozzo|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: north is fixed a bit now|pg||
nt|roswolf: rdbl |pg||
nt|hajru:  Agree, I don't understand the 4@h bid in the other room, if you are going to bid that, why not simply do 4@h over 2@s|pg||
pc|d5|nt|pbmarstr: 2 down probably|pg||
pc|dT|nt|roswolf: right on|pg||
nt|hedyg: E had a choice to bid 1@s or double first|pg||
nt|roswolf: blood will surely flow|pg||
nt|roswolf: practical bid by west|pg||
nt|jaapfr: first doubtful bid frnech|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt looks good without a club lead|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jbgood: and it is rightsided|pg||
nt|roswolf: unlikely lead from north|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|jbgood: must admit I would show E's hand as a strong NT - and gone down in 3 NT|pg||
pc|h9|nt|roswolf: north bid - spoilsport|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes N's blood when S can reach him?|pg||
nt|roswolf: identical auction at both tables|pg||
nt|psyck: As I pointed out at the start of this segment, the score here was entered as 42-22, but was 40-22 in official site.|pg||
nt|psyck: http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/r16runda1.html|pg||
nt|psyck: either way, it is a 1imp difference :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|roswolf: this looks ok|pg||
nt|spooky: this will be just made, South will lose 1@D more|pg||
nt|hajru:  That is not going to help the defence|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i agree with 2@S-3@H-3@S-Pass|pg||
nt|arno11: yes or 3@D all pass  both very safe contracts|pg||
pc|h7|nt|roswolf: :)female intuition|pg||
nt|pelu: no stopper in 2 suits, Jon|pg||
nt|hajru:  isn't standard in mixed pairs to tell the female player never to bid NT first?|pg||
nt|jbgood: do you really care?|pg||
nt|hajru:  sorry girls :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe std but wrong at this level|pg||
nt|blum1956: Not the best idea to open 1NT with 14HCP out of 15 in two suits (if the alternative opening bid is available)|pg||
nt|roswolf: good quality final - would be decent in an open event as well|pg||
nt|jbgood: yes - strong teams playing well|pg||
pc|h2|pg||

nt|granguru:  good decision by Dufrat|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hedyg: XX= i have a good hand, N can pass and let her bid again|pg||

nt|hajru:  Finland now 8 imp's ahead in total|pg||
pc|s7|nt|yorkbeach:  2@s looks fairly comfortable|pg||
pc|s3|nt|pelu: most of the female players are World Champs - if not all of them|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi, Jon, Benedicte Cronier did open 1NT here - and she will go down in 3NT|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|granguru:  2@H plays also good|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe some endplay on W|pg||
pc|s6|nt|roswolf: declarer needs not 5to try and ruff a spade back to hand|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s8|nt|jbgood: unfortunate|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  +1 probable|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|eamongall: it seems to be now 40-22 ... having been 12 imps to Balti then 7 imps to Balti and currently 10 imps to Balti |pg||
nt|psyck: but may not be clear to paly for it|pg||
nt|eamongall: maybe ruling as there is no score in as EW |pg||
nt|roswolf: yes indeed|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  remember you are watching the middle set of a 3-session match|pg||

nt|blum1956: 2NT is OK, 3 fails|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: some might go for 3NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: and go down|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps but i expect most to play 4@S|pg||
mb|3H|nt|roswolf: that is typical brian|pg||
nt|granguru:  EW have a clear advantage up to now..|pg||
nt|roswolf: very quick in this room|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphpl8: http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/frunda1.html|pg||
nt|roswolf: a good conservative view|pg||
nt|hajru:  I would not move over 1NT|pg||

mb|3S|nt|teckh:  strange bid wiht a single @c|pg||
nt|spooky: friendly lead, but don't exepct it to come in|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3nt no coffee time|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  6 boards in advance|pg||

nt|vugraphpl8: http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/frunda1.html|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 27+5 qualify for the Round of 32 tomorrow after five rounds of Swiss today. 27 from Swiss A and 5 from B|pg||
nt|pelu: this is standard frence bidding - whats wrong with that?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|psyck: i'd have expected 3@h instead of 2, but no problems getting to 4 anyway here|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  a jump to 6@h would end proceedings|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  more likely to go via 4NT|pg||
mb|4N|nt|blum1956: 4@h should be the @hA|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: thanks Roland !|pg||
nt|roswolf: absolutely nothing|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  agreed|pg||
mb|5S|nt|arno11: I guess reaching 3NT on bd 23 is not that easy many will go down in high @D contracts|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: brian has distinct views in the bidding and this is one of them - there are many negative inferences from the acol base|pg||
nt|granguru:  other room just finished nr.24...a tie|pg||
nt|roswolf: restart scheduled in another hour|pg||
nt|roswolf: have they agreed a suit as trumps?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @s but when South bids 6@h North should pass|pg||
nt|roswolf: spades it appears|pg||
nt|blum1956: no as North demonstrates the trump Queen|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|nt|spooky: Dummy is usesless now|pg||
nt|roswolf: THAT WAS ALWAYS LIKELY|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  so mst be @s as North has the @sQ but not the @hQ|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  time to trust partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: alert defence|pg||
nt|blum1956: They probably play 15-17 NT so d'Ovidio knows the maximum is 24|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: hmmmmmmmm it is a Mixed teams|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  nicely judged|pg||

nt|jaapfr: do not ask me pls|pg||
nt|hajru:  aren't we supposed to be the experts and explain this?  ;)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Suitplay says the right play in @s is low to the 10, so I suspect 6@s would have failed|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  do not think a trump coup would be available to recover the position|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jaapfr: how to show @H now|pg||

nt|hajru:  I'm still not sure why east rebid 3NT.  It looks like there are 2 ways to bid the north hand: stayman, then|pg||
nt|jaapfr: N|pg||
nt|hajru:  3@s (or 3@h smolen) over 2@d, or transfer, then 3@h. In both cases, south picks the right contract from |pg||
nt|hajru:  3nt, 4@h or 4@s. |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|roswolf: one of them is south is unlikely to have 5 cards in her suit|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|nt|hajru:  That is not the way to defeat 3NT|pg||
nt|jaapfr: E hopes are that pd has @DJ|pg||

nt|hedyg: it will break her heart?|pg||
nt|roswolf: i hope not 2 matches to go:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is a good win for goldcat|pg||
nt|hajru:  I still don't quite understand the ew carding.  Would he really lead the @d6 from J6xx(x)?|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  NS have the sensible agreement that the 1NT rebid shows a hand too strong to open 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: Hi Henk, jon and Geoffrey the spects dont like us - we have 450 and there over 2200 in OR ;(;(;(|pg||
nt|roswolf: spade lead!?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|pelu: :(:(:(|pg||
nt|hajru:  Yes, shows clubs.  X = 4 or 5 @s, 1@s is 6-9, 0-3@s, 2@h is weak with long @s.  |pg||
nt|roswolf: OH WELL WE ARE THE QUALITY NOT THE WIDTH:)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Don't fret you are doing a good job|pg||
nt|hajru:  At least, that is how the open team plays it.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I know a few kamikaze players who rebid 1NT with 12-14 on this type of auction :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jbgood: quite common these days, actually|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|pg||
nt|blum1956: that will be a struggle...|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I have bit more sympathy for Verbeek's decision not to lead her suit this time|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|dT|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  at least she is consistent|pg||
nt|roswolf: in which case leading a spade is i think best neither n/s bid them|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  bid (or show) @h but lead @c|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jbgood: heading for multiple overtricks now - will soon wish he was in 6@c:)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|nt|yorkbeach:  yes if South has the values to raise 1Nt to 3NT, she also has the values to X 1@h to show 4@s |pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|s6|nt|yorkbeach:  ergo she does not have 4@s|pg||
pc|h9|pc|s8|pc|sT|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
pc|dK|pc|h7|nt|yorkbeach:  and North might have X 1H if she had 4@s|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d4|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|chmitty: thanks to all kibs, players, fellow commentators :) see you soon for the last set|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ritong: the @c position saves them, but let s see if they can avoid the 5 level  would be well played|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|chmitty: restart in 28 minutes according to official schedule|pg||
mb|3H|nt|danilo1: since EW vounerable possible 1@H - Dble or ? - 4@H - P-P- 4@S ... all pass|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|danilo1: well, 3@H gives free action to North ... so 4NT expected now|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: wd bep|pg||
pc|h5|nt|danilo1: I do not agree with some 4@C bid (got lot of propositions) ... except if in System 150% clear cue for @S ... may cause confunsion|pg||
nt|ritong: it is 150% cue|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|yorkbeach:  vulnerability will put a dampener on this board|pg||
nt|roswolf: restart in 55 mins approx from now|pg||
mb|2H|an|.|nt|yorkbeach:  likely to be flat for 450 to NS|pg||
mb|3H|nt|blum1956: thx all, spectators, Joeffrey and Julian|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South is happy to show a two-suited hand knowing she has the values to bid again|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|blum1956: sorry Geoffrey))|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South might check on aces but 5@s is safe|pg||
nt|roswolf: south will show her second suit|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  better to cue 4@c|pg||
nt|blum1956: I am for  Blackwood|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes 4@c probably is her second suit rather than a cue bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes michael has a lot to commend it|pg||
mb|4N|nt|yorkbeach:  but still gives north the chance to cue a red ace if he has one|pg||
mb|d|mb|5C|nt|roswolf: south goes michael's way:)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West X to check whether NS have agreement but handling a X :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|nt|blum1956: the heart weakness discovered...|pg||
nt|pelu: also from a spec tx to Michal (operator) he had a hard job from start :)|pg||
nt|hajru:  Yes, thanks Michal.|pg||
nt|roswolf: the heart lead is telegraphed against 3nt - can east find the @HK?|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: not so bad|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: The NS probably will prefer 5@c or 4@s|pg||
nt|pelu: nice to find the @H-weakness - but if s over 2@D just bid 3Nt then a snall @H in lead|pg||
nt|hajru:  We'll never know|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@C or 4@S?|pg||
nt|jbgood: 5 @c an interesting contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  no mistake|pg||
nt|roswolf: np and the play will be quick as well|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h7|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|pelu: only for us - not for S :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: must spurn the black finesses and end play W to win?|pg||
nt|blum1956: only the very special plan brings this home|pg||
nt|pelu: a bet? - I know I owe u 1-2 cokes Jon :)|pg||
nt|hajru:  The @h lead looks obvious and then west can play @h at every opportunity|pg||
nt|blum1956: you're right Jon|pg||
nt|roswolf: THIS WILL NEED ACCURATE TIMING TO ACHIEVE THAT|pg||
nt|jbgood: ok - all in for a downer:)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|pelu: No Jon u had the winning plan :)|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|dQ|pg||

nt|blum1956: bye all|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  usually wetter in Wales than London|pg||
mc|11|nt|jbgood: as a spec says: "yes . it will eventually go down. When ou have a 75% line, it's hard to reject it"|pg||
nt|hajru:  Yes, who would blame E for leading a small heart after 1N-2C;2D-3N|pg||
nt|blum1956: 12 out of 13 as only the @hK lead may disturb))|pg||
