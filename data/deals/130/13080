nt|buffytvs: NS did bid the 6@D slam in the otehr room -- good bidding at both tables|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Jagniewski-Kwiecien also bid the diamond slam on 27. Well done to both pairs|pg||

nt|royhughes: Practical bidding by Hampson, in my opinion|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|buffytvs: actually, as the specs point out, the 5@D response left him now ay to ask for the queen :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  maybe though he could have set @h as trump and then used "redwood|pg||
nt|royhughes: I always thought, hey, why can't trumps be 2-2|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the heart 10 means that if key card is heart ace the suit wil be favourite for no loser without the Q -and the Jack may be there|pg||
nt|henryb:  the @hJ would make the slam decent. still not good but decent|pg||
nt|royhughes: Also, when the opponents are silent suits tend to break better than their initial odds|pg||
nt|royhughes: However, there is still one more trick to be found, even with trumps 2-2|pg||
nt|buffytvs: even when they are vulnerable and have no high cards?|pg||

nt|ady: hot favorite if trumps 2-2|pg||
nt|dburn: and whereas that heart suit alone is slightly more than 50% to play for no losers, the other handling charges mean that this is not in theory a good slam|pg||
nt|sybarra: and lucky landing |pg||
pc|d5|nt|dburn: in practice, of course, a good slam is one that makes, so this was a first-class slam|pg||
