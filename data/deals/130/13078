nt|Walddk2: Buras-Narkiewicz|pg||
mb|d|an|6-7, any shape|nt|kiwibridge: a delicate Moyse made in the other room (4-3 fit)|pg||
nt|brolucius: 25 points or not, it seems that 3NT will be a struggle for North-South.|pg||
nt|roswolf: action already|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2H!|an|pass/correct|nt|bgn: cute auction in other room - after 1@C artificial, 1@D negative, eaast was forced to bid a 3 card major|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bgn: y - either weak NT or strong any|pg||
nt|qwikjanz: 11-13 balanced type or 17+ hand in other room|pg||
nt|brolucius: South has 11 points in his short suits and they have only one 10 and one 9 between them.|pg||
mb|d|nt|kiwibridge: 1@C art on a flat 11?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: they may try to take a penalty here|pg||
nt|lml: I don't really see a reason for North to move unless the dbl isn't penalty oriented|pg||
nt|roswolf: agree|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kiwibridge: and bidding the 3 card major denies 11-13 flat? good methods|pg||
nt|roswolf: flat hand suggests pass|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: That must be take-out for the minors.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bgn: the reverse - with 11-13 have to bid better major over 1@D|pg||
nt|lml: I suppose the double UNDER the bidder was more cooperative|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm now how will Geoff win 9 tricks?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: they're discussing what doubles were/would have been now|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugrapha3: S in tank|pg||
nt|bgn: since 1NT over 1@D is strong NT|pg||
nt|qwikjanz: Hard to see partner having an entry even if they hold 3@D|pg||
nt|qwikjanz: so to duck or not?|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|brolucius: That's a bit late...|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|bgn: true - so maybe best to win this and hope partner has @D6 - as he does :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 6 a good card|pg||
nt|finch: It looks as if North thinks double is take-out (but if so why didn't he double 2@H?)|pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: no, NS conceded 1400 in their 3-2 club fit |pg||
nt|finch: 6@C by South is the spot - it's slightly safer than 6@C by North|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|kiwibridge: LOL|pg||
nt|mdgraham: bit of a bidding misunderstanding, it would appear|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: singl dummy 6@C is a good contract|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: And double dummy|pg||
nt|finch: double showing a major-minor canape is quite popular in England as well against a strong NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: yes I usually change it out against a weaker notrummp range|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt is a bit stultifying|pg||
nt|lml: I suspect quite a few people do|pg||
nt|brolucius: Stultifying? Excellent word, Geoffrey!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: I don't know what 3@d is yet|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: this should drift off a couple|pg||
nt|finch: He's shown a slam try with long clubs, probably correct not to push more if South isn't interested|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 4@D looke like keycard|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: looks if they will at least try for glory|pg||

nt|roswolf: and attain it - well done|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, a nice effort. Looks like we are in for a high-class match.|pg||
nt|brolucius: (Famous last words...)|pg||
nt|finch: South has a huge hand opposite a club slam try - they have an easy 13 tricks, once the ace of clubs is knocked out (!)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: the double wasnt really that effective in interferring with the auction.  He might have got more juice from 2@D|pg||

nt|roswolf: yes a fine table to watch|pg||
mc|12|nt|roswolf: speed of play good too|pg||

nt|mareczek: N has shown some slam ambitions with 6+@c|pg||

mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|mareczek: ho confirms this opinion|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|jallerton: South has a good hand for clubs so it's easy to move, less easy to work out with what|pg||

nt|mareczek: 4@c natural, good hand to play in clubs|pg||
nt|mareczek: 4@h, 4@s cue bids|pg||
nt|jallerton: Yes, 6NT is very hard to bid as you need cards like @hJ and South's 4th heart|pg||

nt|bgn: does Nunn run?|pg||
nt|finch: There's little benefit usually in playing a 2-minor overcall as natural as it hardly prevents the opponents finding a major suit fit|pg||
nt|roswolf: where will this end up?|pg||
nt|lml: yes I know... its just that double doesn't do much|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|bgn: harder to double a major, so he pretends he has 5@H|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am proud to say that I came 6th out of 17 on the latest bidding panel for the Polish magazine, despite not understanding the first thing about Polish Club.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Modesty has never been a strong point of mine.|pg||
nt|roswolf: passing a lot or using the red card!?|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|roswolf: very restrained|pg||
nt|finch: If NS get to 5@D it may not be obvious to EW to cash out|pg||
nt|finch: although having it played by South is probably a bad thing as the strong hand will hit in dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Doesn't 3@D now show the hand, more or less?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfd: Greco: no problem|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: director call now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: west said he didn't know what double meant|pg||
nt|brolucius: I can barely believe that North allows 3@C to play with that diamond fit.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Who hesitated?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: it looked like penalty to greco|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh that|pg||
nt|finch: Many people would play that double as penalties, I assume that is North's problem|pg||
nt|finch: ...now he's seen the dummy|pg||
nt|buffytvs: so it seems as though 3@C will depend on how he plays the trumps|pg||
nt|roswolf: west might well take out a penalty double anyway|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|sA|pg||
nt|finch: West has no reason to take out a penalty double. Clearly they both thought it was take-out, or at least suspected it ought to be|pg||
nt|buffytvs: not so sure about that -- he has 7 clubs and very litlle defense|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think n/s are huffing and puffing if they try to win the board on a ruling|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: e/w claim that they have never discussed this auction|pg||
nt|finch: He has an ace and a king outside clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: On this auction a pair at this level should have an agreement on something this simple|pg||
nt|brolucius: Surely most players would treat the double as take-out. Why not?|pg||

pc|s6|pc|sT|pc|sK|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s9|nt|buffytvs: I agree with Roland -- this isn't an unusual auction, they must surely have discussed it|pg||

pc|c8|pc|d3|nt|bgn: 6 tricks, flat board (I think)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|buffytvs: and n/s are right - there could be a generic agreement that undiscussed dbls under the bidder are t.o., for example|pg||

nt|brolucius: He could have asked about the double, couldn't he? Rather than passing and calling the Director.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: greco asked before he passed|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: thx Alex, great job|pg||

pc|s2|nt|roswolf: simple bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Trump lead is best but declarer can still prevail|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@H, rather than a try, is a bit forward, but South would have accepted anyway.|pg||
nt|kit: 4H is my kind of try -- bid game and try to make it|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|s5|pg||
nt|roswolf: on bd 3 n/s played in 2@H|pg||
nt|finch: Only works in a style where opener won't raise on 3-card support|pg||
nt|roswolf: IN THE OTHER ROOM FOR A USEFUL SWING|pg||
nt|finch: Here opener would accept any game try anyway|pg||
nt|roswolf: sorry:(|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not so loud, Geoffrey.|pg||
nt|brolucius: I was told that you had had the shift-key repaired a while back.|pg||
nt|kit: even if clubs misguessed, declarer in principle has 6 hearts, 2 clubs, and 2 spades, but collecting these tricks may be another matter with the 4-1 heart split|pg||
nt|finch: I think declarer may well need to get clubs right not to end up in trouble|pg||
nt|roswolf: true kit|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|nt|kiwibridge: can he/will he get this one right|pg||
nt|mdgraham: can South signal for spades at trick one... |pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|pg||
nt|kit: he may be able to play along crossruff lines and get 7 hearts, 1 club, and 2 spades|pg||
nt|finch: the diamond lie is such that he has a trick by force if he picks it, which also protects his holding|pg||
nt|kit: but the diamonds lie very badly for that -- however 10 of diamonds coming down may help|pg||
nt|finch: if he could see the opponents' hands it would be easy... on a trump back win in hand, play a club up|pg||
nt|kit: East has a difficult problem now -- will probably shift to a trump as least of evils, though he fears letting declarer score a small trump trick|pg||
nt|finch: If West rises, he has three club tricks and if West ducks he can cross-ruff the way you suggest with two high ruffs in hand|pg||
nt|finch: sorry on a trump back win in dummy.  I'm used to South being declarer!|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|nt|mdgraham: yes :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so a bit of pressure on West|pg||
pc|dK|pc|h5|pg||
nt|bgn: probably - he's known to have exactly 3@H, so 7 was probably suit preference|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: lost play guys, my apologies.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: exactly|pg||
nt|poohbear: just get us a result thanks|pg||
nt|bgn: forcing Nunn to play K under it|pg||
nt|bgn: sorry - private|pg||
nt|kit: this tells declarer the diamond position, as well as setting up the 9 of diamonds|pg||
nt|brolucius: West gave a (reverse-) count signal of his lowest diamond on the first round, but it seems that East could not read him for six diamonds.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|vugrapha3: making only 10 tricks |pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|h9|pg||
nt|brolucius: Letting 3@C play on the earlier deal (3) did indeed cost North 6 IMPs.|pg||
nt|kit: declarer is getting good picture of hand -- and may place West with ace of clubs since East passed initially|pg||
nt|kit: so he may play heart to ace and club off dummy -- if he does that, he will definitely make|pg||
nt|finch: Do EW open all balanced 10-counts?|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|cA|pg||
nt|kit: he has clearly decided to play East for jack of clubs, and will thus be successful|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, in about 10 minutes time, I'm sure he will be.|pg||
nt|buffytvs: 4@H at the other table got a trump lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: I hope I'm not being too optimistic.|pg||
pc|d8|nt|finch: it's only a vulnerable game, not really worth thinking about |pg||
nt|finch: West eventually decided he didn't know what to do, and went for the 'trust partner's defence' approach|pg||
nt|finch: If Greco has decided to play East for the CJ he can ruff high and run the @C10|pg||
nt|kit: well leading back a diamond can hardly be wrong whatever the hand is|pg||
nt|buffytvs: looks like any reasonable line gets him home now -- but he doesn't know that, of course|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s3|pc|d4|pg||
nt|kit: he could go down if he plays for hearts 3-2 and leads heart to ace|pg||
nt|roswolf: rehi|pg||
nt|finch: while taking a losing club finesse goes down if it loses to the 3-card club suit and a club ruff comes back|pg||
nt|kit: although even then he can still recover by tossing East in|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes with a trump.|pg||
nt|finch: but East's spade discard implies he didn't start with a low doubleton club I think|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|finch: West's nine of hearts by itself doesn't mean anything more than he was dealt it|pg||
nt|kit: seems clear to go up ace of hearts now -- he can't risk losing to 109 doubleton and defense getting diamond ruff|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|finch: normal to rise ace I think|pg||
pc|hK|pc|d3|nt|brolucius: Running the @C10 was dangerous too. This line seems OK.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h7|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d5|pc|sT|pc|hT|pg||
pc|c7|nt|finch: yes, he still needs the club finesse but had no real choice about that|pg||
nt|roswolf: moment of truth|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well, it was worth waiting for. An interesting ending.|pg||
nt|kit: well he can play West for AJ doubleton, but that is way against the odds|pg||
nt|buffytvs: i don't think he'll do that|pg||
nt|finch: also surely his spade discard implies he wanted to keep something in clubs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: he almost said the word small under his breath|pg||
nt|kit: East would never have discarded a club from any 3-card holding|pg||
nt|brolucius: He may think that East would exit with a spade if he held @CJ-x now.|pg||
nt|finch: I think he knows the ending is basically double-dummy now|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|nt|buffytvs: wd|pg||
nt|kit: why would East ever exit with a spade?  He doesn't know where jack of spades is.|pg||

pc|sK|nt|brolucius: 3@H was rather ambitious, wasn't it? He did find partner with an ace and is still too high (particularly after this lively defense).|pg||
nt|kit: big difference between playing in 3@C and 4@C.  In 3@C, he could have gone up king of clubs, ruffed a diamond, and had 9 tricks.  Here, he will be going down 2.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
nt|finch: that's the problem when you can't double for penalties on the first round|pg||
nt|kit: in his defense, he expected the club queen to be on if needed, and his partner could have had more.|pg||
nt|buffytvs: In the other room, West played in 1NT, a contract not available to him here :)|pg||

pc|c8|pc|hQ|pc|s2|pc|s9|pg||
nt|brolucius: With a 14-16 hand against him, the minor suits and no stopper in hearts, he would need quite a bit from partner to produce a game.|pg||

mb|4S|nt|roswolf: this is getting hairy|pg||
nt|buffytvs: wonder if NS will play spades now?|pg||
nt|kit: North thinks they might have 4-4 spade fit -- but From South's point of view, maybe 4-3 fit is right|pg||
nt|brolucius: South can guess that North will not hold too much in hearts and there may be a good fit somewhere.|pg||
nt|finch: if 3@H was game forcing, then arguably double should show a singleton honour|pg||
nt|finch: and North has already shown not much in hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: don't go to bed until we see the score for 23 :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Surely you need double just to get the auction moving again.|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer will be pleasantly surprised by the 3-2 trump break.|pg||
nt|finch: it's a bit awkward if trumps are 4-1 which must be more likely after the 4H bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: may be a pause now|pg||
nt|kit: even better than the 800 they could have collected vs. 4@H|pg||
nt|finch: the Polies in the other room as in 5@D so there will be a swing here|pg||
nt|brolucius: North is in 5@D at the other table.|pg||
nt|finch: it's not easy to get 800 out of 4H, needs fairly precise defence|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d5|nt|kit: I think 2 rounds of diamonds ending in hand, claiming if diamonds 3-2 -- if 4-1, then club finesse|pg||
