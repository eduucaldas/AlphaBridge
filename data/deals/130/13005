nt|cicus: I don't think so|pg||
nt|lestergold: low level part scores only here i suspect that someone will declare and go negative here|pg||
mb|2C|nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: without a spade lead/[layed by south it may make|pg||
mb|p|nt|pdjourdain: might declarer read this and drop the king?|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: It looks like 4 clubs, three spades and 1 trick in each other, but not easy timing|pg||
nt|cicus: I think 2@S or even 3 making|pg||
mb|2S|nt|lestergold: Murdoch has correctly downvalued his two bacl Qx is|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: n/s have been playing together for around 40 years|pg||
mb|p|nt|dohicky: :) They had 15 year break at one point|pg||
nt|jackthelad: stunningly beautiful Edinburgh|pg||
nt|barnets: probably one of the longest running partnerships in bridge|pg||
nt|barnets: ok|pg||
nt|barnets: i played against them as juniors|pg||
nt|lestergold: black doubleton qs neither of which are pulling their weight|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: yes i was expecting a further effort fromN/S but they are ta ufavouravle and south's hand was rightly devalued|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|cicus: good decisions by all|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|pdjourdain: West switches a heart and then the hearts run, so declarer needed to play club ace at trick one|pg||
nt|qwikjanz: ducking this will ensure contract makes|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Well done Pat Shields|pg||

nt|athene: but it was never very likely :)|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: 4@S normal|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|athene: it looks as though you have to get diamonds right to make eleven tricks here|pg||
nt|athene: i guess east will get a bit squeezed in the minors|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|athene: if you concede two clubs and then cash the @HA and run the trumps, that should solve matters|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|athene: north really likes his hand with all his high cards working hard|pg||
nt|justin c: hope he doesnt like it too much|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|athene: but slam is likely to need partner to have a doubleton club or five diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: as well as all the right cards|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|justin c: i see lots of ways to make 11|pg||
pc|s5|nt|pdjourdain: two keycards plus trump Q|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps it's a little bit unlucky - if south had the same hand with 3-4-4-2 it would be a fair slam|pg||
nt|justin c: not sure what he will try here|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|justin c: but in any event, ducking a @C is going to be necessary|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|pc|sQ|pc|s6|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: it's interesting how you play it - of course declarer knows it's almost zero - percent|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sA|nt|athene: duck a club, then run the trumps |pg||
nt|athene: then hope to run the diamonds and effect a club-heart squeeze maybe|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|justin c: something like that|pg||
nt|athene: needs someone to have @HKQ and 4+ clubs|pg||
pc|s8|nt|athene: and the diamonds to come home|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|h2|pg||
nt|athene: maybe that's not so bad after all :) zero percent was certainly a bit pessimistic|pg||

nt|dohicky: taken|pg||
nt|qwikjanz: Interesting hansd - right play in spades is somewhat dependant on how aggressive a multi is played|pg||
nt|dohicky: A fairly heavy defeat about 30-40 imps|pg||
nt|lestergold: opps couldnt get at their 4 tricks single dummy|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|lestergold: 3N makes 9 top tricks wikth the clubs breaking|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|barnets: so england are now in the lead ?|pg||
nt|dohicky: I would guess so, i don't know the other scores and the website hasn't been updated|pg||
nt|lestergold: but with a combined 23 game not that likely to be bid 5@d might run into difficulties with spades 4/2|pg||
nt|lestergold: will Greenwood back in here no!|pg||
nt|sheila a: EW look to be able to make game here, possibly|pg||
mb|2S|nt|dohicky: it wasnt a multi :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind you 4@s loses 2@s and a club|pg||
nt|cicus: strange that E is not bidding his spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: east can show both suits like this|pg||
nt|cicus: spade length is concealed or strength overvalued later|pg||
nt|lestergold: was not a 3@d overfcall avaiolabkle to west|pg||
mb|p|nt|pdjourdain: another Multi and N must bid his void!|pg||
nt|qwikjanz: N sitting there hoping opps will bid :)|pg||
nt|dohicky: I'm told by the cbai president that it was a 24 imp loss for 19/11|pg||
nt|chick: NS play a weak NT system, as you can see|pg||
mb|3C|nt|sheila a: W was obviously put off by the vulnerability|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 4@h cold this may be expensve|pg||
nt|sheila a: Hoped that partner would be short in @c and able to re-open|pg||
mb|4S!|nt|cicus: but it may well go in accordance with their agreements|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N also cold as south can establish but not menjpy his clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|pdjourdain: Declarer should scramble 8 or 9 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: a @s lead causes more problems|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: the x  for the lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: his hand in my opinion is too good to put that amolunt of pressure on his partner at unfaviourable|pg||
nt|lestergold: i predict this will cost them a lot of imps|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lestergold: well west has chanced game and they will egt an excellent result for their optimism|pg||
nt|cicus: not a particularly good game as both minors should break|pg||
nt|lestergold: west knows hia Ks in partner's two suits are working well however his er club stop four to the eight is perhaps not that robust|pg||
nt|cicus: by choosing X as his first call, E has practically endplayed his side into game|pg||
nt|lestergold: very robust wehn opps cl;ubs are breaking tho 4/4|pg||
nt|lestergold: i like that ides of being ebdplayed into game!!|pg||
nt|cicus: game is about 25 %|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@s tho was much sounder as it makes even when clubs do not break as long as dims break and spades no worse than 4/2|pg||
nt|cicus: you need 38 % for vul games so it is not that poor|pg||
pc|d7|nt|pdjourdain: He can ruff all three spades|pg||
nt|barnets: i think it takes a club lead to beat 6@S|pg||
nt|dohicky: England beat NI 25/5|pg||
nt|barnets: interesting play in 6|pg||
nt|dohicky: yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think west should have bid4@s if he was going to bid game|pg||
pc|d2|nt|barnets: so here|pg||
nt|barnets: when dec leads a heart|pg||
nt|barnets: east can win and play another club|pg||
nt|lestergold: i mean how silly do you look when they cash first 5 clubs?|pg||
nt|cicus: I would look rater silly for my partners|pg||

nt|lestergold: caps lock at it again|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|nt|cicus: light but normal X by E|pg||

nt|lestergold: 2@c some kind of lebensohl?|pg||
nt|chick: EW play a strong 1@C with 1@D negative|pg||
mb|p|nt|dohicky: Making 3NT looks quite possibly given the @s position|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: but this is OK|pg||
nt|barnets: anyway 8 to ireland on board 1|pg||
nt|lestergold: obviously diamond bid shoing hearts and values|pg||
nt|cicus: transfers have become very popular after intervention - even without|pg||
mb|d|nt|pdjourdain: East should bid 1S in case West has both majors|pg||
nt|dohicky: West would have opened 2@c with both majors so that isn't really possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: oh maybe this is not a coffee hand after all maybe the coffee wil get spilt|pg||
nt|lestergold: north will now like his hand its very slammish|pg||
nt|lestergold: i have a suit to bid but my hand not good enuf to try for a game|pg||

mb|p|nt|dohicky: at least 4/4|pg||

mb|p|pc|d2|nt|sheila a: I guess W could have said something else to indicate a different hand type (ie if he was stronger)|pg||

pc|d5|nt|pdjourdain: interesting whether oppo know East would not show spades|pg||
nt|barnets: today anyway :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: south should sign off now knwoing that his great dim vaslues buy a singlteon opposite and his hearts arec not that great|pg||
nt|cicus: N would have done better splintering with 4@Ds|pg||
nt|cicus: if it does not show a void in their methods|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but effectively he did at the 5 level but partner soldiered on into the valley of death|pg||
nt|lestergold: charge of the l;ight brigade the hearts being rather light|pg||
nt|chick: with such a nice fit, and knowing where all the high cards are, this should make overtricks|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|pg||
nt|cicus: worries of E are over|pg||

nt|dohicky: Hi Eamon|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|pdjourdain: Strong club 1@D|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w can make 3@h n/s only two spades|pg||
nt|chick: I would expect EW to find 3N after the strong club opening|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|p|mb|1H!|nt|sheila a: there is debate as to whether you should play penalty doubles over a strong NT|pg||
nt|sheila a: if you don't it can be hard to let partner know you have a really good hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|pdjourdain: dble shows 3 hearts|pg||
nt|eamongall: looks like one off to me in 4@S |pg||
nt|dohicky: yes|pg||
nt|cicus: another coffee?|pg||
nt|chick: should make on any lead, with 5 clubs and 4 diamonds|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|lestergold: n/s vulnerable so dangerous  now for south to re neter but he has|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|pdjourdain: should just make|pg||
nt|dohicky: I wonder would NS have found 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: this was vey well done n/s|pg||
nt|barnets: to scor their plus|pg||
nt|barnets: and reach the par contract|pg||
nt|barnets: it was tempting for both north and south to take different actions|pg||
nt|lestergold: lucky to find his partner with spades and a few meagre values if east had this instead he could be walking into penalty territory|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lestergold: well he has done a lot of bidding ion his 16 count and bad spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cicus: this is fool-proof against any distribution, E will have to play on spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: one off|pg||
nt|sheila a: it should work out ok|pg||
nt|lestergold: ok but oe off|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|nt|chick: S finds the best lead, but E will just cash out his 10 winners|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: dims ruff heart switch cant get the heart loser away as east can ruff in|pg||

mb|1S|nt|justin c: would rather try 4@S|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2S|mb|3D|mb|4S|nt|athene: the only explanation i can come up with for the closed room auction, is that EW play kaplan inversion but west forgot it|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|cicus: both major games playable here|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5@c e/w or even 4@s makes|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|pdjourdain: both 3N and 4S OK|pg||
nt|dohicky: Do they not play a 14-16 NT?|pg||
nt|sheila a: Walker keen to get the majors in if possible|pg||
nt|chick: E has a light opening, but with both majors, is definitely worth bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: west may x 2@H|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|lestergold: heart save could be too expensive ev en at these colours|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: e/w 4 of either major 6@h if the heartq is guessed - unlikely|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh|pg||
nt|lestergold: greenwood doing the club jumping that seems saner|pg||
nt|chick: unfortunately, I don't have the convention card for EW, so not sure what 1@S shows (in addition to spades)|pg||
mb|2N|nt|lestergold: that makes moire sense|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: e/w can make 5@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w close to slam only clubs lie wrong for it|pg||
nt|sheila a: I think we've got a pass missing|pg||
nt|lestergold: r/s doing a good job of muddying the waters|pg||
nt|sheila a: presumably pass from S, 1@s from W|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: it is not a bad contract with all the cards marked in south|pg||
nt|sheila a: East's pass would be forcing in this situation|pg||
mb|p|nt|pdjourdain: +530 was on Board 15 to be scored later|pg||
nt|dohicky: 5@c looks like it might just scrape home too|pg||
nt|sheila a: pass then bid showing more values than an immediate bid|pg||

nt|pdjourdain: Hi|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Patrick :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: i predict 11 tricks|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: can either establish spade or more simply ruff one dim in dummy and just lose a spade and a trump|pg||
nt|cicus: sure, after a @D ruff normal play is @H|pg||
nt|lestergold: on this lead well |pg||
nt|cicus: @HA|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|barnets: as i pointed out in the last board|pg||
nt|barnets: n/s got too hgh in the othe room|pg||
nt|barnets: bidding to 5@D|pg||
nt|barnets: which was x|pg||
nt|lestergold: nolw a question of which denomination and what level?|pg||
nt|chick: hard to believe they lost the massive 9 card spade fit|pg||
pc|dT|nt|pdjourdain: If west wanted East to bid 3N with a diamond stop he should have bid 3H|pg||
nt|barnets: a swing to ireland|pg||
nt|barnets: the efffect of the 2N bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6 now cold|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|Walddk10: Welcome to David Synnott|pg||
nt|dohicky: Hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: dunno what the contract is going to be here ,,, maybe low level @Hs EW |pg||
nt|lestergold: well ineresting situation hedre|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: difficult hand to bid here|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|pdjourdain: The singleton 9 of spades helps declarer in 4S|pg||
nt|eamongall: maybe 3@Ds can slip thru via @H ruff|pg||
nt|barnets: Scotland overbid the last board to 4@H with no values and are playing it xd|pg||
nt|lestergold: the eight card major fit is off due to the bad heart break but 4@s is cold|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: another not-so-nice fitting hand|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: strong club|pg||
mb|1N!|mb|p|nt|eamongall: hard for Brian Short to stop at 2N|pg||
nt|barnets: this is down 1 as is 3@H|pg||
nt|eamongall: and if he plays NT it might only be 5 tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk5: You are invisible|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|dohicky: With both AQs offside 3@h looks to be -1 |pg||
nt|cicus: also 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: maybe this is a Zia style bidding competition hand|pg||
nt|chick: W again with strong club, another alerted 1S, but I bet they get it right this time :)|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|pdjourdain: 3H splinter|pg||

nt|dohicky:  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdv: this is Sandie I have lost my vugraph operator, very careless|pg||
nt|dohicky:  I think declarer can probably see their way to 7 or more tricks|pg||
nt|eamongall: but I don't know how this NT goes ... 3@S 2@Hs a @D ...maybe it can slip home |pg||
nt|eamongall: I don't think it will be more David if at all|pg||
nt|dohicky:  you might be able to get a an extra @C and @d eventually|pg||
nt|eamongall: but opps will be at least 6 tricks by then |pg||
nt|vugraphzdv: declarer looking at a,9@s and QJ5 @h in dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzdv: trick 4 all at moment|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk10: Welcome to Vladimir Ivanov|pg||
mb|3C|nt|cicus: but 4@S is best as @D may break unevenly|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n of course no problem as dims break but a little strange with neither hand having a diamno9nd guarfd|pg||
mb|p|nt|pdjourdain: or just good raise in spades|pg||
nt|eamongall: I believe screens are now in use at Camrose events|pg||
nt|eamongall: Willem asks |pg||
nt|dohicky: They were when it was in the Republic last time|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||

mb|p|nt|cicus: E treated his @Hs a s4-carder|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: hi David|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|lestergold: mind you again only doomed on  a diamond lead!|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|hT|nt|xenya: but now S is squeezed|pg||

nt|cicus: whatever the range|pg||
nt|sheila a: that's rare |pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Normal 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: some think that failing to oepn balanced hands in the no trump range with  NO TRUMP MAKES THE BIDDING AWKAWD LATER ITS OFTEN DEBATED IN THE BRIDGE MAGS|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzdv: will put in scores in other room at end|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lestergold: PERSONALLY IM IN FAVOUR OF OPENING ALL BALANCED HANDS WITHIN THE RABNGE WITH A NO TRUMP ALTHO I ACCEPT THE OCCASIONAL DOWNSIDE|pg||
mb|p|nt|dohicky: Seems like an easy enough 4@s|pg||
nt|eamongall: seems to be about enough to assemble a 3NT contract for NS |pg||
nt|eamongall: 4@S will do also and maybe safer |pg||
nt|lestergold: caps lock agin sorry|pg||
nt|cicus: however I dislike opening 1NT with 5cM, I have to admit that it works most of the time|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think instinctively we all dislike having to open a no trump with taght sort of hand i think it is a matter of partnership style and preference|pg||
nt|sheila a: 4@s makes here when the @d come in|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: 14-16 NT in 4th seat this is too strong|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|eamongall: but I see quick routes to 9 tricks in 3NT |pg||
nt|eamongall: however as David says ...4@S is a place to play|pg||
nt|chick: NS play a weak 12-14 NT in all but 3rd seat according to their cc, do you know otherwise?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|eamongall: the scots getting a little high now |pg||
nt|lestergold: well now we have a no trump openiong with a 4225 which is not a balnced hand in my opionion|pg||
nt|lestergold: the double fit may encourage game to be bid same ten tricks in the spade 5/2 fit as the dim 5/4 fit tho|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: perhaps E's opening will keep NS from bidding 6|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|dohicky: Could be tough to stay out of slam now|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Drury response but it doesn't have 3@H?|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Sorry, when I partner Gary he has to play 14-16 in fourth as well!|pg||
mb|p|nt|pdjourdain: Most now bid 2S rather than 2C though not the French!|pg||
nt|eamongall: no major pitfalls when the long trump chap has 4333|pg||
nt|eamongall: and the lead scoops out the @DK location |pg||
nt|eamongall: although bidding had told most of the story|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: well if they bid it, they will likely make it |pg||
nt|xenya: declared by S|pg||
nt|dohicky: Yes a @s lead seems unlikely|pg||
nt|eamongall: oops missed the @DT ...4@Ds is makable |pg||
nt|eamongall: thanks rafal|pg||
nt|dohicky:  Yes you can discard a @s or @c on a @H|pg||
pc|d2|nt|pdjourdain: No, can't be Drury with weak NT|pg||
pc|d3|nt|cicus: it would never occur to me to open this one 1NT|pg||

nt|sheila a: I have to leave you, now. Have fun for the rest of the match!|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lestergold: well a missed opportunity but cant accuse them of underbidding maybe Greenwood should have raised the second bid to 3@d |pg||

pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: seems more natural to do so to me|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: nor me it is clearly a club opener unless you have systematic problems and play a club system where clubs dont mean lubs|pg||
pc|h3|pg||

nt|cicus: I do play a club system where this hand is opened 1@D|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|pc|d9|nt|qwikjanz: and that style of bidding makes it harder to duck the @S|pg||

nt|pdjourdain: He thought he was showing a maximum perhaps|pg||
mb|d|nt|barnets: e/w do well in clubs|pg||

nt|cicus: on 7 Scotland did open 1NT but still arrived at 4@H|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Yes i would open 1@H on north|pg||
mb|2S|nt|chick: typically the X shows the ability to double one of the opp's suits|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: until he goes several off!!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|pdjourdain: 2N for the minor|pg||
mb|3D|nt|qwikjanz: bd 6 wales played 3N and scores are tied :)|pg||

nt|barnets: need to lead a @D to stop 5|pg||
nt|dohicky:  you have an extra pass Sandie|pg||
nt|eamongall: 12 in @Ss|pg||
mb|d|nt|dohicky: A spec points out on a @s lead W needs to keep the 9@c to save E from being squeezed|pg||
nt|eamongall: well theres the @Cs into the auction for Ew|pg||
nt|eamongall: might even get 12 tricks in @Sa|pg||

nt|pdjourdain: I didn't realise spades was a minor suit:)|pg||
nt|chick: just for today :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: and some @Hs too ...this double has multi functions|pg||
nt|barnets: now 5@C|pg||
nt|eamongall: vulnerability will not stop Walker ..|pg||
nt|eamongall: at least I typed before auction ended|pg||
nt|cicus: all my Drury sequences follow this course|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: well done|pg||
nt|eamongall: we are encouraged not to use Dave and Adam etc on BBO |pg||
mb|p|pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|eamongall: I think he will use the insurance 5@S |pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: And Wales has the best of Boards 15 and 16|pg||
nt|lestergold: note that even with both finesses wrong and a heart lead a ht discarder on club and third heart ruffed in dummy would make the contract|pg||
pc|dA|nt|eamongall: bugger ..Mesbur for once bid quicker then I type |pg||
pc|d3|nt|eamongall: Normally I will by 1 minute |pg||
nt|eamongall: I win ..|pg||
nt|barnets: so we dont get to see if n/s would find th lead to beat 6@C|pg||
nt|eamongall: one off ...is not bad if one is not finding the @D lead |pg||
nt|lestergold: and may well followm this line as a precaution in any case|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Surely South doubled this too|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like it|pg||
nt|chick: only down 2, but a disaster Vul|pg||
pc|dK|nt|barnets: yes would thye bid 6@S ? over 6@C |pg||
nt|dohicky:  Probably just 10 tricks now |pg||

pc|c5|nt|chick: I would certainly pass the 2@S bid after S's original double -- why risk disaster?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|dohicky:  or maybe not|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c4|pg||
pc|d8|nt|eamongall: me too ...|pg||
nt|chick: partner chose spades, that's all I would need to know|pg||

nt|chick: the missed 4@S on bd 6 cost them 11 imps|pg||
pc|c9|nt|barnets: in other room e/w did not bid|pg||
pc|s7|nt|barnets: so this is the first swing to scotland of any size|pg||

nt|chick: yep, I have never understood swinging, but it happens|pg||
nt|chick: he might actually make this contract |pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: so roland would be in slam as its better than 12.85%|pg||
nt|cicus: what if S now leads a heart and promotes N's K9x?|pg||
nt|cicus: (not on this hand of course)|pg||

nt|pdjourdain: So now we have to say well done not doubling, but there was a better defence|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: We will find out later if it was doubled|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|barnets: 11 imps to scotland|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: Greenwood will need to be cautious but experience has shown that these boys tend to bid any gamne they sniff|pg||
nt|cicus: E worth a game try though|pg||

nt|cicus: has to put @H shortness into the picture|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|eamongall: However Mesbur and Fitzgibbon have been around for many showers of rain ...so they know how to bid |pg||

nt|chick: or just pointcount?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|eamongall: this 3@S appears 1 off|pg||

nt|pdjourdain: 1NT nat|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H!|nt|lestergold: I do not believe this Short floating the double with the square root of zilch defence byt massicve offensive dtrength|pg||
nt|lestergold: a very poor result for the scots|pg||
mb|p|nt|pdjourdain: West must pass|pg||
nt|cicus: W chickened out, not wanting to make them save|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|barnets: cards lie welll for dec here|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|dohicky:  Looks like 8 tricks in @h for EW too|pg||

mb|p|nt|cicus: in which case he felt he would not know what to do|pg||
mb|4S!|mb|p|nt|barnets: can actually make 11 tricks|pg||
mb|4N|nt|pdjourdain: diamonds pips good gives 10 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: in any case im surprised that short passd the spade opener there is something wrong about th is bidding|pg||
mb|6C|nt|pdjourdain: In dangerous territory now|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: DD|pg||
nt|cicus: so a medium size swing to be expected for Scotland|pg||
nt|cicus: and W has even let this make|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: past the point of no return and playing in a 4-2 fit|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Presumably East thought 2@C was checkback and West thought it natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: altho the final contract doubled is within the realms of what we see regularly in these matches|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Alternatively the bididng needs correcting|pg||
pc|c9|nt|xenya: all quite reasonable i think --  9 tricks|pg||
nt|chick: complex bidding agreements may work well as intended, but they sure do mess up a lot of hands when you forget them|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: He is lucky in a way that no slam makes|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: But you should stop in 3N|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|chick: true for sure.  but I think normal bidding of 2N 3@D 3@H 3 or 4N should keep them|pg||

mb|p|nt|dohicky: True :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: I expect 3n making 4 |pg||
nt|lestergold: lsoing 2 spades and a club|pg||
nt|lestergold: if i was playing this id win in dummy and play a spade to start with not wanting to get an early diamnond switch from east|pg||
pc|d2|nt|pdjourdain: probable 9 tricks|pg||

pc|d3|nt|dohicky: This should be -2 now|pg||

nt|barnets: it is though an excellent contract|pg||
nt|barnets: and west should have done more|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|lestergold: but 3N or 4@h both laydown|pg||
pc|c3|nt|eamongall: em em |pg||
nt|dohicky: 3@s makes things very difficult|pg||
nt|eamongall: Adam Mesbur did not bid 4@S |pg||

nt|barnets: can th op tell us the final contract ?|pg||
nt|eamongall: I read all the hands ...now I am reading the stories |pg||
nt|dohicky: interesting|pg||
nt|eamongall: for results etc ...start at www.nibu.co.uk and navigate to Bangor Bridge Congress page |pg||
nt|vugraphzdv: Hands seem to be transposed?|pg||
nt|lestergold: when you see both hands of course 3n is a better contract but unbiddable compared with the obvious 4@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzdv: Lead Jc|pg||
nt|lestergold: then certainly transposed|pg||
nt|lestergold: unless Liz u are already on the l.ocal tipple|pg||
pc|c9|nt|barnets: undo ope|pg||
nt|dohicky: There's an extra pass operator|pg||
nt|eamongall: they are doing more ...just in the wrong seats |pg||

nt|cicus: well it was a bit strange that E opened 1@H then rebid the suit...|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|barnets: east must have bid 4@S|pg||
nt|barnets: now 4N from west|pg||
nt|eamongall: it will sort itself out eventually |pg||

nt|lestergold: after ace of clubs id play spade perosnally but as dim is right no harm done|pg||
pc|h2|nt|barnets: well i think 6@H can be made|pg||
nt|barnets: if dec plays for 6@h tricks 2@C 1@s and 3@D|pg||
nt|eamongall: well I am not arguing with Barnet Shenkin ...I was reading a book recently about playing with experts by the same guy :) |pg||
pc|hT|nt|xenya: yes on both points -- but it would be too much to expect S to let them play 5@D|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm south on lead? this gets curiouser and curiouser|pg||
nt|cicus: board is shifted 180 degrees plus bid out of turn?|pg||
nt|lestergold: i doubt bid out of tuen more likely 180 degrees|pg||
nt|cicus: but dealer shifts as well|pg||
nt|cicus: or am I totally confused?|pg||
nt|lestergold: I must leave for a while folks and look forward to being back for next stanza|pg||
