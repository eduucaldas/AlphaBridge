nt|othered1: Interresting that south in CR passed 1@H, with 3 trumps and an ace|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|roswolf: snap|pg||
nt|bende:  Double would have shown 17+ on last board, so west had difficult finding a bid.|pg||
mb|3C|nt|othered1: Guess it's just normal in Sweden|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: how can North be worth 3@C facing a partner who couldn't respond to 1H!?|pg||
nt|othered1: 3@C looks odd to me|pg||
nt|roswolf: not a fan of this auction|pg||
nt|roswolf: quite|pg||
nt|othered1: and taking @S out of the picture, as well|pg||
nt|ralfwil: neither me:)|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||

nt|haans: Commentators: Rashed Nabi Malik, Jos Jacobs, Hans Sjöström|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Hans and welcome everyone|pg||
nt|sybarra: Good afternoon everyone and welcome back to Linköping in Sweden for the District Championship. Nine rounds of 24-board matches. This is the first half of a match from round 8|pg||
nt|daman: Good morning from Canada|pg||
nt|sybarra: and hello from Wash. DC |pg||
nt|sybarra: hi George:) |pg||
nt|daman: Hi Shirely|pg||
nt|sybarra: bright and early for us |pg||
mb|1H|nt|lestergold: hi everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: hi Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: another close gam,e off on a badly placed ace over a king a lot of them today like this|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone @H@H|pg||
nt|chick: S is already thinking slam here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's a handicap event, so the underdogs, the OS.se team, has a 20 IMP advantage in the first set|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Hi Gary, Haans welcome|pg||
nt|sybarra: daylight time in effect here, so short 1 hour of sleep|pg||
mb|2D|mb|d|nt|josj: gm all|pg||
nt|haans: looks like an easy 4@H|pg||
nt|josj: and gm Hans, Gary and Rashed :)|pg||
nt|josj: maybe good afternoon to Rashed :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: so cautious bidders lucky day|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont know their methods but 3@h should be a weak bid in most modern styles|pg||
nt|peachy: I think S will pass, no shape|pg||
nt|lestergold: as 2@s avaialble to shopw a good raise which of course north has|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 9pm here :)|pg||
nt|josj: gm all again|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good morning all.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|peachy: I would tend to agree, in competition weak|pg||
nt|josj: sorry Gary :)|pg||
nt|haans: Multi has been around for many years but ...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Good Morning Jos, net speed is slightly slow today:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: south should pass whatever the 3@h bid means|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 01.00 PM at my end|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: The underdogs won't lose on this board|pg||
nt|lestergold: and has but we must remember that in general not bidding 50 ish percedntage vul games is not a winning strategy|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello again!|pg||
nt|peachy: it happens to be makeable|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello Ralf|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes of course diamodntakes care of a  spade|pg||
nt|peachy: I meant, game happens to make|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello Raija|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgefederation.se/filbyter_bridge/resultat/fc10/fc_main_en.htm  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|daman: normal contract|pg||
pc|d9|nt|haans: 2@S say pass with spades  but i have hearts|pg||
nt|josj: yes that's what it should say|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Usually game interest the way we play it in NZ|pg||
nt|josj: and it did...for W at least, that is|pg||
nt|sybarra: even I would find the 2 @H bi,  nothing else to bid with S |pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: well it wont surprise me if game is bid in the open|pg||
nt|santyclz: 6@h doesn't have any pitfalls, 6@ss is in danger if the defense starts with 2 rounds of @cs.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: Welcome back to the 2nd session of 4 from this semifinal. In the other semifinal, the favourite team San Sac made a impressive 56-7 against Lirarna. Lirarna had 14IMP as a ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: handicap, but that´s gone already|pg||
nt|chick: hello Everyone :)|pg||
nt|josj: hi Mike|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@S likely transfer to clubs, 2NT accepting with good clubs |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hi Jos|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 2@S = clubs, 2NT = accepting|pg||
nt|josj: yep|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: all up to East here|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|Walddk2: 12 was flat. 4@S -1½ in the other room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: minus 1|pg||
nt|lestergold: soemtimes game declared by north beaten out of hand on spade lead then|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|peachy: This event has teams handicapped as I understand|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|chick: theoretical danger, but not as the cards lie, I think|pg||
nt|santyclz: Right.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kiwibridge: ?|pg||
nt|haans: counted right|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: not everyone plays 4 card majors|pg||
nt|peachy: NS here are the underdogs|pg||
pc|d7|nt|josj: once W failed...|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|santyclz: 3/3 @ds solve any potential problms.|pg||
nt|chick: 3-2 hearts :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|santyclz: That too.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|nt|josj: declarer can make it now but he does not know|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|chick: if E could both make dummy ruff AND lead a heart to knock out entry, then it might be tougher, but he can do only one of those|pg||
nt|haans: right|pg||
pc|hK|nt|santyclz: Defense would be so much easier if they would let us lead 2 suits at the same time.  Maybe we should write a letter.|pg||
nt|chick: nah, if it were changed, then someone would want 3|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: it would be easier to be declarer if you could play two suits at the same time too.. I always seem to run out of entries for my finesses.. :)|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|pc|h6|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: quick starting board, trying to keep themselves ahead of the other table :)|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|nt|Walddk2: Frissan's 17 IMPs are handicap points, the lesser ranked team against a higher ranked|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|d8|pg||
pc|c9|pc|dJ|nt|chick: Hej Staffan :)|pg||

nt|ralfwil: A little bit mor problems with a neutral defence. But possible to figure out|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|1H!|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|bende:  1@c=12-16 any unbalanced or 15-17 balanced.|pg||

nt|ralfwil: but after @hQ it was too late|pg||
nt|peachy: right|pg||
nt|chick: my guess is that Bd1 will be flat|pg||
nt|chick: missing a game is not a great start|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: In  this semifinal, OS.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: .se had 20IMP in handicap at the start, but after a tough session Team Zang is now in the lead |pg||
nt|josj: and keeping us busy|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 6red suit here can they find that|pg||
nt|josj: so Zang likely to further increase their lead|pg||
nt|daman: tah dah|pg||
mb|1C|an|17+|nt|peachy: EW headed for 3NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w have a chance in 3N on a non diamond lead|pg||
nt|josj: what's wrong with a grand?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: slam time and grand |pg||
nt|mdgraham: leading partner's suit is easy. West might very well have led a spade, holding a singleton heart, but when you do not lead partner's suit you have to be right |pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: which might make from W|pg||
nt|chick: this one, on the other hand .... :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Happy International Womens Day, Cornelia, specs of the female persuation and all the ships at sea.|pg||
nt|daman: looks like 4@H|pg||
mb|1H|nt|kiwibridge: not a lot :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: Thank you, Joe :)|pg||
nt|haans: may be to hard to find this slam|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|peachy: unless diamonds shown somehow by S|pg||
nt|josj: also very true...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: NS play 1@C 17+|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it could be said that there is a good case for a spade lead, as hearts are unlikely to run, but again, not particularly easy at the table  |pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|chick: not sure what 2N asked, but they found their way to a makeable contract|pg||
nt|haans: all cards working|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk4: Linköping is the main city in the county of Östergötland in southern Sweden with around 100,000 inhabitants|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 2NT was most likely forcing with support|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: probably will make @d lead un,likely natural to play club finesse for J thru north etc|pg||
nt|pelu: 23-level looks like max - so fight on 3-level :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 1@D 0+, 1@H/@S 5+|pg||
nt|josj: too high for either side, the 3-level here|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Staffan, how do they figure out how many IMPs the weaker team gets in advance?|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade most likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: @h10?|pg||
nt|chick: nice lead, but not obvious to S I suspect|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hey y'all, gl everybody|pg||
nt|chick: 2@H was showing 2 suits?|pg||
nt|sybarra: 9 off the top here |pg||
nt|sybarra: and probably one more in the slush |pg||
nt|daman: yep toppers     but 4@H looks better|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzpx: Think so, 5-4 at least and a decent opening hand for a 11-16|pg||
nt|chick: Merhaba Hamdi :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: There is probably a formula|pg||
nt|peachy: high from dummy and start clubs|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rnmalik: 7@D better contract|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure its as easy to get there |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|peachy: well, I would have:)|pg||
nt|pelu: some would open 1NT in S - and then 2@S from East - passed out|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: well hes going to make it whether or not that was the best start|pg||
nt|santyclz: Suggested (to me) by the 97x in dummy.|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i am not a system maker, however at first glance seemed a bit wide HCP range|pg||
nt|chick: they are playing a precision-like strong 1@C 17+|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|h4|nt|lestergold: clear cut overtake of diamond not that it makes any odds now|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|h_karluk: very good|pg||
nt|sybarra: we may be in a cashing mode |pg||
pc|c4|nt|haans: well done i say|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: as often 7 becomes too hard to reach|pg||
nt|josj: it looks as if S might have bid 5@D rather than 5@H|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kiwibridge: 5@D instead of 4@H may have helped|pg||
pc|cA|nt|nilsland:  There has been a qualification, maybe that has decided the handicap|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it is always odd, on hands like this, that players are so, so reluctant to defend  |pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: E-W is playing 2-way club, either 11-13BAL or 17+|pg||
nt|chick: now 2 spades and a high crossruff|pg||
nt|haans: yeah but 4@H = nothing extra|pg||
pc|hT|nt|josj: in that case, 5@D stands out once N goes on|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: KQ@D looks a bit extra after slam try by pard|pg||
nt|josj: over 4@H|pg||
pc|h9|nt|daman: making good use of the cards|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h8|pg||

nt|chick: thanks Staffan|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d6|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|haans: agree 5@H for cue |pg||
pc|d4|nt|josj: not enough trumps to compete at the 3-level, the Law says|pg||
nt|pelu: Now I know why they dont like to defend :)|pg||

pc|s5|pc|cT|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|nt|Walddk2: Mats Sjöberg's daughter, Emma, is a member of the Swedish ladies team|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: the IMP advanage is based on the swedish hcp system.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rnmalik: with 4441 as S I would bid 1@D first and 7@D would be on|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|nt|roswolf: 1 of the downsides of systems which specify ranges for bad hands is the clues it gives to declarers on hands like this|pg||

nt|bucheister: there are those hands|pg||
nt|pelu: ????????????????|pg||
nt|sybarra: so probably a push|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: The open room has lapped us.|pg||
nt|chick: 2C 2N should find them the spade slam easily enough|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Grand slam you mean|pg||
nt|chick: hey, we get to see other table results for a change :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: should be aflattie tho|pg||
nt|lestergold: even  spade lead wont help much|pg||
mb|1N|an|14-16|nt|Walddk4: Very disappointing that a strong club top pair did not bid it next door|pg||
nt|haans: none play 1@D first and then jump any more. Does anyone?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: and Mats Nilsland will be playing for Sweden seniors at the European Teams Championships this summer. Good luck to him!|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: but 1@C was alerted |pg||
nt|josj: usually, 1@D neg. shows 0-7, I assume|pg||
nt|haans: many have jumpt to 3nt missing slam|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@S lead-directing|pg||
nt|pelu: would u open 2@S in N? - not me|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no|pg||
mb|3N|nt|chick: yes, Roland, easy to set up clubs for a heart pitch|pg||
nt|sybarra: can actually make 3 nt  |pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: no except if playing 2-suiters|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not with six to the nine|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  thx |pg||
nt|ralfwil: On a @s lead to @sJ S should play @sA, not the @sQ|pg||
nt|bucheister: Would be a great time to win the J with the A|pg||
nt|peachy: maybe this would be time to win the spade with ace.... since diamond finesse needed into W|pg||
nt|lestergold: we can predict play win cash top dim enter dummy with club take @d fionesse and then west has no chopice but to switch to a heart|pg||
nt|peachy: heh, you gues are faster typists|pg||
nt|santyclz: My kind of grand.  No finesses, only 1 line and it works.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: That hand with both majors is special|pg||
pc|hK|nt|nilsland:  More exciting if East had ventured 3 NT|pg||
nt|nilsland:  would south find the diamond lead|pg||
nt|chick: but such a perfect fit is not always easy to uncover|pg||
nt|sybarra: close eyes and hold breath......after @H's cashed |pg||
pc|h3|nt|h_karluk: Staffan, east relative of Johan, any idea ? |pg||
nt|sybarra: just ask is k of spades on side,  and next |pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|pg||
nt|chick: now makes perfect sense, simple Jacoby/Stenberg 2N|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: hmm have no idea actually :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|daman: maybe after laying down the @H Ace|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Very strong team. Morath-Flodqvist (Tjolpe), Nilsland-Dahlberg and Bjerregaard-Gullberg. They would have done very well in the Open event I am sure|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Now heart ace is not so good|pg||
nt|daman: nope|pg||
nt|josj: lucky layout for EW in @S amply compensated by bad @C break|pg||
pc|hT|nt|daman: anything but a @H|pg||
nt|daman: clearly 3@S was not forcing|pg||
nt|nilsland:  This will be a good board for the underdogs|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
pc|h5|nt|josj: wd by N|pg||
nt|pelu: what did they have for breakfast? :)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i wonder on the way grand or just slam|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pc|h4|pc|h8|pg||
nt|chick: think they can find the grand, hamdi?|pg||

nt|chick: I blame W for not finding 7, she can see everything she needs to count to 13 tricks ... only danger I can see is 3 small clubs with partner and no 2-2 split|pg||
nt|chick: ruff 2 spades (all trumps are high), draw trump, and pitch last spade on club ... time to claim|pg||

nt|josj: minor suit slams are always difficult to reach and this should be another example|pg||
nt|mdgraham: assuming North has six spades, he is known to have 10 black cards and two hearts|pg||

nt|lestergold: 2@h meaning?|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  Pity it will not make due to the spade lay|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unfortunately the 4-0 trump break dooms it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Very unlucky, it's a 95% slam, roughly|pg||
nt|othered1: aThe stiff @D devalues south's hand slightly, but it still has enough extras to push on.|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh sorry I may have them confuse then  |pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: I guess, dont dare ask about their age :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|daman: maybe they will avoid the trap by peeking :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: as you can cope with all 4 with West|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The correct play in spades is the queen first|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Many get that wrong and they never notice|pg||
nt|Walddk2: because it usually does not matter|pg||
nt|josj: of course, but even if N does not hold a sing. @D the 10 is "unnecessary"|pg||
nt|sybarra: like S,  I agree with not using stayman with a 4333 hand |pg||
pc|c5|pc|cT|nt|lestergold: ah too quick with his enormolus hand |pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: spade  support, better than 2sp|pg||
nt|h_karluk: nowadays 20-20 layouts rare, we may see an elegant solution|pg||
nt|josj: did W have 2@H available here as an opening bid?|pg||
nt|josj: now the @H are lost|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|nilsland:  You have to learn it "the hard way"|pg||
nt|lestergold: if west has shown a good raise in spades then east should beexploring because his hand becomes enormous|pg||
nt|peachy: if he went to game, might as well have splintered or done something|pg||
nt|pelu: with 5-2-2-4 stille a small @D |pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|nt|h_karluk: interesting lead from KJx tenace|pg||
nt|haans: i think 2@H/2@S both roman|pg||
pc|hA|nt|othered1: south will have to push this the rest of the way|pg||
nt|lestergold: lazy sign off basically|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Now  south know the heart ace is missing|pg||
nt|nilsland:  since N didnt cuebid 4 H|pg||
nt|nilsland:  And East will surely lead hearts...|pg||
nt|haans: old carrot style|pg||
pc|hK|nt|chick: this could even make an overtrick, because diamonds can be set up pretty easily|pg||
nt|h_karluk: perhaps a passive trump trick would more safe|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mdgraham: playing four-suit transfers, you can have 1NT-2@C-2x-3@c/@D natural and forcing |pg||
nt|pelu: spec: can u help with the bidding?|pg||
nt|josj: nice question, Peter: help us with the explanation or help the players? |pg||
pc|h4|nt|nilsland:  man or mouse? Man - it seems|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder if north's 4@C control bid was forced or whether it implies slam interest (good trumps are a plus).|pg||
nt|josj: that's what I would think too...|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|pelu: both :)|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|d2|nt|lestergold: club splinter cant cost|pg||
nt|josj: I see now :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 2@h = relay, 2@S = minors|pg||
nt|josj: ty Joel|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 3@D = good @D, 3@S = Q|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ah, science|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: The fact that the 9 is with AK makes the slam 5% better, from 90 to 95% (half of the 4-0 breaks)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 2@C was shape-asking|pg||
nt|pelu: so only the jump to 5@C was "wrong" - the slam need 3-2 in both minor, so 5@C is Ok|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let's see what Eklund does|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Barrling rather|pg||
nt|josj: if E can open his rubbish, the why doesn't W open his nice hand?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|h_karluk: sorry *lead - pls ignore trick word|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ralfwil: I prefer 2nt from W as a very strong invite  and E can jump to 4@c|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, they have missed a decent slam, but at least they have also missed 3NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: although slam is noting great|pg||
nt|mdgraham: *nothing|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: hear hear|pg||

mb|5H|mb|p|nt|othered1: 3@S asks for aces (old-fashioned ACOL and American Standard).  West denies then east cue-bids 4@C and west is obligated to show @H control and you're there.|pg||

nt|nilsland:  a club lead was called for|pg||
mb|5C|an|1/4|nt|chick: with N showing a minimum 17+, and holding small xx in both partner's suits, I think S got too brave with the 4@S bid|pg||

nt|josj: not easy for NS to get to 3NT now|pg||
nt|haans: what does x show?|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: I would say points|pg||
nt|josj: don't see anything else|pg||
nt|josj: W should not be tempted|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S down|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lestergold: 20/20 hand and a misfittin g one too|pg||
nt|lestergold: scope for someone getting into trouble here|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: wonder if 2@C is specific for these suits?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: No, sp + one|pg||
nt|rodal f: Was sorrely black at last board:)|pg||
nt|haans: doubles flying around but ...|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry - my mistake :(:(:(|pg||
nt|josj: curious: how can N hold a @C void, an opening bid and no aces?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|othered1: This should keep them out of NT|pg||
nt|nilsland:  S has a problem, much extra values, maybe a double?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@D to play opposite spades and diamonds I assume|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: West must correct if he doesn't have diamonds as the other suit|pg||
nt|chick: I'm surprised N didn't show his support for @Hs|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/   lets you watch as many vugraph rooms as you want - one window per table|pg||
nt|rodal f: P from N a force P|pg||
nt|haans: nope|pg||
nt|haans: easy make|pg||
nt|josj: well, -470 is less expensive than -500|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: West's D explained as penalty|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Walddk2: ouch|pg||
nt|lestergold: on this occasion unl;ikely to improve contract of 1N|pg||
nt|chick: he can't hope for penalty in spades|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@h=transfer to 4@S|pg||
nt|josj: as usual :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: if pitch the @S, E can just keep 3 hearts instead|pg||
mb|2N|nt|rodal f: And S took 10 Red Bulls|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: I mispredicted again, but why would south bid 3N?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Vg in your timezone: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php  Make it your home page!|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes,  guess it really didnt matter,  had 9 tricks in the bag|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: What was 3@C I wonder|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Why 2@s? 2@h is free|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: well, there is still hope they get to slam|pg||
nt|haans: thats very true :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: unmakeable of course, but at least a good try|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Cornelia always use to be right there:)|pg||
nt|pelu: 9 tricks in @s and @h - so the fight is on 5-level :)|pg||
nt|josj: :):):)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: win club swirch and K@d cant be enjoyed|pg||
nt|josj: low @H now saves a trick, uppercut!|pg||
nt|sybarra: this may be more than a challenge |pg||
pc|c9|nt|josj: Father, forgive them :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: I can not get to 9 tricks |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk4: All half-time scores at   http://www.bridgefederation.se/filbyter_bridge/resultat/fc10/fc_main_en.htm|pg||
nt|chick: yes, I'm always in great slam contracts that are unmakeable :)|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|lestergold: yep best defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think this p[robably headed for two off|pg||
nt|lestergold: whats delay here?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: south is thinking for some reaseon|pg||
nt|daman: the unbid suit factor|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c5|nt|othered1: some kind of counterdefense to 2@C?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|frankaus: re all|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but I don´t like this type of thinking|pg||
nt|santyclz: Well, I don't understand the auction but this hand will not send people swarming to learn the system.|pg||
nt|chick: hehe|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 2NT was forcing to 3@C, 3@D asked for short suit with C supp, then cue, cue and uhm.. well..|pg||
nt|haans: x showing 15-18 not bad agrement|pg||
nt|daman: is leading the 8 back playing East for 10xxx?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|daman: I would have led the Q! back|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|nt|lestergold: well three off now maybe|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @hJ????|pg||
nt|peachy: three for sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: we call it 'eating her own childrfen'|pg||
nt|rodal f: A speciality for the most of us?|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|haans: CORRECT?????????|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vugraphzpx: yes|pg||
pc|s7|nt|nilsland:  3 C was probably a normal raise. South did not whether W had diamonds or hearts really|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: Frissan has lost all of the advantage, and plenty more :(|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the only way to lose 3 @h tricks by his own|pg||
nt|chick: welcome back Frank|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They have not recorded a single IMP so far|pg||
nt|othered1: NS should take a good look at their methods, since a common type of intervention gave them no chance to focus on what's important on this hand.|pg||
nt|nilsland:  If double was take out that would solved the problem, but this is a siatuation that surely was not discussed|pg||
nt|santyclz: ... and uhm |pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|dK|nt|lestergold: is it her?|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|santyclz: ... the wheels fell off.|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s9|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|nt|daman: looks like NS have different carding methods|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lestergold: 300 minus on a part score hand is not too great|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|chick: wouldn't surprise me if EW were getting pretty frustrated by now|pg||
nt|chick: they have yet to win an imp in this session|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: W was clearly frustrated when she bid this|pg||
nt|daman: pretty simple defense now|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h3|nt|chick: for you latecomers ... the 20 IMPs for OS.se is the handicap they started with|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d2|pg||
pc|cK|pc|h5|pc|cQ|pc|c7|pg||

mb|p|nt|othered1: Thanks also to the Filbyter Bridge Club and Carl Ragnarsson for bringing this event to  BBO. |pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Play will resume after a short break, perhaps 10-15 mins|pg||
nt|chick: and N overruling his partner ... he would hate to find out that his partner has 6 spades|pg||

nt|lestergold: and i think pushed n/s overboard|pg||
nt|peachy: N bid again.... I am amazed, in 4-card major system|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lestergold: north has not got a vestige of a 3@h bid |pg||
nt|peachy: not impossible to make though, if guessing the lead is singl|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|nt|pelu: MACH comming back - Zang bid 5@C X over 4@S - 1 (-300) and missed the grand|pg||
nt|josj: might be difficult for W to lead a @D now|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|othered1: Previous hand emphasizes the need to h ave "metaagreements" on handling 2-suited overcalls, so you  have some basis for action if one pops up against you.  A much better use of ...|pg||
nt|othered1: your time than concocting schemes to find third round controls on high minor suit auctions, etc.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well east is nowm glad he was cannily quiet|pg||
pc|c2|nt|nilsland:  6 @C may be the answer says Zbych from Poland|pg||
pc|s3|pc|cA|nt|rodal f: Agree and would been a desaster, but argue with the odds and sucsess?|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|lestergold: well whether or not it was for the right reason he got the play right|pg||
nt|peachy: more hearts please|pg||
nt|chick: knowing that E has only 4 spades, S should keep pushing the hearts|pg||
pc|cK|nt|nilsland:  Or even 6 @H :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|othered1: @D tap won't beat 6@H?|pg||
nt|nilsland:  yes|pg||
nt|nilsland:  as usual :)|pg||

nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|othered1: Auction stopped low enough, befitting a 20-20 HCP break.|pg||
nt|bende:  They play sys on after 1@c by north so 1@d is nebulous (8-16).|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Lirarna is Swedish slang for "The Players"|pg||

pc|cT|nt|daman: and South found a reason not to raise|pg||

pc|s8|nt|peachy: After GF spade raise, S has all suits sontrolled first or second round. Even if N hadn't South still would|pg||
nt|lestergold: well another 13 imps into the bottomless pit|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but they still have tio be confident of 13 tricks controls are only part of the story|pg||
nt|josj: yep, let them sweat it out|pg||
nt|josj: NS seem to have reached the proper contract here, wd so far...|pg||
pc|d4|nt|peachy: the first part, yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: first three bids same in open room then the auctions took different directions|pg||
nt|lestergold: and sadly  a differfent destination|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|pelu: wd by NS - after 5½ bidding-round|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|nt|othered1: OK, perhaps sub-optimal shape for a double|pg||
nt|daman: well   4414 would be ideal I suppose|pg||
nt|sybarra: I imagine that was sigh of relief |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|josj: entry position awkward now|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|nt|lestergold: thios is where you pray that west is the one to show out on the spades|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: We do not live in an ideal world. You've got to bid the cards you are dealt|pg||
nt|santyclz: Whoa, OS:se gained 10 imps while I was gone!  (OS:se supporters, I do take bribes...)|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|d9|nt|nilsland:  If you are waiting for an ideal hand you wil have to pass most of the time|pg||
nt|daman: exactly|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|s2|pg||
nt|lestergold: should be fined for slow claims|pg||
nt|sybarra: can endplay E now |pg||
pc|cA|nt|chick: OS.se isn't doing well at all, but they are hanging in pretty well and trying, not going nuts with silly swing bids|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||
nt|daman: I would have doubled 1@D with the North hand|pg||
pc|c6|pc|dT|pc|c7|nt|haans: endplay|pg||

nt|mdgraham: give East a 4342 hand and there is no fit, but I suppose you wouldn't really want to sell out to 2@S, although it could be the right thing to do |pg||

nt|lestergold: well coffe break hand now|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: Last board of the session now, OS.se needs some good coffee after this one :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: Great job by Staffan Hed, our excellent vugraph operator!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this has been a very exciting set of boards|pg||
nt|josj: 137 imps in 23 (24) boards is good going but...|pg||
nt|josj: 21 only, so far|pg||
mb|1C|an|17+|nt|haans: clubs = they do not bid 3nt|pg||
mb|1S|nt|peachy: a long coffeebreak, last hand:)|pg||
nt|josj: in OR W opened 1NT with 3 unstopped suits...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: that kills thoughts of 3N|pg||
mb|d|nt|nilsland:  East will probably raise with Kx in spades and nothing in hearts|pg||
nt|santyclz: Vg in your timezone: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php  Make it your home page!|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to Cornelia and George (who had to leave)  my co commentators,  always fun |pg||
mb|2N!|nt|nilsland:  EW also have to win by at least 17 imps :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: that is a very 'disciplioned' pass by east ok if ur p[artner will almost always protect|pg||
nt|lestergold: now east will come seriously alive|pg||
nt|pelu: same start, but after 4@C Souths asked with 4Nt - 3Aces and 7@S - he knoiw that his singleton @DA was 2-3 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx also to the Swedish Bridge Federation and the club for bringing this tourney to BBO |pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk4: Thanks Staffan, Cornelia and Joe|pg||
nt|josj: yes, that's what S here should have done too|pg||
mb|3S|nt|othered1: Funny, both room began with board 11?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgefederation.se/filbyter_bridge/resultat/fc10/fc_main_en.htm  for the tournament website|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: hmmm  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Staffan forgot to instruct them :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: in my university days boards with only a single figure swing rated as flat  |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: had been my choice|pg||
nt|josj: lol|pg||
nt|josj: sort of advanced goulash, Mike?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: wea re wiser now - and more than a bit older, too|pg||
nt|josj: the latter is definitely true :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: must be some spade raise  (the 2nt call) |pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 2NT = invitational w/ @S|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: I'm afraid Mr Dylan was wrong when he said that he was so much older then|pg||
mb|4C|nt|Walddk4: Second half after a short break|pg||
nt|josj: I think this needs a quick @H shift|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: I wonder if he was looking for slam?  Why else 2H first if he was going to 4 anyway|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s9|pc|s3|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Now 3 spades seems high enough|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: game over|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: Eklund doing all he can to encourage a club switch|pg||
pc|c6|nt|josj: yup|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 11 much needed imps|pg||
pc|cA|nt|zbig1959: K@C, and small @D shift? (deafeat it)|pg||
nt|chick: should have an easy time making this, so a few imps picked up here|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|daman: duh|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: First @H2, then the jack rather than the king, but partner refuses to ruff in :)|pg||

pc|d8|pg||
nt|santyclz: Yes, @d back does as well though that's tougher.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Walddk4: Is there any chance that Staffan or Tommy might provide us with the halftimescore in the ohter match when second half starts, SanSac-Lirarna?  (I got from a spectator)|pg||
