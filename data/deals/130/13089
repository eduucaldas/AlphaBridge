nt|dinos1: mb S opened?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: The Nickell team is adept at recovering IMPs and this should be an interesting match.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|daman: EW might be coerced into sacrificing over 4@H|pg||

pc|c4|pg||
nt|sybarra: not the worse sac in the world |pg||

nt|daman: on a @C lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: chip's note says 3+@H and a lot more I can't read upside down|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Meckstroth asks about strength of 4@H; Michel expects less than an opening hand|pg||
nt|sybarra2: welcome back to Reno |pg||
nt|kareno: Declarer misguesses (looking for safety) at trick one.  Now a club shift is imperative for the fourth trick.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr a bit late but hi all|pg||
nt|kareno: Shirley :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: noisy in here, not all matches have started play.  at several tables players are explaining methods to their opponents|pg||

nt|ahollan1: underlead @SA works too|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nice to see u all:)|pg||

nt|kareno: Allan ;)|pg||
nt|amr: good evening Karen and all the specs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: meckstroth has his hands folded, looking down|pg||

nt|fabsayc: there was a squeeze for overtrick on last hand i believe|pg||

nt|reisig: I bet 6@s -1|pg||
nt|phil: 4@C is a big bid|pg||
nt|dinos1: 4@c ... too much|pg||

nt|amr: not the right time to get busy unfortunately|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|2D|nt|bridge_one: 3@H 1 down if defence find the ruff in @D|pg||
nt|bridge_one: ruff in @S|pg||
nt|daman: would any of us bid with the North hand?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: chip is thinking about it|pg||
nt|sybarra: not fitting pards suit? |pg||
nt|daman: they can make 10 tricks in @Ds|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@S is mixed raise in @H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but @CQJ should be devalued, so is possibly a bit, er, forward|pg||
nt|harmon: this could be bloody|pg||
nt|hlortz: meckwell are not known for beong shy ...|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, it's a pretty reasonable 3@d bid.  Very unlucky if they manage to double him.  As north I would just bid 3nt directly.  I don't look for penalties at adverse vulnerability.  ...|pg||
nt|kareno: Worst case, partner can't reopen :(|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: meckstroth grabs michel's convention card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=@H & @S|pg||
nt|panja: NS good for 9 or 10 tricks in @S|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3D|nt|daman: and @Cs|pg||
nt|dinos1: in 6@s dcl will misguess @s i thk|pg||
nt|amr: why Hamman probably not take the chance in Open room|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: they have a preprinted WBF style card but were required to fill out ACBL-format cards for this even|pg||
mb|p|nt|robbg: I don't love overcalling on a 5 card suit with 3 in the opp's suit. This is a good suit.|pg||
nt|daman: but @Ds woulod be easier|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|kareno: Really?  Bessis slamming opposite short diamonds in south?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/    lets you open one table per window -- so you can spy on Open Room|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: the good sacrifice on Board 1 gave first blood (8 IMPs) to Dawson|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: johnson whispering a question to stansby about leads|pg||
nt|amr: thx Al|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: and this could very easily be a p/s swing|pg||
nt|bridge_one: very difficult find the fit in the minors for N/S, being the auction 1@S 2@h |pg||
nt|ady: a lot of bidding from north |pg||
nt|phil: I think he can play AK@s and fall back on a throwin against West|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: rodwell still examining dummy|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|nt|phil: but perhaps not enough entries for that|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|panja: @S 32 @H33...all benign breaks..so 10 tricks..almost impossible to bid your way to a game though|pg||
nt|kareno: Oh, certainly not biddable.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|nt|rodal f: Did Meck?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bridge_one: the return @S is obliged by South bec the partner choose don't lead there, so ... void (probably)|pg||
nt|panja: and does not have the required % either...will be 24% or so...that is not enough even when VUL where game bonus is 10 IMPs or so|pg||
nt|kareno: Vulnerable you want about 36 percent or so for game.|pg||
nt|harmon: Yes but helness doesnt know his pard is only 5532 his first 2s bid is VERY timid|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|nt|rodal f: Became a funny board|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfe: rodwell nodding with his arms crossed.  goes through his repertoire of mannerisms but hard to read what he's thinking|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: rodwell lowers the screen to write a question to helness|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: then puts his scorecard over the notepad so I can't read it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: rodwell: sorry|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: I do not have third quarter scores because not all matches were done when this match resumed|pg||

mb|2N|nt|daman: the best possible result for NS|pg||

mb|p|nt|daman: luck of the Irish|pg||
nt|bridge_one: may be DBL at 2@C the best (if play this DBL not penalty)|pg||
nt|daman: Chip O'Martel|pg||
nt|xenya: was S obliged to bid over the double?|pg||
nt|rodal f: By the level I belive a easy 3NT.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dinos1: 7 - 2nd best, so dcl can set 3 @s tricks|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kareno: Interesting.  I would think 2nt was a wiggle bid for a minor.|pg||
nt|harmon: me2|pg||
pc|h2|nt|harmon: Helness still wiggling|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: 2N = MAX, 2@S|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: perhaps East has reasoned that with NS in game and him holding an ace, West must be minimum|pg||
nt|dinos1: just nothing to discard on them :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but still, brave not to lead partner's suit|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hlortz: 12 opposite 12 thats EXTRAS for meckwell :)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|robbg: no, and I wouldn't but it worked in his favor.|pg||
nt|daman: one would think|pg||
nt|bridge_one: South choose to give the second suit because short in @H, so more chances to compete|pg||
nt|daman: I always bid my second suit when I have one|pg||
nt|daman: Kokish would have your head if you didn't bid 2@C|pg||
nt|dinos1: mb he dreamed @s are 2-2?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there are some players this side of the pond who regard not leading their suit as a capital offence |pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|c3|nt|phil: I would not be the least bit surprised to see a simulation confirm a spade lead is better on this bidding and holding an entry|pg||
nt|kareno: First round diamond finesse would prove fatal.|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|c5|nt|daman: but with weak @Cs and Ax in both reds     there could be a reason for passing|pg||
pc|s4|pc|cQ|nt|kareno: Finesse into the safe hand for an overtrick.|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfe: hampson: nice that my lead didn't cost a trick|pg||
nt|panja: on the @SA lead of course...not otherwise..|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: a bit surprising that 2@D was made in both rooms|pg||
nt|robbg: Steve is usually more agressive than that.|pg||
nt|kareno: Famous play - you throw them in and they cash the rest of the tricks :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: yes helgemo exited with a heart and rodwell ran the heart suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 2@H was better|pg||

nt|ahollan1: this 1N=15-17   [3rd seat VUL  always 4th seat]|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|nt|bridge_one: 4@S ON for NS - 4@H 1 down|pg||
nt|robbg: Well, it depends on whether it is forcing for them (they play precision). |pg||
nt|dinos1: ome more strong @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: NS emptyed and EW to find the end|pg||
nt|rodal f: But the 2@C was up to invit Al.|pg||
nt|kareno: 4@d could be too high.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Meck's auction shows why he didn't upgrade to 16+ HCP 1@C   if pointed suits were reversed -- who knows|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: rodwell is hard to read, especially from behind his shoulder|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N = Puppet Stayman|pg||
mb|3C|nt|robbg: Walter seems to think it IS forcing.|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: this is very perilous|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: the notepad seems to read "5+@D; NF"|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 2Down - so Dbl would work here - but 4@S better that 500|pg||
nt|rodal f: By a @Dlead ure right Karen:)|pg||
nt|harmon: trump lead kills this|pg||
nt|hlortz: on a friendly day 5@D might make - not today...|pg||
nt|kareno: Right - spades not working and club offside.  Diamond lead for the money|pg||
nt|hlortz: prob need a @D to set it i guess|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: thomas asks if @S can be 6, Rodwell answers 5|pg||
nt|kareno: I think it's down without a diamond lead.  South would have to duck the first spade though from dummy|pg||
nt|kareno: 3@c shows one or both majors|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Vugraphzfe: rodwell: good luck|pg||
nt|kareno: Let's watch, specs :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn:  may even be three down|pg||

pc|cK|nt|daman: Levin opened the East hand 2@S|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bridge_one: Kx@S and AK K out are to much to pass - but 3@C can be misunderstood (no forcing after passed hand)|pg||
nt|panja: and there will be a trump guess at trick three...does E ruff with @DJT or A?|pg||

nt|rodal f: By the X I belive -1, as by no X would have been -2. Might I'm wrong.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: West was searching a way to play 3Nt or 3@S bidding 3@C - the pass was more conservative but probably the best bid|pg||

nt|rodal f: I heard a lot of comments from the specs. Sorrely I am defrosting my refrig as I try to comment. Can't answer u all:(|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: one kibitzer using the dead time to knit|pg||
nt|kareno: Two club ruffs in hand four tricks in the red suits and either a diamond ruff in dummy or a trump promotion.  BUT he must cash that heart quickly.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: thomas leaning back with his hands behind his head|pg||
nt|kareno: If he tries for the diamond ruff too soon, east can discard his second heart.|pg||

mb|3N|nt|mdgraham: had some suggestions for 4@D|pg||
nt|kit: Should reach 4@S or 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: a normal auction|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: hampson pointing at each bid in the auction around the tray|pg||
nt|dburn: still, this may be the stronger way to get to 5@c, but Hampson will do very well indeed to move|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: shrugs|pg||
nt|hlortz: rod had to X since 2@S would be non forcing..|pg||
nt|rodal f: Give EW a @C lead and u have.....|pg||
nt|ahollan1: note DBL instead of 2@S because of "negative free bids"|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 4@S ON bec West have only 3@h - so 2@S and A@D for E/W|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: dawson asks about 2@S.  chip's handwriting is very tight and hard to read upside down.  "usually 2 spades"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: meckstroth exits and asks a kibitzer to turn dummy|pg||
nt|harmon: potential swing here big one|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: leads? 3/5|pg||
nt|kareno: Instead of asking us about why Rodwell didn't bid spades over hearts, I recommend you watcn for ahollan1's commentary - he knows their system pretty completely.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: explanations on both sides of screen|pg||
nt|kit: They did well to choose 3NT, as 4@S would have been down quickly|pg||
pc|c6|nt|daman: if East could stab the @H Ace   the tap would be on|pg||
nt|bridge_one: sry - 9 tricks - A@H also|pg||
nt|robbg: 4@s is on what?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: johnson asks stansby if he could bid 2@D.  Martel: "What?", Johnson: "we're just chatting" then asks chip to lower the screen|pg||
nt|daman: I'm sure Chip said 'pardon me Sir?'|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes A@H, A@D, 2@S - so 9 tricks - i miscounted before, loosing the A in @H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: martel expressive compared to stoic stansby|pg||
nt|dburn: too tough|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: greco puffs his cheeks and sighs|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, it's a little unlucky not to make.  3nt is definitely better and will fetch.|pg||
nt|kareno: I have some results thanks to a spec:  Fleisher is up on Dawson 126-78; Diamond is up on Gordon 120-86; Zaleski is up on Lall 128-83; DeKnijff is up on Schwartz 130-97|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h9|nt|hlortz: @D hands are often tough for strong @C systems since 1@D is 2+|pg||

nt|jcwla: The CR contract: 3NT / N -- all those who had that may collect.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT next door, also unlikely to make|pg||
nt|petergill: Thomas is thinking- if I exit a spade now, then what will I do when I win @CQ a trick later - best to figure this out NOW|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1700 specs would make it, obviously|pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer will probably cash a trump or two, then use clubs as "replacement trumps" to lead through East, how does all this affect whether declarer will finesse @d's or not, so how ...|pg||
nt|petergill: should East defend now?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hamman conceviably could make this|pg||
nt|petergill: These are the sorts of things Thomas is thinking about|pg||
nt|petergill: Thomas Bessis is one of the very best players in the world who are still in their twenties|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If you think 2@S was light here, then it's nothing compared to Rod's 1@S at the other table|pg||
nt|petergill: through West I meant|pg||
nt|fabsayc: when we were too light for 2@S we opened a Murray 1@S|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That caused Drury to invent Drury|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|pc|cT|pc|s5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He was fed up with Murray's featherlight openings in 3rd|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h6|pc|s4|pc|hA|pg||
nt|petergill: Many of Eric Murray's revolutionary bidding habits of 40 years ago are now commonplace amongst experts - very light non vul 3rd seat openers, "lots of aggression and psyches at fav ...|pg||
nt|petergill: vul" etc|pg||
pc|c7|pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|s6|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|petergill: Now Hamman knows East has 6142 shape and thus has 4-2 or 67% chance of having @DQ|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: controled psychics actually predate Murrays period of fame|pg||
pc|sT|nt|petergill: 4 @D's to 2 @D's = 2/3 chance of East having @DQ|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|sA|pg||
nt|petergill: Well defended by Thomas Bessis|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So 2 IMPs for playing on 4-3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the desperation club lead tends to negate those odds though|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Understandably, Helness went 3 down in 3NT|pg||
nt|petergill: Martin's point is very good, as usual|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d6|pc|d4|pc|d5|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sunsamvar: do all of agree with West return of trump at trick ?|pg||

pc|h8|pc|hK|pc|d7|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d8|nt|petergill: Hamman timed the play well to escape for -1, not -2|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfe: johnson played an honor on the first heart trick then the 4|pg||
nt|kareno: There is a way to watch both sides of the match at once, isn't there?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: rodwell/helness disclose their shape.  helness evaluates 4@S and has a laugh|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|daman: who would invoke 2NT with the East hand?|pg||
nt|daman: Great poker hand in @Cs|pg||
mb|d|nt|daman: Levin bid 2NT in the OR I am told|pg||
nt|robbg: I prefer 2@d with moderate values|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: chip smiling, to dawson: trying to think how long it's been since we last played against each other|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: reminiscing a bit|pg||
nt|daman: and they are n 5@D doubled|pg||
nt|panja: 4@H is a good spot on B56|pg||
nt|kit: odd choiceof 1@S rather than 2@S|pg||
mb|2H!|an|good raise|nt|bridge_one: with Kx in @H 2@D is better that 2Nt|pg||
nt|daman: -300|pg||
nt|robbg: cheap|pg||
nt|daman: vs 420    sure is|pg||
nt|robbg: looked like 500 to me|pg||
mb|d|nt|dburn: 5@d perhaps superior to 3NT here, but that @c7 in the West hand may come to the rescue if they do arrive in 3NT|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kareno: Yes, a psych I would say.|pg||
mb|d|nt|panja: but @H are 51...3N will make if @DQ is brought down in two rounds|pg||

mb|p|nt|daman: yes|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|daman: yes   -500|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: chip took his time deciding on 4@S.  I try to match tempo with the players but sometimes my reportage gets me behind|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: vs 450|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahhhh  the wonders of garbage stayman|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how else do you get to choose betwee 4-2 fits|pg||
nt|kareno: You're a great guesser, Kit :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kareno: I don't play that stuff.  If I have spades, hearts and DIAMONDS I can get out with 2@c and pass any response.|pg||
nt|kareno: King and JTxx good enough to play 1nt I think.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: And worked this time?|pg||
nt|kit: or so I thought|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Michel Bessis did open 2@S   Hamman declaring 4@H|pg||
nt|panja: that might be interesting...|pg||
nt|kit: any of the games will make if you drop the offside queen of diamonds, I believe, but that won't be obvious to do|pg||
nt|kareno: That's a decent contract.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: Cheek may not lead his partner's suit here, of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|dinos1: 5@d may gow down with @d4-1|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: hampson views dummy and nods|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: does not call immediately the way greco had been doing|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm not sure you need that in hearts - set up clubs.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|panja: after the 2@S opening...might be easier to reject @D finesse|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sJ|nt|chick: are they playing some non std lead system, or was that J just deceptive?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: greco asks if he can leave - grue then asks for a cigarette break after the hand|pg||
nt|dinos1: J - 0 or 2 higher?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: grue: we should all go together anyway|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d4|nt|Vugraphzfe: in the first quarter a few players left the room unescorted.  at some point in the vanderbilt that is strongly discouraged|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: hampson has his cards folded on the table, playing with the quitted tricks|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|daman: looks like 2 IMPs to Dawson|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kit: I don't think the opening bid matters -- possession of queen of diamonds wouldn't affect his choice|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kareno: They've pointed out hearts are 5-1 ..  it's late and I never noticed!|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h6|nt|panja: likely two down on a failed @D finesse..|pg||
nt|kit: However, Rodwell has some interesting discards to make here|pg||
nt|panja: true..|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: rodwell asking about 2NT, screen closed again|pg||
nt|panja: he can discard both Clubs..|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, east is definitely under pressure.  Do they still play upside down suit preference, Kit, if you know?|pg||
nt|kit: Remember, West has shown a "good" spade raise|pg||
nt|kareno: Would the ten of hearts show club values?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H10 may [keyword] show @C values|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: helness: 4@H, probably 44(32) or 3433|pg||
nt|kit: yes, they play upside-down suit-pref|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm told they do and that ten of hearts may show club cards.|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfe: cheek pulls out @CA but puts it back|pg||
nt|kit: note that Rodwell might cover 10 of diamonds with Q87x -- necessary if his partner has 9x|pg||
nt|kareno: west continuing to show clubs (I think)|pg||
nt|kit: So if declarer reads the distribution, then ...... maybe|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: helness toying with @HK.  rodwell: sorry|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|daman: I am told NS play Flannery    they do not digress and bid 6-4 2@D|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfe: kibitzer to cheek: great to see you coming back from your injuries|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfe: still has one foot in a boot and arrived on a motorized chair - and has a few scars - but is doing well and playing well now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: greco back, joe and geoff still away.  plenty of time on the clock|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: players return|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: joe brings cheek a pepsi.  he asks greco to open it for him, then washes down a couple pain pills|pg||

nt|daman: French influence maybe|pg||
nt|daman: they NEVER open 1NT with a 5 card major|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: I am not as high above the table as at some venues so my angle sometimes makes it hard to read|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2@S to come and a possible -1+|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|bridge_one: better to play in @S that in NT here|pg||

pc|cA|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: hampson: what's he say about his minors?  grue: could be 4441 but at least 4-4|pg||
nt|dburn: Hampson content to have pushed his opponents up a level, but this time 3@s would have made|pg||
nt|dinos1: @hQ?|pg||
nt|dburn: or maybe it wouldn't - that fourth heart may be an eventual loser|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: hampson/greco chatting at every chance.  this time about lineups for 3rd/4th quarters|pg||
nt|kareno: Depends on the screens, of course :)|pg||
nt|kit: Note that declarer might not get the clubs right, so may have only 2 club tricks|pg||
nt|panja: if a @H shift...S must still guess Clubs?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: helness has another yawn.  laughter breaks out at the cayne-seamon-fantoni-nunes table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this hand one of reasons Rodwell still uses strong 2N opening -- but this south hand too strong for 19-20 range -- then East would get to show @H|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|robbg: aceless. I think it was the 5 card major.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: when the screen is opened, grue asks cheek what 2major by opener is.  cheek: 14 or 15 with a singleton|pg||

pc|s3|nt|sunsamvar: this will seal the match for Z|pg||

nt|petergill: If only dummy had @S9|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: trump now|pg||
nt|petergill: If West plays a @h instead of a @s, East might later be endplayed|pg||
nt|petergill: East is going to be stripped of non-trumps and endplayed to some extent, whatever the defence does|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the other room no-one doubled 3@H of course, so Helness played for a normal heart break|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can make 3 if you know hearts are 4-1|pg||
pc|h6|nt|petergill: Thomas Bessis is really good at identifying Critical Points and stopping to think at the right time - he has a fair idea of the hand and is going through the play on a @S or a @H ...|pg||

pc|h2|pc|hT|pc|h4|pg||

pc|s3|nt|panja: no..not strange, just interesting....it isn't a strong hand really with the @Dk under W|pg||

nt|kit: I think he can still bring this home if he takes the club hook|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: helness riffling his cards|pg||
nt|panja: the only uncertain issue is the @d9...but then...it has to be with E to make after @H break 4-1..has it not?|pg||

nt|petergill: The roof doesn't often fall in on Jeff Meckstroth|pg||

nt|ahollan1: for all of the tough contracts we've seen   still only 22 imps exchanged this set|pg||
pc|s7|nt|daman: they players like to keep the VG operators in the dark|pg||
nt|daman: the*|pg||
nt|kit: still, can afford to lose 2 spades and 1 club -- but I agree, will probably fail|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bridge_one: sry - i was disconnected|pg||
nt|daman: the D has lots of time to get their tricks    no?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: more Q&A between Johnson and Stansby|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: johnson writes 1444 and Stansby nods|pg||
nt|daman: this is a key board for this session   if they make this  they will add a dozen IMPs|pg||

nt|robbg: Hard to find a 9th trick here|pg||
nt|xenya: that doesn't seem likely though|pg||
nt|daman: I think he will try a @H to the King quickly   and go down like a man|pg||
nt|dburn: curious - thought South would bid 3@d there, but perhaps he fancies his chances against hearts|pg||
nt|dburn: unfortunately for him at least, I don't think his chances against hearts are all that good|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: in the same tone of voice every hand he declares|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Roland and Peter Gill just announced Hamman in position to make 4@HX on 62|pg||

pc|cA|nt|dburn: and nor does he, if he thinks he has to underlead @dAK in order to beat it |pg||
pc|c5|nt|dinos1: thk dcl is wondering why they let him play 2@h having 9 @d's|pg||

nt|kareno: My cat Stella in my lap is wondering why somebody doesn't claim :)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: this is when Larry Cohen would talk about  IMP vs BAM [or that other non-IMP scoring method]|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cJ|nt|daman: if not?  he is toast|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: hampson wakes up to pull @CA then leans back and closes eyes again|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: clock on 34|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: greco to table: sorry|pg||
pc|c7|nt|robbg: I would not take the other side of that bet, but I still think it was Stansby's best play.|pg||

nt|kit: oh dear -- now going down many|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: amazing their eyes are fast enough to see some of the tricks late in the play|pg||

pc|s8|nt|kareno: Specs, don't give up your seats!!|pg||
nt|rodal f: Where are u to enter Helness? Pitch the @Ss|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: zimmermann team had a rash of bad luck with late leads.  lost a domestic final and then the (NTW?) final to lavazza that way|pg||
pc|h5|nt|daman: someone owes me a coke|pg||
nt|daman: or a bag of jelly beans|pg||
nt|robbg: can still screw this up, but probably won't.|pg||
nt|daman: surely he can't be thinking about what to play|pg||
nt|robbg: which @h|pg||
nt|daman: perhaps the @H pitch by declarer on the 2nd @S has confused him |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: martel turning head side to side as he reads|pg||
nt|robbg: he should have a count on south's hand now.|pg||
nt|daman: 1825 specs hold their breath|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: dawson motionless|pg||
nt|robbg: but doesn't know about @hJ.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: for the curious, Martel reading a Joe Haldeman novel, Worlds|pg||
nt|robbg: the @hK is kind of a giveaway|pg||
nt|daman: the longer he thinks    the more he will not play another @H|pg||
nt|daman: if declarer had the J   he would never play the K|pg||
nt|robbg: All you people who want to tell me that declarer wouldn't have played the K with the @hJ please tell me what else dawson might be thinking about|pg||

pc|h9|nt|daman: going for the gusto|pg||

pc|d4|nt|dinos1: @c ruff - overruff, @d ruff and @sJ - this will make|pg||
