nt|brolucius: North offers a choice of games by making a transfer response (2@D) and then bidding 3NT.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008Pau-european/OpenTeams/Sweden/bertheau-nystrom.pdf|pg||

nt|brolucius: A kibitzer points out to me that there are three makable games and 3NT is not amongst them.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oops|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: Defenders will often hold up instinctively when declarer plays on dummy's long suit, unless they can see the setting tricks for sure.|pg||

pc|d5|nt|athene: West didn't want to unblock - it might be costly if it was declarer rather than his partner who had the long clubs, of course.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, West could not read the club position. Perhaps he should have thought about it for longer.|pg||
pc|s8|pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or started by leading queen|pg||
pc|dT|pc|hT|pc|s9|pc|h9|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s7|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||

nt|Walddk2: We know there is a typo in the NS team name (should be De Knijff). We can't change it now, sorry|pg||
nt|warrens:  Zaleski returned original 4th best at trick 2.  some players return lowest from 5 because it's easier for partner to read|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|brolucius: Yes, but then West would have no reason to unblock.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c3|nt|brolucius: At the other table North was declarer. East led a club, the king winning. declarer took five diamonds and the top spades, then played a heart. Up went the ace and the defenders ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: claimed the remainder.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The Swedish team holds a unique record at this point. They have won every single quarter until now!|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
nt|athene: Sure but it wouldn't hurt - if West thinks his partner probably has four, but might have five, he can unblock much more happily than if he isn't sure if it's 3 or 5.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Still seems a bit risky to me. Is that common practice?|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|hA|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|dJ|pc|d9|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: Well as a couple of people have pointed out, if East really did hold only three clubs, declarer surely wouldn't have played them like that.|pg||

pc|c9|pc|cJ|nt|warrens:  it's not common, but it is used by several experts.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Indeed. Seems safer to play the 4th best back and hope partner can read it. Having said that, I remember a disaster that the English Ladies had in their world final against China. ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: England West allowed declarer to win with a doubleton queen, opposite two small (and make 3NT).|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|brolucius: All was well in the end when England won by the clear margin of 1 IMP.|pg||
nt|athene: There are a few situations in this area of defensive carding where you are supposed to falsecard your partner to make it easier for him, but it's a very risky business for sure.|pg||
pc|s7|pc|h3|pc|sJ|pc|s3|pg||

mc|8|nt|Vugraphzfb: Discussion of the 1@c opening - normally should show 2 but he chose to do it on this hand with a stiff because he didn't like his other options|pg||

nt|warrens:  a great steal -50 versus a vul game|pg||

nt|brolucius: We can expect E/W to find 4@S at the other table, so that will be a jump start for the Swedish team.|pg||
nt|warrens:  declarer has to decide to play for Qx of @D or Q10 onside.  I expect him to play for the drop.|pg||
nt|athene: These days it's quite a common gambit to jump to 4@H with huge defence to spades, hoping to push opps into 4@S - perhaps EW were scared of that.  If either one had had a bit more ...|pg||
nt|athene: he would have acted over 4@H, surely.|pg||

mb|p|mb|3S|nt|warrens:  I believe this shows a singleton club or diamond|pg||
nt|diaoff: or single @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulhac:  Many players bid the singleton but as it is often doubled for the lead some have reverted to the suit above|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: not a very jovial table here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|brolucius: If the defenders have taken two hearts, in 4@S, declarer has to escape for one spade loser. When the 9 forced an honor, and the 10 does not appear from East on the second round, ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: certain inferences can be made.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes to 15-17 that is|pg||
nt|athene: Yes, but East plays the @S10 on the second round of trumps surely.|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Is this a book hand David?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer cannot pick up K-10-x-x with East, so a finesse of the jack cannot make the contract.|pg||
nt|athene: It's a standard obligatory falsecard isn't it?|pg||

nt|athene: Yes that all seems reasonable|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think I would pass the East hand|pg||
nt|brolucius: You would open 1@H?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, 1@D|pg||
nt|athene: I really don't know what the winning action is with that East hand - even a computer simulation isn't going to give you the "truth" because so much depends on how everyone is going ...|pg||
nt|athene: to bid later on|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Seems wrong to pass a 5-loser hand with two aces|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: back|pg||
nt|brolucius: I think I would pass and hope to describe it well later.|pg||
mb|p|nt|diaoff: I like the pass, it's often efficient just listen one round with such settings...|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: This start will make you bid it with some science|pg||
nt|athene: I remember someone saying with a singleton and a void you should splinter in your singleton and then cue your void, or something|pg||
nt|Walddk2: de Knijff's 6@H was a punt, a successful one admittedly|pg||
nt|athene: He might have been drunk at the time, of course|pg||
nt|brolucius: He maybe wanted it to sound like a punt to deter a sacrifice. |pg||
mb|4C!|an|splinter|nt|Walddk2: How do you show two splinters? :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Why did no-one invent that|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@C splinter. Give Bill a brownie point.|pg||
nt|athene: Well West is going to force to slam now surely|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 7@H might make, but unlikely that they will bid it|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not a usage of 4NT that will receive the Nobel Prize for Blackwood.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Zaleski thinking about how to show two keycards ands a void presumably|pg||
nt|athene: Now east is worried, because if he shows two keycards and a void, his partner will think he has a spade void :)|pg||
nt|athene: club void sorry|pg||
nt|warrens:  i'm betting on 5@s, 2 + the Queen|pg||
mb|5N|an|2 KC + void|nt|brolucius: West will be surprised to hear that his partner holds only 8 points.|pg||
nt|warrens:  wrong again|pg||
nt|athene: i thought the standard way to bid these was 5NT = 2 keycards and void somewhere|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Commentators always lose their bets, Warren|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Predicting is dangerous|pg||
nt|athene: 5NT even   keycards that is|pg||
nt|athene: with an odd number of keycards you can cue 6 of the void or bid 6trump suit if the void is higher|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is not for West to gamble on which void partner has.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Must be clubs, right?|pg||
nt|athene: so if east had bid 6@H, that would have shown odd keycards and higher-ranking void (hence must be spade)|pg||
nt|brolucius: The odds lie steeply in that direction, it is true.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can't make partner believe that you have a singleton in the splintered suit and a void elsewhere|pg||
nt|brolucius: No.|pg||
nt|brolucius: But West can hardly count 13 tricks even so.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe 6@C now as a general grand slam try|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Easy for us to find that bid|pg||
mb|6C|nt|Walddk2: and for Pilon|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Blackwood auctions where BOTH players have a void are particularly awkward. Better to avoid them. |pg||
nt|athene: Perhaps at this point south begins to wish he had doubled 4@C :) maybe that would have other meanings for them, though|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This hand alone is worth all the money we paid to watch this match|pg||
nt|brolucius: French kibitzers will not agree, if they reach 7@H.|pg||
mb|6H|nt|Walddk2: Well ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How obvious is it for North to lead a club?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would say close to zero|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|d9|nt|Walddk2: We shall never know what the lead would have been against 7|pg||

nt|Walddk2: The Swedish NPC, Jan Kamras, says it shows 4-4|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Two strnage auctions I think it's fair to say, so a flat board probably justified|pg||
mb|1C|nt|warrens:  this is a great result for the Swedes.  |pg||
nt|brolucius: Indeed.|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  Unlikely to be repeated.|pg||
nt|athene: 6nt isn't so great on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|athene: you need the heart finesse and the spades to come in|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|athene: 6@C is better as you just need the spades to come in for a diamond pitch|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: then you can concede a heart|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Pilon is not going to accept a 4NT invite|pg||
nt|Walddk2: what else can Zaleski bid?|pg||
mb|4N|nt|paulhac:  He might just bid 6|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: East really has pretty good cards but it's that five-card club suit with the @C109 which make the slam good|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Maybe 2@D artificial to find out about five clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: North might lead a diamond against 3NT but it would be rather risky against 6NT on two balanced hands.|pg||

nt|ady: on a non diamond lead   good chances   can try hearts first    also JX spades|pg||
mb|4H!|an|clubs|mb|p|nt|finch:  slam is still pretty poor even on say a club lead, still need 7 tricks out of the majors|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: 6 tricks|pg||
pc|s3|nt|buffytvs: no -6|pg||
nt|buffytvs: so if SDouth has the @HK you're in good shape|pg||
nt|pelu: ok but @H 3-3 or @S 3-3 or drop of @sJ = close to 50%|pg||
nt|buffytvs: and if that fails, the spades have reasonable chances|pg||
nt|buffytvs: so much better than 50% slam -- as long as they don't lead a diamond|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Now you see that it is possible to bid 1NT twice in one auction|pg||
nt|ady: slam good without diamond lead    can play up to QJ@H  so can make if south has K@H  or hearts 3-3   or   spades  3-3  or JX spades|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|h3|nt|pelu: France also in 6@H on board 13 - but close to bid 7?|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|pelu: I never belive that opp lead from Jxx (or Jxxx) against 6NT - so @S10 would not be my card|pg||
nt|finch:  can you tell us what the contract is?|pg||
nt|ady: 6NT|pg||
nt|pelu: on 13? = 6@H - @D lead = 13 tricks|pg||
nt|finch:  those of us on the internet client see it as 2@C|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: 6NT - you can see all the bidding and explanations by clicking on the down arrow in the bidding box, I think|pg||
nt|finch:  No, I'm logged on through the internet and the contract is clearly 2@C by west on the lead of the @SJ (!!)|pg||
nt|pelu: ????|pg||
nt|finch:  the same might be true for some other spectators|pg||
nt|buffytvs: personally I'm a traditionalist -- I'm sticking with the old interface, warts and all|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d9|pc|d2|pg||
nt|finch:  so far a few other people are also seeing it as 2@C.... we'll have to tell BBO|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I left the duplicated 1Nt - 2@c bids in so I could show it to Uday later (& also because it's hard to undo when things are funny), but on my screen it shows the whole auction and ...|pg||

mc|12|nt|po-s: is that what is called Double Stayman?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Auction was 1@c-1NT-2@c-2@s-2N-3@c-3N-4@c-4@h-6NT. East asked, West showed bad balanced with 5 clubs|pg||

nt|warrens:  nice play of J@D at trick one.  if it loses, declarer would certainly finesse if partner led another @D and that way the suit won't block if partner led from 8xxxx|pg||
nt|athene: If East had found out his partner had five clubs, then his @CJ would be worth a lot more and he might well force to slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Many thanks to John Schwartz in Reno. Great job!|pg||
nt|athene: but even so he might bid it in notrumps rather than clubs|pg||
nt|brolucius: Thanks, John!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and to my fellow commentators: Warren, David and Bill|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: thanks all|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: and to Paul Hackett of course, sorry Paul|pg||
nt|paulhac:  :)|pg||
mb|1D|an|0+ !D|nt|Walddk2: Jan Martel, on behalf of the ACBL, has been instrumental in setting up a fine show|pg||
nt|brolucius: Oh no, not a 1NT contract to end the set....... |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: NS obviously don't play 14-16  NT in 4th|pg||
nt|warrens:  is 1NT in 4th position 15-17?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: it does seem a bit fiddly to change your range by one point depending on seat|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 15-16 in 4th|pg||
nt|athene: although meckwell among others do just that|pg||
nt|paulhac:  More and more common to play 14-16 in 1st and second and 15-17 in third and 4th|pg||
mb|2H!|an|4 !S|nt|brolucius: We have been spared 1NT - not that 2@S is entirely enthralling.|pg||

nt|brolucius: Still, I shouldn't complain when he have just enjoyed two really big hands. And the 4@S doubled.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We won't be able to start until all of the tables have compared because they are all playing the same boards|pg||

nt|Walddk2: They were not until today|pg||
nt|brolucius: Ah, I see.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It is also uncertain which matches we are going to show next|pg||
nt|athene: Declarer doesn't have a fast entry to hand to throw a club on the @HJ, but leading a diamond up will effectively do the trick because if west jumps in with his ace, that solves the ...|pg||

pc|c6|nt|Walddk2: Depends on scores in the two matches we did not watch|pg||

nt|athene: now he is stuck - sure to lose two diamonds and the trump as well, and two clubs|pg||
pc|hA|nt|brolucius: Indeed. Well, I will say goodbye now, since my wife has already asked 'How much longer?'  Thanks for watching! |pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|nt|athene: maybe rising the @DK was better, playing for the @D10 to deny the jack|pg||
