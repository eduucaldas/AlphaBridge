mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|mcphee: and our first board is 3N|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1nt with 5@H is usually a good idea|pg||
nt|mcphee: good hand here for 4 suit tranfers|pg||
nt|mcphee: the N player can show @C and then indicate shortness to arrive at the best game|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|mcphee: apparently they do not have 4 suit transfers available|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|Gerben42: even if they do, maybe they play it other way than you do|pg||
nt|mcphee: 3@C is F and S can cue bid in support|pg||

pc|c4|nt|mcphee: the @D finesse is clearly best choice|pg||
pc|cK|pc|s2|pg||
nt|MolvaM: @d finesse is not extremely risky as he can discard his @h loser even if @d finesse loses|pg||

nt|Gerben42: no entries for @C@D squeeze|pg||
nt|mcphee: @h yes a better defence, but with right view nothing matters|pg||
