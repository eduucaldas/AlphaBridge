mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Tell us about E-W, Jon please|pg||
nt|jbgood: Aa is a long time Nor international who started playing with Molberg when Aa - Grøtheim boke up|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: The other table hasn't yet started and the director is checking that they aren't anywhere where someone could see a hand, so we're going to wait for a moment|pg||
nt|stewball: S may bypass @s for now|pg||
nt|jbgood: the have been very successful in their prdship|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Rumour has it that Aa is almost as slow as Grøtheim. Is that correct?|pg||
nt|jbgood: he may take his time ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Meanwhile, I have some quarter scores from the other matches: Lall 14-Zaleski 38, Dawson 25 - Fleisher 30, Strul 17 - Cayne 30. I will hope to get more scores later|pg||
nt|Walddk2: N-S are not exactly fast either, so we may get all the comparisons in this room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Meanwhile, 1@C is 16+ and 1@D 0-7|pg||

pc|d2|pc|s5|pc|h8|pg||
nt|jbgood: as Roland mentioned, Terje Aa is not the fastest one on earth, but then he doesnt make hasty mistakes|pg||
nt|stewball: I expect he\ll win ace and \play @h|pg||
nt|buffytvs: and the NS pair played pretty slowly yesterdya, so we could be in for some long pauses|pg||
nt|buffytvs: it will up to us to keep everyone amused :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Some Norwegian specs tell me that he is even slower than Grøtheim. That takes a lot|pg||

nt|dinos1: mb S opened?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: The Nickell team is adept at recovering IMPs and this should be an interesting match.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|daman: EW might be coerced into sacrificing over 4@H|pg||

nt|sybarra: not the worse sac in the world |pg||

nt|daman: on a @C lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: chip's note says 3+@H and a lot more I can't read upside down|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Meckstroth asks about strength of 4@H; Michel expects less than an opening hand|pg||
nt|sybarra2: welcome back to Reno |pg||
nt|kareno: Declarer misguesses (looking for safety) at trick one.  Now a club shift is imperative for the fourth trick.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr a bit late but hi all|pg||
nt|kareno: Shirley :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: noisy in here, not all matches have started play.  at several tables players are explaining methods to their opponents|pg||

nt|kareno: Yes, but unlikely.  There is no suit preference associated with the deuce lead.|pg||
nt|kareno: Allan ;)|pg||
nt|amr: good evening Karen and all the specs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: meckstroth has his hands folded, looking down|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Interesting deal this. Cheek misguessed trumps, unerstandably, after East's pre-empt|pg||
nt|Walddk2: O would have too|pg||
nt|Walddk2: *I|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes -- an imbalance of 4 vacant spaces or so defintiely tips the scales in favour of the finesse through West|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Here are the rest of the scores: Schwartz 36 - De Knijff 39, Nickell 10 - Zimmerman 17, Onstott 22 - Carmichael 31, Hampton 19 0 Lynch 48|pg||
mb|1C|mb|3D|nt|buffytvs: not easy to reach 6@S after the preempt -- much depends on North|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Platnick thinks @CQJ are wasted. Miraculously, on this auction, they are not|pg||
nt|buffytvs: the raise could cause him to play for 3-6 clubs, but I sitll don't think he'll get spades right|pg||
nt|jbgood: N showing cards may get S to make a slammish move|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Diamond thinking |pg||
nt|Walddk2: How do you do that now, Jon?|pg||
nt|stewball: 6@c?|pg||
nt|jbgood: 5 @c - as in the other room|pg||
nt|buffytvs: 5@C or 6@S I guess|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: How to show slam interest as long as no suit has been bid yet? Yes Ray, but 6@S leaves partner out of it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So 5@C is probably best|pg||
nt|buffytvs: these auctions are hard -- North could be 3-3 in the majors with some cards|pg||
nt|buffytvs: and if he is, they may well end up in the wrong suit|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: as we always say, you can't be perfect over preempts|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s4|pc|s9|nt|po-s: Isn´t 6D an overbid?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@D has no play on a heart lead, so Diamond did the right thing when he pulled. However, I think it will be a flat board|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Aa asks about the DBL of 4@c and Diamond says "responsive" and shrugs|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|pg||
nt|jbgood: now S can see that the clubs are 7-2 ..|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|nt|buffytvs: The mathematics of the situation definitely favours the losing finesse in spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: All my club members would make it. They go for the drop when they have nine between them, pre-empt or not|pg||
nt|buffytvs: lol|pg||
nt|henryb:  Sorry I am late|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The trouble here is that both declarers are too good|pg||
nt|buffytvs: you can imagine the compare:  1 down on Bd 18?  well played...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And it was|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Jeffrey Allerton: declarer might wonder why Aa raised with doubleton club.  would he do so with @sQxx and honours in the reds?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fair point|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Diamond checking the opponents' convention card about leads|pg||

mb|1C|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dinos1: 3@s-4@s|pg||
nt|ady: if n/s get to 6@S might well go down after the pre-empt from east   may get spades wrong|pg||
nt|reisig: I bet 6@s -1|pg||
nt|phil: 4@C is a big bid|pg||
nt|dinos1: 4@c ... too much|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@C may have two-suiter overtones|pg||
nt|amr: not the right time to get busy unfortunately|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 3@H 1 down if defence find the ruff in @D|pg||
nt|bridge_one: ruff in @S|pg||
nt|daman: would any of us bid with the North hand?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: chip is thinking about it|pg||
nt|sybarra: not fitting pards suit? |pg||
nt|daman: they can make 10 tricks in @Ds|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@S is mixed raise in @H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but @CQJ should be devalued, so is possibly a bit, er, forward|pg||
nt|harmon: this could be bloody|pg||
nt|hlortz: meckwell are not known for beong shy ...|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, it's a pretty reasonable 3@d bid.  Very unlucky if they manage to double him.  As north I would just bid 3nt directly.  I don't look for penalties at adverse vulnerability.  ...|pg||
nt|kareno: Worst case, partner can't reopen :(|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: meckstroth grabs michel's convention card|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|daman: and @Cs|pg||
nt|dinos1: in 6@s dcl will misguess @s i thk|pg||
nt|amr: why Hamman probably not take the chance in Open room|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: they have a preprinted WBF style card but were required to fill out ACBL-format cards for this even|pg||
mb|5C|nt|robbg: I don't love overcalling on a 5 card suit with 3 in the opp's suit. This is a good suit.|pg||
nt|daman: but @Ds woulod be easier|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: Really?  Bessis slamming opposite short diamonds in south?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/    lets you open one table per window -- so you can spy on Open Room|pg||
pc|s3|nt|daman: the good sacrifice on Board 1 gave first blood (8 IMPs) to Dawson|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: johnson whispering a question to stansby about leads|pg||
nt|amr: thx Al|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|daman: and this could very easily be a p/s swing|pg||
nt|bridge_one: very difficult find the fit in the minors for N/S, being the auction 1@S 2@h |pg||
nt|ady: a lot of bidding from north |pg||
nt|phil: I think he can play AK@s and fall back on a throwin against West|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: rodwell still examining dummy|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@C=non-force|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3S|nt|bridge_one: 4@S ON for NS - 4@H 1 down|pg||
nt|robbg: Well, it depends on whether it is forcing for them (they play precision). |pg||
nt|dinos1: ome more strong @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: NS emptyed and EW to find the end|pg||
nt|rodal f: But the 2@C was up to invit Al.|pg||
nt|kareno: 4@d could be too high.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Meck's auction shows why he didn't upgrade to 16+ HCP 1@C   if pointed suits were reversed -- who knows|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: rodwell is hard to read, especially from behind his shoulder|pg||
mb|5D|nt|robbg: Walter seems to think it IS forcing.|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: this is very perilous|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: the notepad seems to read "5+@D; NF"|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 2Down - so Dbl would work here - but 4@S better that 500|pg||
nt|rodal f: By a @Dlead ure right Karen:)|pg||
nt|harmon: trump lead kills this|pg||
nt|hlortz: on a friendly day 5@D might make - not today...|pg||
nt|kareno: Right - spades not working and club offside.  Diamond lead for the money|pg||
nt|hlortz: prob need a @D to set it i guess|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: thomas asks if @S can be 6, Rodwell answers 5|pg||
nt|kareno: I think it's down without a diamond lead.  South would have to duck the first spade though from dummy|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Vugraphzfe: rodwell: good luck|pg||
nt|kareno: Let's watch, specs :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|dburn:  may even be three down|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the important thing is to have the confidence to lead what you think is right, not just to lead a suit because partner bid it |pg||
pc|d7|nt|Vugraphzfe: NS carding upside-down|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: this table was the first to finish from the closed room in the first quarter.  much faster than dawson-johnson-stansby-martel|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|daman: Hi David|pg||
nt|robbg: Pretty hard to bid 4@s and incredibly lucky to make.|pg||
nt|dburn:  one heart, three clubs, two more hearts will promote a trump|pg||

pc|s5|nt|amr: specs wondering if Meck could have any better than AKxxx x AQxxxx x|pg||
nt|harmon: cant be right to rise|pg||
nt|hlortz: n having a stiff @S leads trump to protect partner;s probable spades |pg||
nt|kareno: If he had better than that, he'd have opened 1@c|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
nt|kareno: On the auction west is marked with at least five spades.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: kibitzer brings rodwell a mug of water; he sips it and gives the thumbs-up|pg||
nt|kareno: Spec points out that north will have to shift to clubs to break up a squeeze on south.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: meckstroth holding his cards below the table - as usual - yet has four kibitzers behind him|pg||
nt|harmon: if he divines the club position hes very close to making|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|robbg: yikes|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: Levin opened the East hand 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: Kx@S and AK K out are to much to pass - but 3@C can be misunderstood (no forcing after passed hand)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|dburn: this might not make if declarer takes the wrong view of the spades|pg||
nt|kareno: This double could be costly.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|bridge_one: I think West thought 3@C forcing in this sequence|pg||
nt|daman: it seems Walter has very few green cards in his bidding box     he loves to bid|pg||
nt|robbg: Why are they too much to pass when your partner has basically denied an 11 count?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, pass over passed hand is correct|pg||

nt|rodal f: By the X I belive -1, as by no X would have been -2. Might I'm wrong.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|nt|bridge_one: West was searching a way to play 3Nt or 3@S bidding 3@C - the pass was more conservative but probably the best bid|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfe: thomas asks if EW carding is upsidedown; rodwell says except when the lead shows AK|pg||
nt|rodal f: I heard a lot of comments from the specs. Sorrely I am defrosting my refrig as I try to comment. Can't answer u all:(|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: one kibitzer using the dead time to knit|pg||
nt|kareno: Two club ruffs in hand four tricks in the red suits and either a diamond ruff in dummy or a trump promotion.  BUT he must cash that heart quickly.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: thomas leaning back with his hands behind his head|pg||
nt|kareno: If he tries for the diamond ruff too soon, east can discard his second heart.|pg||
nt|kareno: Specs:  We do NOT use GIB for commentating and we don't want to hear what it says because GIB knows all the cards.|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|nt|Vugraphzfe: greco asks carding again, cheek confirms upside-down|pg||

nt|phil: smith is very useful on this hand|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: thomas pulls a card then thinks twice|pg||
pc|s3|nt|dburn: perhaps - depends what North would lead from three low spades; if he would lead the three, then Smith will come in useful|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: detached @D8 and put it back on the rack before playing it|pg||

nt|buffytvs: is S likely to have 6 spades and 4 diamonds, and enough to raise diamonds, and pass in 1st chair?|pg||

nt|buffytvs: as the cards lie|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: They'll get all of the boards played, unless they manage to take 13 minutes on this one - I think the rule is the board has to be on the table before grace period expires|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfe: more Q&A between Johnson and Stansby|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: johnson writes 1444 and Stansby nods|pg||
nt|daman: this is a key board for this session   if they make this  they will add a dozen IMPs|pg||

nt|robbg: Hard to find a 9th trick here|pg||
nt|xenya: that doesn't seem likely though|pg||
nt|daman: I think he will try a @H to the King quickly   and go down like a man|pg||
nt|dburn: curious - thought South would bid 3@d there, but perhaps he fancies his chances against hearts|pg||
nt|dburn: unfortunately for him at least, I don't think his chances against hearts are all that good|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bridge_one: @C help but isn't sufficient|pg||

pc|h2|nt|dburn: and nor does he, if he thinks he has to underlead @dAK in order to beat it |pg||
pc|hT|nt|dinos1: thk dcl is wondering why they let him play 2@h having 9 @d's|pg||

pc|s8|nt|robbg: I would not take the other side of that bet, but I still think it was Stansby's best play.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|h4|nt|daman: tah dah|pg||
nt|robbg: He could always try hearts later.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h9|nt|daman: someone owes me a coke|pg||
nt|daman: or a bag of jelly beans|pg||
nt|robbg: can still screw this up, but probably won't.|pg||
nt|daman: surely he can't be thinking about what to play|pg||
nt|robbg: which @h|pg||
nt|daman: perhaps the @H pitch by declarer on the 2nd @S has confused him |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: martel turning head side to side as he reads|pg||
nt|robbg: he should have a count on south's hand now.|pg||
nt|daman: 1825 specs hold their breath|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: dawson motionless|pg||
nt|robbg: but doesn't know about @hJ.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: for the curious, Martel reading a Joe Haldeman novel, Worlds|pg||
nt|robbg: the @hK is kind of a giveaway|pg||
nt|daman: the longer he thinks    the more he will not play another @H|pg||
nt|daman: if declarer had the J   he would never play the K|pg||
nt|robbg: All you people who want to tell me that declarer wouldn't have played the K with the @hJ please tell me what else dawson might be thinking about|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfe: cheek is a poker player, unreadable, can't even tell looking at him that he's on lead|pg||
pc|c5|nt|daman: going for the gusto|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: now greco's turn to think some more.  pulls out a card and puts it back|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: shuffling his hand|pg||
