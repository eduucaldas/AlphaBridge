pc|cK|nt|eamongall: is that a normal 1@S opening|pg||
nt|dohicky: Hi all|pg||
nt|eamongall: methinks its the wrong hand|pg||
nt|dohicky: Looks like it|pg||
nt|eamongall: i see a score of 3@Hs+4 in another match but same board ...also bizarre|pg||
nt|eamongall: the bidding here is possible but  aggressive and the 1@S opening is strange|pg||
nt|cicus: a brave entry by David, which has been left unpunished|pg||
pc|c3|nt|dohicky: Hi all :)|pg||

pc|d2|nt|qwikjanz: 2H can make NS, @D appears to have 2H and 2S losers|pg||

nt|cicus: good for another X?|pg||
nt|cicus: I don't think so|pg||
nt|lestergold: low level part scores only here i suspect that someone will declare and go negative here|pg||
mb|4S|nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: without a spade lead/[layed by south it may make|pg||
mb|5C!|nt|pdjourdain: might declarer read this and drop the king?|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: It looks like 4 clubs, three spades and 1 trick in each other, but not easy timing|pg||
nt|cicus: I think 2@S or even 3 making|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: Murdoch has correctly downvalued his two bacl Qx is|pg||
mb|5H|nt|barnets: n/s have been playing together for around 40 years|pg||
mb|p|nt|dohicky: :) They had 15 year break at one point|pg||
nt|jackthelad: stunningly beautiful Edinburgh|pg||
nt|barnets: probably one of the longest running partnerships in bridge|pg||
nt|barnets: ok|pg||
nt|barnets: i played against them as juniors|pg||
nt|lestergold: black doubleton qs neither of which are pulling their weight|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: yes i was expecting a further effort fromN/S but they are ta ufavouravle and south's hand was rightly devalued|pg||
mb|p|pc|dA|nt|cicus: good decisions by all|pg||
pc|dK|nt|pdjourdain: West switches a heart and then the hearts run, so declarer needed to play club ace at trick one|pg||
nt|qwikjanz: ducking this will ensure contract makes|pg||
pc|d4|nt|pdjourdain: Well done Pat Shields|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|pdjourdain: the defence have two hearts a spade a club and a diamond|pg||

pc|h4|nt|qwikjanz: not many plays now|pg||

nt|lestergold: which would be anathma to anderon's ears|pg||
nt|chick: potential to reach an unmakeable slam here|pg||

mb|p|nt|eamongall: Onishuk managed to gather in 8 tricks despite a lack of trumps ...|pg||
nt|eamongall: I was watching this while our room was missing |pg||

nt|pdjourdain: nat positive|pg||
nt|chick: 1@H positive and natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|pdjourdain: 3N better than 4H!!!|pg||
mb|4H|nt|eamongall: via Bangor Bridge Congress|pg||
nt|chick: 1N showing 4 spades?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dohicky:  8 tricks seems like the limit|pg||
nt|chick: or just pointcount?|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: this 3@S appears 1 off|pg||
nt|cicus: well EW might take the push to 5H  which is also making|pg||
nt|cicus: ohoh|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: 1NT nat|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: I do not believe this Short floating the double with the square root of zilch defence byt massicve offensive dtrength|pg||
nt|lestergold: a very poor result for the scots|pg||
pc|h6|nt|pdjourdain: West must pass|pg||
nt|cicus: W chickened out, not wanting to make them save|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|barnets: cards lie welll for dec here|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|nt|dohicky:  Looks like 8 tricks in @h for EW too|pg||
nt|lestergold: does short think taht greenwood was born yesterday?!|pg||
pc|c5|nt|cicus: in which case he felt he would not know what to do|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|cK|nt|barnets: can actually make 11 tricks|pg||
pc|c9|nt|pdjourdain: diamonds pips good gives 10 tricks|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: in any case im surprised that short passd the spade opener there is something wrong about th is bidding|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: In dangerous territory now|pg||
pc|c7|nt|barnets: DD|pg||
nt|cicus: so a medium size swing to be expected for Scotland|pg||
nt|cicus: and W has even let this make|pg||
pc|c3|nt|chick: past the point of no return and playing in a 4-2 fit|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Presumably East thought 2@C was checkback and West thought it natural|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: altho the final contract doubled is within the realms of what we see regularly in these matches|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Alternatively the bididng needs correcting|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|xenya: all quite reasonable i think --  9 tricks|pg||
nt|chick: complex bidding agreements may work well as intended, but they sure do mess up a lot of hands when you forget them|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: He is lucky in a way that no slam makes|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: But you should stop in 3N|pg||
pc|cT|pc|d3|pc|h8|nt|chick: true for sure.  but I think normal bidding of 2N 3@D 3@H 3 or 4N should keep them|pg||
nt|chick: safe|pg||

mb|1N|nt|cicus: then the size is going to be rather large|pg||

mb|p|nt|dohicky: True :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: I expect 3n making 4 |pg||
nt|lestergold: lsoing 2 spades and a club|pg||
nt|lestergold: if i was playing this id win in dummy and play a spade to start with not wanting to get an early diamnond switch from east|pg||
mb|p|nt|pdjourdain: probable 9 tricks|pg||
nt|dohicky:  Could be tricky but with trumps behaving it looks ok|pg||
pc|c3|nt|eamongall: I bought it ...in a bookstore in Boston some years ago |pg||
nt|lestergold: well i do n ot kn ow their bidding system|pg||
pc|h4|nt|dohicky: This should be -2 now|pg||

nt|barnets: it is though an excellent contract|pg||
nt|barnets: and west should have done more|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lestergold: but 3N or 4@h both laydown|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|eamongall: em em |pg||
nt|dohicky: 3@s makes things very difficult|pg||
nt|eamongall: Adam Mesbur did not bid 4@S |pg||
pc|s2|nt|barnets: thats for sure :)|pg||
nt|barnets: can th op tell us the final contract ?|pg||
nt|eamongall: I read all the hands ...now I am reading the stories |pg||
nt|dohicky: interesting|pg||
nt|eamongall: for results etc ...start at www.nibu.co.uk and navigate to Bangor Bridge Congress page |pg||
nt|vugraphzdv: Hands seem to be transposed?|pg||
nt|lestergold: when you see both hands of course 3n is a better contract but unbiddable compared with the obvious 4@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzdv: Lead Jc|pg||
nt|lestergold: then certainly transposed|pg||
nt|lestergold: unless Liz u are already on the l.ocal tipple|pg||
pc|s4|nt|barnets: undo ope|pg||
nt|dohicky: There's an extra pass operator|pg||
nt|eamongall: they are doing more ...just in the wrong seats |pg||

nt|barnets: why would west want t play in 4N ?|pg||
nt|cicus: well it was a bit strange that E opened 1@H then rebid the suit...|pg||
pc|sK|nt|barnets: east must have bid 4@S|pg||
nt|barnets: now 4N from west|pg||
nt|eamongall: it will sort itself out eventually |pg||
nt|barnets: I hope you bought it :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: after ace of clubs id play spade perosnally but as dim is right no harm done|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|barnets: well i think 6@H can be made|pg||
nt|barnets: if dec plays for 6@h tricks 2@C 1@s and 3@D|pg||
nt|eamongall: well I am not arguing with Barnet Shenkin ...I was reading a book recently about playing with experts by the same guy :) |pg||
pc|c4|nt|xenya: yes on both points -- but it would be too much to expect S to let them play 5@D|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm south on lead? this gets curiouser and curiouser|pg||
nt|cicus: board is shifted 180 degrees plus bid out of turn?|pg||
nt|lestergold: i doubt bid out of tuen more likely 180 degrees|pg||
nt|cicus: but dealer shifts as well|pg||
nt|cicus: or am I totally confused?|pg||
nt|lestergold: I must leave for a while folks and look forward to being back for next stanza|pg||
nt|cicus: whatever, result will be the same, 10 tricks in hearts|pg||
nt|cicus: are they playing?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|cicus: ok|pg||
pc|h9|nt|dohicky: yes|pg||
nt|chick: EW are going to have a lot of explaining to do when they meet their teammates|pg||
nt|chick: to compare :-\|pg||
nt|vugraphzdv: we seem to have lost connection to the open room.,  closing to reconnect|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: But they have 3@S doubled making and so did Scotland against England|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|dohicky:  +1 now?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|nt|lestergold: if dimn was wrong he wopuld need a spade trick to make|pg||
nt|lestergold: unlikely that east would go in with @sK to shoot dim thru at that point|pg||
nt|lestergold: just a litle point about technique./declarer play|pg||

nt|chick: minutes|pg||
nt|chick: Lots of thanks to our excellent vugraph operator, Liz Scott!  Thanks Liz, great job|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
nt|chick: a nice solid 4@S to finish this session quietly|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: of course 5@H was makeable -- on the previous one|pg||
nt|dohicky: yes|pg||
nt|dohicky: not on A and another @h lead|pg||
nt|cicus: oh no, Liz |pg||
mb|1C!|nt|dohicky: A weak 2 in @s with strong options|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|chick: EW do have a possible sacrifice in clubs, but cannot make 5|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: here too|pg||
nt|dohicky: 4@s look ok|pg||
nt|dohicky: looks|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|pdjourdain: 3N from north|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: a @H lead might be awkward?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@d infrangible as cards lie|pg||
mb|1N|nt|cicus: again|pg||
nt|vugraphzdv: It appears so.  |pg||
nt|cicus: can you please warn them not to do it again for the last two boards?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdv: I can't clearly seethe held hand by east or south|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: but still should make|pg||
nt|dohicky: yes if S ducks a @c finesse after drawing trumps|pg||
nt|dohicky:  2N is probably some form of limit raise in @s|pg||
nt|lestergold: not a bad contract even with spaxdes breaking 4/2 plenty of chance of making as u cab uff a spade high if necessary|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|dohicky: Missing slam here could be costly|pg||
mb|p|nt|dohicky: well with a @d lead it was down|pg||
nt|dohicky: well no it wouldnt :)|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think so|pg||
nt|xenya: on a @H lead declarer can work on @Ds making 10 eventually|pg||
nt|dohicky: Another possible 6@h|pg||
nt|lestergold: obviously hand breaks down if both key suits break badly but thats against the odds|pg||
nt|lestergold: i will be surprised if they reach slam of course the lack of wasted in clubs is the reason for the playabkle slam here|pg||
mb|2H|nt|dohicky:  maybe a more balanced version than 2@c|pg||
nt|lestergold: can they identify the fact that they are playibng with a thirty point pack in effect and they hold 27 of those 30 points!|pg||
nt|lestergold: its an aold and familiar story|pg||
nt|lestergold: Short will know his hand is great if south can be relied on for a stiff/void club|pg||
nt|lestergold: now short has a problem how can he show dim support and make a slam try as well?|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: England 139 Ireland 126 Scotland 114 I think is the current top 3 after 7 matches |pg||
nt|lestergold: looks l.ike short sighneed off in 5@d and south couldnt move|pg||
mb|2S|nt|cicus: so it was West who opened 1NT and E transferred|pg||
nt|vugraphzdv: I don't think it's their fault - misdealt by me I think?|pg||
nt|lestergold: or can south puntit with those lousy spades?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: 4@D was another transfer to make the hand be played by West (I am writing this hanging from the ceiling)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: surely input error|pg||

mb|1H|nt|xenya: 1N?|pg||
nt|dohicky: 12-14 :)|pg||
nt|xenya: i can count 6 hcp|pg||

nt|eamongall: strong version of the Carrot Club|pg||
nt|lestergold: operator input check please!|pg||
nt|chick: looks like a makeable slam double dummy, but not finding the @HJ10xx will|pg||
nt|chick: probably kill it|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: yes, pass missed here |pg||
nt|dohicky: 2@d from N is 4@s + longer other or 5+@s|pg||
nt|dohicky:  1@d is 0-7|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh it is right|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry|pg||
nt|lestergold: NI did well to bid this slam in the open room|pg||
nt|lestergold: they will not be unhappy if the Scots miss this|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|dohicky: oh this makes more sense|pg||
nt|xenya: that's even better|pg||
nt|dohicky: An extra pass operator|pg||
nt|dohicky:  1N is 17-19|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphzdv: Yes but a couple ended up suited so had to be hand done, these seem to be the ones|pg||
nt|cicus: I am not familiar with the technicalities of BBO|pg||
nt|vugraphzdv: Carelessness on my part.  Sorry|pg||
nt|cicus: np, you do a fine job|pg||
nt|lestergold: spec points out that there are squeeze p;osibilities in 6H but it involves ruffing down the diamonds so west has rto guard both minors etc etc|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: but did N really pass over 1N?|pg||
nt|dohicky: another pass missed?|pg||
nt|cicus: 10 tricks expected here with 1@S+3@H+2@D+4@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: this hand is aclassic hand of playing in the 4/4 fit to use the long suit fit for discards|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: I like the 4@H bid, knowing partner has at least 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|pdjourdain: Shields was planning a penalty pass of 2D so must bid 4H now|pg||
nt|xenya: seems unlikely|pg||
nt|dohicky: well he has 2@s as 5@s and a minor|pg||
nt|lestergold: not always correct as sometimes you need to play in the long suit for reasons of control|pg||
pc|s2|nt|qwikjanz: so this should catapult wales into the lead|pg||
nt|dohicky: I suppose this bidding makes some sense (except for N first pass)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|s6|pg||
nt|lestergold: south has the club guard so has to bid it maybe is worried about trump quality presumably can enquire about that?|pg||
nt|lestergold: no he has chickened out and this will be very expensive for the scots|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: 13 imps the price|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||
nt|dohicky: A spec points out that the 3@d showing a doubleton will take the only guess of the hand away|pg||
nt|dohicky: well one of the 2|pg||
nt|xenya: well 5@D is a nice contract -- and perhaps N did pass -- otherwise they would be in 4@S|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c7|nt|eamongall: seems a decent contract 2@S ..although defence have big trumps but both hands 4333|pg||
pc|cT|pc|s5|pg||
nt|xenya: or not|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe short is more to blame in this auction his hand after all is massive he should b enquiring about the club control|pg||

nt|lestergold: excellent lead here|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|nt|pdjourdain: Well done!|pg||
nt|cicus: but in fact I thought the lead will be from the ace, managed to confuse myself again|pg||
nt|cicus: after 2 rounds of @Hs N wil have to switch so declarer will have time to develop his tricks|pg||
nt|cicus: he can even  play @Ds from the top|pg||
nt|cicus: if S has the ace he will go up anyway to lead a 3rd @H so declarer may place the ace behind the king|pg||
nt|cicus: so there is no way to lose this contract|pg||
nt|cicus: Liz, is S thinking?|pg||
nt|cicus: we are stuck, I believe|pg||
