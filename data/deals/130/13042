nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone @H@H|pg||
nt|chick: S is already thinking slam here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's a handicap event, so the underdogs, the OS.se team, has a 20 IMP advantage in the first set|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|rnmalik: Hi Gary, Haans welcome|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|josj: gm all|pg||

nt|josj: maybe good afternoon to Rashed :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: so cautious bidders lucky day|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont know their methods but 3@h should be a weak bid in most modern styles|pg||
nt|peachy: I think S will pass, no shape|pg||
nt|lestergold: as 2@s avaialble to shopw a good raise which of course north has|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 9pm here :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: I would tend to agree, in competition weak|pg||

nt|haans: Multi has been around for many years but ...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Good Morning Jos, net speed is slightly slow today:)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lestergold: south should pass whatever the 3@h bid means|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 01.00 PM at my end|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: The underdogs won't lose on this board|pg||
nt|lestergold: and has but we must remember that in general not bidding 50 ish percedntage vul games is not a winning strategy|pg||

nt|haans: 2@S say pass with spades  but i have hearts|pg||
nt|josj: yes that's what it should say|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Usually game interest the way we play it in NZ|pg||
nt|josj: and it did...for W at least, that is|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lestergold: well it wont surprise me if game is bid in the open|pg||
nt|santyclz: 6@h doesn't have any pitfalls, 6@ss is in danger if the defense starts with 2 rounds of @cs.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: Welcome back to the 2nd session of 4 from this semifinal. In the other semifinal, the favourite team San Sac made a impressive 56-7 against Lirarna. Lirarna had 14IMP as a ...|pg||

nt|lestergold: soemtimes game declared by north beaten out of hand on spade lead then|pg||
pc|d6|nt|peachy: This event has teams handicapped as I understand|pg||
pc|c3|nt|chick: theoretical danger, but not as the cards lie, I think|pg||

nt|haans: right|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|santyclz: Defense would be so much easier if they would let us lead 2 suits at the same time.  Maybe we should write a letter.|pg||
nt|chick: nah, if it were changed, then someone would want 3|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: it would be easier to be declarer if you could play two suits at the same time too.. I always seem to run out of entries for my finesses.. :)|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|vugraphzpx: quick starting board, trying to keep themselves ahead of the other table :)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Interesting point is whether 4@D shows @HQ already when the subsequent 5@D denied a keycard. Do you have an agreement like that?|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: 6red suit here can they find that|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: EW headed for 3NT|pg||

nt|rnmalik: slam time and grand |pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: which might make from W|pg||

nt|santyclz: Happy International Womens Day, Cornelia, specs of the female persuation and all the ships at sea.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: not a lot :)|pg||

mb|2N|an|Jacoby|mb|p|mb|3C|an|Minimum|nt|chick: not sure what 2N asked, but they found their way to a makeable contract|pg||
nt|haans: all cards working|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Linköping is the main city in the county of Östergötland in southern Sweden with around 100,000 inhabitants|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 2NT was most likely forcing with support|pg||
mb|3H|an|Shortage asking|nt|lestergold: probably will make @d lead un,likely natural to play club finesse for J thru north etc|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Staffan, how do they figure out how many IMPs the weaker team gets in advance?|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade most likely|pg||
mb|4C|nt|santyclz: @h10?|pg||
nt|chick: nice lead, but not obvious to S I suspect|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hey y'all, gl everybody|pg||
nt|chick: 2@H was showing 2 suits?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpx: Think so, 5-4 at least and a decent opening hand for a 11-16|pg||
nt|chick: Merhaba Hamdi :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: :)|pg||
mb|4D|nt|Walddk2: There is probably a formula|pg||
nt|peachy: high from dummy and start clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 7@D better contract|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|peachy: well, I would have:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well hes going to make it whether or not that was the best start|pg||
nt|santyclz: Suggested (to me) by the 97x in dummy.|pg||
mb|5H|nt|h_karluk: i am not a system maker, however at first glance seemed a bit wide HCP range|pg||
nt|chick: they are playing a precision-like strong 1@C 17+|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|nt|lestergold: clear cut overtake of diamond not that it makes any odds now|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: very good|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: well done i say|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: as often 7 becomes too hard to reach|pg||
nt|josj: it looks as if S might have bid 5@D rather than 5@H|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kiwibridge: 5@D instead of 4@H may have helped|pg||
pc|sA|nt|nilsland:  There has been a qualification, maybe that has decided the handicap|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphzpx: E-W is playing 2-way club, either 11-13BAL or 17+|pg||
nt|chick: now 2 spades and a high crossruff|pg||
nt|haans: yeah but 4@H = nothing extra|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|josj: in that case, 5@D stands out once N goes on|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: KQ@D looks a bit extra after slam try by pard|pg||
nt|josj: over 4@H|pg||

nt|bucheister: Would be a great time to win the J with the A|pg||
nt|peachy: maybe this would be time to win the spade with ace.... since diamond finesse needed into W|pg||
nt|lestergold: we can predict play win cash top dim enter dummy with club take @d fionesse and then west has no chopice but to switch to a heart|pg||
nt|peachy: heh, you gues are faster typists|pg||
nt|santyclz: My kind of grand.  No finesses, only 1 line and it works.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|rnmalik: That hand with both majors is special|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  More exciting if East had ventured 3 NT|pg||
nt|nilsland:  would south find the diamond lead|pg||

mb|3S|nt|h_karluk: Staffan, east relative of Johan, any idea ? |pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|chick: now makes perfect sense, simple Jacoby/Stenberg 2N|pg||

mb|p|nt|daman: maybe after laying down the @H Ace|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Very strong team. Morath-Flodqvist (Tjolpe), Nilsland-Dahlberg and Bjerregaard-Gullberg. They would have done very well in the Open event I am sure|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Now heart ace is not so good|pg||
nt|daman: nope|pg||

mb|p|nt|daman: anything but a @H|pg||

nt|lestergold: 2@h meaning?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|nilsland:  Pity it will not make due to the spade lay|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unfortunately the 4-0 trump break dooms it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Very unlucky, it's a 95% slam, roughly|pg||
nt|othered1: aThe stiff @D devalues south's hand slightly, but it still has enough extras to push on.|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: maybe they will avoid the trap by peeking :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: as you can cope with all 4 with West|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The correct play in spades is the queen first|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Many get that wrong and they never notice|pg||
nt|Walddk2: because it usually does not matter|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: ah too quick with his enormolus hand |pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: spade  support, better than 2sp|pg||
nt|h_karluk: nowadays 20-20 layouts rare, we may see an elegant solution|pg||
nt|josj: did W have 2@H available here as an opening bid?|pg||
nt|josj: now the @H are lost|pg||
pc|c4|nt|nilsland:  You have to learn it "the hard way"|pg||
nt|lestergold: if west has shown a good raise in spades then east should beexploring because his hand becomes enormous|pg||
nt|peachy: if he went to game, might as well have splintered or done something|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|nt|h_karluk: interesting lead from KJx tenace|pg||
nt|haans: i think 2@H/2@S both roman|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|othered1: south will have to push this the rest of the way|pg||
nt|lestergold: lazy sign off basically|pg||
pc|c3|nt|nilsland:  Now  south know the heart ace is missing|pg||
nt|nilsland:  since N didnt cuebid 4 H|pg||
nt|nilsland:  And East will surely lead hearts...|pg||
nt|haans: old carrot style|pg||
pc|cK|nt|chick: this could even make an overtrick, because diamonds can be set up pretty easily|pg||
nt|h_karluk: perhaps a passive trump trick would more safe|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|pg||
nt|nilsland:  man or mouse? Man - it seems|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder if north's 4@C control bid was forced or whether it implies slam interest (good trumps are a plus).|pg||
nt|josj: that's what I would think too...|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|pc|h9|nt|lestergold: club splinter cant cost|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The fact that the 9 is with AK makes the slam 5% better, from 90 to 95% (half of the 4-0 breaks)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: Let's see what Eklund does|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Barrling rather|pg||
nt|josj: if E can open his rubbish, the why doesn't W open his nice hand?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|h_karluk: sorry *lead - pls ignore trick word|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ralfwil: I prefer 2nt from W as a very strong invite  and E can jump to 4@c|pg||

nt|nilsland:  a club lead was called for|pg||

mb|p|nt|peachy: apparently weak two in d not vailable|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|frankaus: i vaguelly recall a legend about some famous pair that agreed not to bid any slams in a year and found they were level pegging on the overall results|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: horrible X by W|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: no preempt with east'shand ?|pg||
nt|peachy: if no weak two, surely 3D is|pg||
nt|lestergold: no weak 2 at least its maxi but at this vul pretty ideal|pg||
nt|haans: right :) weak 2|pg||
nt|haans: strongly agree|pg||
nt|josj: no matter what it meant, Gary? :)|pg||
mb|4D|nt|ralfwil: cannot expect more than 2@h from N|pg||
nt|lestergold: another Roland fave hand here|pg||
nt|josj: interesting duplication in @D for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Thanks also to the Filbyter Bridge Club and Carl Ragnarsson for bringing this event to  BBO. |pg||
nt|othered1: And, f inally, thanks to my fellow commentators, George Holland, Mats Nilsland, John Bucheister, and Roland Wald.|pg||
nt|lestergold: he loves those 20/20 hands|pg||
nt|chick: I assume 2@D is asking further description|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yes|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk2: Play will resume after a short break, perhaps 10-15 mins|pg||
nt|chick: and N overruling his partner ... he would hate to find out that his partner has 6 spades|pg||
nt|haans: usually bid you suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: 4@C transfer to u suit|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lestergold: yep east backs in|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: and i think pushed n/s overboard|pg||
nt|peachy: N bid again.... I am amazed, in 4-card major system|pg||
pc|c7|nt|lestergold: north has not got a vestige of a 3@h bid |pg||
nt|peachy: not impossible to make though, if guessing the lead is singl|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h9|nt|othered1: Previous hand emphasizes the need to h ave "metaagreements" on handling 2-suited overcalls, so you  have some basis for action if one pops up against you.  A much better use of ...|pg||
nt|othered1: your time than concocting schemes to find third round controls on high minor suit auctions, etc.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well east is nowm glad he was cannily quiet|pg||
pc|hK|nt|nilsland:  6 @C may be the answer says Zbych from Poland|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|rodal f: Agree and would been a desaster, but argue with the odds and sucsess?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lestergold: well whether or not it was for the right reason he got the play right|pg||
nt|peachy: more hearts please|pg||
nt|chick: knowing that E has only 4 spades, S should keep pushing the hearts|pg||
pc|dK|nt|nilsland:  Or even 6 @H :)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|othered1: @D tap won't beat 6@H?|pg||
nt|nilsland:  yes|pg||
nt|nilsland:  as usual :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk2: 6@C is a great contract. If this is a choice of slams, I am impressed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Very well done!|pg||
pc|d3|nt|othered1: Very well done.  Minor suit slams aren't easiest contracts to find.|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|nilsland:  Should be easy to play with 2 diamond ruffs in dummy|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and no @c finess! @cA and a small|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|chick: and now S knows that partner is out of clubs, so a club to him, and heart back|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|othered1: or 2@S ruffs in hand (but @D are better)|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|lestergold: best to duck the club|pg||
nt|peachy: he will duck|pg||
nt|lestergold: he is considering it i expect|pg||
nt|lestergold: knows declarr needs every trick he can muster|pg||
nt|lestergold: sholuld be a trick short here|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Souths AK98 in clubs are solid|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|chick: if E tries to draw trump, will have no way back to the clubs|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|pc|s4|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or was it? 2@H is -1|pg||

nt|roswolf: whyis a 4-4-4-1 hand balanced !?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is a match between 3rd and 1st|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4441's are not always easy to describe|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so Mats Sjöberg treated his hand as balanced|pg||
nt|vugraphzew: Bergström thinking|pg||
nt|bjurn:  2nd and 4th teams, is it not?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup probably end up in 3nt|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: this wont be nice to play|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 23 combined, misfit and terrible breaks. That can't lead to something good|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|bjurn:  the layout is a bit unlucky but I would be surprised if the contract isnt the same at the other table|pg||

nt|vugraphzpx: E/W plays strong club, and 1D is 4k M unbal or 11-13NT.|pg||
nt|lestergold: the grand is enormous|pg||
nt|frankaus: sometimes with a misfitt 50 at a time is a bargain.|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: yes, probably tools available to dind out SQ is missing, but went on with length|pg||
nt|chick: and with the nice result in the other room, OS.se finally gets on the scoreboard this session|pg||
mb|1S|nt|daman: is there an engldih translation for Torbjorn?|pg||
nt|daman: english|pg||
nt|Walddk2: björn = bear|pg||
nt|daman: ok  thx|pg||
nt|peachy: *find|pg||
nt|chick: for you latecomers ... 20 of the IMPs for OS.se is the handicap they started with|pg||
nt|chick: wow, now we are moving on to transfer overcalls :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: this is the weak NT obviously|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Mats Nilsland|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Mats|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Mats!|pg||
nt|nilsland:  hi|pg||
nt|lestergold: and they had better bid it or they will be drowned in then deficit|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ralfwil: looks like Stenberg|pg||
nt|peachy: it is pretty deep already|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: pretty soon, it will be transfer openings, and then no one will be able to bid the suits they have :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: here are the OR's first 2 boards|pg||
mb|2N|nt|lestergold: it was a long auction to 7 in the open|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Mats will tell you all about wriggling if they get doubled in 1NT :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: not bidding the grand would be resignimng time i think|pg||
nt|rodal f: Let's see how EWs minorsystem works|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: He is the man behind Nilsland's Slinkningar, an escape system when 1NT gets doubled|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|santyclz: Re-hi folks.  Lost my conn for a few moments.|pg||
nt|chick: an aceless 10 HCP plus a void is hardly worth two takeout doubles|pg||
nt|chick: we missed you, Joe :)|pg||
nt|chick: everyone was getting totally bored with just me :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: if East would have passed, as I think he should have, South may pass 3@C D|pg||
nt|frankaus: not real well but its a difficult hand for most systems|pg||
nt|rodal f: Would it been better with 2@S from E at the 1NT?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: definitly 2@S would have been better if they play like that|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: that was a heavy 1@H overcall|pg||
nt|chick: hehe|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: I bid 1NT - 2@S - something - 3@D with hands like Easts|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: and South found a reason not to raise|pg||
nt|othered1: off shape for a double and wrong for 1N, 1@H looks normal, if you choose to act at all|pg||
nt|haans: 23 hcp|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no fit and no hope of making :(|pg||
pc|dT|nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|josj: biut not much of a swing either|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I never open 4441 11 counts - keeps me out of trouble|pg||
nt|josj: look at those nice pointed suits|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: also would NEVER open one 1@S|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|daman: why do you feel it is offshape?|pg||
nt|santyclz: S didn't his 4@c?  Mercy rule in effect?|pg||
nt|santyclz: (hit)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: I don´t think he expected a pass from his p|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: combined 28 count have to bid well to reach the grand|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|d2|nt|haans: i do not open it with 1@S|pg||
pc|d6|nt|rodal f: Belive they don't. Might something for them to discuss|pg||
pc|d5|nt|daman: 3424|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: perfecto no wasted hands fit like hand and glove|pg||
pc|c4|nt|vugraphzpx: South that is.. :)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|peachy: After GF spade raise, S has all suits sontrolled first or second round. Even if N hadn't South still would|pg||
nt|lestergold: well another 13 imps into the bottomless pit|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but they still have tio be confident of 13 tricks controls are only part of the story|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|peachy: the first part, yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: first three bids same in open room then the auctions took different directions|pg||
nt|lestergold: and sadly  a differfent destination|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h3|pc|d3|nt|othered1: OK, perhaps sub-optimal shape for a double|pg||
nt|daman: well   4414 would be ideal I suppose|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|josj: entry position awkward now|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|pc|sK|nt|lestergold: thios is where you pray that west is the one to show out on the spades|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We do not live in an ideal world. You've got to bid the cards you are dealt|pg||
nt|santyclz: Whoa, OS:se gained 10 imps while I was gone!  (OS:se supporters, I do take bribes...)|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d7|nt|nilsland:  If you are waiting for an ideal hand you wil have to pass most of the time|pg||
nt|daman: exactly|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c3|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lestergold: should be fined for slow claims|pg||
pc|hA|nt|chick: OS.se isn't doing well at all, but they are hanging in pretty well and trying, not going nuts with silly swing bids|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pg||
