nt|jbgood: Aa is a long time Nor international who started playing with Molberg when Aa - Grøtheim boke up|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: The other table hasn't yet started and the director is checking that they aren't anywhere where someone could see a hand, so we're going to wait for a moment|pg||
nt|stewball: S may bypass @s for now|pg||
nt|jbgood: the have been very successful in their prdship|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Rumour has it that Aa is almost as slow as Grøtheim. Is that correct?|pg||
nt|jbgood: he may take his time ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Meanwhile, I have some quarter scores from the other matches: Lall 14-Zaleski 38, Dawson 25 - Fleisher 30, Strul 17 - Cayne 30. I will hope to get more scores later|pg||
nt|Walddk2: N-S are not exactly fast either, so we may get all the comparisons in this room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Meanwhile, 1@C is 16+ and 1@D 0-7|pg||

nt|jbgood: as Roland mentioned, Terje Aa is not the fastest one on earth, but then he doesnt make hasty mistakes|pg||
nt|stewball: I expect he\ll win ace and \play @h|pg||
nt|buffytvs: and the NS pair played pretty slowly yesterdya, so we could be in for some long pauses|pg||
nt|buffytvs: it will up to us to keep everyone amused :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Some Norwegian specs tell me that he is even slower than Grøtheim. That takes a lot|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Roland, who picks the matches?  We have the same team here as yesterday...|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Interesting deal this. Cheek misguessed trumps, unerstandably, after East's pre-empt|pg||
nt|Walddk2: O would have too|pg||
nt|Walddk2: *I|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes -- an imbalance of 4 vacant spaces or so defintiely tips the scales in favour of the finesse through West|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Here are the rest of the scores: Schwartz 36 - De Knijff 39, Nickell 10 - Zimmerman 17, Onstott 22 - Carmichael 31, Hampton 19 0 Lynch 48|pg||
mb|d|mb|4C|nt|buffytvs: not easy to reach 6@S after the preempt -- much depends on North|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Platnick thinks @CQJ are wasted. Miraculously, on this auction, they are not|pg||
nt|buffytvs: the raise could cause him to play for 3-6 clubs, but I sitll don't think he'll get spades right|pg||
nt|jbgood: N showing cards may get S to make a slammish move|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Diamond thinking |pg||
nt|Walddk2: How do you do that now, Jon?|pg||
nt|stewball: 6@c?|pg||
nt|jbgood: 5 @c - as in the other room|pg||
nt|buffytvs: 5@C or 6@S I guess|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: How to show slam interest as long as no suit has been bid yet? Yes Ray, but 6@S leaves partner out of it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So 5@C is probably best|pg||
nt|buffytvs: these auctions are hard -- North could be 3-3 in the majors with some cards|pg||
nt|buffytvs: and if he is, they may well end up in the wrong suit|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: as we always say, you can't be perfect over preempts|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|po-s: Isn´t 6D an overbid?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@D has no play on a heart lead, so Diamond did the right thing when he pulled. However, I think it will be a flat board|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Aa asks about the DBL of 4@c and Diamond says "responsive" and shrugs|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cQ|nt|jbgood: now S can see that the clubs are 7-2 ..|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|buffytvs: The mathematics of the situation definitely favours the losing finesse in spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: All my club members would make it. They go for the drop when they have nine between them, pre-empt or not|pg||
nt|buffytvs: lol|pg||
nt|henryb:  Sorry I am late|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The trouble here is that both declarers are too good|pg||
nt|buffytvs: you can imagine the compare:  1 down on Bd 18?  well played...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And it was|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Jeffrey Allerton: declarer might wonder why Aa raised with doubleton club.  would he do so with @sQxx and honours in the reds?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fair point|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Diamond checking the opponents' convention card about leads|pg||
