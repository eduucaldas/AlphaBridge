nt|chick: Hello Everyone @H@H|pg||
nt|chick: S is already thinking slam here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's a handicap event, so the underdogs, the OS.se team, has a 20 IMP advantage in the first set|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S!|nt|josj: gm all|pg||

nt|josj: maybe good afternoon to Rashed :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: so cautious bidders lucky day|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont know their methods but 3@h should be a weak bid in most modern styles|pg||
nt|peachy: I think S will pass, no shape|pg||
nt|lestergold: as 2@s avaialble to shopw a good raise which of course north has|pg||

mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: The underdogs won't lose on this board|pg||
nt|lestergold: and has but we must remember that in general not bidding 50 ish percedntage vul games is not a winning strategy|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: 2@S say pass with spades  but i have hearts|pg||
nt|josj: yes that's what it should say|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Usually game interest the way we play it in NZ|pg||
nt|josj: and it did...for W at least, that is|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well it wont surprise me if game is bid in the open|pg||
nt|santyclz: 6@h doesn't have any pitfalls, 6@ss is in danger if the defense starts with 2 rounds of @cs.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: Welcome back to the 2nd session of 4 from this semifinal. In the other semifinal, the favourite team San Sac made a impressive 56-7 against Lirarna. Lirarna had 14IMP as a ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: handicap, but that´s gone already|pg||
nt|chick: hello Everyone :)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: minus 1|pg||
nt|lestergold: soemtimes game declared by north beaten out of hand on spade lead then|pg||
pc|cA|nt|peachy: This event has teams handicapped as I understand|pg||
pc|c2|nt|chick: theoretical danger, but not as the cards lie, I think|pg||
nt|santyclz: Right.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kiwibridge: ?|pg||

pc|c7|nt|santyclz: 3/3 @ds solve any potential problms.|pg||
nt|chick: 3-2 hearts :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|santyclz: That too.|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|josj: declarer can make it now but he does not know|pg||
pc|s3|nt|chick: if E could both make dummy ruff AND lead a heart to knock out entry, then it might be tougher, but he can do only one of those|pg||
nt|haans: right|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|santyclz: Defense would be so much easier if they would let us lead 2 suits at the same time.  Maybe we should write a letter.|pg||
nt|chick: nah, if it were changed, then someone would want 3|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: it would be easier to be declarer if you could play two suits at the same time too.. I always seem to run out of entries for my finesses.. :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzpx: .se had 20IMP in handicap at the start, but after a tough session Team Zang is now in the lead |pg||
nt|josj: and keeping us busy|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 6red suit here can they find that|pg||
nt|josj: so Zang likely to further increase their lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: EW headed for 3NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w have a chance in 3N on a non diamond lead|pg||
nt|josj: what's wrong with a grand?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: slam time and grand |pg||
nt|mdgraham: leading partner's suit is easy. West might very well have led a spade, holding a singleton heart, but when you do not lead partner's suit you have to be right |pg||
mb|1D!|an|0+ !D|nt|peachy: which might make from W|pg||

mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: not a lot :)|pg||

mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|peachy: unless diamonds shown somehow by S|pg||
nt|josj: also very true...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: NS play 1@C 17+|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it could be said that there is a good case for a spade lead, as hearts are unlikely to run, but again, not particularly easy at the table  |pg||
mb|3H!|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|chick: not sure what 2N asked, but they found their way to a makeable contract|pg||
nt|haans: all cards working|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Linköping is the main city in the county of Östergötland in southern Sweden with around 100,000 inhabitants|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 2NT was most likely forcing with support|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: probably will make @d lead un,likely natural to play club finesse for J thru north etc|pg||
nt|pelu: 23-level looks like max - so fight on 3-level :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 1@D 0+, 1@H/@S 5+|pg||
nt|josj: too high for either side, the 3-level here|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: Staffan, how do they figure out how many IMPs the weaker team gets in advance?|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade most likely|pg||
pc|hA|nt|santyclz: @h10?|pg||
nt|chick: nice lead, but not obvious to S I suspect|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hey y'all, gl everybody|pg||
nt|chick: 2@H was showing 2 suits?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzpx: Think so, 5-4 at least and a decent opening hand for a 11-16|pg||
nt|chick: Merhaba Hamdi :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: :)|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There is probably a formula|pg||
nt|peachy: high from dummy and start clubs|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rnmalik: 7@D better contract|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|peachy: well, I would have:)|pg||
nt|pelu: some would open 1NT in S - and then 2@S from East - passed out|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lestergold: well hes going to make it whether or not that was the best start|pg||
nt|santyclz: Suggested (to me) by the 97x in dummy.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|h_karluk: i am not a system maker, however at first glance seemed a bit wide HCP range|pg||
nt|chick: they are playing a precision-like strong 1@C 17+|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lestergold: clear cut overtake of diamond not that it makes any odds now|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|h_karluk: very good|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|haans: well done i say|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: as often 7 becomes too hard to reach|pg||
nt|josj: it looks as if S might have bid 5@D rather than 5@H|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 5@D instead of 4@H may have helped|pg||
pc|d9|nt|nilsland:  There has been a qualification, maybe that has decided the handicap|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it is always odd, on hands like this, that players are so, so reluctant to defend  |pg||
pc|dT|nt|vugraphzpx: E-W is playing 2-way club, either 11-13BAL or 17+|pg||
nt|chick: now 2 spades and a high crossruff|pg||
nt|haans: yeah but 4@H = nothing extra|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|josj: in that case, 5@D stands out once N goes on|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: KQ@D looks a bit extra after slam try by pard|pg||
nt|josj: over 4@H|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c2|nt|cuttysark: Rather like the lady who did not double Harrison-Gray's 7NT when on lead with an ace - "Mr Gray always redoubles"|pg||

mb|p|nt|santyclz: The open room has lapped us.|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Grand slam you mean|pg||
nt|chick: hey, we get to see other table results for a change :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: should be aflattie tho|pg||
nt|lestergold: even  spade lead wont help much|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk4: Very disappointing that a strong club top pair did not bid it next door|pg||
nt|haans: none play 1@D first and then jump any more. Does anyone?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: and Mats Nilsland will be playing for Sweden seniors at the European Teams Championships this summer. Good luck to him!|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: but 1@C was alerted |pg||
nt|josj: usually, 1@D neg. shows 0-7, I assume|pg||

nt|mdgraham: 2@S lead-directing|pg||
nt|pelu: would u open 2@S in N? - not me|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|chick: yes, Roland, easy to set up clubs for a heart pitch|pg||
mb|3C|nt|josj: no except if playing 2-suiters|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not with six to the nine|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  thx |pg||
nt|ralfwil: On a @s lead to @sJ S should play @sA, not the @sQ|pg||
nt|bucheister: Would be a great time to win the J with the A|pg||
nt|peachy: maybe this would be time to win the spade with ace.... since diamond finesse needed into W|pg||
nt|lestergold: we can predict play win cash top dim enter dummy with club take @d fionesse and then west has no chopice but to switch to a heart|pg||
nt|peachy: heh, you gues are faster typists|pg||
nt|santyclz: My kind of grand.  No finesses, only 1 line and it works.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|rnmalik: That hand with both majors is special|pg||
mb|3S|nt|nilsland:  More exciting if East had ventured 3 NT|pg||
nt|nilsland:  would south find the diamond lead|pg||
nt|chick: but such a perfect fit is not always easy to uncover|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: Staffan, east relative of Johan, any idea ? |pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|chick: now makes perfect sense, simple Jacoby/Stenberg 2N|pg||

mb|p|nt|daman: maybe after laying down the @H Ace|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Very strong team. Morath-Flodqvist (Tjolpe), Nilsland-Dahlberg and Bjerregaard-Gullberg. They would have done very well in the Open event I am sure|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Now heart ace is not so good|pg||
nt|daman: nope|pg||
nt|josj: lucky layout for EW in @S amply compensated by bad @C break|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: anything but a @H|pg||
nt|daman: clearly 3@S was not forcing|pg||
nt|nilsland:  This will be a good board for the underdogs|pg||

mb|p|nt|josj: wd by N|pg||
nt|pelu: what did they have for breakfast? :)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|h_karluk: i wonder on the way grand or just slam|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|cA|nt|chick: think they can find the grand, hamdi?|pg||
nt|chick: NS has been very solid so far today|pg||
nt|chick: if 3@H showed shortness (specifically), then should bid them again to show void|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|nt|bucheister: Catholic grade school with nuns|pg||
nt|peachy: aah, they made you learn it|pg||
nt|ralfwil: bad presence at table again!|pg||
nt|lestergold: curwest  an see he has to get busy and hope for the hearts|pg||
nt|ralfwil: as @sJ denies @s10.....|pg||
nt|lestergold: but his pard's blood pressure rising as tank goes on|pg||
nt|lestergold: he can see that if he doesnt find some fast tricks then declarer is likely home|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||

nt|chick: (not to mention no heart stopper) :)|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|santyclz: Did e ever get to show a long solid suit?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: he showed 6+ @S|pg||

pc|h5|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|s5|nt|ralfwil: another nice play is that after @sQ play a small towards dummy|pg||
nt|chick: I blame W for not finding 7, she can see everything she needs to count to 13 tricks ... only danger I can see is 3 small clubs with partner and no 2-2 split|pg||
nt|chick: ruff 2 spades (all trumps are high), draw trump, and pitch last spade on club ... time to claim|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no overruff fear there - 432 outside spots|pg||
nt|haans: most swedes play low positive|pg||

pc|h6|nt|josj: declarer has to go all out now and will end up down a lot|pg||

nt|davidstern: You obviously havent lost as many matches by 1 or 2 imps as I have|pg||

nt|davidstern: Sure it looks good seeing @DJxx @CJxx|pg||
nt|davidstern: Bit scary looking just at N/S hands|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes, David, I know - against you they would both break 5-0....|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: No I am EVER the optimist not the half empty person|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|davidstern: As evidenced by how many slams I go down in|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|davidstern: Hard to see how they will get to slam - the first hurdle is to avoid 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|bjurn:  if south has any way of showing a 3suited hand with short @Hs they might|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think 2 3-2 breaks are about 50% - so its fair, and one NS want to be in at the state of the match|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Many players can repond 3@H (or 3@D) to show the shortage in hearts. Useful here|pg||
nt|davidstern: 2 x 3-2 not worrying about singleton jacks is 68% x 58% or 46.24%|pg||
nt|davidstern: 6|pg||
nt|davidstern: 68% x 68%|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|roswolf: this has scope|pg||
nt|davidstern: So around 50/50 after you take into accounts the singleton jack or picking up trumps if that is all|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|vugraphzew: You have an extra chance with @S coming in 3-3 as well|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|vugraphzew: TD is called, EW thinks NS takes too much time|pg||
nt|davidstern: Ok we have convinced ourselves that it is a GREAT SLAM|pg||
nt|po-s: and some stiff tens or jacks in clubs|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: 4nt should be passable in this sequence but i wouldnt here|pg||
nt|dburn: well, whatever kind of a slam it is, it is a better contract than 4NT|pg||
nt|davidstern: EW have called for the director - I wouldnt think of it after I take our 5 heart tricks|pg||
nt|cuttysark: That is a bit harsh - and may put them off their stroke. I do not think North intended 4N to play?|pg||

mb|p|nt|peachy: nice fitting hands EW here|pg||

mb|1N|nt|kiwibridge:  2 was a longer auction but still faded out at 6@H|pg||
nt|pelu: @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 18 opposite 13 and a 5-4 fit, I think they will|pg||
nt|josj: minor suit slams are always difficult to reach and this should be another example|pg||
nt|mdgraham: assuming North has six spades, he is known to have 10 black cards and two hearts|pg||
nt|pelu: spec after 1NT|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|ralfwil: a nice @s slam!|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ah, not a married couple...|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|lestergold: will desrve some praise if they get there|pg||
nt|peachy: indeed|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2@h meaning?|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  Pity it will not make due to the spade lay|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unfortunately the 4-0 trump break dooms it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Very unlucky, it's a 95% slam, roughly|pg||
nt|othered1: aThe stiff @D devalues south's hand slightly, but it still has enough extras to push on.|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|daman: maybe they will avoid the trap by peeking :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: as you can cope with all 4 with West|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The correct play in spades is the queen first|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Many get that wrong and they never notice|pg||
nt|Walddk2: because it usually does not matter|pg||
nt|josj: of course, but even if N does not hold a sing. @D the 10 is "unnecessary"|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S!|nt|lestergold: ah too quick with his enormolus hand |pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: spade  support, better than 2sp|pg||
nt|h_karluk: nowadays 20-20 layouts rare, we may see an elegant solution|pg||
nt|josj: did W have 2@H available here as an opening bid?|pg||
nt|josj: now the @H are lost|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  You have to learn it "the hard way"|pg||
nt|lestergold: if west has shown a good raise in spades then east should beexploring because his hand becomes enormous|pg||
nt|peachy: if he went to game, might as well have splintered or done something|pg||
nt|pelu: with 5-2-2-4 stille a small @D |pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: interesting lead from KJx tenace|pg||
nt|haans: i think 2@H/2@S both roman|pg||
mb|3D|nt|othered1: south will have to push this the rest of the way|pg||
nt|lestergold: lazy sign off basically|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  Now  south know the heart ace is missing|pg||
nt|nilsland:  since N didnt cuebid 4 H|pg||
nt|nilsland:  And East will surely lead hearts...|pg||
nt|haans: old carrot style|pg||
mb|3S|nt|chick: this could even make an overtrick, because diamonds can be set up pretty easily|pg||
nt|h_karluk: perhaps a passive trump trick would more safe|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: playing four-suit transfers, you can have 1NT-2@C-2x-3@c/@D natural and forcing |pg||
nt|pelu: spec: can u help with the bidding?|pg||
nt|josj: nice question, Peter: help us with the explanation or help the players? |pg||
mb|5C|nt|nilsland:  man or mouse? Man - it seems|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder if north's 4@C control bid was forced or whether it implies slam interest (good trumps are a plus).|pg||
nt|josj: that's what I would think too...|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: both :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: club splinter cant cost|pg||
nt|josj: I see now :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 2@h = relay, 2@S = minors|pg||
nt|josj: ty Joel|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 3@D = good @D, 3@S = Q|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ah, science|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk2: The fact that the 9 is with AK makes the slam 5% better, from 90 to 95% (half of the 4-0 breaks)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 2@C was shape-asking|pg||
nt|pelu: so only the jump to 5@C was "wrong" - the slam need 3-2 in both minor, so 5@C is Ok|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: Let's see what Eklund does|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Barrling rather|pg||
nt|josj: if E can open his rubbish, the why doesn't W open his nice hand?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|h_karluk: sorry *lead - pls ignore trick word|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I prefer 2nt from W as a very strong invite  and E can jump to 4@c|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, they have missed a decent slam, but at least they have also missed 3NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: although slam is noting great|pg||
nt|mdgraham: *nothing|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|nt|lestergold: hear hear|pg||

nt|josj: a natural @S lead by S would have made life more difficult for declarer|pg||

mb|p|nt|davidstern: I wait till the end of the auction and simply agree with the opponents that there was a hesitation if they dont agree I then call the director|pg||

nt|davidstern: Simply calling for the director creates auto angst at the table which often is necessary|pg||

nt|davidstern: This auction is moving quickly.....hmmm.....|pg||
nt|dburn: Yes I would, if partner chose a heart from three low rather than a diamond from three low because I had not doubled 4@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzew: EW doesn't play Blackwood|pg||
nt|cuttysark: One thing you know - if partner is on lead and you do not double he will not lead a diamond....|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: absolutely david S|pg||
mb|5S|nt|davidstern: I would not imagine partner would lead a @H from xxx based on my not doubling diamonds|pg||
nt|davidstern: In my 40+years I have seen more bad results than good ones from doubles in this situation|pg||
nt|cuttysark: With the choice in his actual hand he would never lead a diamond - 'you did not double, partner'|pg||
nt|dburn: of course he would, if he also had nothing but xxx in diamonds|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjurn:  in my district final a couple of weeks ago I got to double both for a @D lead and later on double for no @D lead |pg||

mb|1N|nt|nilsland:  6 S down one was a flat board but HÃ¥kan StrÃ¤Ã¤f played the spade Queen in the first spade trick :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: Big Clubs going nowere|pg||
nt|josj: what's it called? quaternary?|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|othered1: 3@S asks for aces (old-fashioned ACOL and American Standard).  West denies then east cue-bids 4@C and west is obligated to show @H control and you're there.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I think that's the name for base 4|pg||
mb|3C|an|!C|nt|Walddk2: 6@S on 4 was flat, but it's worth noting that in the other room Strääf did cash @SQ first. He has seen it before|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: ok back to the slam-zone - 13 toptricks in 7NT|pg||
mb|3S|nt|josj: lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  Better to play 4 H from East here to avoid 3 diamond losers|pg||

nt|josj: exactly 13 top tricks|pg||

nt|peachy: I dont like 3C|pg||
nt|lestergold: exactly my point Raif|pg||
nt|peachy: fortunate club singleton AND diamond spots|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think a lot ofwork to do in 4@h|pg||
nt|josj: 1NT 18-20 I assume|pg||
mb|d|nt|nilsland:  nobody bids them ....|pg||
nt|lestergold: a trump lead would not be helpful to declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: and east has found it|pg||
nt|peachy: good lead|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: gutsy raise|pg||
nt|josj: to say the least - but nice intermediates|pg||
nt|haans: many play deal before if you have a singleton you lead it. otherwise you do not have singleton|pg||
nt|pelu: I 'hate' 1NT on a strong 5 card major|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|r|nt|peachy: I expect this goes down on trump lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: rather logical with that @c holding|pg||
nt|lestergold: with aced clubs badly placed and the trump attack, i think this is doomed|pg||
nt|josj: what with a void, Hans?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|frankaus: a strong @C plus relays would  identify the shape and controls and get NS to 7 @S easy on last|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|nt|nilsland:  Now Axelsson regrets bidding hearts first :)|pg||

mb|p|pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: Some specs may not be familiar with the term "phantom". It's a sacrifice bid against a contract which would have been defeated anyway (in this case 4@S)|pg||

mb|1H|nt|Walddk2: Must avoid 3NT here; 4@H has a chance|pg||

nt|josj: curious: how can N hold a @C void, an opening bid and no aces?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|othered1: This should keep them out of NT|pg||
nt|nilsland:  S has a problem, much extra values, maybe a double?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@D to play opposite spades and diamonds I assume|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: West must correct if he doesn't have diamonds as the other suit|pg||

mb|p|nt|chick: well, there is still hope they get to slam|pg||

pc|cT|pc|cQ|pc|c9|pg||

pc|sK|nt|haans: CORRECT?????????|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzpx: yes|pg||
pc|s3|nt|nilsland:  3 C was probably a normal raise. South did not whether W had diamonds or hearts really|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Frissan has lost all of the advantage, and plenty more :(|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the only way to lose 3 @h tricks by his own|pg||

pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: They have not recorded a single IMP so far|pg||
nt|othered1: NS should take a good look at their methods, since a common type of intervention gave them no chance to focus on what's important on this hand.|pg||
nt|nilsland:  If double was take out that would solved the problem, but this is a siatuation that surely was not discussed|pg||

nt|peachy: N bid again.... I am amazed, in 4-card major system|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: north has not got a vestige of a 3@h bid |pg||

nt|josj: might be difficult for W to lead a @D now|pg||
pc|h4|nt|othered1: Previous hand emphasizes the need to h ave "metaagreements" on handling 2-suited overcalls, so you  have some basis for action if one pops up against you.  A much better use of ...|pg||

pc|s5|nt|lestergold: well whether or not it was for the right reason he got the play right|pg||
nt|peachy: more hearts please|pg||

mb|2H!|nt|daman: why do you feel it is offshape?|pg||
nt|santyclz: S didn't his 4@c?  Mercy rule in effect?|pg||
nt|santyclz: (hit)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: I don´t think he expected a pass from his p|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: combined 28 count have to bid well to reach the grand|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|haans: i do not open it with 1@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it has been said that the fewer bids oyu take to get to your final contract, the better - but this swing is really a bit random|pg||
nt|mdgraham: assuming 3NT is the final contract, of course...  |pg||
nt|pelu: I remember a stury, where Riese was asked by to young players - how do u bid 3NT - we stopped in 4@C -1 - R: 1NT - 3NT!|pg||
mb|3D|nt|rodal f: Belive they don't. Might something for them to discuss|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: 3424|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|lestergold: perfecto no wasted hands fit like hand and glove|pg||
nt|josj: yes, this story often used to show the advantages of 12-14 NT :)|pg||
nt|pelu: tell your story - and dont tell opp|pg||
mb|5D|nt|vugraphzpx: South that is.. :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: After GF spade raise, S has all suits sontrolled first or second round. Even if N hadn't South still would|pg||
nt|lestergold: well another 13 imps into the bottomless pit|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but they still have tio be confident of 13 tricks controls are only part of the story|pg||
nt|josj: yep, let them sweat it out|pg||
nt|josj: NS seem to have reached the proper contract here, wd so far...|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: the first part, yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: first three bids same in open room then the auctions took different directions|pg||
nt|lestergold: and sadly  a differfent destination|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: wd by NS - after 5½ bidding-round|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|nt|othered1: OK, perhaps sub-optimal shape for a double|pg||
nt|daman: well   4414 would be ideal I suppose|pg||
pc|s5|nt|josj: entry position awkward now|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: thios is where you pray that west is the one to show out on the spades|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: We do not live in an ideal world. You've got to bid the cards you are dealt|pg||
nt|santyclz: Whoa, OS:se gained 10 imps while I was gone!  (OS:se supporters, I do take bribes...)|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|d2|nt|nilsland:  If you are waiting for an ideal hand you wil have to pass most of the time|pg||
nt|daman: exactly|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|lestergold: should be fined for slow claims|pg||
pc|dK|nt|chick: OS.se isn't doing well at all, but they are hanging in pretty well and trying, not going nuts with silly swing bids|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|pc|s3|pg||
nt|daman: I would have doubled 1@D with the North hand|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d8|pc|d9|nt|haans: endplay|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
mc|11|nt|Walddk2: Most of us would I think|pg||

nt|davidstern: E/W may try 3NT here|pg||
nt|bjurn:  me too|pg||
nt|davidstern: Which will make if a diamond is ducked and South having no entry|pg||
nt|davidstern: Yes fourth highest from longest and strongest if my aging brain recalls properly|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes 3nt looks normal|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Situation where ducking can do no harm and might just work|pg||
mb|1D!|an|4+ may hold longer !C|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|2C|an|*|mb|p|nt|davidstern: If ducked South may switch seeing no future in diamonds|pg||
nt|cuttysark: East hoping for a juicy penalty|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Strääf going for the kill by passing, but he did not get the chance|pg||
nt|roswolf: now 3nt is hard to resist|pg||
mb|2S|an|*|mb|p|nt|roswolf: ah science|pg||
nt|davidstern: Easy passage an no threatening lead|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|davidstern: I dont really blame West for bidding 2@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|davidstern: He doesn't really imagine getting rich from 1@HX|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It was moot after South bid 1@S|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Especially after South bid 1@S :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: no but trying for a plus score|pg||
pc|s4|nt|davidstern: Ah missed that - late Sunday evening and back to my aging brain|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c8|pg||
pc|s7|nt|davidstern: Do you regard West as a sub-minimum opening in today's world|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Fresh spring morning here - but brain in the same state|pg||
nt|bjurn:  my brain is not yet fresh ;)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think it's normal to open, but woud not fancy 1@D a lot|pg||
nt|davidstern: Bet my autumn evening is warmer than your spring morning|pg||
nt|roswolf: in todays world no but in yesterday's yes|pg||
nt|davidstern: I would be reluctant to open based on the quality of the suit I have to open |pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Still likely to reach game opposite partner's hand|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|d6|pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|bjurn:  in a natural system I'd prefer opening 1@C and responding 1@S|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s8|pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair point|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c9|nt|cuttysark: you enjoy the occasional 3-3 fit?|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s9|pg||
nt|bjurn:  yup!|pg||
pc|c6|nt|roswolf: yes saw one in this match earlier|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: You were not here earlier, Liz|pg||

pc|sK|pc|h7|pc|d4|pc|sT|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h9|pc|d2|pc|hJ|pg||

nt|peachy: sleep, it is only 1PM :)|pg||
nt|chick: This is the last board of this session, and I believe of today|pg||

mb|1D!|nt|Walddk2: 14-16 NT?|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: well coffe break hand now|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: Last board of the session now, OS.se needs some good coffee after this one :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|chick: Great job by Staffan Hed, our excellent vugraph operator!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this has been a very exciting set of boards|pg||
nt|josj: 137 imps in 23 (24) boards is good going but...|pg||
nt|josj: 21 only, so far|pg||
mb|3N|nt|haans: clubs = they do not bid 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: a long coffeebreak, last hand:)|pg||
nt|josj: in OR W opened 1NT with 3 unstopped suits...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: that kills thoughts of 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  East will probably raise with Kx in spades and nothing in hearts|pg||
nt|santyclz: Vg in your timezone: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php  Make it your home page!|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  EW also have to win by at least 17 imps :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: that is a very 'disciplioned' pass by east ok if ur p[artner will almost always protect|pg||
nt|lestergold: now east will come seriously alive|pg||
nt|pelu: same start, but after 4@C Souths asked with 4Nt - 3Aces and 7@S - he knoiw that his singleton @DA was 2-3 tricks|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk4: Thanks Staffan, Cornelia and Joe|pg||
nt|josj: yes, that's what S here should have done too|pg||
pc|d2|nt|othered1: Funny, both room began with board 11?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgefederation.se/filbyter_bridge/resultat/fc10/fc_main_en.htm  for the tournament website|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Walddk2: hmmm  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Staffan forgot to instruct them :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: in my university days boards with only a single figure swing rated as flat  |pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|haans: had been my choice|pg||
nt|josj: lol|pg||
nt|josj: sort of advanced goulash, Mike?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: wea re wiser now - and more than a bit older, too|pg||
nt|josj: the latter is definitely true :)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|mdgraham: I'm afraid Mr Dylan was wrong when he said that he was so much older then|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Walddk4: Second half after a short break|pg||
nt|josj: I think this needs a quick @H shift|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|peachy: I wonder if he was looking for slam?  Why else 2H first if he was going to 4 anyway|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|c8|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d6|nt|nilsland:  Now 3 spades seems high enough|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: game over|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk2: Eklund doing all he can to encourage a club switch|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|josj: yup|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 11 much needed imps|pg||
pc|h5|nt|zbig1959: K@C, and small @D shift? (deafeat it)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|daman: duh|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk2: First @H2, then the jack rather than the king, but partner refuses to ruff in :)|pg||

pc|s6|nt|santyclz: Yes, @d back does as well though that's tougher.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk4: Is there any chance that Staffan or Tommy might provide us with the halftimescore in the ohter match when second half starts, SanSac-Lirarna?  (I got from a spectator)|pg||
