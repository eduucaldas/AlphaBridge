mb|p|mb|1S!|nt|sharkey: yes - not sure they'll get there|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: trump pips make seven a very good proposition|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however EW next door do not seem to have got to grips with it|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|sharkey: This hand shows the power of the Aces|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: and a ten-card fit :)|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|sharkey: Erik will tell us what 3@H means|pg||
nt|dburn: if West can show short hearts, East may aim very high indeed|pg||
nt|dburn: but the auction may not be developing along those lines|pg||
nt|vugraphzew: 3@H was expalined by Thomasson as "natural, some extras"|pg||
nt|sharkey: ty |pg||
nt|sharkey: West must go past game now |pg||
nt|vugraphzew: EW doesn't play RKCB, if it might look strange later on|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|dburn: so that if West bids hearts now, it will not be clear to East that this is a singleton and not the king|pg||
mb|4N|an|3 keys of 5|mb|p|nt|sharkey: no|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so much easier if East has some sort or relay over 2NT to find out what sort of hand it was based on |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@C, for example|pg||
nt|dburn: and West, who does not know of East's sixth spade, may not be able to bid seven himself|pg||
nt|dburn: still, reaching "only" six will collect a lot of IMPs anyway|pg||
nt|mdgraham: for example, 1@s-2N-3@c (relay)-4@H (splinter)|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c5|nt|mdgraham: still, 13 imps anyway|pg||

mb|1S|nt|peachy: hi Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: another close gam,e off on a badly placed ace over a king a lot of them today like this|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone @H@H|pg||
nt|chick: S is already thinking slam here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's a handicap event, so the underdogs, the OS.se team, has a 20 IMP advantage in the first set|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Hi Gary, Haans welcome|pg||
nt|sybarra: daylight time in effect here, so short 1 hour of sleep|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|josj: gm all|pg||
nt|haans: looks like an easy 4@H|pg||
nt|josj: and gm Hans, Gary and Rashed :)|pg||
nt|josj: maybe good afternoon to Rashed :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: A little bidding test here.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lestergold: so cautious bidders lucky day|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont know their methods but 3@h should be a weak bid in most modern styles|pg||
nt|peachy: I think S will pass, no shape|pg||
nt|lestergold: as 2@s avaialble to shopw a good raise which of course north has|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 9pm here :)|pg||
nt|josj: gm all again|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good morning all.|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: I would tend to agree, in competition weak|pg||
nt|josj: sorry Gary :)|pg||
nt|haans: Multi has been around for many years but ...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Good Morning Jos, net speed is slightly slow today:)|pg||
mb|4C|nt|lestergold: south should pass whatever the 3@h bid means|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 01.00 PM at my end|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: The underdogs won't lose on this board|pg||
nt|lestergold: and has but we must remember that in general not bidding 50 ish percedntage vul games is not a winning strategy|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello again!|pg||
nt|peachy: it happens to be makeable|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello Ralf|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes of course diamodntakes care of a  spade|pg||
nt|peachy: I meant, game happens to make|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello Raija|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgefederation.se/filbyter_bridge/resultat/fc10/fc_main_en.htm  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|daman: normal contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 2@S say pass with spades  but i have hearts|pg||
nt|josj: yes that's what it should say|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Usually game interest the way we play it in NZ|pg||
nt|josj: and it did...for W at least, that is|pg||
nt|sybarra: even I would find the 2 @H bi,  nothing else to bid with S |pg||
mb|4S|nt|lestergold: well it wont surprise me if game is bid in the open|pg||
nt|santyclz: 6@h doesn't have any pitfalls, 6@ss is in danger if the defense starts with 2 rounds of @cs.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: Welcome back to the 2nd session of 4 from this semifinal. In the other semifinal, the favourite team San Sac made a impressive 56-7 against Lirarna. Lirarna had 14IMP as a ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: handicap, but that´s gone already|pg||
nt|chick: hello Everyone :)|pg||
nt|josj: hi Mike|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@S likely transfer to clubs, 2NT accepting with good clubs |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hi Jos|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 2@S = clubs, 2NT = accepting|pg||
nt|josj: yep|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: all up to East here|pg||
nt|chick: EW getting too brave, maybe no respect for weak NTs :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpx: EW confused about their bidding|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: 12 was flat. 4@S -1½ in the other room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: minus 1|pg||
nt|lestergold: soemtimes game declared by north beaten out of hand on spade lead then|pg||
nt|jcwla: Not the way to make up 27 IMPs.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|peachy: This event has teams handicapped as I understand|pg||
pc|d4|nt|chick: theoretical danger, but not as the cards lie, I think|pg||
nt|santyclz: Right.|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: ?|pg||
nt|haans: counted right|pg||
pc|h9|nt|lestergold: not everyone plays 4 card majors|pg||
nt|peachy: NS here are the underdogs|pg||
pc|h2|nt|josj: once W failed...|pg||
pc|hA|nt|santyclz: 3/3 @ds solve any potential problms.|pg||
nt|chick: 3-2 hearts :)|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|santyclz: That too.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|josj: declarer can make it now but he does not know|pg||
pc|s2|nt|chick: if E could both make dummy ruff AND lead a heart to knock out entry, then it might be tougher, but he can do only one of those|pg||
nt|haans: right|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|santyclz: Defense would be so much easier if they would let us lead 2 suits at the same time.  Maybe we should write a letter.|pg||
nt|chick: nah, if it were changed, then someone would want 3|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: it would be easier to be declarer if you could play two suits at the same time too.. I always seem to run out of entries for my finesses.. :)|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dT|pc|s3|nt|vugraphzpx: quick starting board, trying to keep themselves ahead of the other table :)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||

nt|ralfwil: but after @hQ it was too late|pg||
nt|peachy: right|pg||
nt|chick: my guess is that Bd1 will be flat|pg||
nt|chick: missing a game is not a great start|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: In  this semifinal, OS.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: .se had 20IMP in handicap at the start, but after a tough session Team Zang is now in the lead |pg||
nt|josj: and keeping us busy|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 6red suit here can they find that|pg||
nt|josj: so Zang likely to further increase their lead|pg||
nt|daman: tah dah|pg||
nt|lml: good morning|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: NS play 2-way PASS (0-7 or 17+) so be ready for some weird-looking bids|pg||
nt|chick: so which of them needed to initiate the slam try?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: W didnt knwo that 3@S meant @D-single|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: E thought he already had shown his @D- Q, hence no 4@D-bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: EW headed for 3NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w have a chance in 3N on a non diamond lead|pg||
nt|josj: what's wrong with a grand?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: slam time and grand |pg||
nt|mdgraham: leading partner's suit is easy. West might very well have led a spade, holding a singleton heart, but when you do not lead partner's suit you have to be right |pg||
nt|chick: Hi Linda|pg||
mb|1D!|an|0+ !D, 11-16|nt|peachy: which might make from W|pg||
nt|chick: this one, on the other hand .... :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Happy International Womens Day, Cornelia, specs of the female persuation and all the ships at sea.|pg||
nt|daman: looks like 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: not a lot :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|chick: Thank you, Joe :)|pg||
nt|haans: may be to hard to find this slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|peachy: unless diamonds shown somehow by S|pg||
nt|josj: also very true...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: NS play 1@C 17+|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it could be said that there is a good case for a spade lead, as hearts are unlikely to run, but again, not particularly easy at the table  |pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|chick: thanks Joel, too bad for them |pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: not sure what 2N asked, but they found their way to a makeable contract|pg||
nt|haans: all cards working|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Linköping is the main city in the county of Östergötland in southern Sweden with around 100,000 inhabitants|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 2NT was most likely forcing with support|pg||
nt|jcwla: Maybe next time...|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: probably will make @d lead un,likely natural to play club finesse for J thru north etc|pg||
nt|pelu: 23-level looks like max - so fight on 3-level :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 1@D 0+, 1@H/@S 5+|pg||
nt|josj: too high for either side, the 3-level here|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: Staffan, how do they figure out how many IMPs the weaker team gets in advance?|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade most likely|pg||
nt|lml: hearts is actually the best spot if you can find it|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: NS in a elay sequence|pg||
nt|lml: 7@H is pretty darn good|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello Hans and Marshall|pg||
pc|c3|nt|santyclz: @h10?|pg||
nt|chick: nice lead, but not obvious to S I suspect|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hey y'all, gl everybody|pg||
nt|chick: 2@H was showing 2 suits?|pg||
nt|sybarra: 9 off the top here |pg||
nt|sybarra: and probably one more in the slush |pg||
nt|daman: yep toppers     but 4@H looks better|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: Think so, 5-4 at least and a decent opening hand for a 11-16|pg||
nt|chick: Merhaba Hamdi :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: *relay|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Walddk2: There is probably a formula|pg||
nt|peachy: high from dummy and start clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi Roland & Hans:)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|rnmalik: 7@D better contract|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure its as easy to get there |pg||
nt|Walddk4: We also have Tobias Bende with us. He is an expert on the N-S methods, pass = 0-7 or any 17+. But he he will explain I am sure|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome Tobia|pg||
nt|Walddk4: s|pg||
nt|lml: 2@S shows 5+@s and 4@H|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Tobias, thanks for helping out :)|pg||
nt|lml: welcome Tobias and thanks for the information about the auction|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Always nice to start with a grand|pg||
nt|lml: this may be the best type of system to find it|pg||
nt|lml: in a lot of systems once you find the spade fit its hard to go back|pg||
nt|lml: a more standard auction might start 1@C-1@S|pg||
nt|bende:  3@d = 5422 (or 7411)|pg||
nt|lml: now if South jump shift into hearts that might get there|pg||
nt|bende:  3@s must have been a weak relay. 1@s showed 8-16.|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s5|nt|peachy: well, I would have:)|pg||
nt|pelu: some would open 1NT in S - and then 2@S from East - passed out|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lestergold: well hes going to make it whether or not that was the best start|pg||
nt|santyclz: Suggested (to me) by the 97x in dummy.|pg||
nt|lml: all this technology to miss the grand|pg||
nt|lml: one thinks there must have been some bid between 4@H and 6@H|pg||
nt|bende:  Hmm.. I don't know what went wrong. They should be able to find this.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|h_karluk: i am not a system maker, however at first glance seemed a bit wide HCP range|pg||
nt|chick: they are playing a precision-like strong 1@C 17+|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|s3|nt|marlowepi: it looks as though W will have an end position for the overtrick|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lestergold: clear cut overtake of diamond not that it makes any odds now|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|h_karluk: very good|pg||
nt|sybarra: we may be in a cashing mode |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|haans: well done i say|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: as often 7 becomes too hard to reach|pg||
nt|josj: it looks as if S might have bid 5@D rather than 5@H|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kiwibridge: 5@D instead of 4@H may have helped|pg||
pc|c6|nt|nilsland:  There has been a qualification, maybe that has decided the handicap|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it is always odd, on hands like this, that players are so, so reluctant to defend  |pg||
nt|chick: there's a big tradeoff between having a complex system that conveys a lot of information, vs the problems of remembering all of it :)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugraphzpx: E-W is playing 2-way club, either 11-13BAL or 17+|pg||
nt|chick: now 2 spades and a high crossruff|pg||
nt|haans: yeah but 4@H = nothing extra|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|josj: in that case, 5@D stands out once N goes on|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: KQ@D looks a bit extra after slam try by pard|pg||
nt|josj: over 4@H|pg||

nt|chick: and what is the "Danny Kleinman berry count"?  :)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Walddk2: and Mats Nilsland will be playing for Sweden seniors at the European Teams Championships this summer. Good luck to him!|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: but 1@C was alerted |pg||
nt|josj: usually, 1@D neg. shows 0-7, I assume|pg||
nt|haans: many have jumpt to 3nt missing slam|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@S lead-directing|pg||
nt|pelu: would u open 2@S in N? - not me|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: yes, Roland, easy to set up clubs for a heart pitch|pg||
nt|sybarra: can actually make 3 nt  |pg||
nt|jcwla: To bid here, Danny would want 18 "berries" in the top four cards.  A = 10; K = 9; Q = 6; J = 5; T = 4; 9 = 2; 8 = 1.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|josj: no except if playing 2-suiters|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not with six to the nine|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  thx |pg||
nt|ralfwil: On a @s lead to @sJ S should play @sA, not the @sQ|pg||
nt|bucheister: Would be a great time to win the J with the A|pg||
nt|peachy: maybe this would be time to win the spade with ace.... since diamond finesse needed into W|pg||
nt|lestergold: we can predict play win cash top dim enter dummy with club take @d fionesse and then west has no chopice but to switch to a heart|pg||
nt|peachy: heh, you gues are faster typists|pg||
nt|santyclz: My kind of grand.  No finesses, only 1 line and it works.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: That hand with both majors is special|pg||
nt|chick: I'm curious, Tobias, if they pass with 17+ and need 8+ to open, how do they handle hands like 24+?   Pass and hope pard has 8?|pg||
nt|bende:  1@d=8-16 nebulous|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  More exciting if East had ventured 3 NT|pg||
nt|nilsland:  would south find the diamond lead|pg||
nt|chick: but such a perfect fit is not always easy to uncover|pg||
nt|sybarra: close eyes and hold breath......after @H's cashed |pg||
pc|h5|nt|h_karluk: Staffan, east relative of Johan, any idea ? |pg||
nt|sybarra: just ask is k of spades on side,  and next |pg||
nt|bende:  After pass they play 1@c=0-7/17+ and other bids 8-16.|pg||
nt|chick: thanks :)|pg||
nt|bende:  pass-1@c; 1@d=0-7 and others show 17+|pg||
pc|h8|nt|lml: I wonder what East-west are playing over that.  I might have bid if I were East|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|chick: now makes perfect sense, simple Jacoby/Stenberg 2N|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: hmm have no idea actually :)|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|daman: maybe after laying down the @H Ace|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Very strong team. Morath-Flodqvist (Tjolpe), Nilsland-Dahlberg and Bjerregaard-Gullberg. They would have done very well in the Open event I am sure|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Now heart ace is not so good|pg||
nt|daman: nope|pg||
nt|josj: lucky layout for EW in @S amply compensated by bad @C break|pg||
pc|cT|nt|daman: anything but a @H|pg||
nt|daman: clearly 3@S was not forcing|pg||
nt|nilsland:  This will be a good board for the underdogs|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Hi  and hello|pg||
pc|cK|nt|josj: wd by N|pg||
nt|pelu: what did they have for breakfast? :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|h_karluk: i wonder on the way grand or just slam|pg||
nt|josj: this normal enough contract should go down, this time|pg||
nt|mdgraham: raw meat|pg||
nt|josj: akvavit, Peter?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi all.|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|lml: perhaps double should just show the values for a takeout double|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jcwla: Hi Hans and Marshall.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|nt|chick: think they can find the grand, hamdi?|pg||
nt|chick: NS has been very solid so far today|pg||
nt|chick: if 3@H showed shortness (specifically), then should bid them again to show void|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bucheister: Catholic grade school with nuns|pg||
nt|peachy: aah, they made you learn it|pg||
nt|ralfwil: bad presence at table again!|pg||
nt|lestergold: curwest  an see he has to get busy and hope for the hearts|pg||
nt|ralfwil: as @sJ denies @s10.....|pg||
nt|lestergold: but his pard's blood pressure rising as tank goes on|pg||
nt|lestergold: he can see that if he doesnt find some fast tricks then declarer is likely home|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
nt|chick: a grand has to be in @Ds, not enough tricks in NT|pg||
nt|chick: (not to mention no heart stopper) :)|pg||
nt|daman: sigh of relief|pg||
pc|c6|nt|santyclz: Did e ever get to show a long solid suit?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: he showed 6+ @S|pg||
nt|santyclz: When designing a system you should give thought to "out of the box" bids that show specific holding types.|pg||
nt|bende:  I am getting expert help on the system and probably South couldn't find @hQ low enough to find the grand on the last board.|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c8|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lestergold: curtains well defended|pg||
nt|peachy: wd|pg||
nt|chick: well done NS!|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Houston, eagle landed|pg||
nt|chick: claim at trick 1 :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 3@H showed short @h, 3@S, 4@C, 4@S showing cue, 5@C denied 3 aces of 5, 5@H showed void @H|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h2|nt|sybarra: claim:)|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ralfwil: another nice play is that after @sQ play a small towards dummy|pg||
nt|chick: I blame W for not finding 7, she can see everything she needs to count to 13 tricks ... only danger I can see is 3 small clubs with partner and no 2-2 split|pg||
nt|chick: ruff 2 spades (all trumps are high), draw trump, and pitch last spade on club ... time to claim|pg||
pc|d8|nt|h_karluk: no overruff fear there - 432 outside spots|pg||
nt|haans: most swedes play low positive|pg||
nt|josj: @H now is OK|pg||
pc|dA|nt|josj: nice defence|pg||
nt|haans: still going down|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|josj: declarer has to go all out now and will end up down a lot|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mdgraham: on the EW cards 5@C is quite playable - West will be delighted to have stopped short|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|chick: wonder what the odds of that are|pg||
nt|lml: they need to rethink that... there should always be a handy way to find the trump queen below a grand|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sybarra: sorry we have to check if @D's break |pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|s7|nt|chick: is that in-suit, or anywhere in the hand?|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s2|nt|peachy: best still was the SA|pg||
nt|josj: playing @D10 was costly here|pg||
pc|h3|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s3|nt|josj: restricting the loss|pg||
pc|h4|nt|santyclz: 0% if you don't bid the grand.  Much higher if you do.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Or at least that's how it seems to work for me.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: will make his hand master|pg||

nt|vugraphzew: Not so sure|pg||
nt|mdgraham: (presumably)|pg||
mb|4N|an|2 aces of 4|nt|mdgraham: definitely not natural |pg||

nt|sharkey: cud it be anything else?|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|an|cue|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|sharkey: 4 NT = cop out?|pg||
nt|dburn: who has shown one key card when he has two, and denied the queen of trumps when he has it|pg||
mb|5N|an|2 other aces|mb|p|nt|dburn: of course, what is really happening is that both players are using Blackwood at the same time|pg||
nt|vugraphzew: Once again, they doesn't play RKCB|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe 4@S=exclusion blackwood, 4N=no, I want to use blackwood|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They do NOT use RKCB|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 7@h when @h are 2-2|pg||
nt|dburn: OK - sorry. Then what do they use?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I never mentioned Roman|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Culbertson's 4NT-5NT if I'm not mistaken|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I have seen this pair on vugraph before|pg||
nt|vugraphzew: That's what they use to say :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzew: I have no clue what's going on|pg||
nt|dburn: well, West may be as confused as we are|pg||
nt|sharkey: Not sure EW know for sure either....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: neither have we, by the look of things |pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: but 7@h by East is far from terrible as a contract - hearts 2-2 or the club finesse|pg||
nt|Walddk2: My guess is that 4NT confirms 2 keycards outside spades and that 5NT shows the other 2|pg||
nt|ralfwil: why not 13 tricks in CR?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Got a club lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now has to guess if @CK is onside or hearts 2-2|pg||

nt|sybarra: just to confuse us|pg||

nt|jcwla: top 4 cards in the preempt suit|pg||
nt|chick: found this:  http://dannykleinman.com/Documents/BRIDGE%2037%20POINTS.pdf|pg||
mb|1N|nt|peachy: nice fitting hands EW here|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a perfecto slam avaialbkle for e/w if their bidding is up to it|pg||
nt|haans: easy to go to high here|pg||
nt|haans: good pass|pg||
nt|pelu: NS: 6@d/1C|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge:  2 was a longer auction but still faded out at 6@H|pg||
nt|pelu: @c|pg||
nt|daman: another 3NT|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|Walddk2: 18 opposite 13 and a 5-4 fit, I think they will|pg||
nt|josj: minor suit slams are always difficult to reach and this should be another example|pg||
nt|mdgraham: assuming North has six spades, he is known to have 10 black cards and two hearts|pg||
nt|pelu: spec after 1NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: am I right that N is the younger ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: no, W is|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: a nice @s slam!|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ah, not a married couple...|pg||
nt|lml: they know the shape and the controls by 4@H... the trump queen should be high on the list by then|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|lestergold: will desrve some praise if they get there|pg||
nt|peachy: indeed|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2@h meaning?|pg||
nt|bende:  Hmm... 4NT should be asking for queens in this sequence.|pg||
mb|4D|nt|nilsland:  Pity it will not make due to the spade lay|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unfortunately the 4-0 trump break dooms it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Very unlucky, it's a 95% slam, roughly|pg||
nt|othered1: aThe stiff @D devalues south's hand slightly, but it still has enough extras to push on.|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh sorry I may have them confuse then  |pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: I guess, dont dare ask about their age :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: maybe they will avoid the trap by peeking :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: as you can cope with all 4 with West|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The correct play in spades is the queen first|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Many get that wrong and they never notice|pg||
nt|Walddk2: because it usually does not matter|pg||
nt|josj: of course, but even if N does not hold a sing. @D the 10 is "unnecessary"|pg||
nt|sybarra: like S,  I agree with not using stayman with a 4333 hand |pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|lestergold: ah too quick with his enormolus hand |pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: spade  support, better than 2sp|pg||
nt|h_karluk: nowadays 20-20 layouts rare, we may see an elegant solution|pg||
nt|josj: did W have 2@H available here as an opening bid?|pg||
nt|josj: now the @H are lost|pg||
nt|jcwla: Wow, there you go.|pg||
mb|4N|nt|nilsland:  You have to learn it "the hard way"|pg||
nt|lestergold: if west has shown a good raise in spades then east should beexploring because his hand becomes enormous|pg||
nt|peachy: if he went to game, might as well have splintered or done something|pg||
nt|pelu: with 5-2-2-4 stille a small @D |pg||
nt|lml: I actually play exactly that if I have a control asking sequence earlier|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|nt|h_karluk: interesting lead from KJx tenace|pg||
nt|haans: i think 2@H/2@S both roman|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: south will have to push this the rest of the way|pg||
nt|lestergold: lazy sign off basically|pg||
mb|6H|nt|nilsland:  Now  south know the heart ace is missing|pg||
nt|nilsland:  since N didnt cuebid 4 H|pg||
nt|nilsland:  And East will surely lead hearts...|pg||
nt|haans: old carrot style|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Even I would be able to win thius 3 NT - on a good day|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: this could even make an overtrick, because diamonds can be set up pretty easily|pg||
nt|h_karluk: perhaps a passive trump trick would more safe|pg||
nt|jcwla: Friendly layout.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4H makes also|pg||
nt|marlowepi: fortunately for declarer the entry situation makes it awkward to hook W for the heart queen|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: playing four-suit transfers, you can have 1NT-2@C-2x-3@c/@D natural and forcing |pg||
nt|pelu: spec: can u help with the bidding?|pg||
nt|josj: nice question, Peter: help us with the explanation or help the players? |pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  man or mouse? Man - it seems|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder if north's 4@C control bid was forced or whether it implies slam interest (good trumps are a plus).|pg||
nt|josj: that's what I would think too...|pg||
pc|c6|nt|pelu: both :)|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|lestergold: club splinter cant cost|pg||
nt|josj: I see now :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 2@h = relay, 2@S = minors|pg||
nt|josj: ty Joel|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 3@D = good @D, 3@S = Q|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ah, science|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The fact that the 9 is with AK makes the slam 5% better, from 90 to 95% (half of the 4-0 breaks)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 2@C was shape-asking|pg||
nt|pelu: so only the jump to 5@C was "wrong" - the slam need 3-2 in both minor, so 5@C is Ok|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk2: Let's see what Eklund does|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Barrling rather|pg||
nt|josj: if E can open his rubbish, the why doesn't W open his nice hand?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|h_karluk: sorry *lead - pls ignore trick word|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ralfwil: I prefer 2nt from W as a very strong invite  and E can jump to 4@c|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, they have missed a decent slam, but at least they have also missed 3NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: although slam is noting great|pg||
nt|mdgraham: *nothing|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: hear hear|pg||

pc|h6|nt|chick: we knew what you meant :)|pg||

nt|marlowepi: S would like to double competitively here but the doubleton heart is a big worry|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: sure but still -1|pg||
nt|mdgraham: is it?|pg||
nt|sybarra: makes is easier for director etc |pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: For those who have come in later, 20 of OS.se's IMPs were their original handicap, so the earned score (last session and so far this one) is 61-20|pg||
nt|h_karluk: another grand or just slam - we ' ll see|pg||
nt|josj: definitely|pg||
mb|d!|mb|p|nt|nilsland:  We will have a ong bidding to 6 spades...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: oh yes :(|pg||
mb|2S|nt|nilsland:  long|pg||
mb|3C|nt|santyclz: Very unusual to play 3nt on balanced hands after the opps open a strong nt.|pg||
nt|chick: another 'should make' hand, but a lot of work for declarer to do getting there|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 1NT showed 13-17NT, if 13-14 then there´s no 4card major|pg||
nt|h_karluk: trumps 2-2, @d suit break friendly 3-2|pg||
nt|josj: too many opposing singletons around for 4@S|pg||
mb|3D|nt|bucheister: what about the "world class"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D is negative and 1@H is any 20+, that's all I know|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3@s lucky make due to very favouravle heart position|pg||
nt|chick: at least she knows where the honors are :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 3@HX was set to be interesting|pg||
nt|rnmalik: because of the net not being of any assistance but watching alright:)|pg||
nt|josj: :(|pg||
nt|daman: what is this auction?    forcing stayman I suppose|pg||
nt|lml: either way I dont think this is going to be a good hand for "the system"|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  1 S is negative, 2 C gameforcing as a normal 2 C opening|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: GF with 5+ spades from east|pg||
nt|peachy: if not cashing, could slip in overtrick|pg||
nt|sybarra: about to say same |pg||
nt|chick: S would have been in for a major shock, opps making 4S with his holding|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 3+1 = 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 8 times @d and 9 times @s|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Hey, good to see you Frank, welcome aboard|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Frank :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: came at a good time  - this is an interesting collection how high will nS get??|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes that's the question|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just check  15 on movie please, i think brave bidders there - earned their applause with 17 IMPs swing|pg||
nt|frankaus: now has the @D a cue will bid the slam  IMO|pg||
nt|jcwla: No double no trouble.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|marlowepi: S made a crafty call here|pg||
pc|c8|nt|nilsland:  the king of hearts is the key card - lets see if they can find that out|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|pg||
nt|frankaus: the grand may be too much to expect|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Frank, also new at the town, I am informed by Cornelia "they are playing a precision-like strong 1@C 17+"|pg||
nt|chick: actually, that was EW, and they play a 2-way club |pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 3@S asked for shortness and South denied any shortness by 3NT. |pg||
nt|frankaus: this wil make 13 with a beer card at end if declarer is into that  ;)|pg||
nt|daman: 6@C is cool|pg||
pc|sT|nt|vugraphzpx: both pairs play a 2-way 1@c opening|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|josj: :)|pg||
nt|lml: Now West has to overtake I think|pg||
pc|s3|nt|nilsland:  now it comes|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nyström-Bertheau and Tundal-Grøtheim would for sure with all their relays. I expect this pair to do it too|pg||
nt|h_karluk: open room may have a situation on their hands|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: as long as South chooses to upgrade his hand to a positive answer on a 1@C strong opening, they shouldn´t have any problem|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: in the open room that is :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: allright. ty so much :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: N hand is huge once S bids 1@S|pg||
nt|frankaus: gets even bigger if S can cue the @DA|pg||
nt|rodal f: How would u bid at N after 1@S Frank and Hamdi?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi all. Roland told me to help|pg||
nt|h_karluk: such positions are kind of tornado alert in my book, anytime one may caught without enough preparations|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think this is better slam,  is it George?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 2NT = short @H, 9 cards in minors|pg||
nt|sybarra: what was 4 @C?|pg||
nt|daman: I am a big fan of playing in 4-4 fits|pg||
nt|sybarra: gerber? |pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 4@c = accept of @C|pg||
nt|daman: and pitching on the long suit|pg||
pc|d4|nt|santyclz: Now the @c10 and she's home.|pg||
nt|frankaus: 2NT F eliciting the @D cue the check for @S Q (RKCB)|pg||
nt|lml: I suppose its hard to figure out the best defense|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: voila|pg||
nt|chick: nice play|pg||
nt|pelu: nice calculation , Mike :)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|chick: needs that 2nd entry, that was only way to get it|pg||
nt|chick: diamond best now, but won't be enough|pg||
nt|santyclz: The trick on the c!10 is to duck if n plays the j.|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok here we go,  play will not take long |pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|peachy: Open Room, in the 3NT, declarer did take trick 1 with Ace, well deserved make there|pg||
nt|daman: no brainer|pg||
pc|s8|nt|nilsland:  4 H was enough for east|pg||
nt|othered1: well don|pg||
nt|nilsland:  This was not a relay bidding, it was natural after 2 S|pg||
nt|rodal f: Well. Seems as 2NT didn't work for them. Should do. An other one is 4@C as (renons) splinter|pg||
nt|lml: but there is only one left|pg||
nt|marlowepi: knowing his partner almost surely had a stiff spade|pg||
pc|s9|nt|othered1: Standard methods will get you here, too.  Perhaps beginning 2@C-2@D-3@S.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|santyclz: S could have caused a problem by ducking the @c, but is would be worth an award to do so.|pg||
nt|santyclz: (it would)|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|frankaus: then depending on how frisky i felt  &@S|pg||
nt|frankaus: 7@S|pg||
nt|rodal f: A 3rd is 5@C exlution b. w. but to hard.|pg||
nt|daman: 2 rounds of trumps and claim|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mdgraham: well, I always was ok at arithmetic|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lml: if North has it then you can give partner a ruff and if North doesnt your side has no more outside tricks|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s4|pg||
nt|lestergold: claim??|pg||
nt|frankaus: some say all grands need to be 105%|pg||

nt|mdgraham: quite so|pg||
nt|daman: more good stuff for NS|pg||
nt|lml: I think so|pg||
nt|chick: pretty subtle, but at world class levels, yes|pg||
nt|lml: its a matter of counting one suit|pg||
nt|chick: its also a matter of realizing you need to count that suit and work out something|pg||
mb|1S|nt|nilsland:  6 S down one was a flat board but HÃ¥kan StrÃ¤Ã¤f played the spade Queen in the first spade trick :)|pg||
nt|chick: making 9 tricks is what mattered, and the endplay was 100% :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bende:  1@d=8-11, a) balanced, b) 4M-5+m, c) (4441) or d) 55 minors|pg||
mb|2H|nt|bucheister: they should get  a bonus|pg||
nt|sybarra: and vulernability is not set rigtht for the "save" |pg||
nt|daman: must play for the pointed Kings properly|pg||
nt|chick: vulnerability won't let EW try any sacrifices either|pg||
nt|sybarra: gm Cornelia,  welcome |pg||
nt|daman: Hey C|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Big Clubs going nowere|pg||
nt|josj: what's it called? quaternary?|pg||
nt|chick: hello everyone :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: A @D lead might be just enough here...|pg||
mb|2N|nt|bende:  1@h=natural or strong relay|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: 3@S asks for aces (old-fashioned ACOL and American Standard).  West denies then east cue-bids 4@C and west is obligated to show @H control and you're there.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I think that's the name for base 4|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Walddk2: 6@S on 4 was flat, but it's worth noting that in the other room Strääf did cash @SQ first. He has seen it before|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: ok back to the slam-zone - 13 toptricks in 7NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: lol|pg||
nt|lml: yes, East could have switched to a heart (or led a heart) but West just had to get out his abacus|pg||
nt|bende:  1@s=4@s, 2@c=relay|pg||
nt|jcwla: I didn't mean in 1. :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  Better to play 4 H from East here to avoid 3 diamond losers|pg||
nt|mdgraham: meanwhile, can EW get to 7@C or 7@S or 7NT|pg||
nt|josj: exactly 13 top tricks|pg||
nt|chick: don't like 3@S if they are playing 4 card majors|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sybarra: some one has to hit this and they did |pg||
nt|bende:  2@h=5+@c|pg||
nt|chick: rebid hearts better imo|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|nt|lestergold: well i dont know their methods but why 3 level only 16 points|pg||
nt|lestergold: and spade response doesnt improve that 16 points|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Do you all agree with 3@c on N? only 2@c for me. Specially with a stiff @s|pg||
nt|peachy: I dont like 3C|pg||
nt|lestergold: exactly my point Raif|pg||
nt|peachy: fortunate club singleton AND diamond spots|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think a lot ofwork to do in 4@h|pg||
nt|josj: 1NT 18-20 I assume|pg||
nt|lml: a grand is pretty good here so lets see if they can find it this time|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|nilsland:  nobody bids them ....|pg||
nt|lestergold: a trump lead would not be helpful to declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: and east has found it|pg||
nt|peachy: good lead|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: gutsy raise|pg||
nt|josj: to say the least - but nice intermediates|pg||
nt|haans: many play deal before if you have a singleton you lead it. otherwise you do not have singleton|pg||
nt|pelu: I 'hate' 1NT on a strong 5 card major|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bende:  2NT=short hearts|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|peachy: I expect this goes down on trump lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: rather logical with that @c holding|pg||
nt|lestergold: with aced clubs badly placed and the trump attack, i think this is doomed|pg||
nt|josj: what with a void, Hans?|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|dA|nt|frankaus: a strong @C plus relays would  identify the shape and controls and get NS to 7 @S easy on last|pg||
nt|lml: North is surely thinking oh me what a fit!|pg||
pc|d6|pc|c6|nt|nilsland:  Now Axelsson regrets bidding hearts first :)|pg||
nt|haans: you never lead a void :)|pg||
nt|josj: OK, I agree|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|daman: yes mats       what a coup if they could have played it from the east side|pg||
nt|josj: 5NT now and then 7@C|pg||
nt|jcwla: well said|pg||
pc|s3|pc|d9|pg||
nt|daman: 5@H was miscalculated     you force your opps to double by default|pg||
pc|c8|nt|lml: well done|pg||
nt|bende:  Very good.|pg||
nt|lml: this time he wasnt as worried about the trump queen :)|pg||
nt|lml: well lets see can this be bid in a different system?|pg||
nt|lml: most would open 1@C or maybe some 2NT|pg||
nt|chick: would take some imagination and a good system to find 7@C with standard bidding|pg||
pc|cK|nt|pelu: wd|pg||
nt|josj: no overtricks for the @H ruffs |pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: best duck this dim|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|c9|pc|c7|pg||
nt|lestergold: lost a tempo by not ducking dim now had to kill 4th dim rather than play trump|pg||
nt|chick: I would open 1@C with S's hand playing simple 2/1|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|nt|nilsland:  On Easts hand one diamond losers goes on then spades|pg||
nt|lml: right sorry looking at north|pg||
pc|s4|nt|santyclz: In the open room e got in a 1@s bid, so we'll have to count this as a triumph for weak nts.|pg||

mb|p|nt|josj: the message lost on E apparently|pg||

nt|chick: if 2@D shows 13-15, he's even a little short for it|pg||

nt|chick: yes, that's why a jump to 4@H is too unilateral|pg||

pc|cA|pg||
nt|chick: with N showing a minimum 17+, and holding small xx in both partner's suits, I think S got too brave with the 4@S bid|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sybarra: oh well always like to give pard a challenge,  playing one level higher |pg||
nt|lml: not to say he will make 4!|pg||
pc|d8|nt|pelu: 9+14 and 2 ballanced hand - normal to go down|pg||
nt|haans: no but bthey may make 4@S|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d4|pg||
nt|josj: W can overruff with his natural trump tricks, if he wants|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|josj: but 7 tricks are easy enough now|pg||
nt|chick: I think they had to make a slam check with all those HCP|pg||
nt|chick: good job staying out of it|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s6|nt|othered1: still time for a trump, I think|pg||
nt|nilsland:  the defence is perhaps allergic to trump leads|pg||
nt|lestergold: well its off i would think now|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|chick: although it will work out well for them :-\|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|santyclz: If the 3@s bid showed a minimum...|pg||

nt|lestergold: slam on dim finesse|pg||
nt|josj: just unlucky that both N and S hold @Cxxx|pg||
nt|pelu: Nt = 14-16 -so N sh not foce to game|pg||
nt|sybarra: should probably keep the N/S cards for a money bridge game later |pg||
nt|lml: interesting hand all round|pg||
nt|jcwla: Meanwhile the 6@C and 3NT on 3 and 4 have put Team Zang up big at this point.|pg||
mb|1C|nt|lestergold: dont see it being bid tho|pg||
nt|daman: if North opens 1NT   South might take a shot|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: If I remember it right, Darvas has written about the trumph ace which disappeared|pg||
nt|haans: may be passed out|pg||
nt|lml: double here probably to show positive?|pg||
nt|haans: natural bodding 1nt-pass-pass-pass|pg||
mb|1D|nt|daman: NS might just get to the @S game|pg||
nt|josj: either xx would have done|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|daman: or defend 2@Hs doubled?|pg||
nt|lestergold: im sure many have|pg||
nt|lestergold: now will they even get to play in 5@d?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: not 4@s|pg||
nt|lestergold: ten card fit better than 7 card fit especially when there is 5/1 break out|pg||
nt|josj: another slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  The spade game is difficult even with 3-3 in clubs i defense avoid playing hearts|pg||
nt|ralfwil: As I play Easts hand has more than enough for 2@d after @s-opening from P|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will NS get away from there 4-4@H?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it's a 2 way 1C :)|pg||
nt|haans: they did not play old Carrot |pg||
nt|sybarra: right you are George|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: Stone age bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: well, perhaps 2/1 is gf for them|pg||
nt|lestergold: he is playing 'catch up' now|pg||
nt|peachy: i dont know if it is|pg||
nt|santyclz: Uh oh, a multi-2@d *overcall*.  The ACBL just went into shock.|pg||
nt|josj: should be easy now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yet another slam - dealing computer working well |pg||
nt|jcwla: 10 more to Team Zang on 15 - they made 4@S where Curt-Lennart failed in the single-@H-stopper 3NT here.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lestergold: will west imagione how perfect his cards are?|pg||
nt|chick: easy 3N to make, too|pg||
nt|lml: I think people would bid over 1NT with the East hand |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|daman: E will lead a @C maybe|pg||
nt|nilsland:  A trump lead is best|pg||
nt|chick: sure, they will find it|pg||
nt|rodal f: If so slam is on|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|daman: the 6 will force the King :)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  this will be another exiting board, may go either way|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5@c now@@?|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lml: but here we are getting a bit high|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lestergold: now do you get message pard??|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant criticise them for failing to bid 6 on a finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: esepcially when they are in comfortable lead|pg||
nt|chick: I sure wish they would wake up and realize that multi isn't the nightmare they make it out to be|pg||
nt|haans: many do not bid 1@C with 16 hcp balanced hand|pg||
pc|d7|nt|chick: I don't think there is any slam here, I thought you meant find the game :)|pg||
nt|josj: is 4@C a void already?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: we are about to find out.....|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 4 @C = void|pg||
nt|pelu: sh be - after 2NT most systems can show singletons on 3-level|pg||
nt|josj: ty|pg||
nt|josj: in that case, S can work it out|pg||
nt|mdgraham: missing slam gained 11 on board 16. NS at the other table in 4NT-2 |pg||
nt|lml: I usually have to have 17 HCP balanced and played opening 1NT 14-16 but thats just me|pg||
nt|jcwla: If they're going to split like this, at least let 'em be on the right side.|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|lestergold: east has no reason o bid one more|pg||
nt|lestergold: east cannot know there are no wasted in hearts|pg||
nt|peachy: nicely done. I suppose if they needed IMPs badly, they would have bid slam, it is not that far|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think most good pairs would reach 5@d and play there |pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@d is not a self-playing contract....|pg||
nt|peachy: no, it isn|pg||
nt|haans: thats many|pg||
pc|s2|nt|pelu: 5@d = 0/3 - I exp|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yes|pg||
pc|s3|nt|santyclz: Hard to believe this auction.|pg||

pc|dT|nt|mdgraham: aww|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 5NT = Do you have another trick somewhere :)?|pg||
nt|pelu: here I play 5@s = Pass with = and cue bid with 3 (even if it is sure that pd has 3|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzpx: West thought East would double with cards strong enough for GF against a 17+|pg||
nt|pelu: on the 5@c/6@c hand NS had an accident - stopped in 4Nt (-2)|pg||
nt|lml: has to hold diamond losers to one|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|pg||
nt|lestergold: safest in thios contract play @d A now|pg||

pc|h2|nt|lml: that will do it|pg||

nt|josj: curious: how can N hold a @C void, an opening bid and no aces?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|othered1: This should keep them out of NT|pg||
nt|nilsland:  S has a problem, much extra values, maybe a double?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@D to play opposite spades and diamonds I assume|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: West must correct if he doesn't have diamonds as the other suit|pg||
nt|chick: I'm surprised N didn't show his support for @Hs|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: ouch|pg||
nt|lestergold: on this occasion unl;ikely to improve contract of 1N|pg||
nt|chick: he can't hope for penalty in spades|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@h=transfer to 4@S|pg||
nt|josj: as usual :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: if pitch the @S, E can just keep 3 hearts instead|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rodal f: And S took 10 Red Bulls|pg||

pc|cK|nt|othered1: I mispredicted again, but why would south bid 3N?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Vg in your timezone: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php  Make it your home page!|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes,  guess it really didnt matter,  had 9 tricks in the bag|pg||
nt|lml: that should show more than their balancing notrump|pg||
nt|haans: spade lead = no 3nt|pg||
nt|haans: no spade lead = 3nt a make|pg||
nt|lml: 3NT is not a good contract.  5@c isnt bad|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: What was 3@C I wonder|pg||

nt|lml: it doesnt mae though|pg||
nt|lml: make|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No @S-lead is also = no 3 NT|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
nt|chick: well, there is still hope they get to slam|pg||
nt|haans: thats very true :)|pg||

pc|c5|nt|rodal f: Cornelia always use to be right there:)|pg||

pc|c6|nt|lestergold: win club swirch and K@d cant be enjoyed|pg||

pc|c7|pg||

nt|lestergold: whats delay here?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: south is thinking for some reaseon|pg||
nt|daman: the unbid suit factor|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lml: missing 9 I would expect to get a spade lead a lot of the time but then I guess if the club is on you are home anyway|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|othered1: some kind of counterdefense to 2@C?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|frankaus: re all|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ralfwil: but I don´t like this type of thinking|pg||
nt|santyclz: Well, I don't understand the auction but this hand will not send people swarming to learn the system.|pg||
nt|chick: hehe|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 2NT was forcing to 3@C, 3@D asked for short suit with C supp, then cue, cue and uhm.. well..|pg||
nt|haans: x showing 15-18 not bad agrement|pg||
nt|daman: is leading the 8 back playing East for 10xxx?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|daman: I would have led the Q! back|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lestergold: well three off now maybe|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @hJ????|pg||
nt|peachy: three for sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: we call it 'eating her own childrfen'|pg||
nt|rodal f: A speciality for the most of us?|pg||
nt|lml: but 5@C has extra chances to without a spade lead|pg||
pc|d4|nt|haans: CORRECT?????????|pg||
pc|d9|nt|vugraphzpx: yes|pg||
nt|lml: and you are less likely to get one|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|nilsland:  3 C was probably a normal raise. South did not whether W had diamonds or hearts really|pg||
nt|haans: only think that say DO NOT BID 3NT is = nonvul|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk2: Frissan has lost all of the advantage, and plenty more :(|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the only way to lose 3 @h tricks by his own|pg||
nt|chick: welcome back Frank|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Risky lead indeed|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: They have not recorded a single IMP so far|pg||
nt|othered1: NS should take a good look at their methods, since a common type of intervention gave them no chance to focus on what's important on this hand.|pg||
nt|nilsland:  If double was take out that would solved the problem, but this is a siatuation that surely was not discussed|pg||

nt|chick: would have been interesting to see E win the @DA and return the club ... see if S can figure out to go up with the K|pg||
nt|henryb:  did he make 11 or 12 tricks?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 11|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: apparently weak two in d not vailable|pg||
mb|1D|an|0+, 11-16|nt|frankaus: i vaguelly recall a legend about some famous pair that agreed not to bid any slams in a year and found they were level pegging on the overall results|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: horrible X by W|pg||
nt|haans: best defense 2@C Landy|pg||
nt|bende:  1@d = 8-11 nebulous, among other variants 4M-5+m|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lestergold: no preempt with east'shand ?|pg||
nt|peachy: if no weak two, surely 3D is|pg||
nt|lestergold: no weak 2 at least its maxi but at this vul pretty ideal|pg||
nt|haans: right :) weak 2|pg||
nt|haans: strongly agree|pg||
nt|josj: no matter what it meant, Gary? :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: cannot expect more than 2@h from N|pg||
nt|lestergold: another Roland fave hand here|pg||
nt|josj: interesting duplication in @D for NS|pg||
mb|4S|nt|othered1: Thanks also to the Filbyter Bridge Club and Carl Ragnarsson for bringing this event to  BBO. |pg||
nt|othered1: And, f inally, thanks to my fellow commentators, George Holland, Mats Nilsland, John Bucheister, and Roland Wald.|pg||
nt|lestergold: he loves those 20/20 hands|pg||
nt|chick: I assume 2@D is asking further description|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Play will resume after a short break, perhaps 10-15 mins|pg||
nt|chick: and N overruling his partner ... he would hate to find out that his partner has 6 spades|pg||
nt|haans: usually bid you suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 21|pg||
nt|lml: I think exclusion bids might be the best way to bid over 1@D|pg||
nt|lml: so here 2@C would be takeout of clubs|pg||
nt|haans: 2@C with clubs not winning bridge|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: ah...|pg||
nt|sybarra: tough lead |pg||
nt|jcwla: If only one stopper, should be at high end; if two, ok to be a bit lower.  Diamond suit lays out well for decl w/best read.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|haans: 4@C transfer to u suit|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lestergold: yep east backs in|pg||
nt|lml: I meant West at the first opportunity|pg||
nt|haans: M more vital that minors|pg||
nt|lml: 2@c would show no clubs by west|pg||
nt|lml: it would ask East to bid another suit|pg||
nt|haans: yes me to 2@C Landy immediate|pg||
nt|lml: yes something like that :)|pg||
nt|lml: you have to have a defense over 1@D|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: and i think pushed n/s overboard|pg||
nt|peachy: N bid again.... I am amazed, in 4-card major system|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|lestergold: north has not got a vestige of a 3@h bid |pg||
nt|peachy: not impossible to make though, if guessing the lead is singl|pg||
nt|chick: Looks like EW have decided it's time to start swinging|pg||
nt|chick: overbid and hope for a big score|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|pelu: MACH comming back - Zang bid 5@C X over 4@S - 1 (-300) and missed the grand|pg||
nt|josj: might be difficult for W to lead a @D now|pg||
pc|c8|nt|othered1: Previous hand emphasizes the need to h ave "metaagreements" on handling 2-suited overcalls, so you  have some basis for action if one pops up against you.  A much better use of ...|pg||
nt|othered1: your time than concocting schemes to find third round controls on high minor suit auctions, etc.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well east is nowm glad he was cannily quiet|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|nilsland:  6 @C may be the answer says Zbych from Poland|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dQ|nt|rodal f: Agree and would been a desaster, but argue with the odds and sucsess?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: well whether or not it was for the right reason he got the play right|pg||
nt|peachy: more hearts please|pg||
nt|chick: knowing that E has only 4 spades, S should keep pushing the hearts|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Or even 6 @H :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|othered1: @D tap won't beat 6@H?|pg||
nt|nilsland:  yes|pg||
nt|nilsland:  as usual :)|pg||
nt|josj: and another missed grand coming soon|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: 6@C is a great contract. If this is a choice of slams, I am impressed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Very well done!|pg||
pc|h2|nt|othered1: Very well done.  Minor suit slams aren't easiest contracts to find.|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|s5|nt|haans: landy better than exclusion p can bid 2@D asking were 5 cards|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lml: I dont mind either but you need something|pg||
pc|sK|nt|nilsland:  Should be easy to play with 2 diamond ruffs in dummy|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and no @c finess! @cA and a small|pg||
nt|lml: just trying to find an overcall is not very good|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|chick: and now S knows that partner is out of clubs, so a club to him, and heart back|pg||
pc|sA|nt|othered1: or 2@S ruffs in hand (but @D are better)|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|nt|haans: agree go to the table PREPARED|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|lestergold: best to duck the club|pg||
nt|peachy: he will duck|pg||
nt|lestergold: he is considering it i expect|pg||
nt|lestergold: knows declarr needs every trick he can muster|pg||
nt|lestergold: sholuld be a trick short here|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|nilsland:  Souths AK98 in clubs are solid|pg||
pc|h4|nt|chick: if E tries to draw trump, will have no way back to the clubs|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
pc|d8|nt|rodal f: Or was it? 2@H is -1|pg||
nt|josj: yes we do!|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|s3|nt|lestergold: if west takes club it mnakes he ducks its off|pg||
nt|peachy: Team Zang has gained a large lead, despite team Frissan's handicap carryover of 17|pg||

nt|vugraphzpx: E/W plays strong club, and 1D is 4k M unbal or 11-13NT.|pg||
nt|lestergold: the grand is enormous|pg||
nt|frankaus: sometimes with a misfitt 50 at a time is a bargain.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this grand appears to have a slight flaw|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks brutal at other table in 1 nt |pg||
nt|lml: innovative|pg||
nt|haans: i see a fast 3@D here|pg||
nt|bende:  I think he will bid 2@c=8-11, 6+@c or 5@c-4@d|pg||
mb|1S|nt|peachy: yes, probably tools available to dind out SQ is missing, but went on with length|pg||
nt|chick: and with the nice result in the other room, OS.se finally gets on the scoreboard this session|pg||
nt|hawe45:  With a @S-suit...?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|daman: is there an engldih translation for Torbjorn?|pg||
nt|daman: english|pg||
nt|Walddk2: björn = bear|pg||
nt|daman: ok  thx|pg||

nt|chick: for you latecomers ... 20 of the IMPs for OS.se is the handicap they started with|pg||
nt|chick: wow, now we are moving on to transfer overcalls :)|pg||
nt|josj: depends on who's on lead :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: 10 to Curt-Lennart on 9 for stopping in 4@S.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|daman: this is the weak NT obviously|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Mats Nilsland|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Mats|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Mats!|pg||
nt|nilsland:  hi|pg||
nt|lestergold: and they had better bid it or they will be drowned in then deficit|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: looks like Stenberg|pg||
nt|peachy: it is pretty deep already|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Ups,sry|pg||
nt|bende:  2@d=relay, FG|pg||
nt|haans: x he diud and I ask why?|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: pretty soon, it will be transfer openings, and then no one will be able to bid the suits they have :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: here are the OR's first 2 boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: it was a long auction to 7 in the open|pg||
nt|pelu: best chance with S or N on lead :)|pg||
nt|bende:  2@h = short hearts|pg||
nt|chick: since 1@D artificial would be showing @Ds, asking for @D lead|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Walddk2: Mats will tell you all about wriggling if they get doubled in 1NT :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: not bidding the grand would be resignimng time i think|pg||
nt|rodal f: Let's see how EWs minorsystem works|pg||
nt|josj: :)|pg||
nt|bende:  Should normally be 2NT but here they won two steps, pass and RD|pg||
nt|chick: heart lead likely|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lml: well again that depends on discussions.  maybe it should be takeout|pg||
nt|lml: but again after the FG you are right Chick|pg||
nt|bende:  Here they have lost in total one step which means they keep relaying.|pg||
nt|lml: I like it as lead directing|pg||
nt|haans: bid fast and pass for ever|pg||
nt|jcwla: Nice low stop here.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Walddk2: He is the man behind Nilsland's Slinkningar, an escape system when 1NT gets doubled|pg||
nt|lml: a bit aggressive to bid 3@D|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|pelu: after 2Nt - 3Nt diff - almost impossible for East to lead @s|pg||
nt|pelu: now 3NT in S and easy for W for find a @S-lead|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Shoe me the real East-hand - this bidding canÂ´t be true|pg||
nt|hawe45:  show|pg||
nt|chick: need to get the @D tricks too, though, right up front|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|santyclz: Re-hi folks.  Lost my conn for a few moments.|pg||
nt|chick: an aceless 10 HCP plus a void is hardly worth two takeout doubles|pg||
nt|chick: we missed you, Joe :)|pg||
nt|chick: everyone was getting totally bored with just me :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: if East would have passed, as I think he should have, South may pass 3@C D|pg||
nt|frankaus: not real well but its a difficult hand for most systems|pg||
nt|rodal f: Would it been better with 2@S from E at the 1NT?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: definitly 2@S would have been better if they play like that|pg||
nt|sybarra: not X'd  likely hands break well with little inteference |pg||
nt|sybarra: however....|pg||
nt|sybarra: S is looking for tricks |pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: Declarer drumming his fingers on the table|pg||
pc|cA|nt|daman: that was a heavy 1@H overcall|pg||
nt|chick: hehe|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: I bid 1NT - 2@S - something - 3@D with hands like Easts|pg||
nt|lml: I am with you bid it the first time or not at all... in fact not at all sounds good to me|pg||
nt|haans: yep cost 800 some times :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|daman: and South found a reason not to raise|pg||
nt|othered1: off shape for a double and wrong for 1N, 1@H looks normal, if you choose to act at all|pg||
nt|haans: 23 hcp|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no fit and no hope of making :(|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|josj: biut not much of a swing either|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I never open 4441 11 counts - keeps me out of trouble|pg||
nt|josj: look at those nice pointed suits|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: also would NEVER open one 1@S|pg||
nt|pelu: so much for science :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: On a low sapde lead, East has to play @SK then 9 - not too hard, one would think|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR 2 bids to get to 3NT - hele a long travel|pg||
nt|chick: The double said it all, but perhaps he is trying to interfere with the relaying|pg||
nt|bende:  3@h=7+@c and singelton @h|pg||
nt|lml: if he wanted to do that he should have bid it over 2@D|pg||
nt|lml: 3@D doesnt take much space|pg||
nt|hawe45:  800 with two blind children af opponents!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  as|pg||
nt|bende:  4@d=4 controls|pg||
nt|haans: problem with bidding they will not bid slam|pg||
nt|chick: of course, Linda, but there is no other reason I can see for bidding 3@D|pg||
pc|sA|nt|daman: why do you feel it is offshape?|pg||
nt|santyclz: S didn't his 4@c?  Mercy rule in effect?|pg||
nt|santyclz: (hit)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: I don´t think he expected a pass from his p|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: combined 28 count have to bid well to reach the grand|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
nt|haans: i do not open it with 1@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it has been said that the fewer bids oyu take to get to your final contract, the better - but this swing is really a bit random|pg||
nt|mdgraham: assuming 3NT is the final contract, of course...  |pg||
nt|pelu: I remember a stury, where Riese was asked by to young players - how do u bid 3NT - we stopped in 4@C -1 - R: 1NT - 3NT!|pg||
nt|lml: my thinking is that east-west has had it!|pg||
nt|lml: its a teeny tiny white flag|pg||
nt|haans: a bid score this time|pg||
nt|lml: great spot 4@S|pg||
nt|haans: big|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rodal f: Belive they don't. Might something for them to discuss|pg||

nt|lestergold: perfecto no wasted hands fit like hand and glove|pg||
nt|josj: yes, this story often used to show the advantages of 12-14 NT :)|pg||
nt|pelu: tell your story - and dont tell opp|pg||
nt|sybarra: and opps discards not making it easy |pg||
nt|sybarra: W making it look like @S's do not break |pg||
nt|sybarra: Joel,  is S in the tank?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: he certainly is|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzpx: South that is.. :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|peachy: After GF spade raise, S has all suits sontrolled first or second round. Even if N hadn't South still would|pg||
nt|lestergold: well another 13 imps into the bottomless pit|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but they still have tio be confident of 13 tricks controls are only part of the story|pg||
nt|josj: yep, let them sweat it out|pg||
nt|josj: NS seem to have reached the proper contract here, wd so far...|pg||
pc|h9|nt|peachy: the first part, yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: first three bids same in open room then the auctions took different directions|pg||
nt|lestergold: and sadly  a differfent destination|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|pelu: wd by NS - after 5½ bidding-round|pg||
nt|chick: sad for EW|pg||
nt|jcwla: Oy gevalt.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|nt|othered1: OK, perhaps sub-optimal shape for a double|pg||
nt|daman: well   4414 would be ideal I suppose|pg||
nt|sybarra: I imagine that was sigh of relief |pg||
nt|chick: I was about to say the defense will have to set up a club for him, but he's doing it himself|pg||

nt|josj: lol|pg||
nt|josj: sort of advanced goulash, Mike?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: wea re wiser now - and more than a bit older, too|pg||
nt|josj: the latter is definitely true :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: must be some spade raise  (the 2nt call) |pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 2NT = invitational w/ @S|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|mdgraham: I'm afraid Mr Dylan was wrong when he said that he was so much older then|pg||
nt|lml: west should show the @SQ with the extra length|pg||
nt|haans: if 2NT did show 4 spades @SQ not needed|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk4: Second half after a short break|pg||
nt|josj: I think this needs a quick @H shift|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|peachy: I wonder if he was looking for slam?  Why else 2H first if he was going to 4 anyway|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes|pg||
nt|lml: yes but east doesnt know that|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 2NT = "jacoby"|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|dJ|pc|d5|pg||

nt|chick: should have an easy time making this, so a few imps picked up here|pg||
nt|lml: the only trick was for west to show the queen with the extra length and he did|pg||
pc|c9|nt|daman: duh|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk2: First @H2, then the jack rather than the king, but partner refuses to ruff in :)|pg||
