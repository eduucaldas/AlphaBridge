nt|Vugraphzfb: Board 1 is on the table but they're still discussing methods|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Both play natural systems, 2/1'ish|pg||
nt|brolucius: Thank goodness.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|jallerton: are there are some strange conventions to defend against then, Jan?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://tinyurl.com/ykmy5n3  for the N-S convention card|pg||
mb|d|nt|brolucius: If South bids 1@H, this will steal the E/W suit.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I don't think so, but there was a little bit of a language problem, since NS mainly speak French and EW English & Italian|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: 2@H is not forcing, but suggests around 8-10 points.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I have to confess that I absolutely hero-worship Jacqui Mitchell, so anyone who says anything bad about her will have to contend with me :)|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|dK|pg||
nt|jbgood:  it is normal these days to bid 1@h on the S hand, as if E would havbe passed? Or is it just here we do that?|pg||

mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: West and North can make something big if they were partners|pg||

mb|2S|mb|d|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I think you should, David, not least at these colours|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|jallerton: Presumably East could not bid Stayman followed by 2@s over 2@d|pg||
mb|3D|nt|Walddk2: Very easy to psyche a strong NT NV against V|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: East could not bid Stayman instead because she plays 1NT - 2@C - 2@D - 2@S invitational (presumably). |pg||
nt|reisig: 3@d wasn't best|pg||
nt|jallerton: correct, Roland, especially vs oppo who do not play pen douvles|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Z has put his cards on the table and has his head in his hand thinking|pg||
nt|brolucius: A very dangerous type of psyche to make, since partner may go too high.|pg||
nt|jallerton: that's the case with most psyches, David|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|reisig: This is the time for a bathroom break|pg||
nt|brolucius: South may reason that North would have bid immediately if he had a great diamond suit. But I suppose North might pass initially on any very strong hand.|pg||
nt|jallerton: double from West should be penalties here I think|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Olivieri asks about the bidding and Z explains that the DBL was spade shortness, takeout but on the subsequent 3@d bid not many clubs|pg||
nt|jallerton: and I'd be disappointed not to take at least 5 tricks in my own hand|pg||

nt|daman: on Board 1   repeated @D tap held declarer to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|daman: I have been advised they use 2@C as either clubs or two suits if run when doubled|pg||

nt|brolucius: West may overcall 1@H here, despite holding only a 4-card suit.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: A little unsual to rebid 1@S with less than three|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: No explanation of 1@s, but I'm guessing that it shows a balanced minimum with no information about number of spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ady: less west balances |pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: 3@S is quite a bid. Why not 2@S?|pg||
nt|ady: did not have a chance    got way to high    can collet 100  instead of 140|pg||
nt|reisig: This may not make :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: stopped in 2@s in the CR|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Now Mitchell asks about 1@s and Multon says that 1@s showed any hand with 3 spades or a hand with 2 spades and 13-16 HCP. 3@s was invitational, 3NTprobably showed 2@ss, accepting|pg||
nt|brolucius: Seems a perfectly normal 2@S to me, even if you are keen to impress a BBO crowd with your aggressive bidding.|pg||
nt|jallerton: this is a mini NT position for N/S  I think - South may have implied extras|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ady: n/s may have gained an imp for their optimism   West surely would have balanced if 2@S had been passed round|pg||
nt|jbgood: Still looks like 3@s is a bit too much.. non-vul to boot|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.acbl.org/nabc/index.php?a=2010&b=Spring&c=daily_bulletins  for team rosters and daily bulletins with pairings in the Round of 64|pg||

pc|c3|nt|brolucius: For some pairs, East's heart spot-card would be suit preference (with a singleton in the dummy, so no future in hearts). East actually played a middle heart, suggesting equal ...|pg||

nt|brolucius: De Falco has outbid Multon twice already. (He passed 3@C, remember, rather than going on to 3@D).|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: :)|pg||
nt|jallerton: or Geir Helgemo, who also opened 1NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Z hesitated for a significant time over  the 2@c bid, so Mitchell may have an idea that there's some distribution on this hand|pg||

nt|brolucius: Getting the range into the picture is very important - not to mention the fact that you can grab the contract as declarer.|pg||
nt|jallerton: Yes, it's seems to be a modern trend, though  after a opening 1@c you do have an easy rebid|pg||
nt|brolucius: Recommended for those who find rebids difficult.|pg||
nt|jallerton: if I were playing with Tor I would feel no need whatsoever to hog the contract|pg||
nt|reisig: Or ..to keep opps from a cheap 1@h overcall|pg||
nt|ady: meantime 4@S not so easy with 4-1 split    but declarer should prevail|pg||
nt|brolucius: With four trumps to the ace, North was attempting to force declarer with his club lead. Unlucky to find declarer with five club stoppers.|pg||
nt|jbgood: :)|pg||
nt|jallerton: she can lead club winners through North now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: After the 2@d overcall in the other room, N led a diamond, so declarer's @d K was good. Here she doesn't know the @d A is onside|pg||
