pc|cK|nt|eamongall: is that a normal 1@S opening|pg||
nt|dohicky: Hi all|pg||
nt|eamongall: methinks its the wrong hand|pg||
nt|dohicky: Looks like it|pg||
nt|eamongall: i see a score of 3@Hs+4 in another match but same board ...also bizarre|pg||
nt|eamongall: the bidding here is possible but  aggressive and the 1@S opening is strange|pg||
nt|cicus: a brave entry by David, which has been left unpunished|pg||
pc|c3|nt|dohicky: Hi all :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: Good aFTERNOON ALL|pg||

pc|d2|nt|qwikjanz: 2H can make NS, @D appears to have 2H and 2S losers|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Anna Onishuk has played Lady Milne for the Republic|pg||

mb|4D|nt|barnets: a cool but bright day here in fla|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|dohicky: 2@d Shows a weak 2 in @h or some strong options|pg||

nt|Walddk1: http://www.bridgewebs.com/cgi-bin/bwma/display.cgi?pid=display_page5&club=bangorholidaycongress&sessid=545753491721727  for current standings (scroll down)|pg||
nt|cicus: good for another X?|pg||
nt|cicus: I don't think so|pg||
nt|lestergold: low level part scores only here i suspect that someone will declare and go negative here|pg||
mb|4S|nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: without a spade lead/[layed by south it may make|pg||
mb|5C!|nt|pdjourdain: might declarer read this and drop the king?|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: It looks like 4 clubs, three spades and 1 trick in each other, but not easy timing|pg||
nt|cicus: I think 2@S or even 3 making|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: Murdoch has correctly downvalued his two bacl Qx is|pg||
mb|5H|nt|barnets: n/s have been playing together for around 40 years|pg||
mb|p|nt|dohicky: :) They had 15 year break at one point|pg||
nt|jackthelad: stunningly beautiful Edinburgh|pg||
nt|barnets: probably one of the longest running partnerships in bridge|pg||
nt|barnets: ok|pg||
nt|barnets: i played against them as juniors|pg||
nt|lestergold: black doubleton qs neither of which are pulling their weight|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: yes i was expecting a further effort fromN/S but they are ta ufavouravle and south's hand was rightly devalued|pg||
mb|p|pc|dA|nt|cicus: good decisions by all|pg||
pc|dK|nt|pdjourdain: West switches a heart and then the hearts run, so declarer needed to play club ace at trick one|pg||
nt|qwikjanz: ducking this will ensure contract makes|pg||
pc|d4|nt|pdjourdain: Well done Pat Shields|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|pdjourdain: the defence have two hearts a spade a club and a diamond|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d8|pc|d3|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|pdjourdain: if West gets in|pg||
pc|h4|nt|qwikjanz: not many plays now|pg||
nt|cicus: although E can now make 10 tricks with good spade guess which is unlikely|pg||
