mb|2C|mb|d|mb|p|nt|garnetts: Pass looks anti-percentage to me |pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphzdt: bd 17, sy lost|pg||
nt|dohicky: After an 11-16 opening it will be tough for W to envision a slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: 2@S = 15+ HCP and 8 playing tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|justin c: hi geoffrey|pg||
nt|justin c: you prefer 5@H for east?|pg||
nt|garnetts: I would double simply because 5@H looks too much of a committment|pg||
nt|justin c: nothing ideal really|pg||
mb|p|pc|cK|nt|pdjourdain: Hi from Patrick jourdain|pg||
nt|garnetts: Pull 5@C to 5@H |pg||
nt|pdjourdain: England gained 2 IMPs during the scoring break compared with our earlier scores|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ady: assume 2 diamonds   spades and minor    east reasonably passed|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@c showed any 1-suited hand|pg||
nt|justin c: this needs something good to happen in @D|pg||
nt|justin c: which it is not|pg||
pc|cT|nt|garnetts: I agree but pass is a cop out |pg||
nt|justin c: I like the 4@S opening|pg||
nt|garnetts: Good morning Patrick |pg||
nt|justin c: has a lot of ways to win|pg||
nt|justin c: anybody prefer 1@S?|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@S seems normal to me--have bid it with less |pg||

mb|4N|mb|p|nt|golfsquash: I mean in 6@s|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|justin c: depends on lead tho|pg||
nt|justin c: if a @C from W, must choose yr play immediately|pg||
nt|eamongall: my first bridge book at age 15 told me you add 1 point for the 5th and 6th cards and 2 pts for the 7th card ...so 14 hcp and 4 length pts = 18 = 1 Blue @C|pg||
nt|justin c: (clear to finesse)|pg||

mb|3D|nt|chick: Hello again, Helen :)|pg||
nt|chick: 6@S here, but 6@H fails|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|chick: clubs was his only chance anyway, he could see the endplay in both other suits|pg||
nt|lestergold: well you can go and do ur blogging whateve that means|pg||
nt|chick: 4@C is takeout|pg||
mb|4D|nt|ady: dbl 13-15|pg||
nt|justin c: pushy 2@D bid|pg||
nt|chick: N will bid hearts and they could end in the unmakeable slam|pg||
mb|5C|nt|jallerton: 2@d Multi, pass probably shows @d|pg||
nt|lml: what is 2@H?|pg||
nt|lml: is is pyschic or a transfer or something else?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: pass from west shows 6+ diamonds|pg||
nt|justin c: partscore hand here|pg||
nt|lestergold: a luncay or input error|pg||
nt|lml: so maybe 2@S?|pg||
nt|chick: or not :)|pg||
mb|5S|nt|justin c: 12 tricks for EW when both @S are right|pg||
nt|roswolf: the english are very aggressive|pg||
nt|justin c: was just wondering if S would make a second X|pg||
nt|justin c: likely EW in 3@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: is 2NT natural from N here?|pg||
nt|justin c: but E got there first :)|pg||
nt|lml: must be|pg||
mb|6H|nt|Walddk7: Good morning David, Justin and Patrick|pg||
nt|justin c: Liggins 'balancing'|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: knows that passed hand East will drop 2@H|pg||
mb|6S|nt|roswolf: this seems super optimistic|pg||
nt|justin c: hi Roland|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: hi folks|pg||
nt|chick: We are experiencing some difficulty with the vugraph hands, so please be patient, we'll get it fixed soon|pg||
nt|chick: hi Bob|pg||
nt|lestergold: well with both club and heart aces on side and the q@s appearintg on 2nd round west will get a lucky let off |pg||
nt|chick: S has to override this to make a slam, and he does!|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: will do well yo make this|pg||
nt|ady: best to play low in both hands|pg||
nt|jallerton: yes, there is still room for East to hold @cK (the EW CC does not specify a range)|pg||
nt|ady: west may be end played if winning KC if the first heart is ducked|pg||
nt|justin c: I guess if you want to play in slam , 6@C by W is as good as anything|pg||
nt|roswolf: crawling back under his stone!|pg||
nt|justin c: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk7: http://www.bridgewebs.com/cgi-bin/bwma/display.cgi?pid=display_page5&club=bangorholidaycongress&sessid=545753491721727  for current standings (scroll down)|pg||
nt|garnetts: It seems a little incongruous to me to make a marginal game try here and pass with the last hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: west will be disappointed when he sees the full layout|pg||
nt|justin c: If you are going to ask for keycards with west, it doesnt make a lot of sense to then sign off when you have enough, does it?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|garnetts: Good morning Roland|pg||
nt|justin c: buying a useful dummy for his efforts|pg||
pc|d3|nt|dohicky: I really don't understand this bidding. Were all NS bids except 4@c to play?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphzdt: Lost it|pg||
nt|justin c: likely to make 10 here, rising @SA on a trump switch and ruffing hearts|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not to worry viewgraph is really hard to manage and this happens from time to time--not sure if this will make but looks favourite to me |pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|justin c: If you arent going to know what to do over the reply, 4NT not a good idea|pg||
nt|chick: club finesse has to work of course, but it does, so he can pitch the losing heart|pg||
nt|dohicky: Hard to argue with success though :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lml: its possible to musguess spades but not likely|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|pdjourdain: At other table Wales bid failing slam on Board 31 we will see later|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|ady: little chance now unless dropping KC|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jallerton: yes, alas Chris Dixon has chosen a different line|pg||
nt|lestergold: well if that qualifies as a weak 2 then im a leprachaun|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vugraphzdt: He doesn't know about the diamond void...|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|pc|h6|pc|s5|pg||
nt|chick: don't know, but I think 4@C was takeout for the other two suits|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|d8|nt|jallerton: true, Helen, but may suspect it after no diamond lead at trick 1|pg||
mc|12|nt|chick: was surprised N didn't just bid 4@H|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|justin c: this looks v close|pg||
nt|ppiglett: You might play hearts by low the the eight to deal with entries for diamonds and spades|pg||
nt|golfsquash: he will play on hearts, but which way?|pg||
nt|justin c: run the @HQ maybe? |pg||
nt|golfsquash: he will play a heart to the 8 and will scramble 7 tricks.|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Agreed|pg||
mc|6|nt|justin c: guess we'll never know|pg||
pg||
qx|c19|st||md|1SK5HQT76DA97CA543,SQT63HK52DQ43CJ82,SJ874HA98DJT6CT76,SA92HJ43DK852CKQ9|sv|e|nt|vugraphzdt: Some heat, not much light|pg||
nt|ady: silverstone liekly to open|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@d Multi also played by N/S|pg||
nt|justin c: more slams|pg||
nt|mcphee: that 4-1 fit looked like a tuff one:)|pg||
nt|chick: yes, I was starting to think someone was starting the party early :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: now this hand looks like 4@S may have a decent shot|pg||
nt|mcphee: it doesn't, but close|pg||
nt|mcphee: they must be taking a moment to hit the bar|pg||
nt|chick: may still be trying to get to the right set of hands|pg||
nt|mcphee: this is what we call teeter totter hands|pg||
nt|chick: teetering on the brink of disaster and then tottering back to normalcy?  :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: lets predict an auction|pg||
nt|petepunt: sorting boards out as we speak.  Players have right boards tho'|pg||
nt|chick: I'm starting to worry that the hands they are actually playing are not in the vugraph computer :-\|pg||
nt|vugraphzdt: Thanks first time doing this|pg||
nt|justin c: game likely to be let through if N overcalls 1@S and S raises with @SKQ doubleton (as he might)|pg||
mb|1C|nt|justin c: then north would assume 3@S in S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: likely to play 2H|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm now a real slam perhaps even a grand for the heroic|pg||
nt|justin c: 1NT 14-16|pg||
nt|roswolf: if they lock into hearts they may get into the grand|pg||
nt|justin c: should be able to find out the @DK missing|pg||
nt|roswolf: but diamonds is the likely trump suit = the 1nt opening should see to that|pg||
mb|1H|nt|pdjourdain: Good result for wales there and on board 15 at the other table we will see later|pg||
nt|justin c: nebulous precision type 1@D|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: 3N likely for E/W |pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: 3@C = 6@D i think|pg||
nt|garnetts: North will always bid almost whatever |pg||
mb|1N|nt|roswolf: presumably transfer|pg||
nt|justin c: support X, (3@H)|pg||
nt|dohicky: a xfer I suspect|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 3@H PROBE|pg||
nt|garnetts: rdble now catches NS |pg||
nt|chick: should be a good score for NI, as it is easy to get into the bad 6@H contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: needs to shorten trumps as much as possible|pg||
nt|vugraphzdt: Another nine!|pg||
nt|jallerton: there are some entries to hand in @d|pg||
nt|justin c: now 3@S = shortage (maybe)|pg||
nt|justin c: it does|pg||
nt|justin c: 3NT will make EW with @C 4-4|pg||
nt|garnetts: 1NT has no advantage over redouble --in fact it rules out a penalty|pg||
nt|garnetts: However is East worth 3@D?  |pg||
nt|justin c: hard for him to judge|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: no splinter|pg||
nt|justin c: if there is a real @D suit in S, east's hand just falls apart|pg||
nt|garnetts: He was very aggressive on the last hand Non vul but not so here |pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Normal to bid 2D|pg||
nt|chick: yes, they play transfer advances over 1@C openings|pg||
nt|chick: 1@C opening is "prepared club", could be 2 card suit|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|roswolf: void splinter|pg||
nt|chick: The vugraph operator is getting caught up on some hands that have already been played, we'll get to live hands soon|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: but difficult to reach|pg||
pc|s4|nt|roswolf: they will play 6@D|pg||
nt|justin c: looking that way|pg||
nt|justin c: 5@D okay too|pg||
pc|s2|nt|justin c: nothing wrong with playing this in 2@S|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|h7|nt|justin c: game needs a @D break and a @C break|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Excellent try|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not so sure Patrick--depends on a number of systemic arrangements|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: 3N lucky to make|pg||
nt|justin c: this looks like making|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: wants heart finesse to lose|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: but if he doesn't take it and South has Kx very bad news|pg||
pc|h5|nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|justin c: y|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ady: can take A@S   and 3 spade ruffs   2 diamond tricks and 1 club trick   then exit and wait for 8th trick|pg||
nt|justin c: wont take long|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|pdjourdain: But well done the Jones!|pg||
nt|garnetts: The system NS were using almost forced this--No reason for EW to worry about a club lead on the auction|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Father Gary is West and son Dafydd East|pg||
pc|c5|nt|pdjourdain: There is a trophy at stake in this match: the Alan Pierce Trophy given in memory of a former Welsh international|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|c7|pg||

nt|vugraphzdt: Connection plasying up bear with us|pg||
nt|lestergold: np|pg||
pc|c3|nt|pdjourdain: safe now and will make an overtrick|pg||
nt|justin c: i suppose the problem with a @H finesse is that, N will hold up with Kxx or Kxxx, and that leaves the trump suit blocked with an awkward entry situation|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cT|pc|c9|pg||
nt|dohicky: A quiet 7 tricks|pg||
pc|h2|nt|pdjourdain: Yes, he had to take the risk of Kx with South, as North rated to have the king|pg||

nt|lestergold: 5@c for N/S |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 4@S might make if bid|pg||

nt|lestergold: if they manage to find the 30 point pack fit|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|pdjourdain: 3NT likely spot|pg||
nt|justin c: not a good time to try 6@H|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Prepared club|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|justin c: should be able to find the @HAQ missing and stay out|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Doesn't look more than 4@H to me|pg||
nt|garnetts: guaging trump suit quality can be hard--here even 5@H could fail|pg||
nt|lestergold: double now but west will interfere|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: 5@D is a decent contract, failing when the @HA is wrong|pg||
nt|roswolf: north might bid 1nt|pg||
nt|justin c: but 50-50|pg||
nt|roswolf: in some strong club systems|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: 2D forcing|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: non-forcing 2@S|pg||
nt|lml: and not much but trouble for east-west despite west's big hand|pg||
mb|1N|nt|pdjourdain: 1@S = @H|pg||
nt|lestergold: now south needs to cue|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: 2@H shows a minimum|pg||
mb|2C|nt|roswolf: if north bids nt at any point south will raise to 3 when the defence will make hay|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: System card doesn't say but I think 2@S was an asking bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: and that will bring north top life|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: looks like 9, losing a couple of @S, a @H and a @D|pg||
nt|lestergold: well west is givimng them another chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: a matter of partnership style whether East should bid 1@s or raise to 2@h|pg||
nt|justin c: declarer could make quite a bit of hay himself if east tries a heart lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: cards lay well  might scramble this|pg||
nt|roswolf: true|pg||
nt|chick: S decides to lie in ambush|pg||

nt|dohicky: oops :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: i think west is failing to downgrade his 18 count|pg||
pc|hT|nt|jallerton: card lie very well indeed|pg||

nt|chick: although, E could save the diamond loser by setting up the @SQ for a pitch|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: 2@H was pass or correct bvut the risk was West had spades and diamonds!|pg||
nt|chick: this should tell NS they have a spade fit|pg||
nt|justin c: S contemplating 3@S rather than 2 here (i think)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|garnetts: agreed nothing to this |pg||
nt|lestergold: very lucky infrangible with @s A onside|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ady: difficult to blame east   2NT strong invote with 4 spades   but a simple cu at 2 level would have worked out better|pg||
nt|jallerton: Yes, I prefer to use 2@h as a good 4-card raise (2@c would be a good 3-card raise)|pg||
nt|roswolf: ireland on completed matches by 1 vp|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: 2@C checkback|pg||
pc|hK|nt|pdjourdain: small swing as 5D is also one off|pg||
nt|chick: @SK|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|mcphee: might be able to dump the @D loser on K@S|pg||
nt|chick: can't make 4@S unless EW kindly set up a diamond pitch of a heart|pg||
nt|chick: N has 9 tricks off the top, 10 if E cashes the @SK.  E must realize his partner has no points left, and just lead the safe heart|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|justin c: might be a nailbiter|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: East denied 3-card hearts|pg||
nt|justin c: wales gained a swing by stopping in 2NT brd 17|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: king asks for count so if south has two West will guess he has three diamonds and East two|pg||
nt|vugraphzdt: Nth Loo break this hand apols !!|pg||
nt|justin c: which would have been a swing the other way if the @D position had been different :(|pg||

nt|garnetts: In fact that has to be the right choice--might bid 3@H if it was forcing --not keen on splinter as spades might be better than hearts |pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Dafydd wondering what else?|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2NT forcing might be OK too--bot esoteric |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdt: Sorry if I can't keep up but multitasking is not my forte|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|jallerton: pass by South|pg||
nt|jallerton: 3@h by West|pg||

nt|pdjourdain: I think Board 1 was flat not 15 to NI as the score was wrongly entered|pg||
nt|justin c: did he really rebid 4NT here?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well he has great hand but no aces partner is minimum wont get too excited|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mcphee: E took quite a view here|pg||
nt|chick: yes, but I think 3N is equally dangerous ... W doesn't have to have nearly as good a hand as he actually has|pg||
nt|mcphee: so remove the Q@D and 3N is still a make|pg||
nt|mcphee: i would not expect my p[artner to dble 3@S facing a passed hand vul with a poor hand|pg||
nt|mcphee: this is no 1-4-4-4 12 count t/o dble|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: they open 2@D with limited minor two-suiters so West may realise East is strong|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|justin c: might make 6@S here in absurd fashion|pg||
pc|c5|nt|roswolf: the spade overcalll may have kept the irish out of trouble|pg||
nt|chick: yes, in the open room, EW did not make 4@S :)|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: And Wales has stopped in game on board 3 when NI failed in  a slam|pg||

nt|vugraphzdt: yip|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: The jones bid several thin making games and several thin non-making slams!|pg||
nt|justin c: this one might make|pg||
nt|garnetts: 6@H will likely go off as there is no reason for West to play North for Qxx--can pick up Qxxx in the south hand |pg||
nt|justin c: ruff @H lead, @SA, @DA, @D ruff, Trumps, @C|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: only 8 tricks on heart lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: west may enwuire about aces and then play at 'unsaf' five level but that wont come to harm as dim ace onside|pg||
pc|c6|nt|justin c: W might have passed 2@D here|pg||
pc|cA|nt|justin c: E wont let 3NT play|pg||
nt|chick: E should not settle for 3N, any strong 6-5 belongs in slam|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: 5@C more likely|pg||
nt|lestergold: east is bidding the pips off his 11 count opener|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|chick: declarer has a lot of work to do, and the strong hand is exposed |pg||
nt|justin c: this auction is not sound|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: 5@D asked for trump queen|pg||
nt|justin c: West would bid the same way with the @SK, for instance, when 6@H is a claimer|pg||
nt|justin c: as David said, no real reason to get the trumps right here|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: On Board 3 where Jones bid and made the thin 3N Eng are in a thin, but sounder 5@D|pg||

nt|pdjourdain: when sees dummy wants favourable lie in BOTH minors|pg||

pc|s2|nt|chick: no need in diamonds, has 4 pitches |pg||
nt|justin c: wrong re lead of course :)|pg||

nt|pdjourdain: They can cut him off so not that simple even if North has @CA|pg||
pc|sA|nt|justin c: hard to analyze this one - potential endplays everywhere|pg||

nt|chick: yes, agree|pg||

nt|justin c: but with the @DK wrong...|pg||
nt|vugraphzdt: That's names corrected|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lml: thanks|pg||
nt|chick: a solid 6@S here|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: a truly ugly weak 2 bid and the vul isn't an excuse this time|pg||
mb|2D|nt|garnetts: looks like a 2@C bid to me --but what do I know |pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Now East might bid 3@C|pg||
nt|garnetts: just feels right to bid 2@C with xx spades |pg||
nt|garnetts:  should west bid 2@S perhaps |pg||
nt|pdjourdain: If West has a good hand with @HQx you want him to be declarer though not easy to engineer|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: part score  hand   20-20    e/w may play in either spades or hearts |pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Playing 14-16 NT East can bid 1NT on 10 points|pg||
nt|chick: nothing to this hand except the bidding (and the @CA opening lead)|pg||
mb|4D|nt|justin c: 4@S EW|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: 2@C = @D|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: East wants to show strong raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: maybe good hand for the weak NT here|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Now West might repeat the excellent spades|pg||

mb|4N|nt|mcphee: should make this one, although could go down|pg||
nt|mcphee: he had 7 tricks, strange|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Yes that may well happen|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: @H rate to be 4-2 so declarer may play on @S first|pg||
nt|mcphee: if so, he will be rewarded|pg||
nt|chick: no scores in the movie, so we'll just have to believe|pg||
nt|chick: but 4S will make on any lead as the cards lie|pg||
mb|5S|nt|pdjourdain: Good spot making 10 tricks|pg||

nt|justin c: i dont know their bidding methods|pg||
nt|roswolf: i hope they do|pg||
nt|justin c: told 4@D is 'last train' type slam try|pg||
nt|roswolf: blackwood might keep them out|pg||
nt|justin c: if that is right, north cant really know what to do|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: sign off|pg||
nt|justin c: transfer to the appeals committee|pg||

nt|roswolf: bd 23 a disaster for the irish 3NTXX +2|pg||
nt|justin c: north might have cue bid 5@C here, hoping to hear 5@D when opposite the @DK but 5@H otherwise|pg||
nt|mcphee: i would also bid 2@C as N|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: He ruffed it of course|pg||
nt|chick: either suit works, but hard to imagine they don't play in a 5-5 major suit fit :)|pg||

pc|s6|pc|sT|pg||
nt|petepunt: 4@S need good guessinig|pg||
nt|lml: 3NT is the usually bid you here from partner when they really wanted you to pass|pg||
nt|lml: usual|pg||
nt|chick: 3 @Ss, 1 @C, 4 @Ds, and not much prospect for anything else|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jallerton: declarer can pick up the diamond suit for no losers - the contract will depend on how he plays the @C|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|justin c: wouldnt try saying that after a few drinks|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|d2|pg||
nt|lml: I can sort of see 9 tricks|pg||
nt|lml: two spades, four hearts, two clubs and a diamond |pg||
nt|lml: or maybe an extra club instead |pg||
nt|lml: a heart back from east prob is best for the defence|pg||
pc|s9|nt|roswolf: yes sbriety is required|pg||
nt|roswolf: sobriety|pg||
pc|sA|nt|justin c: wonder if Eng can manage 6@S by S - not easy|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||

nt|lml: South can throw a spade easily enough|pg||
nt|lml: south knows where most cards are by now|pg||
nt|lml: cashing a heart and playing a diamond will work well here but then again most things will at this point|pg||
nt|lml: Ireland won a big 12 imps on the last board where east-west played the spade 4-3|pg||
pc|d7|nt|pdjourdain: guess he threw a heart|pg||
nt|justin c: think a @H went on that|pg||

mb|p|nt|jallerton: 14-16 NT|pg||
nt|justin c: what could possibly go wrong|pg||
nt|justin c: 2@D 10-13, @D or minors|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: hmm unusual |pg||
nt|justin c: 4@H going off on a @C ruff|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: 3@S not a game try|pg||
nt|justin c: normally 3@h by E would be a game invitation, 3@S just competitive|pg||
mb|3C|nt|garnetts: My guess is that South will lead the J@C against this unless North has another  go--which I doubt|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: south would rather defend 3@DX, if north doesnt...|pg||
nt|roswolf: east will be pleased he has 4 cards in diamonds|pg||
nt|justin c: do that|pg||
nt|roswolf: this now looks like 4@H|pg||
nt|petepunt: usually best to bid 1@S on these type of hand, even with 4points|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Fairly easy 9 tricks|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Wales has one good result to come at the other table on Board 15|pg||
nt|lml: Now that is an interesting development for West!|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: NS play ACOL, so this is all natural bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: a WJS 2@S also works|pg||
nt|petepunt: expect 9 with @S ruff|pg||
nt|lml: okay that makes a lot more sense|pg||
nt|dohicky: @h position is very kind for declarer|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jallerton: perhaps 1NT-2@C-2@d-2@S would be constructive for this pair|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|nt|roswolf: PROBABLY SHOULD MAKE|pg||
nt|lml: I suppose North though South must have two hearts for this|pg||
nt|lml: I thought north south was on a different time zone or something|pg||
nt|lml: now it is north who is so hap happy|pg||
nt|lml: a bad one|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|ady: some might try 2@C with south hand and go to 2@S if north does not show hearts   probably not right for their system|pg||
nt|chick: cards certainly lie badly for any contract NS|pg||
nt|lestergold: what kind of an aucrtion is tbhis/|pg||
nt|lml: the 2@S presumably showed both minors so I am not sure what West was doing|pg||
nt|lestergold: does north think they cajn run somewhere/|pg||
nt|lestergold: o mean what about a bit of a tickle|pg||
nt|lml: probably worried about clubs|pg||
pc|c2|nt|chick: 5@D Q-ask|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Of course the ACOL 1@D-1@H might get there too if East did not raise to 2@H|pg||
nt|lml: not that it isn't worth a double anyway!|pg||
nt|lestergold: wedll he knows they arent breaking for e/w and he has a lot of high cards|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|nt|chick: should kill the @H entry to the clubs now|pg||

pc|c8|pg||
nt|jallerton: playing normal Stayman Silverstone would prefer to bid 2@c|pg||

nt|justin c: 5@D?|pg||
nt|justin c: any better ideas?|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Their bids make it easier to settle for 5@D|pg||
nt|chick: second hand in 2 days with a 13 card fit|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: wow|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Weak jump|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: 4@H for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: or even 3@d 4th suit over 2@s|pg||
nt|garnetts: Good save in 4@S here--actaully a little unlucky not to make |pg||
mb|p|nt|pdjourdain: 3@S will probably fail|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Dummy has trump entry for club finesse|pg||
nt|chick: 3@C jump fit ... clubs plus spades support|pg||
nt|justin c: this gets out for one off|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Very tricky and well done by N/S|pg||
nt|lml: I dont think East is worth a slam try without knowing they have a heart fit|pg||
nt|lestergold: east would like tol bid 3 and a half no trumps now|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: should west go to 4@H  north would do well to pass  as e/w can make 10 tricks  or possible 11 in no-trumps|pg||
nt|chick: -2 against a partscore, not good for NI|pg||
pc|sA|nt|petepunt: looks like @H intra finess?|pg||
nt|chick: will be fun to see if he can smother the 10 that way :)|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Cards lie well for 4@H|pg||
nt|garnetts: I would certainly have bid 4@S in the North seat |pg||
nt|justin c: not sure 4@S is a bargain|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: at least two off in 4@S|pg||
nt|justin c: couple of @D, @HA, @CA, @C ruff off the top|pg||
nt|justin c: and dec still needs to drop the @SK|pg||
nt|justin c: E might bid a sixth here?|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: @D lead gives ruff & discard but may still be one off|pg||
nt|chick: ruff/discard does no good at all|pg||
nt|justin c: trump and 2@C to lose here|pg||
nt|justin c: Quite a view for E to let this go|pg||
nt|justin c: @SJ in dummy makes 5@S, when 6@D just one off|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear west is very good and probably has ana cceptance|pg||
pc|s7|nt|garnetts: As the card lie maybe not but 4@H is likely to make and you have a lot of undisclosed playing strength|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: meanwhile declarer is short of entries to take all those finesses in 4@H|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Declarer may have to ruff in hand to retain trump entry to hearts but they don't break|pg||
nt|lml: I would make a slam try if partner bid 4!G over 3NT|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|jallerton: Dixon should have learnt his lesson in that respect!|pg||
nt|lml: 4@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: misundertsanding one is bidding quantittaive the other takes it as blackwood|pg||
nt|lml: West is going for sure|pg||
nt|lml: well in some partnerships I respond to blackwood when I accept 4NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: no play that i can see|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lml: so it may not be a misunderstanding just over exhuberent bidding|pg||
pc|h6|nt|garnetts: Sometimes it gets you defending 5@H  --I know the cards are bad but was looking at it as a single hand problem|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Declarer might cross to club run @HQ and then switch to diamond finesse|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: that gives him 12 tricks!|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
nt|ady: yes I agree  west should not bid hearts a 4th time|pg||
nt|lestergold: east's 4N is a clearcut overbid|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|lml: I agree|pg||
nt|lestergold: ten count no nermediates and no aces not enuf|pg||
nt|lml: they are too high now I think|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5n isnot too high|pg||
nt|lml: maybe there is a way to make 5NT if they stop there|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5n easy ebuf 3 spades 2 dims 2 hearts 4 clubs even without heart finnese|pg||
nt|lml: if you guess spades|pg||
nt|lml: do they have a way to stop in this auction?|pg||
nt|lml: does 5@S say bid 5NT??|pg||
nt|lml: this is not an auction I use|pg||
nt|lestergold: but in 6 you have to lose a dim aND SPADE IN OTHER WORDS NO WAY IOF COMING TO 12 TRICKS WITHOUT LOSING 2 TRICKS|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ady: east has raised    but this time wisely no double|pg||
nt|jallerton: East has a double diamond stop - news to East until he sees the dummy|pg||
pc|s8|nt|pdjourdain: Now two hearts shows the break|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lestergold: 5@H ABSURD ON 5/2 FIT|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c3|nt|lml: true|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
pc|c7|nt|pdjourdain: declarer has to rely on clubs and goes one off|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lestergold: must lose three tricks at least|pg||
nt|lestergold: on any line|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||
pc|c6|nt|justin c: he knows the @CA is wrong, but nothing else to do|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|petepunt: has @S KQ or KQ3 >|pg||
nt|petepunt: @H|pg||
nt|chick: right, just need to decide if N has Hx or 10x |pg||
nt|petepunt: helps if he had the @D count|pg||
nt|lestergold: its sillier than playing in 6N|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jallerton: still perhaps East considers that West's hearts are not good enough to bid a 3rd time.  Preference to 3@c would be a possibility |pg||

mb|1N|nt|ady: e/w   have around 10 tricks in diamonds|pg||

nt|justin c: @D lead stops 4@S|pg||
nt|petepunt: west thinks it is here :)|pg||
nt|petepunt: it is a good 'tool' to have in your bag:)|pg||
mb|d|nt|justin c: S will x the transfer|pg||
nt|justin c: 3@S now?|pg||
nt|garnetts: I am not convinced that double over a weak notrump should show hearts--OK over a strong no-trump |pg||
nt|justin c: y, can equally play that X is points|pg||
nt|lml: Rixi Marcus was a fine British women player who wrote a book with that name... Bid Boldly Play Safe|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: S showed good restraint vulnerable|pg||
nt|garnetts: How else can you show a hand that wanted to express an opinion about 1NT making |pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Exotic|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|petepunt: points inflation has come into play|pg||
nt|justin c: prob play 3NT here|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: yeah, counting 3 10's as a full HCP :)|pg||
nt|petepunt: not just 10's its the J10 and 1098 combinations too|pg||
nt|chick: the @D8 will be hard to read as a singleton|pg||
nt|garnetts: North might double with two aces--after all partner mentioned he was alive |pg||
nt|justin c: and unnecessary|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: with defensive values 3@S is enough|pg||
nt|lestergold: she was a world ladies champion the greatest lady player of her era|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: momma poppa exchange|pg||
nt|roswolf: poppa takes out a making contract to a non making one|pg||
nt|justin c: this was their hand in 3@S|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: 3@S from West and 3NT by East?|pg||
nt|lestergold: a formideable player by any standards|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jallerton: should South bid his 2nd suit at the 4-level?|pg||
nt|chick: but if N continues the @DQ, they will set this easily|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: and a formideable person as well!|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: nothing dec can do here |pg||
nt|chick: and the Q should suggest a @S back|pg||

pc|s3|nt|pdjourdain: Probable 10 tricks|pg||
nt|justin c: gotta lead something|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Horrible lead for South|pg||
nt|chick: the danger of making a takeout double without the appropriate majors|pg||
nt|chick: luckily the hearts are 3-3|pg||
nt|dohicky: Yes, looks ok|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sA|nt|justin c: @SJ lead might achieve something if some of Wests @S spots were in N|pg||

nt|lml: yes this one has no chance at all|pg||
nt|lml: on the lie of the cards|pg||
nt|lml: not even for Rixi (if she were alive)|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think 1 spade bid free bid on two qs was bonkers|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|pdjourdain: Plenty of options for declarer but all work (e.g. playing on spades or diamonds)|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|nt|lestergold: no preemptive value merely designed to encourage his partner to go wrong|pg||
nt|lml: well you see East knows West does miracles|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|roswolf: west may duck the heart|pg||
nt|lml: he saw the previous hand for one thing|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jallerton: can get a loser away on the @C as West ruffs with a trump trick|pg||
pc|c3|nt|roswolf: in my dreams|pg||
pc|cA|nt|justin c: :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I quite like 3@D over the double to show indicate a lead if they bid to 4H from a  Northerly quarter |pg||
nt|justin c: Pinning singleton @S10/9/8 in E, and finding N with @SA98xx or similar would be nice|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|lestergold: West will need to outperform all previous miracles on this hand|pg||
pc|h4|nt|pdjourdain: spades look better to me|pg||
nt|justin c: (failing horribly on the actual layout of course)|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: should plan for 1 spade, 1 heart and seven minor winners|pg||
nt|chick: needs to set up the spade while he still has a way to it|pg||
nt|justin c: with the @SJ dropping, the @D 3-3 and the @HA in S, he can do no wrong|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||

nt|ady: 109 hearts in north hand  and club holding of AJ  very good for a heart contract|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: if he balanced with 3@D  surely east will try 3NT|pg||
nt|jallerton: probably just clarifying the NS methods: 2@h can be 5-4 either way round|pg||

nt|petepunt: will need care with @C posotion in 6@H|pg||
pc|s9|nt|chick: again, 2@D shows hearts|pg||
nt|chick: have to admit, I'd bid 1@S with the N hand ... all those 10s, 9s, and 8s make up for a missing HCP or 2|pg||
pc|sK|nt|pdjourdain: They play my invention of 14-16 NT in 3rd and 4th seat, weak 1st and 2nd|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: specs have pointed out that on last hand a heart lead beats it by virtue of cutting off declarer from the clubs|pg||
nt|lml: yes I was just looking at that|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|ady: england extend lead   got 11 imps on hand 11 when ireland went down 2 in 4 hearts and england played 3NT making 10 tricks|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@s control showing: an ace and a king, or three kings|pg||
nt|jallerton: presumably South can just bid 4@h now|pg||
nt|petepunt: may ruff 3@D in South and rev dummy|pg||
nt|chick: E is happy to defend @Ss|pg||
nt|petepunt: y and 2N a 4 card raise i @S|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|pc|h3|nt|justin c: goig to be close|pg||
nt|justin c: @HA and another?|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: 3@D shows small doubleton with big heart support|pg||
nt|garnetts: maybe no club ruff now |pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|jallerton: Does 4@C agree @h?  Maybe it does, as South could have responded 2NT to show "any 6-card suit"|pg||
nt|roswolf: this also looks crazy bidding by the english but if you live by the sword occasionally you die by it|pg||
nt|chick: wonder what they play 5@S to show|pg||
nt|justin c: it is a pretty awful idea to break a @H transfer to 3@D unless you have a hand where responder shoulud declare|pg||
nt|dohicky: I'd definately be tempted too|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|nt|ady: 5@S?|pg||
nt|ady: Ireland got 12 imps back on hand 12   found 4@H  when england went down in 3@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzdt: S believes 4n agreed clubs|pg||
pc|c2|nt|roswolf: but you can also triumph|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|chick: oh, never mind, @H is trump, not spades :)|pg||
nt|petepunt: think it needs a @D lead let through|pg||
nt|chick: so EW will get 2 hearts, and if E ducks a spade smoothly, maybe 3 @Ss|pg||
nt|lml: okay I double dare anybody to beat this one|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|jallerton: to make 6@c he'll need to start with the Q from hand, then take another finesse on the 2nd round|pg||
nt|justin c: this would be a good time to play trumps|pg||
nt|garnetts: struck me that way too--|pg||
nt|lestergold: easy|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|petepunt: may lack 1 entry for dummy rev|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|pc|dA|nt|lestergold: pointy a gun at declarer's head play spade and order him to duck it etc|pg||
nt|lml: like that|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|roswolf: should be -1 i think now|pg||
pc|s7|nt|justin c: for one of the stranger flat boards|pg||
nt|lml: the operator illustrated it for you|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jallerton: looks like the natural line as he'll be in the North hand anyway: pay off to stiff K in West|pg||
nt|ady: looks like going down now|pg||
pc|c6|nt|pdjourdain: usually partner can re-transfer at the same level|pg||
nt|justin c: could always use a 2NT break to show a doubleton @D, if u are that way inclined|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|d8|pc|dT|pg||
nt|ady: queen first though would also lose to stiff king with east|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jallerton: I don't see the advantage of low to the J|pg||
pc|sA|pc|h4|pc|c8|pg||
nt|chick: I think he can cash a club, pitch a club, ruff a club then draw trump|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|pc|hJ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes -2 but -1 dd before that card|pg||
nt|chick: as they say, no double no trouble|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|pc|c7|nt|jallerton: but stiff 4 and stiff 5 in West twice as likely|pg||
nt|jallerton: as stiff K in East|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|chick: pinpoint defense, well done|pg||

nt|roswolf: where was the irish axe|pg||
nt|chick: nice and safe :)|pg||
nt|chick: I'm sure E ruffed that last @D trick|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: However, given a narrow win for Wales in this 32 boards and a good win for the Rep against NI, the gap |pg||
nt|justin c: @S better than @H here|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: between Eng and the Rep narrows|pg||
nt|vugraphzdt: Because boards reversed I can't score at present both boards|pg||
nt|justin c: needs S to be declarer tho, or a @C lead through the @CK|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: final match starts at 3.10pm and still everything to play for|pg||
nt|justin c: another round 5:35|pg||
nt|chick: GMT?|pg||
nt|justin c: y|pg||
nt|chick: so 1 hour from now, and 3.5 hours from now|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: In trophy matches: Scot beat Wales, Wales beat Rep, and Rep beat Eng and Scot, Eng beat Scot and NI|pg||
nt|justin c: y|pg||
nt|justin c: 5@S by N, 6@S by S|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: Good result for England in the other room|pg||
nt|ady: very swingy set     england got 11 imps on hand 13 when dixon went down 1 in 2 hearts   england made 3NT in OR|pg||
nt|petepunt: E would have over ruffed if he had exited with a @C tho'|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Yes, and then the suit below becomes the max break|pg||
nt|chick: 2 hands to go at this table|pg||
mb|1N|nt|chick: NS play weak NT in 1st/2nd seat,  ACOL 4 card majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: unswung Geoff, unswung|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: :|pg||
nt|justin c: 2NT leb, trying to play 3@H|pg||
nt|lml: you want to avoid the heart slam here, where the heart break will probably defeat declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Seems to be helpful to the defence when they know about xx in a side suit |pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: well NI did well to make 6n in open it doesnt look too healthy with the hearts 4/1|pg||
nt|lml: are you allowed to bid hearts with hearts over notrump?|pg||
nt|lestergold: otherwise its a great contract and they certainly did well to bid it|pg||
nt|lestergold: and it was right sided|pg||
pc|h2|nt|chick: I would imagine XX shows extras, inviting|pg||
nt|justin c: 'aces' hand, rather than positional values i guess|pg||
nt|lestergold: i wonder how it was made|pg||
nt|lml: yes 6NT from West is much better than 6@H from East|pg||
nt|chick: duck this heart and he has few worries|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jallerton: dbl shows a penalty double of @d|pg||
nt|jallerton: a matterof agreement what @s holding it promises|pg||
nt|ady: dixon double shows penalty pass of 2 diamonds and cards to compete|pg||
nt|ady: south likely 3@H|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|justin c: N might X when that comes back to him, or W might raise to 4@H regardless|pg||
nt|lml: although many people would transfer with the east hand|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jallerton: I rather like 2NT|pg||
nt|jallerton: running scores at http://www.bridgewebs.com/cgi-bin/bwmb/display.cgi?pid=display_page5&club=bangorholidaycongress&sessid=266715925403045|pg||
pc|h5|nt|justin c: why is this not making?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|garnetts: J@S led in the OR |pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ady: this not likely to go well|pg||
nt|justin c: did i predict something that actually happened?|pg||
nt|justin c: (weird)|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|nt|lestergold: hm Garvey led ten of hearts giving game away perhaps|pg||
nt|lml: in the OR West made it when North ducked everything and was eventually endplayed to lead a spade|pg||
pc|d4|nt|justin c: 4@H risky now - maybe push NS into 4@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: just shows your maturing judgment|pg||
nt|lestergold: thats how ok|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|justin c: lol|pg||
nt|golfsquash: At the other table north ducked an early J@c lead after hearts didn't break. Then declarer read the ending correctly.|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h9|nt|justin c: just saw the play at the other table |pg||
nt|lestergold: a case of ouit for a duck'segg|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ady: surely better to not play A@S first round|pg||
nt|lml: there might always be a squeeze though, if you play for one|pg||
nt|lml: NOrth has to hold the majors even if he takes the club|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|h3|nt|garnetts: has nothing to recommend it does it|pg||
nt|lml: as long as 2 hearts arent played early|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: well a massive swing here for NI|pg||
nt|lml: which they will be|pg||
pc|s6|nt|chick: I can't see making this with the holey trump suit ... will have to lose 3 trumps|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is doomed too|pg||
nt|justin c: i see 6 trump tricks and a couble of @C|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sQ|pc|s5|nt|lestergold: 14 imps|pg||
nt|lml: well obviously this has no chance|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|nt|lml: yes does that make it a tie?|pg||
nt|lml: no it gives N. Ireland the lead|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jallerton: Yes, but peraps hoping to gain the lead in @H|pg||
nt|chick: sorta turnabout from the previous hand :)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|justin c: the other two tricks are more enigmatic|pg||
nt|lml: and the only other comparison missing is good for them|pg||
pc|cA|nt|chick: or maybe only 2 :)|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cT|pc|c5|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|nt|justin c: seems to bet on a parlay - Even if the @SK was in N, still off when it is tripleton and S with the @DA, where playing S for it is 5-3 on|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ady: must be better to keep communications by letting the K@S win first round|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Good swing to Wales|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|justin c: nothing 'good' about it patrick :)|pg||
nt|dohicky: Looks like a flat board alright|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|jallerton: I agree|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Scoring break after Board 16 restart 12.25 British time|pg||

mb|1C!|nt|justin c: 5@D seems kinda high...|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: so this 32 board match is very close now|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes they failed to follow the well known principlethat when you have two apprently solid long suits its better to play in no trumps in case one doesnt break|pg||
nt|lestergold: as well as right siding the declaration|pg||
nt|dohicky: Missed a pass I think|pg||
mb|1S|nt|roswolf: scheduld re start in 40 mins|pg||

mb|d|nt|ady: thx all    a very swing set     england made 3@SX last hand another large swing|pg||
nt|chick: Thanks to our very excellent vugraph operator, Helen Cole, great job Helen!! :)|pg||

nt|lestergold: well you were on  great formurself Linda!!|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jallerton: 2nd half  of the match coming up in 20 minutes from now|pg||
nt|lml: now East really doesnt have much is he really going to bid 6?|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course non vul opps trying to throw the odd spanner into the works|pg||
nt|lml: the @HK is likely worthless|pg||
nt|lml: he has been the big bidder all day so I think he will step up|pg||
nt|lml: a real pressure bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: in open the NI pair had plenty of information exchan ge no intereference|pg||
nt|lml: West really has a huge hand ... really too much for a one bid in the first place|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2c opener mnorth couldnt inetrfere over that|pg||
nt|lml: with the length of the pause West can hardly bid 6 over 5|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|ady: another mis fit|pg||
nt|jallerton: England did well to stop in 2@s in other room|pg||
nt|justin c: if your mental equilibrium is of value to you, do not look at the auction in the other room|pg||
nt|petepunt: 1n is 15-17 on 3rd pos vuln, hence 1@h|pg||
mb|6D|nt|chick: a very conservative contract, especially vul|pg||
nt|justin c: losing the first 9|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: see you in an hour's time for the final match|pg||
nt|justin c: expensive habit this, vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: Crouch/Patterson play a strong @c system, so West was able to show a distributional hand without huge strength|pg||
nt|petepunt: tx all,  will have right boards on bbo form the start on sunday!|pg||
nt|chick: hehehe|pg||
nt|chick: Peter will see to it personally :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: 2N is 11-poor 14 i suspect|pg||
nt|chick: W doesn't have much to work with here|pg||
nt|petepunt: entries not easy to set up @D|pg||
nt|chick: a hand of aces and small cards is not much use at 3N, despite the point count|pg||
nt|chick: I don't think he can get more than the 2 top diamonds|pg||
nt|petepunt: lack of 10,9's and 8's is unusual|pg||
nt|chick: only 2 spade tricks, 1 club, 3 hearts ... I don't see much hope for a 9th trick|pg||
nt|chick: 13th club possible|pg||
nt|garnetts: hard to avoid leading that card |pg||
nt|garnetts: srry thought he led a spade --better lead than i would have found|pg||
nt|dohicky: bit of tilt I feel|pg||
nt|dohicky: *of a|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 1@H    1NT    2@S   all pass in OR|pg||
nt|lml: East did step up...well done East!!|pg||
nt|lml: and in a very thoughtful way.  I am not sure I would have thought of 4NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: director called ??|pg||
nt|golfsquash: trump lead best|pg||
pc|sK|nt|roswolf: yes a little surreal|pg||
nt|lml: well one could argue that the length of time for the 4NT bid influenced WEst but I think West has her bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm ducking the Kd could make this hand awakward|pg||
pc|sA|nt|golfsquash: yes|pg||
pc|s2|nt|petepunt: worth considering using 2@D as 8-10 with 3@H by a passed hand. :)|pg||
nt|petepunt: fav lie of cards here|pg||
nt|justin c: just @DK here or|pg||
nt|justin c: no time to finish that thought :)|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|jallerton: playing Acol, perhaps West should content himself with 2@h over 1NT|pg||
nt|justin c: my 'mature' judgment sees five @H and five @C for dec |pg||
nt|roswolf: ah but in which order?|pg||
nt|justin c: unless of course he goes and ruffs the third @D high, but I dont think he will do that|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|justin c: @H first Geoff, @H first|pg||
nt|petepunt: but too slow |pg||
pc|dA|nt|justin c: (safety play)|pg||
nt|chick: Yes, will make overtricks and regret not bidding 3 :)|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|jallerton: but you can see how game might be making if partner has the right high cards|pg||
nt|lestergold: now??|pg||
nt|lestergold: brown cow??|pg||
nt|lml: hook the spade :)... not really|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: this is down 2  so some imps for england|pg||

pc|h2|nt|chick: Thanks Peter!  Thanks to everyone, see you again soon :)|pg||

nt|lestergold: was robbed!|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
