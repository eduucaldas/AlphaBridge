nt|chick: S is already thinking slam here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's a handicap event, so the underdogs, the OS.se team, has a 20 IMP advantage in the first set|pg||
mb|1D!|an|0-7|mb|p|mb|1N|an|18-20NT|mb|p|nt|lestergold: so cautious bidders lucky day|pg||

nt|lestergold: as 2@s avaialble to shopw a good raise which of course north has|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|peachy: I would tend to agree, in competition weak|pg||

mb|2H!|nt|Walddk2: The underdogs won't lose on this board|pg||

nt|santyclz: 6@h doesn't have any pitfalls, 6@ss is in danger if the defense starts with 2 rounds of @cs.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: Welcome back to the 2nd session of 4 from this semifinal. In the other semifinal, the favourite team San Sac made a impressive 56-7 against Lirarna. Lirarna had 14IMP as a ...|pg||

pc|h6|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s3|nt|chick: if E could both make dummy ruff AND lead a heart to knock out entry, then it might be tougher, but he can do only one of those|pg||
pc|h7|nt|santyclz: Defense would be so much easier if they would let us lead 2 suits at the same time.  Maybe we should write a letter.|pg||
nt|chick: nah, if it were changed, then someone would want 3|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: it would be easier to be declarer if you could play two suits at the same time too.. I always seem to run out of entries for my finesses.. :)|pg||

mb|2H!|nt|peachy: EW headed for 3NT|pg||

pc|c5|nt|Walddk4: Linköping is the main city in the county of Östergötland in southern Sweden with around 100,000 inhabitants|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 2NT was most likely forcing with support|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|lestergold: probably will make @d lead un,likely natural to play club finesse for J thru north etc|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk2: Staffan, how do they figure out how many IMPs the weaker team gets in advance?|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade most likely|pg||

nt|h_karluk: hey y'all, gl everybody|pg||

nt|chick: Merhaba Hamdi :)|pg||

pc|h5|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i am not a system maker, however at first glance seemed a bit wide HCP range|pg||
nt|chick: they are playing a precision-like strong 1@C 17+|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|d5|nt|lestergold: clear cut overtake of diamond not that it makes any odds now|pg||
pc|d6|pg||

mb|d|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: I wonder where NS's big @C starts?  In last set opened a flat 17 with 11S|pg||
nt|othered1: 1@S|pg||
nt|peachy: in the other Room, S opened.  I would also|pg||
nt|othered1: A big @C system is supposed to let you open all shapely 2.5 honor trick hands, I think.|pg||
nt|peachy: perhaps 1D  covers 1-4-4-4 hands?|pg||
mb|4D|nt|ralfwil: I don´t like D on S with a void in @h a good @d and only 4 small spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: Maybe that the opening would be in an ambiguous @D influenced south|pg||

nt|bucheister: there are those hands|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|santyclz: The open room has lapped us.|pg||
nt|chick: 2C 2N should find them the spade slam easily enough|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Grand slam you mean|pg||
nt|chick: hey, we get to see other table results for a change :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: should be aflattie tho|pg||
nt|lestergold: even  spade lead wont help much|pg||
mb|1N|an|6-9 no 4cM OR 16+ without any good suit|nt|Walddk4: Very disappointing that a strong club top pair did not bid it next door|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: and Mats Nilsland will be playing for Sweden seniors at the European Teams Championships this summer. Good luck to him!|pg||
mb|2D|nt|chick: yes, Roland, easy to set up clubs for a heart pitch|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D!|nt|nilsland:  thx |pg||
nt|ralfwil: On a @s lead to @sJ S should play @sA, not the @sQ|pg||
nt|bucheister: Would be a great time to win the J with the A|pg||
nt|peachy: maybe this would be time to win the spade with ace.... since diamond finesse needed into W|pg||
nt|lestergold: we can predict play win cash top dim enter dummy with club take @d fionesse and then west has no chopice but to switch to a heart|pg||
nt|peachy: heh, you gues are faster typists|pg||
nt|santyclz: My kind of grand.  No finesses, only 1 line and it works.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H!|nt|nilsland:  More exciting if East had ventured 3 NT|pg||
nt|nilsland:  would south find the diamond lead|pg||
nt|chick: but such a perfect fit is not always easy to uncover|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: Staffan, east relative of Johan, any idea ? |pg||
mb|3S!|mb|p|nt|chick: now makes perfect sense, simple Jacoby/Stenberg 2N|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: hmm have no idea actually :)|pg||
mb|4C|nt|daman: maybe after laying down the @H Ace|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Very strong team. Morath-Flodqvist (Tjolpe), Nilsland-Dahlberg and Bjerregaard-Gullberg. They would have done very well in the Open event I am sure|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Now heart ace is not so good|pg||
nt|daman: nope|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: anything but a @H|pg||
nt|daman: clearly 3@S was not forcing|pg||
nt|nilsland:  This will be a good board for the underdogs|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
mb|4S|mb|d|nt|h_karluk: i wonder on the way grand or just slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|chick: think they can find the grand, hamdi?|pg||
nt|chick: NS has been very solid so far today|pg||
nt|chick: if 3@H showed shortness (specifically), then should bid them again to show void|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|bucheister: Catholic grade school with nuns|pg||
nt|peachy: aah, they made you learn it|pg||
nt|ralfwil: bad presence at table again!|pg||
nt|lestergold: curwest  an see he has to get busy and hope for the hearts|pg||
nt|ralfwil: as @sJ denies @s10.....|pg||
nt|lestergold: but his pard's blood pressure rising as tank goes on|pg||
nt|lestergold: he can see that if he doesnt find some fast tricks then declarer is likely home|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
nt|chick: a grand has to be in @Ds, not enough tricks in NT|pg||
nt|chick: (not to mention no heart stopper) :)|pg||
mb|7D|nt|santyclz: Did e ever get to show a long solid suit?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: he showed 6+ @S|pg||
nt|santyclz: When designing a system you should give thought to "out of the box" bids that show specific holding types.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: curtains well defended|pg||
nt|peachy: wd|pg||
nt|chick: well done NS!|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Houston, eagle landed|pg||
nt|chick: claim at trick 1 :)|pg||

pc|s5|pc|sA|pc|s9|pc|s3|pg||
nt|ralfwil: another nice play is that after @sQ play a small towards dummy|pg||
nt|chick: I blame W for not finding 7, she can see everything she needs to count to 13 tricks ... only danger I can see is 3 small clubs with partner and no 2-2 split|pg||
nt|chick: ruff 2 spades (all trumps are high), draw trump, and pitch last spade on club ... time to claim|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Very unlucky, it's a 95% slam, roughly|pg||
nt|othered1: aThe stiff @D devalues south's hand slightly, but it still has enough extras to push on.|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: maybe they will avoid the trap by peeking :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: as you can cope with all 4 with West|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The correct play in spades is the queen first|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Many get that wrong and they never notice|pg||
nt|Walddk2: because it usually does not matter|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|lestergold: ah too quick with his enormolus hand |pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: spade  support, better than 2sp|pg||
nt|h_karluk: nowadays 20-20 layouts rare, we may see an elegant solution|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  You have to learn it "the hard way"|pg||
nt|lestergold: if west has shown a good raise in spades then east should beexploring because his hand becomes enormous|pg||
nt|peachy: if he went to game, might as well have splintered or done something|pg||
mb|p|pc|c7|nt|h_karluk: interesting lead from KJx tenace|pg||
pc|c2|nt|othered1: south will have to push this the rest of the way|pg||

pc|cT|nt|nilsland:  Now  south know the heart ace is missing|pg||
nt|nilsland:  since N didnt cuebid 4 H|pg||
nt|nilsland:  And East will surely lead hearts...|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|chick: this could even make an overtrick, because diamonds can be set up pretty easily|pg||
nt|h_karluk: perhaps a passive trump trick would more safe|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|nt|nilsland:  man or mouse? Man - it seems|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder if north's 4@C control bid was forced or whether it implies slam interest (good trumps are a plus).|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lestergold: club splinter cant cost|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk2: The fact that the 9 is with AK makes the slam 5% better, from 90 to 95% (half of the 4-0 breaks)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: Let's see what Eklund does|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Barrling rather|pg||

mb|p|nt|chick: pretty soon, it will be transfer openings, and then no one will be able to bid the suits they have :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|lestergold: it was a long auction to 7 in the open|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Mats will tell you all about wriggling if they get doubled in 1NT :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: not bidding the grand would be resignimng time i think|pg||
nt|rodal f: Let's see how EWs minorsystem works|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: He is the man behind Nilsland's Slinkningar, an escape system when 1NT gets doubled|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|santyclz: Re-hi folks.  Lost my conn for a few moments.|pg||
nt|chick: an aceless 10 HCP plus a void is hardly worth two takeout doubles|pg||
nt|chick: we missed you, Joe :)|pg||
nt|chick: everyone was getting totally bored with just me :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: if East would have passed, as I think he should have, South may pass 3@C D|pg||
nt|frankaus: not real well but its a difficult hand for most systems|pg||
nt|rodal f: Would it been better with 2@S from E at the 1NT?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: definitly 2@S would have been better if they play like that|pg||
pc|c4|nt|daman: that was a heavy 1@H overcall|pg||
nt|chick: hehe|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: I bid 1NT - 2@S - something - 3@D with hands like Easts|pg||
pc|c5|nt|daman: and South found a reason not to raise|pg||
nt|othered1: off shape for a double and wrong for 1N, 1@H looks normal, if you choose to act at all|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|daman: why do you feel it is offshape?|pg||
nt|santyclz: S didn't his 4@c?  Mercy rule in effect?|pg||
nt|santyclz: (hit)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: I don´t think he expected a pass from his p|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: combined 28 count have to bid well to reach the grand|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|rodal f: Belive they don't. Might something for them to discuss|pg||
pc|d7|nt|daman: 3424|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|nt|lestergold: perfecto no wasted hands fit like hand and glove|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: South that is.. :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|peachy: After GF spade raise, S has all suits sontrolled first or second round. Even if N hadn't South still would|pg||
nt|lestergold: well another 13 imps into the bottomless pit|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but they still have tio be confident of 13 tricks controls are only part of the story|pg||
pc|d5|nt|peachy: the first part, yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: first three bids same in open room then the auctions took different directions|pg||
nt|lestergold: and sadly  a differfent destination|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c7|pg||
pc|dT|nt|othered1: OK, perhaps sub-optimal shape for a double|pg||
nt|daman: well   4414 would be ideal I suppose|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s8|pc|c6|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lestergold: thios is where you pray that west is the one to show out on the spades|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: We do not live in an ideal world. You've got to bid the cards you are dealt|pg||
nt|santyclz: Whoa, OS:se gained 10 imps while I was gone!  (OS:se supporters, I do take bribes...)|pg||
pc|sT|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|nilsland:  If you are waiting for an ideal hand you wil have to pass most of the time|pg||
nt|daman: exactly|pg||
pc|cK|pc|s2|pc|c3|nt|lestergold: should be fined for slow claims|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|chick: OS.se isn't doing well at all, but they are hanging in pretty well and trying, not going nuts with silly swing bids|pg||
pc|cT|pc|s3|pc|cJ|nt|daman: I would have doubled 1@D with the North hand|pg||

mb|1C!|mb|1H|nt|Walddk2: Diabolical trump break in a spade contract|pg||
nt|Walddk2: All other suits well placed|pg||
nt|othered1: routine 4@S here.  trump split will cause a problem here.  3N is very good and maybe interference will lead NS to it.|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|peachy: WWith 4-3-3-3 and H stop N might suggest NT|pg||

mb|2H!|an|17+|nt|nilsland:  EW also have to win by at least 17 imps :)|pg||

nt|lestergold: now east will come seriously alive|pg||
