nt|kiwibridge: hi Hans and welcome everyone|pg||
nt|sybarra: Good afternoon everyone and welcome back to Linköping in Sweden for the District Championship. Nine rounds of 24-board matches. This is the first half of a match from round 8|pg||

nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone @H@H|pg||
nt|chick: S is already thinking slam here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's a handicap event, so the underdogs, the OS.se team, has a 20 IMP advantage in the first set|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|rnmalik: Hi Gary, Haans welcome|pg||
nt|sybarra: daylight time in effect here, so short 1 hour of sleep|pg||
mb|d|mb|3C|nt|josj: gm all|pg||
nt|haans: looks like an easy 4@H|pg||
nt|josj: and gm Hans, Gary and Rashed :)|pg||
nt|josj: maybe good afternoon to Rashed :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: so cautious bidders lucky day|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont know their methods but 3@h should be a weak bid in most modern styles|pg||
nt|peachy: I think S will pass, no shape|pg||
nt|lestergold: as 2@s avaialble to shopw a good raise which of course north has|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 9pm here :)|pg||
nt|josj: gm all again|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good morning all.|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: I would tend to agree, in competition weak|pg||
nt|josj: sorry Gary :)|pg||
nt|haans: Multi has been around for many years but ...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Good Morning Jos, net speed is slightly slow today:)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lestergold: south should pass whatever the 3@h bid means|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 01.00 PM at my end|pg||
mb|4C|nt|Walddk2: The underdogs won't lose on this board|pg||
nt|lestergold: and has but we must remember that in general not bidding 50 ish percedntage vul games is not a winning strategy|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello again!|pg||
nt|peachy: it happens to be makeable|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello Ralf|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes of course diamodntakes care of a  spade|pg||

mb|4S|nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgefederation.se/filbyter_bridge/resultat/fc10/fc_main_en.htm  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|daman: normal contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 2@S say pass with spades  but i have hearts|pg||
nt|josj: yes that's what it should say|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Usually game interest the way we play it in NZ|pg||
nt|josj: and it did...for W at least, that is|pg||
nt|sybarra: even I would find the 2 @H bi,  nothing else to bid with S |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well it wont surprise me if game is bid in the open|pg||
nt|santyclz: 6@h doesn't have any pitfalls, 6@ss is in danger if the defense starts with 2 rounds of @cs.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: Welcome back to the 2nd session of 4 from this semifinal. In the other semifinal, the favourite team San Sac made a impressive 56-7 against Lirarna. Lirarna had 14IMP as a ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: handicap, but that´s gone already|pg||
nt|chick: hello Everyone :)|pg||
nt|josj: hi Mike|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@S likely transfer to clubs, 2NT accepting with good clubs |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hi Jos|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 2@S = clubs, 2NT = accepting|pg||
nt|josj: yep|pg||
mb|p|pc|dA|nt|mdgraham: all up to East here|pg||
nt|chick: EW getting too brave, maybe no respect for weak NTs :)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: 12 was flat. 4@S -1½ in the other room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: minus 1|pg||
nt|lestergold: soemtimes game declared by north beaten out of hand on spade lead then|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|peachy: This event has teams handicapped as I understand|pg||
pc|dK|nt|chick: theoretical danger, but not as the cards lie, I think|pg||
nt|santyclz: Right.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kiwibridge: ?|pg||
nt|haans: counted right|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lestergold: not everyone plays 4 card majors|pg||
nt|peachy: NS here are the underdogs|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|josj: once W failed...|pg||
pc|cK|nt|santyclz: 3/3 @ds solve any potential problms.|pg||
nt|chick: 3-2 hearts :)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|santyclz: That too.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|pg||
nt|josj: declarer can make it now but he does not know|pg||
pc|c6|nt|chick: if E could both make dummy ruff AND lead a heart to knock out entry, then it might be tougher, but he can do only one of those|pg||
nt|haans: right|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|santyclz: Defense would be so much easier if they would let us lead 2 suits at the same time.  Maybe we should write a letter.|pg||
nt|chick: nah, if it were changed, then someone would want 3|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: it would be easier to be declarer if you could play two suits at the same time too.. I always seem to run out of entries for my finesses.. :)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||
pc|h6|nt|vugraphzpx: quick starting board, trying to keep themselves ahead of the other table :)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|nt|Walddk2: Frissan's 17 IMPs are handicap points, the lesser ranked team against a higher ranked|pg||

nt|brolucius: I remembered it was Sweden too, so I should have known.|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  That was an inelegant play by N. He does not want W to play the @hK, so should lead small, not the J|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|henryb:  more grands|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: We are in Linköping in the county of Östergötland in southern Sweden. 5th largest city in Sweden with around 150,000 inhabitants|pg||
mb|1S!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/league/division.php?action=view&id=2520  for standings after round 7|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|brolucius: Roland would have been annoyed if West had bid 1@D on that hand.|pg||
nt|henryb:  cold in @h. the power of the 4-4 fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: only grand in @H|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: it doesn't look like hearts are going to be bid naturally |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Acolites may get to hearts. Don't they open 1@H with that South hand?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|henryb:  they used to. Nowadays many of them, even, open 1@c|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Not easy for them to judge that hearts is better, since from North's point of view the @HJ might be missing and there could be a heart discard available somewhere.|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|henryb:  I don't know a standard auction that will find @h|pg||

nt|ralfwil: but after @hQ it was too late|pg||
nt|peachy: right|pg||
nt|chick: my guess is that Bd1 will be flat|pg||
nt|chick: missing a game is not a great start|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: In  this semifinal, OS.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: .se had 20IMP in handicap at the start, but after a tough session Team Zang is now in the lead |pg||
nt|josj: and keeping us busy|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 6red suit here can they find that|pg||
nt|josj: so Zang likely to further increase their lead|pg||
nt|daman: tah dah|pg||
nt|lml: good morning|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: NS play 2-way PASS (0-7 or 17+) so be ready for some weird-looking bids|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: EW headed for 3NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w have a chance in 3N on a non diamond lead|pg||
nt|josj: what's wrong with a grand?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: slam time and grand |pg||
nt|mdgraham: leading partner's suit is easy. West might very well have led a spade, holding a singleton heart, but when you do not lead partner's suit you have to be right |pg||
nt|chick: Hi Linda|pg||
mb|p!|nt|peachy: which might make from W|pg||
nt|chick: this one, on the other hand .... :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Happy International Womens Day, Cornelia, specs of the female persuation and all the ships at sea.|pg||
nt|daman: looks like 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: not a lot :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|chick: Thank you, Joe :)|pg||
nt|haans: may be to hard to find this slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|peachy: unless diamonds shown somehow by S|pg||
nt|josj: also very true...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: NS play 1@C 17+|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it could be said that there is a good case for a spade lead, as hearts are unlikely to run, but again, not particularly easy at the table  |pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|chick: not sure what 2N asked, but they found their way to a makeable contract|pg||
nt|haans: all cards working|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Linköping is the main city in the county of Östergötland in southern Sweden with around 100,000 inhabitants|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 2NT was most likely forcing with support|pg||
mb|3D|nt|lestergold: probably will make @d lead un,likely natural to play club finesse for J thru north etc|pg||
nt|pelu: 23-level looks like max - so fight on 3-level :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 1@D 0+, 1@H/@S 5+|pg||
nt|josj: too high for either side, the 3-level here|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Staffan, how do they figure out how many IMPs the weaker team gets in advance?|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade most likely|pg||
nt|lml: hearts is actually the best spot if you can find it|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: NS in a elay sequence|pg||
nt|lml: 7@H is pretty darn good|pg||
mb|3S|nt|santyclz: @h10?|pg||
nt|chick: nice lead, but not obvious to S I suspect|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hey y'all, gl everybody|pg||
nt|chick: 2@H was showing 2 suits?|pg||
nt|sybarra: 9 off the top here |pg||
nt|sybarra: and probably one more in the slush |pg||
nt|daman: yep toppers     but 4@H looks better|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpx: Think so, 5-4 at least and a decent opening hand for a 11-16|pg||
nt|chick: Merhaba Hamdi :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: *relay|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk2: There is probably a formula|pg||
nt|peachy: high from dummy and start clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 7@D better contract|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure its as easy to get there |pg||
nt|Walddk4: We also have Tobias Bende with us. He is an expert on the N-S methods, pass = 0-7 or any 17+. But he he will explain I am sure|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome Tobia|pg||
nt|Walddk4: s|pg||
nt|lml: 2@S shows 5+@s and 4@H|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Tobias, thanks for helping out :)|pg||
nt|lml: welcome Tobias and thanks for the information about the auction|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Always nice to start with a grand|pg||
nt|lml: this may be the best type of system to find it|pg||
nt|lml: in a lot of systems once you find the spade fit its hard to go back|pg||
nt|lml: a more standard auction might start 1@C-1@S|pg||
nt|bende:  3@d = 5422 (or 7411)|pg||
nt|lml: now if South jump shift into hearts that might get there|pg||
nt|bende:  3@s must have been a weak relay. 1@s showed 8-16.|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|peachy: well, I would have:)|pg||
nt|pelu: some would open 1NT in S - and then 2@S from East - passed out|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well hes going to make it whether or not that was the best start|pg||
nt|santyclz: Suggested (to me) by the 97x in dummy.|pg||
nt|lml: all this technology to miss the grand|pg||
nt|lml: one thinks there must have been some bid between 4@H and 6@H|pg||
nt|bende:  Hmm.. I don't know what went wrong. They should be able to find this.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|h_karluk: i am not a system maker, however at first glance seemed a bit wide HCP range|pg||
nt|chick: they are playing a precision-like strong 1@C 17+|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cT|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: clear cut overtake of diamond not that it makes any odds now|pg||
pc|h5|nt|h_karluk: very good|pg||
nt|sybarra: we may be in a cashing mode |pg||
pc|h2|nt|haans: well done i say|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: as often 7 becomes too hard to reach|pg||
nt|josj: it looks as if S might have bid 5@D rather than 5@H|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kiwibridge: 5@D instead of 4@H may have helped|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|nilsland:  There has been a qualification, maybe that has decided the handicap|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it is always odd, on hands like this, that players are so, so reluctant to defend  |pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphzpx: E-W is playing 2-way club, either 11-13BAL or 17+|pg||
nt|chick: now 2 spades and a high crossruff|pg||
nt|haans: yeah but 4@H = nothing extra|pg||
pc|h7|nt|josj: in that case, 5@D stands out once N goes on|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: KQ@D looks a bit extra after slam try by pard|pg||
nt|josj: over 4@H|pg||
pc|h6|nt|daman: making good use of the cards|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|pc|hQ|nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgefederation.se/filbyter_bridge/resultat/fc10/fc_main_en.htm  for the tournament website|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bende:  4@h shows 5 controls (A=2, K=1)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|haans: agree 5@H for cue |pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: heated discussion NS|pg||
mc|13|nt|josj: not enough trumps to compete at the 3-level, the Law says|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|mdgraham: although at the other table North seemed to be able to bid hearts naturally  |pg||
mb|d!|nt|brolucius: It could still be difficult after a start of 1@H - 1@S - 3@S, say, to get back to hearts. That type of hand is very difficult to judge.|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|henryb:  looks like E-W can make some @d|pg||
nt|mdgraham: quite so|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H!|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|d|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Is there any need for North to introduce spades if partner opens 1@H, David?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can't he just bid a game-foring 2NT showing 4-card support?|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: It depends how convincing your 2NT follow-up's are. There is some use in showing your longest side suit, so partner can evaluate the fit.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|henryb:  partner's spade holding may be critical, so bidding 1@s might be right, of better, 2@s in my opinion|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that lead won't paralyse declarer|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|pc|h2|pg||
nt|henryb:  is that right agter N discourages @h so vehemently?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Even if the @H8 is discouraging (reverse-attitude), South may think: 'Declarer would have won if he held the ace.'|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: should be aflattie tho|pg||
nt|lestergold: even  spade lead wont help much|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|Walddk4: Very disappointing that a strong club top pair did not bid it next door|pg||
nt|haans: none play 1@D first and then jump any more. Does anyone?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: and Mats Nilsland will be playing for Sweden seniors at the European Teams Championships this summer. Good luck to him!|pg||

nt|bucheister: Would be a great time to win the J with the A|pg||
nt|peachy: maybe this would be time to win the spade with ace.... since diamond finesse needed into W|pg||

nt|santyclz: My kind of grand.  No finesses, only 1 line and it works.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: That hand with both majors is special|pg||
nt|chick: I'm curious, Tobias, if they pass with 17+ and need 8+ to open, how do they handle hands like 24+?   Pass and hope pard has 8?|pg||
nt|bende:  1@d=8-16 nebulous|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  More exciting if East had ventured 3 NT|pg||
nt|nilsland:  would south find the diamond lead|pg||
nt|chick: but such a perfect fit is not always easy to uncover|pg||
nt|sybarra: close eyes and hold breath......after @H's cashed |pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: Staffan, east relative of Johan, any idea ? |pg||
nt|sybarra: just ask is k of spades on side,  and next |pg||
nt|bende:  After pass they play 1@c=0-7/17+ and other bids 8-16.|pg||
nt|chick: thanks :)|pg||
nt|bende:  pass-1@c; 1@d=0-7 and others show 17+|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lml: I wonder what East-west are playing over that.  I might have bid if I were East|pg||
pc|dT|nt|chick: now makes perfect sense, simple Jacoby/Stenberg 2N|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: hmm have no idea actually :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|daman: maybe after laying down the @H Ace|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Very strong team. Morath-Flodqvist (Tjolpe), Nilsland-Dahlberg and Bjerregaard-Gullberg. They would have done very well in the Open event I am sure|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Now heart ace is not so good|pg||
nt|daman: nope|pg||
nt|josj: lucky layout for EW in @S amply compensated by bad @C break|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|daman: anything but a @H|pg||
nt|daman: clearly 3@S was not forcing|pg||
nt|nilsland:  This will be a good board for the underdogs|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
pc|h3|nt|josj: wd by N|pg||
nt|pelu: what did they have for breakfast? :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|h_karluk: i wonder on the way grand or just slam|pg||
nt|josj: this normal enough contract should go down, this time|pg||
nt|mdgraham: raw meat|pg||
nt|josj: akvavit, Peter?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lml: perhaps double should just show the values for a takeout double|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|nt|chick: think they can find the grand, hamdi?|pg||
nt|chick: NS has been very solid so far today|pg||
nt|chick: if 3@H showed shortness (specifically), then should bid them again to show void|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|pg||
nt|bucheister: Catholic grade school with nuns|pg||
nt|peachy: aah, they made you learn it|pg||
nt|ralfwil: bad presence at table again!|pg||
nt|lestergold: curwest  an see he has to get busy and hope for the hearts|pg||
nt|ralfwil: as @sJ denies @s10.....|pg||
nt|lestergold: but his pard's blood pressure rising as tank goes on|pg||
nt|lestergold: he can see that if he doesnt find some fast tricks then declarer is likely home|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
nt|chick: a grand has to be in @Ds, not enough tricks in NT|pg||
nt|chick: (not to mention no heart stopper) :)|pg||
nt|daman: sigh of relief|pg||
pc|cA|nt|santyclz: Did e ever get to show a long solid suit?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: he showed 6+ @S|pg||
nt|santyclz: When designing a system you should give thought to "out of the box" bids that show specific holding types.|pg||
nt|bende:  I am getting expert help on the system and probably South couldn't find @hQ low enough to find the grand on the last board.|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||
nt|lestergold: curtains well defended|pg||
nt|peachy: wd|pg||
nt|chick: well done NS!|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Houston, eagle landed|pg||
nt|chick: claim at trick 1 :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 3@H showed short @h, 3@S, 4@C, 4@S showing cue, 5@C denied 3 aces of 5, 5@H showed void @H|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|nt|sybarra: claim:)|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h9|pg||
nt|ralfwil: another nice play is that after @sQ play a small towards dummy|pg||
nt|chick: I blame W for not finding 7, she can see everything she needs to count to 13 tricks ... only danger I can see is 3 small clubs with partner and no 2-2 split|pg||
nt|chick: ruff 2 spades (all trumps are high), draw trump, and pitch last spade on club ... time to claim|pg||
pc|c6|nt|h_karluk: no overruff fear there - 432 outside spots|pg||
nt|haans: most swedes play low positive|pg||
nt|josj: @H now is OK|pg||
pc|cT|nt|josj: nice defence|pg||
nt|haans: still going down|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|josj: declarer has to go all out now and will end up down a lot|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: on the EW cards 5@C is quite playable - West will be delighted to have stopped short|pg||
mc|7|nt|chick: wonder what the odds of that are|pg||
nt|lml: they need to rethink that... there should always be a handy way to find the trump queen below a grand|pg||

nt|othered1: 4@CX|pg||
nt|brolucius: For many the 3@D response would suggest around 8-10 (Lebensohl convention). With 0-7 North would respond 2NT instead.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I have had a suggestion that as well as blue and pink, there should be green for the undecided|pg||

nt|sybarra: I can not remember Berg's first name |pg||

nt|sybarra: one of young stars for Sweden |pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: Both "bergs" have the same first name: magnus|pg||

nt|sybarra: just to confuse us|pg||
mb|1S|nt|peachy: nice fitting hands EW here|pg||

nt|haans: easy to go to high here|pg||
nt|haans: good pass|pg||
nt|pelu: NS: 6@d/1C|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge:  2 was a longer auction but still faded out at 6@H|pg||
nt|pelu: @c|pg||
nt|daman: another 3NT|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: 18 opposite 13 and a 5-4 fit, I think they will|pg||
nt|josj: minor suit slams are always difficult to reach and this should be another example|pg||
nt|mdgraham: assuming North has six spades, he is known to have 10 black cards and two hearts|pg||
nt|pelu: spec after 1NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: am I right that N is the younger ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: no, W is|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ralfwil: a nice @s slam!|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ah, not a married couple...|pg||
nt|lml: they know the shape and the controls by 4@H... the trump queen should be high on the list by then|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: will desrve some praise if they get there|pg||
nt|peachy: indeed|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2@h meaning?|pg||
nt|bende:  Hmm... 4NT should be asking for queens in this sequence.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|nilsland:  Pity it will not make due to the spade lay|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unfortunately the 4-0 trump break dooms it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Very unlucky, it's a 95% slam, roughly|pg||
nt|othered1: aThe stiff @D devalues south's hand slightly, but it still has enough extras to push on.|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh sorry I may have them confuse then  |pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: I guess, dont dare ask about their age :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: maybe they will avoid the trap by peeking :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: as you can cope with all 4 with West|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The correct play in spades is the queen first|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Many get that wrong and they never notice|pg||
nt|Walddk2: because it usually does not matter|pg||
nt|josj: of course, but even if N does not hold a sing. @D the 10 is "unnecessary"|pg||
nt|sybarra: like S,  I agree with not using stayman with a 4333 hand |pg||
mb|3S|mb|4C|nt|lestergold: ah too quick with his enormolus hand |pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: spade  support, better than 2sp|pg||
nt|h_karluk: nowadays 20-20 layouts rare, we may see an elegant solution|pg||
nt|josj: did W have 2@H available here as an opening bid?|pg||
nt|josj: now the @H are lost|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  You have to learn it "the hard way"|pg||
nt|lestergold: if west has shown a good raise in spades then east should beexploring because his hand becomes enormous|pg||
nt|peachy: if he went to game, might as well have splintered or done something|pg||
nt|pelu: with 5-2-2-4 stille a small @D |pg||
nt|lml: I actually play exactly that if I have a control asking sequence earlier|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|h_karluk: interesting lead from KJx tenace|pg||
nt|haans: i think 2@H/2@S both roman|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: south will have to push this the rest of the way|pg||
nt|lestergold: lazy sign off basically|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  Now  south know the heart ace is missing|pg||
nt|nilsland:  since N didnt cuebid 4 H|pg||
nt|nilsland:  And East will surely lead hearts...|pg||
nt|haans: old carrot style|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: this could even make an overtrick, because diamonds can be set up pretty easily|pg||
nt|h_karluk: perhaps a passive trump trick would more safe|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mdgraham: playing four-suit transfers, you can have 1NT-2@C-2x-3@c/@D natural and forcing |pg||
nt|pelu: spec: can u help with the bidding?|pg||
nt|josj: nice question, Peter: help us with the explanation or help the players? |pg||
pc|d4|nt|nilsland:  man or mouse? Man - it seems|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder if north's 4@C control bid was forced or whether it implies slam interest (good trumps are a plus).|pg||
nt|josj: that's what I would think too...|pg||
pc|d2|nt|pelu: both :)|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: club splinter cant cost|pg||
nt|josj: I see now :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 2@h = relay, 2@S = minors|pg||
nt|josj: ty Joel|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 3@D = good @D, 3@S = Q|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ah, science|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk2: The fact that the 9 is with AK makes the slam 5% better, from 90 to 95% (half of the 4-0 breaks)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 2@C was shape-asking|pg||
nt|pelu: so only the jump to 5@C was "wrong" - the slam need 3-2 in both minor, so 5@C is Ok|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk2: Let's see what Eklund does|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Barrling rather|pg||
nt|josj: if E can open his rubbish, the why doesn't W open his nice hand?|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sorry *lead - pls ignore trick word|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ralfwil: I prefer 2nt from W as a very strong invite  and E can jump to 4@c|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, they have missed a decent slam, but at least they have also missed 3NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: although slam is noting great|pg||
nt|mdgraham: *nothing|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|s6|nt|lestergold: hear hear|pg||

nt|chick: we knew what you meant :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks :) however that was my carelessness|pg||

nt|daman: I am a big fan of playing in 4-4 fits|pg||
nt|sybarra: gerber? |pg||

pc|d2|pg||
nt|santyclz: Now the @c10 and she's home.|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|othered1: Standard methods will get you here, too.  Perhaps beginning 2@C-2@D-3@S.|pg||

mb|p|nt|nilsland:  6 S down one was a flat board but HÃ¥kan StrÃ¤Ã¤f played the spade Queen in the first spade trick :)|pg||

nt|chick: hello everyone :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bende:  1@h=natural or strong relay|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|othered1: 3@S asks for aces (old-fashioned ACOL and American Standard).  West denies then east cue-bids 4@C and west is obligated to show @H control and you're there.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I think that's the name for base 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 6@S on 4 was flat, but it's worth noting that in the other room Strääf did cash @SQ first. He has seen it before|pg||

mb|p|nt|josj: lol|pg||

nt|bende:  1@s=4@s, 2@c=relay|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|nilsland:  Better to play 4 H from East here to avoid 3 diamond losers|pg||
nt|mdgraham: meanwhile, can EW get to 7@C or 7@S or 7NT|pg||
nt|josj: exactly 13 top tricks|pg||

nt|peachy: I dont like 3C|pg||

nt|lml: a grand is pretty good here so lets see if they can find it this time|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|nilsland:  nobody bids them ....|pg||

nt|peachy: good lead|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: gutsy raise|pg||
nt|josj: to say the least - but nice intermediates|pg||
nt|haans: many play deal before if you have a singleton you lead it. otherwise you do not have singleton|pg||
nt|pelu: I 'hate' 1NT on a strong 5 card major|pg||
mb|p|nt|bende:  2NT=short hearts|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|peachy: I expect this goes down on trump lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: rather logical with that @c holding|pg||
nt|lestergold: with aced clubs badly placed and the trump attack, i think this is doomed|pg||
nt|josj: what with a void, Hans?|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|frankaus: a strong @C plus relays would  identify the shape and controls and get NS to 7 @S easy on last|pg||
nt|lml: North is surely thinking oh me what a fit!|pg||
mb|3S!|mb|p|nt|nilsland:  Now Axelsson regrets bidding hearts first :)|pg||

nt|lestergold: slam on dim finesse|pg||
nt|josj: just unlucky that both N and S hold @Cxxx|pg||
nt|pelu: Nt = 14-16 -so N sh not foce to game|pg||
nt|sybarra: should probably keep the N/S cards for a money bridge game later |pg||
nt|lml: interesting hand all round|pg||
mb|1C|an|16+|nt|lestergold: dont see it being bid tho|pg||
nt|daman: if North opens 1NT   South might take a shot|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ralfwil: If I remember it right, Darvas has written about the trumph ace which disappeared|pg||
nt|haans: may be passed out|pg||
nt|lml: double here probably to show positive?|pg||
nt|haans: natural bodding 1nt-pass-pass-pass|pg||
mb|d!|nt|daman: NS might just get to the @S game|pg||
nt|josj: either xx would have done|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|daman: or defend 2@Hs doubled?|pg||
nt|lestergold: im sure many have|pg||
nt|lestergold: now will they even get to play in 5@d?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: not 4@s|pg||
nt|lestergold: ten card fit better than 7 card fit especially when there is 5/1 break out|pg||
nt|josj: another slam|pg||
mb|3S|nt|nilsland:  The spade game is difficult even with 3-3 in clubs i defense avoid playing hearts|pg||
nt|ralfwil: As I play Easts hand has more than enough for 2@d after @s-opening from P|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will NS get away from there 4-4@H?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it's a 2 way 1C :)|pg||
nt|haans: they did not play old Carrot |pg||
nt|sybarra: right you are George|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: well, perhaps 2/1 is gf for them|pg||
nt|lestergold: he is playing 'catch up' now|pg||
nt|peachy: i dont know if it is|pg||
nt|santyclz: Uh oh, a multi-2@d *overcall*.  The ACBL just went into shock.|pg||
nt|josj: should be easy now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yet another slam - dealing computer working well |pg||
mb|4D|nt|lestergold: will west imagione how perfect his cards are?|pg||
nt|chick: easy 3N to make, too|pg||
nt|lml: I think people would bid over 1NT with the East hand |pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|daman: E will lead a @C maybe|pg||
nt|nilsland:  A trump lead is best|pg||
nt|chick: sure, they will find it|pg||
nt|rodal f: If so slam is on|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|daman: the 6 will force the King :)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  this will be another exiting board, may go either way|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5@c now@@?|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: but here we are getting a bit high|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: now do you get message pard??|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant criticise them for failing to bid 6 on a finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: esepcially when they are in comfortable lead|pg||
nt|chick: I sure wish they would wake up and realize that multi isn't the nightmare they make it out to be|pg||
nt|haans: many do not bid 1@C with 16 hcp balanced hand|pg||
pc|sA|nt|chick: I don't think there is any slam here, I thought you meant find the game :)|pg||
nt|josj: is 4@C a void already?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: we are about to find out.....|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 4 @C = void|pg||
nt|pelu: sh be - after 2NT most systems can show singletons on 3-level|pg||
nt|josj: ty|pg||
nt|josj: in that case, S can work it out|pg||
nt|mdgraham: missing slam gained 11 on board 16. NS at the other table in 4NT-2 |pg||
nt|lml: I usually have to have 17 HCP balanced and played opening 1NT 14-16 but thats just me|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lestergold: east has no reason o bid one more|pg||
nt|lestergold: east cannot know there are no wasted in hearts|pg||
nt|peachy: nicely done. I suppose if they needed IMPs badly, they would have bid slam, it is not that far|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think most good pairs would reach 5@d and play there |pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@d is not a self-playing contract....|pg||
nt|peachy: no, it isn|pg||
nt|haans: thats many|pg||
pc|s9|nt|pelu: 5@d = 0/3 - I exp|pg||

nt|santyclz: Hard to believe this auction.|pg||

nt|vugraphzpx: 5NT = Do you have another trick somewhere :)?|pg||
nt|pelu: here I play 5@s = Pass with = and cue bid with 3 (even if it is sure that pd has 3|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: West thought East would double with cards strong enough for GF against a 17+|pg||
nt|pelu: on the 5@c/6@c hand NS had an accident - stopped in 4Nt (-2)|pg||
nt|lml: has to hold diamond losers to one|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dQ|nt|lestergold: safest in thios contract play @d A now|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgefederation.se/filbyter_bridge/resultat/fc10/fc_main_en.htm  for the tournament website|pg||

pc|d7|pg||
nt|lml: that will do it|pg||
pc|d3|nt|santyclz: Also strange to make 10 tricks in @ss.|pg||
nt|sybarra: safety play in @D and home |pg||

mb|p|mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|1D!|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: West probably too strong for a 1NT rebid with that very good 19 count|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|dburn: perhaps, but West's sequence carries a fairly wide range - about 16-19 or so|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: maybe he could have upgraded it, though|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But subsequent bidding after a balancing double is a grey area|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|brolucius: I wonder if South knows the spade position.|pg||

pc|h6|nt|mdgraham: The Italian rugby team is getting a bit chopped up in Paris|pg||
pc|c7|nt|dburn: it does not matter all that much whether South knows it - North knows enough about it|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|othered1: @S9 should clarify the @S p[osition|pg||
nt|brolucius: It does if South throws a spade.|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Must avoid 3NT here; 4@H has a chance|pg||
nt|chick: That 20 IMP handicapp for OS.se is looking inadequate now|pg||
nt|chick: are they rose-colored? :)|pg||
nt|josj: not easy for NS to get to 3NT now|pg||

mb|d|nt|lestergold: 20/20 hand and a misfittin g one too|pg||
nt|lestergold: scope for someone getting into trouble here|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: wonder if 2@C is specific for these suits?|pg||

nt|rodal f: Was sorrely black at last board:)|pg||
nt|haans: doubles flying around but ...|pg||

nt|josj: curious: how can N hold a @C void, an opening bid and no aces?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|othered1: This should keep them out of NT|pg||
nt|nilsland:  S has a problem, much extra values, maybe a double?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@D to play opposite spades and diamonds I assume|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: West must correct if he doesn't have diamonds as the other suit|pg||
nt|chick: I'm surprised N didn't show his support for @Hs|pg||

nt|vugraphzpx: West's D explained as penalty|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: ouch|pg||
nt|lestergold: on this occasion unl;ikely to improve contract of 1N|pg||
nt|chick: he can't hope for penalty in spades|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@h=transfer to 4@S|pg||
nt|josj: as usual :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: if pitch the @S, E can just keep 3 hearts instead|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: And S took 10 Red Bulls|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: I mispredicted again, but why would south bid 3N?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Vg in your timezone: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php  Make it your home page!|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes,  guess it really didnt matter,  had 9 tricks in the bag|pg||
nt|lml: that should show more than their balancing notrump|pg||
nt|haans: spade lead = no 3nt|pg||
nt|haans: no spade lead = 3nt a make|pg||
nt|lml: 3NT is not a good contract.  5@c isnt bad|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk2: What was 3@C I wonder|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Why 2@s? 2@h is free|pg||
nt|lml: it doesnt mae though|pg||
nt|lml: make|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No @S-lead is also = no 3 NT|pg||
nt|haans: best is to bid 3nt all the time mostly u make :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|chick: well, there is still hope they get to slam|pg||
nt|haans: thats very true :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|chick: unmakeable of course, but at least a good try|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|rodal f: Cornelia always use to be right there:)|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|lestergold: win club swirch and K@d cant be enjoyed|pg||

pc|s2|nt|josj: Father, forgive them :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: I can not get to 9 tricks |pg||
pc|c7|nt|Walddk4: All half-time scores at   http://www.bridgefederation.se/filbyter_bridge/resultat/fc10/fc_main_en.htm|pg||
nt|chick: yes, I'm always in great slam contracts that are unmakeable :)|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|lestergold: yep best defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think this p[robably headed for two off|pg||
nt|lestergold: whats delay here?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: south is thinking for some reaseon|pg||
nt|daman: the unbid suit factor|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lml: missing 9 I would expect to get a spade lead a lot of the time but then I guess if the club is on you are home anyway|pg||
pc|s4|nt|othered1: some kind of counterdefense to 2@C?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|frankaus: re all|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but I don´t like this type of thinking|pg||
nt|santyclz: Well, I don't understand the auction but this hand will not send people swarming to learn the system.|pg||
nt|chick: hehe|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 2NT was forcing to 3@C, 3@D asked for short suit with C supp, then cue, cue and uhm.. well..|pg||
nt|haans: x showing 15-18 not bad agrement|pg||
nt|daman: is leading the 8 back playing East for 10xxx?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|daman: I would have led the Q! back|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|lestergold: well three off now maybe|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @hJ????|pg||
nt|peachy: three for sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: we call it 'eating her own childrfen'|pg||
nt|rodal f: A speciality for the most of us?|pg||
nt|lml: but 5@C has extra chances to without a spade lead|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|haans: CORRECT?????????|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vugraphzpx: yes|pg||
nt|lml: and you are less likely to get one|pg||
pc|c9|nt|nilsland:  3 C was probably a normal raise. South did not whether W had diamonds or hearts really|pg||
nt|haans: only think that say DO NOT BID 3NT is = nonvul|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk2: Frissan has lost all of the advantage, and plenty more :(|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the only way to lose 3 @h tricks by his own|pg||
nt|chick: welcome back Frank|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They have not recorded a single IMP so far|pg||
nt|othered1: NS should take a good look at their methods, since a common type of intervention gave them no chance to focus on what's important on this hand.|pg||
nt|nilsland:  If double was take out that would solved the problem, but this is a siatuation that surely was not discussed|pg||
nt|santyclz: ... and uhm |pg||
pc|cT|pc|h7|pc|c5|nt|lestergold: is it her?|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|santyclz: ... the wheels fell off.|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d7|pc|c6|pc|dT|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|nt|daman: looks like NS have different carding methods|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: 300 minus on a part score hand is not too great|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|chick: wouldn't surprise me if EW were getting pretty frustrated by now|pg||
nt|chick: they have yet to win an imp in this session|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: W was clearly frustrated when she bid this|pg||
nt|daman: pretty simple defense now|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lml: I wonder is east realized what west intedned the auction to mean|pg||
pc|d9|nt|chick: for you latecomers ... the 20 IMPs for OS.se is the handicap they started with|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|pg||
pc|hT|pc|s8|pc|hA|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|h4|nt|chick: so they are actually 0-39 for the session so far, and more for Zang on this one|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|d8|mc|11|nt|lml: usually taking 12 tricks in 1NT is not that good|pg||

pc|h2|nt|othered1: Previous hand emphasizes the need to h ave "metaagreements" on handling 2-suited overcalls, so you  have some basis for action if one pops up against you.  A much better use of ...|pg||
nt|othered1: your time than concocting schemes to find third round controls on high minor suit auctions, etc.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well east is nowm glad he was cannily quiet|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|nilsland:  6 @C may be the answer says Zbych from Poland|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rodal f: Agree and would been a desaster, but argue with the odds and sucsess?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|lestergold: well whether or not it was for the right reason he got the play right|pg||
nt|peachy: more hearts please|pg||
nt|chick: knowing that E has only 4 spades, S should keep pushing the hearts|pg||
pc|c9|nt|nilsland:  Or even 6 @H :)|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|othered1: @D tap won't beat 6@H?|pg||
nt|nilsland:  yes|pg||
nt|nilsland:  as usual :)|pg||
nt|josj: and another missed grand coming soon|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk2: 6@C is a great contract. If this is a choice of slams, I am impressed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Very well done!|pg||
pc|h6|nt|othered1: Very well done.  Minor suit slams aren't easiest contracts to find.|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|haans: landy better than exclusion p can bid 2@D asking were 5 cards|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lml: I dont mind either but you need something|pg||
pc|d8|nt|nilsland:  Should be easy to play with 2 diamond ruffs in dummy|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and no @c finess! @cA and a small|pg||
nt|lml: just trying to find an overcall is not very good|pg||
pc|c5|nt|chick: and now S knows that partner is out of clubs, so a club to him, and heart back|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|othered1: or 2@S ruffs in hand (but @D are better)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|s6|nt|haans: agree go to the table PREPARED|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: best to duck the club|pg||
nt|peachy: he will duck|pg||
nt|lestergold: he is considering it i expect|pg||
nt|lestergold: knows declarr needs every trick he can muster|pg||
nt|lestergold: sholuld be a trick short here|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Souths AK98 in clubs are solid|pg||
pc|c6|nt|chick: if E tries to draw trump, will have no way back to the clubs|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s7|pc|cT|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or was it? 2@H is -1|pg||
nt|josj: yes we do!|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: if west takes club it mnakes he ducks its off|pg||

nt|vugraphzpx: E/W plays strong club, and 1D is 4k M unbal or 11-13NT.|pg||
nt|lestergold: the grand is enormous|pg||
nt|frankaus: sometimes with a misfitt 50 at a time is a bargain.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this grand appears to have a slight flaw|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks brutal at other table in 1 nt |pg||
nt|lml: innovative|pg||
nt|haans: i see a fast 3@D here|pg||
nt|bende:  I think he will bid 2@c=8-11, 6+@c or 5@c-4@d|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|peachy: yes, probably tools available to dind out SQ is missing, but went on with length|pg||
nt|chick: and with the nice result in the other room, OS.se finally gets on the scoreboard this session|pg||
nt|hawe45:  With a @S-suit...?|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: is there an engldih translation for Torbjorn?|pg||
nt|daman: english|pg||
nt|Walddk2: björn = bear|pg||
nt|daman: ok  thx|pg||
nt|peachy: *find|pg||
nt|chick: for you latecomers ... 20 of the IMPs for OS.se is the handicap they started with|pg||
nt|chick: wow, now we are moving on to transfer overcalls :)|pg||
nt|josj: depends on who's on lead :)|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|daman: this is the weak NT obviously|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Mats Nilsland|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Mats|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Mats!|pg||
nt|nilsland:  hi|pg||
nt|lestergold: and they had better bid it or they will be drowned in then deficit|pg||
mb|d|nt|ralfwil: looks like Stenberg|pg||
nt|peachy: it is pretty deep already|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Ups,sry|pg||
nt|bende:  2@d=relay, FG|pg||
nt|haans: x he diud and I ask why?|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|chick: pretty soon, it will be transfer openings, and then no one will be able to bid the suits they have :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: here are the OR's first 2 boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: it was a long auction to 7 in the open|pg||
nt|pelu: best chance with S or N on lead :)|pg||
nt|bende:  2@h = short hearts|pg||
nt|chick: since 1@D artificial would be showing @Ds, asking for @D lead|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|Walddk2: Mats will tell you all about wriggling if they get doubled in 1NT :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: not bidding the grand would be resignimng time i think|pg||
nt|rodal f: Let's see how EWs minorsystem works|pg||
nt|josj: :)|pg||
nt|bende:  Should normally be 2NT but here they won two steps, pass and RD|pg||
mb|3D|nt|lml: well again that depends on discussions.  maybe it should be takeout|pg||
nt|lml: but again after the FG you are right Chick|pg||
nt|bende:  Here they have lost in total one step which means they keep relaying.|pg||
nt|lml: I like it as lead directing|pg||
nt|haans: bid fast and pass for ever|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|Walddk2: He is the man behind Nilsland's Slinkningar, an escape system when 1NT gets doubled|pg||
nt|lml: a bit aggressive to bid 3@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: after 2Nt - 3Nt diff - almost impossible for East to lead @s|pg||
nt|pelu: now 3NT in S and easy for W for find a @S-lead|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Shoe me the real East-hand - this bidding canÂ´t be true|pg||
nt|hawe45:  show|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|santyclz: Re-hi folks.  Lost my conn for a few moments.|pg||
nt|chick: an aceless 10 HCP plus a void is hardly worth two takeout doubles|pg||
nt|chick: we missed you, Joe :)|pg||
nt|chick: everyone was getting totally bored with just me :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: if East would have passed, as I think he should have, South may pass 3@C D|pg||
nt|frankaus: not real well but its a difficult hand for most systems|pg||
nt|rodal f: Would it been better with 2@S from E at the 1NT?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: definitly 2@S would have been better if they play like that|pg||
nt|sybarra: not X'd  likely hands break well with little inteference |pg||
nt|sybarra: however....|pg||
nt|sybarra: S is looking for tricks |pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: Declarer drumming his fingers on the table|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: that was a heavy 1@H overcall|pg||
nt|chick: hehe|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: I bid 1NT - 2@S - something - 3@D with hands like Easts|pg||
nt|lml: I am with you bid it the first time or not at all... in fact not at all sounds good to me|pg||
nt|haans: yep cost 800 some times :)|pg||
mb|4D|nt|daman: and South found a reason not to raise|pg||
nt|othered1: off shape for a double and wrong for 1N, 1@H looks normal, if you choose to act at all|pg||
nt|haans: 23 hcp|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no fit and no hope of making :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|josj: biut not much of a swing either|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I never open 4441 11 counts - keeps me out of trouble|pg||
nt|josj: look at those nice pointed suits|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: also would NEVER open one 1@S|pg||
nt|pelu: so much for science :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: On a low sapde lead, East has to play @SK then 9 - not too hard, one would think|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR 2 bids to get to 3NT - hele a long travel|pg||
nt|chick: The double said it all, but perhaps he is trying to interfere with the relaying|pg||
nt|bende:  3@h=7+@c and singelton @h|pg||
nt|lml: if he wanted to do that he should have bid it over 2@D|pg||
nt|lml: 3@D doesnt take much space|pg||
nt|hawe45:  800 with two blind children af opponents!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  as|pg||
nt|bende:  4@d=4 controls|pg||
nt|haans: problem with bidding they will not bid slam|pg||
nt|chick: of course, Linda, but there is no other reason I can see for bidding 3@D|pg||
mb|4S|nt|daman: why do you feel it is offshape?|pg||
nt|santyclz: S didn't his 4@c?  Mercy rule in effect?|pg||
nt|santyclz: (hit)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: I don´t think he expected a pass from his p|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: combined 28 count have to bid well to reach the grand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: i do not open it with 1@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it has been said that the fewer bids oyu take to get to your final contract, the better - but this swing is really a bit random|pg||
nt|mdgraham: assuming 3NT is the final contract, of course...  |pg||
nt|pelu: I remember a stury, where Riese was asked by to young players - how do u bid 3NT - we stopped in 4@C -1 - R: 1NT - 3NT!|pg||
nt|lml: my thinking is that east-west has had it!|pg||
nt|lml: its a teeny tiny white flag|pg||
nt|haans: a bid score this time|pg||
nt|lml: great spot 4@S|pg||
nt|haans: big|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rodal f: Belive they don't. Might something for them to discuss|pg||
pc|d4|nt|daman: 3424|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pg||
nt|lestergold: perfecto no wasted hands fit like hand and glove|pg||
nt|josj: yes, this story often used to show the advantages of 12-14 NT :)|pg||
nt|pelu: tell your story - and dont tell opp|pg||
nt|sybarra: and opps discards not making it easy |pg||
nt|sybarra: W making it look like @S's do not break |pg||
nt|sybarra: Joel,  is S in the tank?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: he certainly is|pg||
pc|d8|nt|vugraphzpx: South that is.. :)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|peachy: After GF spade raise, S has all suits sontrolled first or second round. Even if N hadn't South still would|pg||
nt|lestergold: well another 13 imps into the bottomless pit|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but they still have tio be confident of 13 tricks controls are only part of the story|pg||
nt|josj: yep, let them sweat it out|pg||
nt|josj: NS seem to have reached the proper contract here, wd so far...|pg||
pc|dK|nt|peachy: the first part, yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: first three bids same in open room then the auctions took different directions|pg||
nt|lestergold: and sadly  a differfent destination|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|pelu: wd by NS - after 5½ bidding-round|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|othered1: OK, perhaps sub-optimal shape for a double|pg||
nt|daman: well   4414 would be ideal I suppose|pg||
nt|sybarra: I imagine that was sigh of relief |pg||
pc|h7|nt|josj: entry position awkward now|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|lestergold: thios is where you pray that west is the one to show out on the spades|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Walddk2: We do not live in an ideal world. You've got to bid the cards you are dealt|pg||

nt|josj: in OR W opened 1NT with 3 unstopped suits...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: that kills thoughts of 3N|pg||

nt|sybarra: thx to Cornelia and George (who had to leave)  my co commentators,  always fun |pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  EW also have to win by at least 17 imps :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: that is a very 'disciplioned' pass by east ok if ur p[artner will almost always protect|pg||
nt|lestergold: now east will come seriously alive|pg||
nt|pelu: same start, but after 4@C Souths asked with 4Nt - 3Aces and 7@S - he knoiw that his singleton @DA was 2-3 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx also to the Swedish Bridge Federation and the club for bringing this tourney to BBO |pg||
nt|lml: when west shows the clubs singleton east should think his hand is huge|pg||

nt|josj: sort of advanced goulash, Mike?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: wea re wiser now - and more than a bit older, too|pg||
nt|josj: the latter is definitely true :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: must be some spade raise  (the 2nt call) |pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 2NT = invitational w/ @S|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: I'm afraid Mr Dylan was wrong when he said that he was so much older then|pg||
nt|lml: west should show the @SQ with the extra length|pg||
nt|haans: if 2NT did show 4 spades @SQ not needed|pg||
mb|5D|nt|Walddk4: Second half after a short break|pg||
nt|josj: I think this needs a quick @H shift|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: I wonder if he was looking for slam?  Why else 2H first if he was going to 4 anyway|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes|pg||
nt|lml: yes but east doesnt know that|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 2NT = "jacoby"|pg||

mb|7S|nt|lml: east should bid it now|pg||
