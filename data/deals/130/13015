nt|scotty: E-W missed the pretty good slam in CR|pg||
nt|roswolf: with difficulty|pg||
mb|d|nt|barnets: he Ace and north plays the 10 ?|pg||
nt|scotty: key is for N to play 10 with 10x, K10x and Q10x.  First is easy, last two are dangerous unless you know a lot about the hand|pg||
nt|barnets: if you lead up to the ace and north plays the 10|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: bidding this slam isnt a doddle|pg||
nt|dburn: you can save yourself these agonies by just cashing the ace - that's as good as anything else|pg||
nt|barnets: right he must play the 10 from H10x to give you a guess|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|scotty: North bid 3@c in the other room - but that was after a Strong Club opening|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: finis?|pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: Against almost all opponents, better to lead toward ace - then you pick up KQ10 also|pg||
nt|barnets: so 6 is decent on the cards|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes and neither room got close|pg||
nt|barnets: yes then tou can play the J with safety|pg||

nt|roswolf: well done captain - i trust you will enjoy the champagne:)|pg||
nt|scotty: Impolite question, I know|pg||
nt|dburn: never mind, Barnet - your suggestion of a team of expats may well find favour. Put your money now on Shenkin-Rosenberg, Coyle-Silverstone to win the 2011 Camrose|pg||
nt|minimonkey:  2C is Strong with hearts or 18/19 Bal|pg||
nt|dburn: perhaps with Gold-McIntosh as a third pair, though used sparingly - that foursome won't need 'em|pg||
