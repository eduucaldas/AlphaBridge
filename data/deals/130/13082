nt|bucheister: Hi Shirley; I will be with you tonight|pg||
nt|bucheister: Hi everyone; I am John Buchheister and will one of the commentators this evening; welcome all|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1N|nt|xenya: yes, lots of it maybe|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|roswolf: love the double on 3-4-3-3|pg||
nt|lml: and his son used to play with my son in juniors|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: and the double by W is...?|pg||
nt|hedyg: Fleisher 11 seed|pg||
mb|2S|nt|lml: the double is support I would think|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: west doubles for pens?|pg||
nt|lml: yep there is the alert|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|lml: they are having a great tournament|pg||
nt|petergill: Jessica Piafsky is in her 30s - I played against her in the European Championships in San Remo last year, when her bridge partner was Bob Drijver|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now what?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: lively first hand|pg||
nt|dburn: close decision|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  need to play game in 4-3 heart fit|pg||
nt|ady: sorry    4 losers in hearts|pg||
nt|kareno: Interesting hand.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|hedyg: Agica seed 75|pg||
nt|lml: passing on the south hand is a good decision as it turns out|pg||
nt|lml: but there are 14hcp opposite an opening bid|pg||
nt|dburn: South might have take the odd-looking action of reopening with 2NT to show the minors|pg||
nt|lml: I think going for bidding is the concentration of strength in the north hand|pg||
pc|c8|nt|lml: going against bidding 3NT is the vulnerability|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|lml: that seems more normal|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok now|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|petergill: Barry Piafsky is Don's son. He was in Canada's youth (under 26) team in 1997. |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|davidstern: Hi all so a close match here|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|lml: they found their minus like they should|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|roswolf: well shouldnt this be game? - east a little wet i think|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like they stopped too early|pg||
nt|daman: Good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|bucheister: It truly is a bidders game; in the old days no one would dream of bidding over a strong NT with that hand, now it is automatic|pg||
nt|lml: yes my son Colin's partner in that |pg||
nt|dburn: tendency is to bid game what it's close anyway, but at these colors staying out of game wins as many IMPs when right as bidding game does when that's right|pg||
nt|lml: yes but the concentration of points in one hand (the openers) makes it a bit better|pg||
nt|lml: on the other hand the only five card suit was clubs|pg||
nt|lml: it is a tough call|pg||
nt|fabsayc: excellent and not especially obvious shift by Lauria|pg||
nt|dburn: sure - you can make game more easily on less than the normal values when one defender has all the strength (and you know it)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|fabsayc: i dont believe this lead|pg||
nt|kareno: Oh, less interesting.  South's happy - this one he can beat... but not with a club lead!|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kareno: North convinced himself that south's second suit was clubs.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dK|nt|xenya: but they are not vulnerable and it's 1st hand|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|pc|d4|pg||
nt|xenya: hello George|pg||
nt|kareno: But west had to take the pitch on a heart!|pg||
nt|kareno: Guess west also convinced himself about clubs in south.|pg||
nt|rodal f: But for shure N knew that S had S. Was it a brain drop? Belive so.|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, the club king was a bizarre lead.|pg||
nt|panja: hi all|pg||
pc|c4|nt|dburn: indeed; was wondering if 2@h showed majors, but it probably does not or Rodwell would have corrected to spades|pg||
pc|c2|nt|roswolf: its never too early to start losing|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lml: well he still has to make 2|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|kareno: panja :)  |pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|nt|daman: giving them a spot early|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=1-suit   Meck DBL would be 1-minor or both majors [or ....]|pg||
pc|cT|pc|d9|nt|dburn: for all that, game on this occasion is a rotten contract, and East-West have done well to stay out of it|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lml: yes this is a promising start for them|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c9|pc|h4|nt|bucheister: You are so fast Al; I actually knew that one |pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|petergill: The heart switch attacked declarer's communications - a real expert play|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|nt|fabsayc: back and forth|pg||
nt|kareno: Not a terrible play that heart.  South's hand was counted out by now.|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pg||
pc|s3|nt|dburn: I forget exactly what Meckwell's defence to 1NT is nowadays, but it makes sense to treat the West hand as one-suited in hearts|pg||
nt|dburn: perhaps - game might be bid at the other table and make on a less precise defense than this one|pg||

nt|bucheister: Welcome to my partners in crime|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ok spectators, not that bad|pg||
nt|dburn: still, 120 was the best that East-West could do here|pg||
nt|lml: the Paifsky's did the best they could... well done|pg||
mb|1D|nt|roswolf: another fun hand|pg||
nt|bucheister: Maybe that S hand is a little too strong and suited for 1NT at imps|pg||
mb|d|nt|gambit: par|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: lots of shape|pg||
nt|daman: 2@C is the only safe place for NS should they compete|pg||
nt|lml: now that to me is a very borderline opening|pg||
nt|lml: did north really bid 1@S?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|xenya: they will|pg||
nt|bucheister: Seems like it has been a pretty tight match so far|pg||

mb|p|nt|lml: whew|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|lml: hey sit for it... right its not game|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@H was a transfer bid|pg||
nt|ady: south managed to get into the bidding 2nd round|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|dburn: to some extent, but you could see why he would want to protect his major-suit holdings|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: would we all have bid 2@S over the double?|pg||
nt|bucheister: these are all relays|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15, 2+@D   2@C=one round force   2@H=11-13 bal|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@S forces 2N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N is normal game try|pg||
nt|lml: I think Don must be very pleased to be playing in this great event with his son|pg||
pc|d4|nt|dburn: 2@h showed a weak no trump, 2@s was a transfer to notrump to get East to be declarer|pg||
pc|d9|nt|xenya: i confess i would|pg||
nt|roswolf: so would i|pg||
nt|lml: well this got north the spade lead which is a pretty good one|pg||
nt|bucheister: they must always accept the transfer; most of the pair accept with at least three|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bucheister: If you are going to open that 1NT you have to convince yourself to compete later in the auction|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: this should be a + for n/s    neither quite able to doubvle 1NT|pg||
nt|lml: South had a shot at doubling but not north|pg||
nt|panja: 11 tricks because after @SQ drops...@SJ can be finessed|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|nt|lml: I think this is pretty normal|pg||
nt|kareno: The percentage on the heart finesse was not 50-50, rather it was three to one.|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|daman: would garbage stayman apply over the double?|pg||
nt|roswolf: where was the axe? somebody asks?|pg||
nt|roswolf: not with me|pg||
nt|finch: it's quite handy to bid a natural 2@C over the double|pg||
nt|xenya: axe? what axe?|pg||
nt|daman: on Board 1   repeated @D tap held declarer to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|daman: I have been advised they use 2@C as either clubs or two suits if run when doubled|pg||
nt|finch: it's very difficult for North to double; his partner has shown nothing other than long clubs|pg||
nt|finch: East could be 5=5 rather than 5=4|pg||
nt|roswolf: very true frances|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pc|s7|nt|lml: great defense so far|pg||
nt|bucheister: would a doubleof one heart be a takeout double of 1S?|pg||
nt|bucheister: I don't think game tries are in their vocabulary|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bucheister: or would it be hearts?|pg||
nt|lml: you could play that|pg||
nt|lml: you could play it either way.  you should agree|pg||
nt|ady: I think most play double of 1 heart shows hearts and bid 1 spade with short spades as a take-out|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes 1@s takeout|pg||
nt|lml: ace and out a heart looks decent approach for south|pg||
nt|bucheister: specs should discuss this with their partnerships because this is becoming very common|pg||

nt|fabsayc: operator, i am asked if you have any scores for other matches|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|daman: Charlie wants to make sure he takes a trick :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: meckwell game try = bid game, try to make it    [an oldie but goodie quote]|pg||
nt|dburn: they have a number of sequences in which they can in effect discuss which way up to play the final contract|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if this makes other than 10 tricks i will (fill in the blank)|pg||
nt|dburn: not everyone would have been directly involved with that South hand on the first round of bidding|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h5|nt|poohbear: youd be surprised. They have become more accurate bidders. Dont routinely bid 3NT on every hand|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|daman: now the @H position is exposed|pg||
pc|c9|nt|po-s: that silly DJ by North was expensive|pg||
pc|c8|nt|daman: I would have played the @C J|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|c7|nt|hedyg: could have cashed the K@s|pg||
nt|ady: better for south to win ace of hearts  cash diamonds and exit with a heart|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi PO, welcome :)|pg||
nt|lml: this defense isnt bad|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lml: if South cashes the diamond and plays ace and another club they wills till get a club trick in the end|pg||
nt|lml: I dont think they could have done much better than that|pg||
nt|bucheister: a small plus is better than a big minus|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|hedyg: np Richard, sometimes they play too fast for the operator to keep up|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|ady: e/w   likely to end in 3NT|pg||
nt|lml: 3@C looks a bit better than I usually play it|pg||
nt|dburn: now, that is a strange sort of 2@h overcall, but it came to no harm|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all 3rd seat NT opener's are treated as "weak"  so this DBL=14+ HCP|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: not sure what West is supposed to do here - take a view and pass, or scramble to 2@c|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|bucheister: he certainly has the right cards for partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|bucheister: You are doing a great job; thank you|pg||
nt|dburn: that he does - slightly surprised that South did not bail out into 2@d|pg||
nt|fabsayc: undo|pg||
nt|kareno: Operator I am sure it is north who bid 3@d|pg||
nt|panja: 3Nt is the limit for NS here..|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: I do not ... just the other table of this match|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: awkward, that South hand - no comfortable fit into any category (one-bid, pre-empt, pass)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|roswolf: all very normal|pg||
nt|daman: back to back 3@H contracts for EW    could have 3 for 3 had West balanced :)|pg||
nt|finch: tHelgemo put off protecting by the vulnerability (and the fact it isn't matchpoints)|pg||
nt|lml: well they now have 9 top tricks |pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure it will come up this hand, but EW play Reverse Smith Echo vs NT|pg||
nt|panja: but S has opened 'natural' 1@C|pg||
nt|gambit: marginal opener |pg||
nt|fabsayc: tit for tat, attacking communication|pg||
pc|h9|nt|gambit: spade lead would have proved better for the def |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|hedyg: they always did with the doublefinesse in @d|pg||
nt|ady: likely 10 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: now can make 10, yes|pg||
nt|lml: yes they can make 10 now and probably will by the double diamond finesse|pg||
nt|panja: and North has natural Club suit..so naturally, N has higher ambitions|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|lml: guessing they would end in the same place after an opening pass|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|nt|fabsayc: transfers over 2nt rebid would work better|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: I'm sorry ... N, not W bis 3@D|pg||
nt|fabsayc: np|pg||
nt|kareno: I use Gladiator after 2nt rebid.  Then 3@c - 3@s - 3nt is suggesting club slam but south would quit.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this auction completely off the rails now|pg||
pc|d5|nt|fabsayc: or 3s over 2nt with transfers also ending in 3nt|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: Rod has so many options while still holding @DA|pg||
nt|panja: In the OR, S opened a Prec 1@C, it seems like, so they had time to explore below 3N and stop at 3N|pg||
pc|c2|nt|po-s: and North will try to cash three spade tricks|pg||
nt|lml: there was never any risk in it anyway|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|lml: if South has the @HK instead of the QJ...|pg||
nt|petergill: I think a club switch is best now|pg||
nt|lml: it would be easier to do with 2 of them|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure about the spade lead - that would have guessed spades for declarer, who could then make simply by taking a heart finesse|pg||
nt|petergill: Then if declarer plays spades, the defence continues spades while the hearts are blocked, so |pg||
pc|s6|nt|dburn: but this is becoming serious - covering that club will allow the defenders to preserve communication and collect 500|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|petergill: after a club switch, declarer might have to unblock @HA then guess spades|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|c3|nt|finch: The problem with entering into this sort of auction is that NS have not shown a fit, and there could be a very large penalty|pg||
nt|finch: You just take the odd below-par partscore result|pg||
nt|daman: stay fixed|pg||
nt|finch: ....particular if they are going to play in 4@S in the other room|pg||
nt|daman: with apologies to Al Roth|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|gambit: 3NT went off one in the closed room  (as predicted by someone ) on board 33 for 5 Imps to VP |pg||
pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: @S8 upside down attitude -- does NOT like @S|pg||
nt|dburn: but pitching that spade will send it back to 300|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he did like spades - in effect, he unblocked the suit for declarer|pg||
nt|dburn: @s8 may have been upside-down suit preference for clubs, rather than reverse attitude in spades|pg||
pc|d8|pc|c4|pc|h5|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h4|nt|petergill: Declarer mwill have to guess the ending to make this|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|sunsamvar: hi all|pg||
pc|h6|nt|dburn: but whatever it was, it was a card with which West could not afford to signal, though it was almost impossible for even Meckstroth to know this|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|nt|bucheister: maybe S did not realize that the double was a strong hand and not the normal Meckwell|pg||
nt|gambit: cash th aces, exit with a spade|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: squeezing defense down to all winners|pg||
nt|petergill: the tricky bit is to cash @CA after winning @HA, playing for East to have started with one not two clubs|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|cT|mc|8|nt|petergill: North played for East to have more than one club|pg||
nt|fabsayc: kudos to the defense|pg||
nt|dburn: well, that was the less tricky bit... the tricky bit was the trick after that|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: so he does|pg||
nt|bucheister: very aggresive by n|pg||
nt|dburn: that is a brave double|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: a pedestrian 4@S coming up|pg||
mb|1D|nt|bucheister: Thank you Al; I always get the two confused; they should bar one of them|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|1N|nt|po-s: a bid for the hand, yes, but was it a hand for thee bid?|pg||

mb|d|an|!H and !C|nt|ahollan1: 2@H=nat, non-force|pg||
nt|dburn: but this time it is the opponents and not partner who will bid a lot of hearts|pg||
nt|petergill: Most people would discard @C7 on the West cards, alllowing Versace to read what the layout was, but Don Piafsky is too smart for that|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lml: north is playing for earthquake|pg||
nt|ady: should be held to 4 tricks|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|roswolf: was 2@D alerted?|pg||

nt|hedyg: @s lead should be automatic|pg||

nt|gambit: amazing how easy it is seeing all hands, I am going to talk to Fred about NS Vugraph, where we only see half the cards, see how clever we can all be seeing 26 vs 52 cards :) |pg||
mb|3C|nt|daman: time to fill up your lemonade|pg||

nt|poohbear: need low @s shift immediately|pg||
nt|panja: looks like W would have got 4 tricks in 1@H|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Hi Karen. Sunit is playing in the tourney. I am Sunil, only a commentator :)|pg||
nt|kareno: It's hard to double at the one-level for penalties |pg||
nt|kareno: Sunil :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Would be max|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|roswolf: or something stronger|pg||
mb|p|nt|bucheister: low spade would have gotten him|pg||
nt|dburn: a low spade might have given declarer a guess, but what with North's double, Rodwell might have put up the jack anyway|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Yep|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Rod will be pleasantly surprised with 3-2 trump|pg||
nt|bucheister: we will never know|pg||
nt|ahollan1: auction and @S6 probably place North with K & Q|pg||

mb|p|nt|lml: ?|pg||
nt|gambit: Why did Versace pull? They had them on the ropes |pg||
nt|lml: you could call that bid brave or you could call it ....|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i thinks 1nt on balance is more likely to help opponents|pg||
pc|h8|nt|lml: I think it is worse than just helpful... its asking to go for a number|pg||
nt|gambit: yes, toll free (800) give or take|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|nt|finch: 2@D was natural|pg||
nt|daman: the Francophones got much too high on Board 3    so 5 more to DeFalco|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hK|nt|finch: Declarer's problem is that if clubs don't run he doesn't have 10 tricks. Try giving North the same shape but the @CJ instead of the 4|pg||
nt|bucheister: the bid could have worked but probably more suited to MP|pg||
nt|lml: what do they say -1100 is character building|pg||
nt|ady: should be 11 imps for e/w   -1100|pg||
nt|lml: that will build some character for sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: believe me Linda it isnt|pg||
nt|dburn: I suspect that 2@h doubled would have cost quite a lot more than 800|pg||
nt|gambit: Even my mama says if you never go for a digit - you're not bidding enough.....something I fail to heed adhering to Alvin's philosophy :) |pg||
nt|lml: I wondered why he pulled?|pg||
nt|gambit: a low trump would hit the table so fast, it would be carnage|pg||
nt|lml: for those who want to play single dummy there is a way to set your settings to see only one hand|pg||

pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: i missed the opening @D lead :(|pg||
pc|h7|nt|xenya: the @S8 looked ominous -- now declarer can strongly suspect trumps are 4-1|pg||
nt|finch: Trumps 3-2 there's not problem, of course|pg||
nt|hedyg: and very bad for partnership!|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|bucheister: spade lead was probably more aggresive than a diamond anyway|pg||
nt|petergill: Now he plays with his son Barry, a former Canadian junior international|pg||
nt|dburn: at any rate, 3NT did make at the other table on 35 (spade lead)|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|lml: the trick is to play in the present as they say in sports|pg||

nt|rodal f: I know it's hard for N for N to pass to a check for penalty, but could come...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: anyway defense off to a good start, with many entry problems for declarer|pg||
nt|dburn: so that the Dutch-Canadian alliance is now 14 IMPs to the good|pg||
nt|lml: he knows where the clubs are which should help|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|daman: on BBO    Dano DeFalco is known as smispi      which is Italian for Mississippi|pg||
nt|xenya: not clear why N went up with the ace |pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|daman: or    it might be the blending of the names of his dogs :)|pg||
nt|finch: the club switch cleared up the suit while a heart switch would have led to some potential problems|pg||
nt|finch: Of course the defence don't know what declarer's problem is|pg||
nt|lml: later much later North has to repeat to himself I wont make bad overcalls vulnerable after 1NT|pg||
nt|rodal f: pass for a|pg||

pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|sJ|pc|d2|pg||

nt|ady: west might have to win this|pg||
nt|hedyg: how will he be endplayed?|pg||
nt|lml: so Kamil may step up|pg||
nt|gambit: I am sure he is asking himself as he struggles on this misfit with no communication betweek the two hands |pg||
mc|9|nt|gambit: wd!|pg||
nt|dburn: the original Blue Team philosophy, it is true, was to bid your own contracts and not go out of your way to take penalties, so that most doubles were just "extras, please bid on"|pg||

pc|h4|nt|daman: people have no sense of humo(u)r    I tried to make a joke and I get 300 messages|pg||
nt|kareno: Everyone liked the east hand for 1nt.  I'm not mad about it but it's not a terrible bid.  All roads lead to 3nt and diamonds don't break so push board.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|nt|xenya: we have quite a large audience -- 2060 people |pg||

pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|h7|nt|petergill: 4@S has better chances than 3NT|pg||

nt|gambit: I guess Lauria has seen those overcalls a few times |pg||
pc|s6|nt|daman: they can make 4@Ds|pg||
nt|finch: while opening a weak two with a 4-card major on the side is not traditional, with that hand you want to play|pg||
nt|finch: in hearts even if partner has four spades, which makes the 2@H opening better|pg||
nt|daman: actually   can make 5@D probably|pg||
nt|finch: NS may only be able to make 4@D but they can make 3NT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3nt not forcing so 7 out of the question|pg||

pc|d3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but it's A LAW  [as opposed to THE LAW]|pg||
nt|dburn: Versace's bidding throughout his long and hugely successful career has always been based not on "what have I got?" but "is it my turn?"|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bucheister: It is a bidders game; |pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|gambit: cute|pg||
nt|fabsayc: which leads to a new strategy, bid no trump with no stopper and all side suits covered|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@H is normal in Lauria - Versace's style. Their aim as a passed hand is to get into auctions on 5 card majors at the one level whenever possible, for various reasons.  |pg||
nt|fabsayc: and the worse the suit the better|pg||
pc|d9|nt|poohbear: poor gamesmanship on the part of MW|pg||

nt|po-s: Is this considered a long enough match to allow it? My guess is that it is allowed BUT you must provide a written def|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hedyg: making an overcall with that hand is not what i would call bidding|pg||
pc|c5|nt|dburn: well, we don't know what's really going on - I'm sure Jan will keep us posted|pg||
nt|dburn: not completely clear why East did not bid 2@d, mind|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|poohbear: I wonder if it would be an issue if they were up 50|pg||
nt|petergill: Martin's comment has some truth in it, even if he was joking. If you have overcalled 1@H on an ordinary suit and partner doesn't raise and they reach 3NT, you might lead something ...|pg||
nt|petergill: else. Their overcalling style and opening leads are very much interwoven. |pg||
pc|dA|nt|dburn: in the meantime, speculation is entertaining but fruitless|pg||

nt|dburn: of course, the odds on a vulnerable game change when if you go down, you go down a lot|pg||

mb|p|nt|daman: where is the temptation?|pg||
nt|ady: was opposit a passed hand|pg||
nt|lml: he would have otherwise for sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: cannot bid 1NT with just Jxx in @H|pg||

mb|p|nt|bucheister: I do not think that 1NT is a stretch|pg||
nt|ahollan1: imo -- that is a 2@H opener only if playing Intermediate 2's [ala Fantunes]|pg||
nt|dburn: well, East tried to run diamonds, but when West showed out he shifted to clubs, so declarer took six hearts and one of each|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same as before -- always 6+@C|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: 6@D?|pg||
nt|daman: gag|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 4@D looks like a splinter to everyone, right?|pg||
nt|bucheister: We have two interpretations of 3C|pg||
nt|po-s: of course...|pg||
nt|dburn: tough to sort this out - if West had @cK instead of @cQ, seven hearts would be a decent contract|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lml: no but he thinks game is unlikely opposite a passed partner|pg||
nt|bucheister: But 1nt may be a much better contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: YUP I AGREE BUT THERE IS A PLETORYA OF CONTROLS|pg||
nt|finch: A 2NT rebid makes it much easier for South to insist on spades|pg||
mb|2D|nt|kareno: I think east's is an overbid.|pg||

nt|roswolf: soory for the shouting:(|pg||
nt|po-s: rightsided...very clever system|pg||
nt|dburn: as it is, 6@h needs some luck - North rather than South needs to have @sK|pg||
nt|bucheister: Picked the right side this time|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: @H not bid until the 6-level!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: pure luck of the draw that North holds @SK|pg||
nt|bucheister: Winners make their own luck Al|pg||
nt|po-s: perhaps 4D was RKCB|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you need an agreement about 4 level delayed bids in partners suit, cue bid or choice of games|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: well they have agreed hearts I believe|pg||
nt|lml: and are looking for slam|pg||
nt|ady: 6NT  best    as 6@H would fail on bad trunp split  however the spades lay|pg||
nt|bucheister: This starting to get away from NG|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: well, 6@h is a shade better than 50%, since even if South did hold @sK, someone might have the singleton @cK|pg||
nt|gambit: EW a little greedy on that one, poor fit(s), modest texture,|pg||
nt|lml: a heart lead is the best I think|pg||
nt|fabsayc: then will versace take first round diamond finesse|pg||
nt|lml: but a club does look attractive|pg||
nt|petergill: What should East do if heart is led and @D10 is led from dummy at Trick 2? J, A or low?|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|ady: the gap might be closed here|pg||
nt|hedyg: the kind of slam i like, cant go wrong|pg||
nt|lml: it is a pretty normal slam to bid really... the OR should get there|pg||
nt|lml: the defense has 5 tricks now if they realize it|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|s4|nt|petergill: This spade play is perhaps designed to put the opponents off playing spades|pg||

nt|petergill: if so, it did not work|pg||
nt|lml: interesting|pg||
nt|gambit: Nice play by West |pg||
pc|s7|nt|bucheister: I think the other pair will also bid it; 50% minus 33% I think|pg||

pc|s9|pc|h7|pg||

nt|petergill: The discouraging @H2 at Trick 1 got the job done|pg||
nt|gambit: club through?|pg||
nt|lml: very nice play by West|pg||
nt|petergill: Then true count at Trick 2, when many players give Smith Signal here, helped West find the best defence. |pg||
nt|fabsayc: after the discard he can play hearts|pg||
nt|lml: it was just pointed out that all eight boards at this table have been played in notrump|pg||
nt|petergill: Barry Piafsky might be trying to work out why Versace has chosen such an unexpected line of play|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|h9|pc|c3|pg||
nt|po-s: not to mention the possibility of a different lead|pg||
nt|po-s: two shades...|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, as a practical matter 6@h may have been better still - although if 4@d really were a splinter, you could expect a spade lead a lot of the time|pg||
nt|po-s: yes, but it might well have been RKCB|pg||
nt|bucheister: Actually standard methods should get you close to 6H|pg||
nt|po-s: perhaps not "well" but who knows|pg||
nt|dburn: yes, but they would not get you very close to 6@h by West|pg||
nt|bucheister: Especially if you play minisplinters|pg||
nt|bucheister: So true|pg||
nt|bucheister: Feels like we are having a biological break|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: Now playing Bd 37 in 4@H W ... can not enter play-by-play|pg||
nt|poohbear: they are replaying the board|pg||
nt|othered1: May a pleyer who smokes demand the time to go smoke, or might it count against any time limits on play?|pg||

nt|fabsayc: this is one of the downsides to the 2nt bid|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i've seen other 5422 but don't recall seeing both majors|pg||
nt|bucheister: No they tend to open any balanced hand with 1NT|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes I agree Martin... what was the need to give a positive with a bad @H suit and singleton @DK|pg||
nt|kareno: I learned long ago not to get in the way of partner's prepared auction without a VERY GOOD REASON and KTxxx of hearts is not good enough.|pg||

nt|petergill: If the defence had kept another heart and switched to a low heart not @HQ, then unblocked @CK under the ace, 3NT might have failed|pg||
nt|lml: with 9 top tricks we move along ...|pg||
mb|1D|nt|petergill: Sory, I miscounted the tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: opposite a ph pd he could have AKJxx in @s and out?|pg||
nt|lml: even if he raises to 3@H you have a decent chance|pg||
nt|lml: then he bids 2@S|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lml: interesting bid by north here|pg||
nt|ady: 11 tricks in either major     1@H?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now 1@H is a bid i could predict|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ady: east will surely go as high as 5@C|pg||
mb|d|nt|lml: I do that some times when watching... funny its easier to do it watching than playing|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2H|nt|finch: Board 8, in the other room they haven't managed to get to 4@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would pass on a good day|pg||
nt|daman: Charlie will pass|pg||
nt|kareno: Diamond lead needed to defeat 6@h here.|pg||
nt|rodal f: So u're 26 Karen? I'm 17:)++|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: Rod's double showing Trap Pass of 1@S??|pg||
nt|dburn: that plus some suitability for defending against diamonds|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: forcing pass by S?|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, 26 and then some :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: automagic trump lead|pg||
nt|bucheister: 64 hands|pg||
nt|panja: @S lead might lead to only 11 tricks...seems 12 should be there...but might not be as easy|pg||
nt|rodal f: My first bidat S wouldhave been 3@S = renons splinter|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: a spec points out taht south was a passed hand ... then @H positive is probaly the right bid over 2@C|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@S = as previously discussed - if you are an Italian and have a 5 card major which you can overcall at the one level, hey presto|pg||
nt|fabsayc: as usual|pg||
nt|lml: it was the 7 that did it|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ady: great result for e/w  -100|pg||
nt|hedyg: we have bid a vulnerable game, they are defending nv, they are stealing from us|pg||
nt|lml: he wouldnt have overcalled 65432|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|nt|daman: Alphonse/Gaston|pg||
nt|lml: I think it should be a forcing pass but north didnt want it to be anyway|pg||
nt|hedyg: S surely thought his pass was forcing|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|lml: I am guessing South agreeds with you Hedy|pg||
nt|po-s: I would have thought it forcing|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|nt|daman: trump switch |pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ady: may now be an end play for down 1|pg||
nt|po-s: but wouldn´t argue strongly - an overcall and an inviting sound by me, does that force us?|pg||
nt|ady: but more likely will try to make  playing on diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: no but then when partner bids game vul ... yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: no PO, but pd bid 4@H|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|finch: Helgemo clearly noticing the vulnerability again - that might be a 1NT NV, but definitely not vul|pg||
nt|daman: @D &   they play 2/4  leads|pg||
nt|daman: @D7|pg||
pc|c4|nt|roswolf: remember the vikings - geir rarely respects vul|pg||
nt|xenya: trump now looks clear|pg||
nt|daman: duh|pg||
nt|xenya: and might result in -2|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lml: you and me Hedy we should play together|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: now @H misguess??|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|dburn: declarer can make this, but he may well not get the hearts right|pg||
nt|gambit: lucky 7?|pg||
nt|petergill: Good point Linda - much easier when commentating, as it is so much easier to be distracted when commentating (compared to playing) by reading other comments etc|pg||
pc|h5|nt|fabsayc: if 2c is natural trump lead is too passive|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hT|nt|lml: we are so on the same wavelength here|pg||
nt|hedyg: :) yes!!|pg||
nt|po-s: yes Hedy, on shape, what do I know?|pg||
nt|ady: now  down 2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wd|pg||
nt|dburn: he did - good for him|pg||
nt|bucheister: Yes Tom|pg||
nt|bucheister: That is quite a guess; kudos|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|po-s: wrong|pg||
nt|kareno: Still not good enough hearts, sorry.|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ady: down 1 again|pg||
nt|hedyg: we cannot guess that hand pd has can we? we just know our pass is forcing|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|nt|bucheister: I think two imps|pg||
nt|dburn: deserves more - that was a heck of a play in the heart suit|pg||
nt|bucheister: he has five more tricks|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree Martin. The rule for thrump lead is....|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pc|h2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: also we sometimes comment very quickly so the comments are relevant if not accurate :)|pg||

nt|ritong: not lauria s|pg||
pc|h4|nt|davidstern: The 4@S bid would be more successful if partner had four spades and less in hearts|pg||
nt|me argent: NOT LAURIAS|pg||

mc|9|nt|davidstern: No but when you are flat they often dont have a hspaely enough fit to bounce you out of the auction if it is right for you to bid|pg||
nt|ritong: ic|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.districtsix.org/Articles/Article%202009-08.aspx  -- amazing read by steve robinson showing how almost universal this double has become|pg||
nt|santyclz: And if you're flat, don't you want to defend anyway?|pg||

nt|petergill: After the 2@D cue bid raise by North, It looks like 2@S by South was either (1) weaker than passing 2@H or (2) less inclined to defend 2@H than Passing 2@H.  This is something ...|pg||
nt|petergill: which good pairs should discuss. |pg||
mb|1C|nt|fabsayc: thrump leads better be right :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 3NT for e/w|pg||
mb|1H|nt|po-s: I agree Magnus, not forcing, but some people hav rule that if we bid game vul, then we are forced|pg||
nt|kareno: They give up tempo.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|kareno: That would be a trap for declarer.|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: looks like  an 8-trick hand in Nt..B61|pg||
nt|kareno: Time about run out for Lambardi|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i lead trumps a lot, but east had a very natural diamond alternative|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lml: definitely something the partnership should discuss|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: Lucky club lie here.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: note how much different that result if 2@DX = game|pg||
mb|p|pc|dT|nt|lml: still I think south thought it was forcing|pg||
nt|lml: otherwise he would have doubled|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Lead = 0 or 2 higher|pg||
nt|lml: this should go down|pg||
nt|lml: but it seems likely to be bid in the CR|pg||
nt|fabsayc: still this is a free finesse|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: west a little conservative    might have doubled 1st round |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: this should seal the match|pg||
pc|d3|nt|daman: on Board 9 in the OR    NS are in 2@S  on the 6-0   lol|pg||
nt|rodal f: Trump at a partscore often use to be right, at a game u often loose tempo.|pg||
nt|panja: this might bet interesting|pg||
nt|kareno: Certainly looks bad for declarer.|pg||
nt|panja: E cannot unblock @C as S has @CT..|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: if he unblocks, south has his 9th trick :)|pg||
nt|panja: and if S wins, plays a @D to @DK and a @S...E might actually get squeezed in a strategic manner|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|panja: possibly E will be endplayed to @D away for the ninth trick..|pg||
nt|petergill: NS Convention Card at http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008MindSportGamesBeijing/Open/Italy/lauria-versace.pdf = Standard with some gadgets|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kareno: But can that be the right play?  If diamonds are coming, then spades aren't needed.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: that 8 lead should warm him... so may not unblock|pg||
pc|d5|nt|dburn: this has some chance also, I guess|pg||
nt|bucheister: Courtesy of Bob "Tiger" Morris of Dayton OH; when men were men|pg||
nt|kareno: Well yes, ten of clubs and club ruff in dummy.|pg||
nt|bucheister: I thought NS played precision|pg||
nt|kareno: That raise is pretty alarming though.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope - but their teammates in Open Room are playing Big Club with Weak NT|pg||
nt|dburn: as long as declarer rejects the Principle of Restricted Choice in favour of the notion that East might have led a singleton club if he had one|pg||
nt|poohbear: Hamman played for 8x|pg||
nt|kareno: Correct.|pg||
nt|dburn: still, I guess that playing for East to have the doubleton eight is a much better shot|pg||
pc|c4|nt|roswolf: but no double no trouble:)|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: versace preparing for hearts offside|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lml: after you make that lead you spend a while trying not to think about whether that let the contract through|pg||

nt|kareno: Yes, as opposed to specifically doubleton QJ|pg||

pc|s7|pc|s8|pg||
nt|kareno: Ng also knows his probabilities|pg||
nt|panja: it seems timing was the issue, now, by the time a @S trick is developed, E would be able to keep right cards to take 5 tricks..|pg||

mb|p|nt|po-s: I am surprised he bid only 3C over patner´s 2NT|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: agree PO, 3NT looked automatic|pg||
nt|panja: that was GIB conclusion|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lml: the vulnerable west made an awful overcall of 1NT|pg||
nt|ady: decent 6 spades here|pg||
nt|lml: North should bid again|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Rod's PASS=0-5 or trap pass  --  but operator already entered that |pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: okay its tough|pg||
nt|lml: I am looking at the hands |pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: the 3@D bid made it easier for NS to reach 4@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: de falco leaps ahead|pg||

mb|1D|nt|daman: doink is what you hear on BBO when there is a claim    for the hearing impaired it is <doink>|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, that is always more interesting.  However, we have seen some good hands.  Better luck to us tomorrow.|pg||
mb|2S|mb|d|nt|roswolf: well this is a bidding test after a weak 2@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: E/W MAY WELL PUNT THE GRAND SLAM|pg||
nt|finch: it's a test of how sound your weak twos are. If partner might have QJ10xx you need to tread more carefully|pg||
nt|daman: as predicted   Zimmerman recouped 11 on Board 10    settled in 3NT|pg||
nt|xenya: i would bid 4@H if that doesn't show a powerhouse|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5NT is a popular bid for the specs|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 5 NT?|pg||
nt|po-s: You have KQx in trumps and suggest that partner should decide...|pg||
nt|lml: brb need lots of coffee|pg||
nt|lml: well you are missing controls in both minors|pg||
nt|bucheister: Too strong a word; OK|pg||
mb|3S|nt|daman: 5NT is very perilous     cannot count 13 tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah science|pg||
nt|lml: I think when you bid 5@H you are saying that you have hearts and spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: it is easy for us, but what about SJ?|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|roswolf: true good point p-o|pg||
nt|po-s: now not many heart ruffs likely in East´s hand|pg||
nt|lml: and if partner has the minors controlled then he should bid it|pg||
nt|lml: back soon|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: D0P1 here, so 1 ace|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=LR, 4+@S  [rare 3@S]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S = zero game interest|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: RM Precision uses  1@H/@S-3@C as game forcing raise|pg||
nt|bucheister: 3S = probably going down|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Should be a push.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: belay that -- 2N=LR+   |pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: I am a simple soul, when partner jumps to 4S over my 1NT I assume HE (she?) has the spades|pg||
nt|hedyg: what did you say re paralyse PO?|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: pass was DOPI|pg||
pc|sK|nt|roswolf: hmm well they tried but no cigar|pg||
nt|daman: 5NT night have asked for specific Kings|pg||
nt|poohbear: correct al|pg||
pc|s2|nt|po-s: of course he wasn´t going to bid it|pg||
nt|finch: he suspects grand is on the club finesse at best, which is reasonably likely to be wrong|pg||
nt|po-s: but tes, 5NT would have solved the CK problem|pg||
pc|sT|nt|daman: if partner had bid 5@C  (@CK)    7 was easy|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|petergill: A boring 11 tricks here|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|nt|kareno: 3 hearts, two spades, two diamonds - I think best line is to try for two clubs also.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: which minor suit will he go for ?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kareno: Diamonds aren't good enough to press out if they don't break.|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|d7|nt|panja: this way, with two @C tricks, 8 tricks can be counted..|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|nt|sunsamvar: agree Karen|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|lml: wont take long|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lml: so less boring|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kareno: We can see they break but that's not the point :)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bucheister: This is the next to last board; thanks to all the commentators and specs; this was a great show by MR|pg||
pc|s5|nt|po-s: that was Ron Anderson´s favourite expression when a defender screwed up his returns|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hedyg: i will remember it|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|ady: south will feel the pressure in a moment|pg||
nt|hedyg: last board of this segment now|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kareno: With 2 club tricks, that's nine.|pg||
pc|s7|pc|h4|pc|h9|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|nt|fabsayc: odds for 3 clubs are about the same as diamonds 33|pg||
nt|gambit: Europeans underseeded, true enough - I face the same problem myself |pg||
mc|11|nt|panja: both Majors are 3-3 so all is well whichever way the play goes..|pg||

nt|hedyg: we will be back in 2 and half hours|pg||
nt|kareno: How are you going to collect a penalty if north takes out the double?|pg||
nt|petergill: 5@D would have been doubled by Versace for 500|pg||
nt|gambit: as my partner Zia used to say to me - claim before you make a mistake |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kareno: Yes, it is.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|me argent: dont think they play pen doubles over 1nt karen|pg||
nt|bucheister: seems like a solid pass; even have a five card suit to lead|pg||
nt|kareno: Ahh .. not a penalty double.  Takeout I guess.  I'd be passing anyway.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|po-s: perhaps 5NT hasn´t reache Norway - OR Helness didn´t want to hear 7H|pg||
nt|roswolf: competent sequence|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|me argent: EW cold 4 1nt on the expected @H lead|pg||
nt|bucheister: Maybe they are playing double as a one suiter|pg||
nt|me argent: NS sorry|pg||
nt|me argent: EW double sorry|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|sA|nt|po-s: does the operator know abt the other matches?|pg||
nt|panja: else 4@H would have been a cakewalk..the bidding does not uncover it as it has gone too fast for that..|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lml: the van Prooljen team didnt play badly at all at this table but they will have some work in the last quarter to win|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|nt|hedyg: probably not|pg||

nt|lml: 31 to zip|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: Yes ... hello Al|pg||
mc|10|nt|daman: making 3NT|pg||
nt|gambit: V-L, very tough, not counting Seamon at the other table..... perhaps a little "swinging" in the last quarter |pg||
nt|fabsayc: what is interesting here is how Lauria-Versace win with what in effect is a very natural and simple system|pg||
nt|gambit: tell that to Murray - Kehela|pg||
nt|lml: back in about 45 minutes|pg||
nt|gambit: thx all|pg||
nt|lml: definitely going to need lots of black coffee but it will be worth it|pg||
nt|petergill: Long story: In last year's Spingold, Cayne and Team 62 were almost tied at halftime. Midway through the 3rd quarter, hotel staff came to the table and told Cayne's opponent that he ...|pg||
nt|petergill: must take a phone call. "No way," he replied. "But you will be in contempt of court if you don't  take the call." So Cayne's opponents asked Cayne's kibitzer if he could play ...|pg||
nt|petergill: bridge. Yes. Cayne has no objection to the kibitzer (who had perhaps 10 masterpoints) filling in for several boards....   |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Word of explanation:  Sometimes the play at this table goes very fast, and one player doesn't show his cards very well, so I got behind once or twice....|pg||
nt|fabsayc: thanks all, i suspect we will be switching match for 4th segment|pg||
nt|petergill: Up by about 30 imps with 16 boards to go, Cayne would normally sit out his own partnership for the last segment, but against a team who has the kibitzer fill in, he decided to play ...|pg||
nt|petergill: the last 16 boards of last year's Spingold, and Cayne's team lost the match by about 2 imps. So this time you can expect the Italian and Polish pairs to play the last 16 boards of ...|pg||
nt|petergill: this match. |pg||
nt|petergill: This really happened. The story has not been told in writing before, anywhere.|pg||
nt|petergill: Bye everyone. See you in 35 minutes. |pg||

nt|petergill: 2009 Bermuda Bowl, Vlad Isporski - Val Kovachev who narrowly missed out on making last year's Bulgarian Open Team, and Walter Johnson - Dennis Dawson. |pg||
