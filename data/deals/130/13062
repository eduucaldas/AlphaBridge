mb|p|mb|1H|nt|Walddk2: I know Wolkowitz is pretty young, haven't heard about Agica I must confess|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Sorry - -2. I was distracted by sending someone off to get the scores from the other matches |pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|petergill: This time it's North who has all queens and jacks, so he might remove the penalty double of the 11-14 1NT|pg||

nt|petergill: South has a tough opening lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: @S10 obviously best but that's easy for us to see|pg||

mb|1D|nt|roswolf: another fun hand|pg||
nt|bucheister: Maybe that S hand is a little too strong and suited for 1NT at imps|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2H|nt|daman: lots of shape|pg||
nt|daman: 2@C is the only safe place for NS should they compete|pg||
nt|lml: now that to me is a very borderline opening|pg||
nt|lml: did north really bid 1@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: they will|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: hey sit for it... right its not game|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@H was a transfer bid|pg||
nt|ady: south managed to get into the bidding 2nd round|pg||
mb|p|pc|c3|pc|cA|nt|dburn: to some extent, but you could see why he would want to protect his major-suit holdings|pg||
pc|c2|nt|daman: would we all have bid 2@S over the double?|pg||
nt|bucheister: these are all relays|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15, 2+@D   2@C=one round force   2@H=11-13 bal|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: 2@S forces 2N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N is normal game try|pg||
pc|h2|nt|dburn: 2@h showed a weak no trump, 2@s was a transfer to notrump to get East to be declarer|pg||
pc|hA|nt|xenya: i confess i would|pg||
nt|roswolf: so would i|pg||
nt|lml: well this got north the spade lead which is a pretty good one|pg||
nt|bucheister: they must always accept the transfer; most of the pair accept with at least three|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|bucheister: If you are going to open that 1NT you have to convince yourself to compete later in the auction|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hQ|nt|ady: this should be a + for n/s    neither quite able to doubvle 1NT|pg||
nt|lml: South had a shot at doubling but not north|pg||
nt|panja: 11 tricks because after @SQ drops...@SJ can be finessed|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c6|pg||
nt|lml: I think this is pretty normal|pg||
nt|kareno: The percentage on the heart finesse was not 50-50, rather it was three to one.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|daman: would garbage stayman apply over the double?|pg||
nt|roswolf: where was the axe? somebody asks?|pg||
nt|roswolf: not with me|pg||
nt|finch: it's quite handy to bid a natural 2@C over the double|pg||
nt|xenya: axe? what axe?|pg||
nt|daman: on Board 1   repeated @D tap held declarer to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|daman: I have been advised they use 2@C as either clubs or two suits if run when doubled|pg||
nt|finch: it's very difficult for North to double; his partner has shown nothing other than long clubs|pg||
nt|finch: East could be 5=5 rather than 5=4|pg||
nt|roswolf: very true frances|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|pc|c8|pg||
nt|lml: great defense so far|pg||
nt|bucheister: would a doubleof one heart be a takeout double of 1S?|pg||
nt|bucheister: I don't think game tries are in their vocabulary|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|bucheister: or would it be hearts?|pg||
nt|lml: you could play that|pg||
nt|lml: you could play it either way.  you should agree|pg||
nt|ady: I think most play double of 1 heart shows hearts and bid 1 spade with short spades as a take-out|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes 1@s takeout|pg||
nt|lml: ace and out a heart looks decent approach for south|pg||
nt|bucheister: specs should discuss this with their partnerships because this is becoming very common|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|hedyg: np Richard, sometimes they play too fast for the operator to keep up|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|ady: e/w   likely to end in 3NT|pg||
nt|lml: 3@C looks a bit better than I usually play it|pg||
nt|dburn: now, that is a strange sort of 2@h overcall, but it came to no harm|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all 3rd seat NT opener's are treated as "weak"  so this DBL=14+ HCP|pg||
mb|3D|nt|dburn: not sure what West is supposed to do here - take a view and pass, or scramble to 2@c|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|bucheister: he certainly has the right cards for partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|bucheister: You are doing a great job; thank you|pg||

mb|p|mb|4C|nt|roswolf: all very normal|pg||
nt|daman: back to back 3@H contracts for EW    could have 3 for 3 had West balanced :)|pg||
nt|finch: tHelgemo put off protecting by the vulnerability (and the fact it isn't matchpoints)|pg||
nt|lml: well they now have 9 top tricks |pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure it will come up this hand, but EW play Reverse Smith Echo vs NT|pg||

nt|ady: likely 10 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: now can make 10, yes|pg||

nt|panja: and North has natural Club suit..so naturally, N has higher ambitions|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: transfers over 2nt rebid would work better|pg||

nt|fabsayc: np|pg||
nt|kareno: I use Gladiator after 2nt rebid.  Then 3@c - 3@s - 3nt is suggesting club slam but south would quit.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this auction completely off the rails now|pg||
mb|5S|nt|fabsayc: or 3s over 2nt with transfers also ending in 3nt|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Rod has so many options while still holding @DA|pg||
nt|panja: In the OR, S opened a Prec 1@C, it seems like, so they had time to explore below 3N and stop at 3N|pg||
pc|h7|nt|po-s: and North will try to cash three spade tricks|pg||
nt|lml: there was never any risk in it anyway|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lml: if South has the @HK instead of the QJ...|pg||

pc|c5|nt|finch: Declarer's problem is that if clubs don't run he doesn't have 10 tricks. Try giving North the same shape but the @CJ instead of the 4|pg||

pc|h3|pg||
nt|daman: or    it might be the blending of the names of his dogs :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|USBF: Multi is definitely legal - I wasn't in the room so don't know what the problem was.|pg||

mb|p|nt|USBF: Probably they're just going on to the next board so the director can think about whatever issue was raised|pg||

mb|p|nt|panja: how did they come to know 6 was the limit?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|daman: they can make 4@Ds|pg||
nt|finch: while opening a weak two with a 4-card major on the side is not traditional, with that hand you want to play|pg||
nt|finch: in hearts even if partner has four spades, which makes the 2@H opening better|pg||
nt|daman: actually   can make 5@D probably|pg||

pc|hA|nt|daman: in case anyone missed it   Dan Wolkowitz (West) is one of our regular VyGraph operators|pg||
nt|joest: 4@d is both without a slam try?|pg||
nt|joest: in other words, can Weinstein conclude that Levin is tentatively rejecting a slam try?|pg||
nt|petergill: North recognises that @DKQ and @CKJ are not ideal cards opposite both majors 4-4 or 5-4|pg||
nt|joest: b/c if he is, Weinstein is all done it seems to me|pg||
nt|daman: he will give it a nudge|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@H by North = 4 hearts, not as interested in slam as 4@D would be|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6NT is perhaps slightly better than 6@H|pg||
nt|joest: make north's diamond queen the spade queen and it's a good slam.  Presumably Levin would bid differently?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6NT may make even if hearts are 4-1, 6@H has no chance if they are|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Weinstein still thinking about bidding more|pg||
nt|joest: unwinding 5-4 in the majors is sometimes a problem with puppet stayman|pg||
nt|joest: you can't regress to typical 'Smolen' auctions|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C strong, 2@D relay, 2NT strong balanced (about 23), 3@C Puppet Stayman, 3@D at least one 4 card major|pg||
nt|joest: there are various 'tricks' to get around it|pg||
nt|joest: but some influence the ability to send a clear slam try too|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Another opetion is to let 3@S show five spades and four hearts. Different approaches|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@C slam try with usually 4-4 (or 5-4) in majors, 4@h to play, South adds 9 to 23 and realises that slam is touch and go - will he go?|pg||

mb|p|nt|bucheister: I do not think that 1NT is a stretch|pg||
nt|ahollan1: imo -- that is a 2@H opener only if playing Intermediate 2's [ala Fantunes]|pg||

nt|bucheister: We have two interpretations of 3C|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Levin "So is he saying he doesn't care what your minor is?" Agica says he thought that 3@d was pass or correct, so he bid 3@s to show black suits. Now he thinks W just has @ds|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 800 it is|pg||

mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|daman: it's a question of degree|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|joest: in closed room, east also overcalled 1@d with 1@s instead of a t/o double.  Many would start with double|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not obvious to bid with the West cards|pg||
nt|joest: west did well to scrape up 2@h in the other room|pg||

nt|ady: 980 was flat on hand 24|pg||
nt|hedyg: as expected|pg||
nt|lml: on the lie of the cards you make a lot of hearts or spades east west|pg||
nt|po-s: so now PP1D to East?|pg||
nt|ady: this should finish in 4@H e/w|pg||
nt|po-s: Easy 4H for those of us who can see all cards|pg||
nt|hedyg: slowly...|pg||
nt|panja: there is just not enough space after 2@C opening to manage things gracefully|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: i just think 5@H is going to gain nothing -- does it ask for @H, ask for @S, ask Exclusion ???   takes too much space to be so non-descript|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: would everybody bid 2H now?|pg||
nt|hedyg: it might end here|pg||
nt|lml: I would want to bid something|pg||
nt|po-s: gambling that partner has his values (some) outside hearts|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: now this could be a fascinating 3nt|pg||
nt|lml: so did he|pg||
nt|ady: now easy|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@H is an overbid, even for a passed hand|pg||
nt|lml: and there was no other sensible bid so you are forced into it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: sure there is, south could wait or positive with 2d|pg||
mb|4N|nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-16|pg||

mb|p|nt|lml: yes it is but you think you have too much to pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but holding @CAK - when is south supposed to bid slam?|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@C puppet?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|hedyg: what is the redeeming value of the hand? the 4 small @ds?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: am i the only one surprised to see Meck 1N with 4@S & 5@H?|pg||
nt|kareno: I absolutely agree!! The heart suit is NOT good enough to use all that space showing it.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|daman: NS use Smith Echo|pg||
nt|xenya: this may be a killer?|pg||
nt|lml: I agree 2@H is an overbid|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h9|nt|roswolf: yup going for the weak spot|pg||
nt|lml: I know just what he was thinking though|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
nt|po-s: Me, I would bid 2H, but my partners may have a good hand even white|pg||
nt|lml: partner can have a wide range of hands and I hate to pass |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|daman: nailing them in the cusp|pg||
pc|d9|nt|roswolf: nice play|pg||
nt|finch: More perhaps that a spade lead was very unappealing from such a holding with them well stopped on his right|pg||
nt|finch: Dummy will have at most two hearts (no 3@H bid over 2NT)|pg||
nt|daman: Charlie has been through a lot of battles    I'm sure his @H Q was well thought out|pg||
nt|xenya: S's spade holding is too unattractive to lead from|pg||
nt|roswolf: now needs to play a heart i think|pg||
pc|d2|nt|daman: gag|pg||
nt|roswolf: not good enough i fear|pg||
nt|daman: If he led a @H   he shd continue|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed george|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|lml: yes thats it|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|c6|nt|daman: Dano could have played 10@H|pg||
pc|d4|nt|roswolf: yes would have assisted south|pg||
nt|daman: Charlie had to have led from QJ9|pg||
nt|lml: exactly|pg||
nt|hedyg: "maybe my pd has 16 hcps with @h fit and a singleton @D so i better bid"?|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|lml: or he has 16 points and really good spades and your hearts are a help (and your spades)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i've seen other 5422 but don't recall seeing both majors|pg||
nt|bucheister: No they tend to open any balanced hand with 1NT|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes I agree Martin... what was the need to give a positive with a bad @H suit and singleton @DK|pg||
nt|kareno: I learned long ago not to get in the way of partner's prepared auction without a VERY GOOD REASON and KTxxx of hearts is not good enough.|pg||

nt|joest: it's also the poster child for starting with a double with easts hand.  West might jump in hearts, or jump to game after some strength showing sound by east|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Very good result for Fleisher|pg||
nt|Walddk2: N-S can make 11 tricks in either major|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D looks like a fit jump, it may be a fit showing jump, I'm not sure|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Weinstein asks about 2@d. Wolkowitz: "I think it's weak - we definitely play 2M as weak"|pg||
mb|2C|an|GF either !C or balanced|nt|joest: notice Levin passes with 7-4 AT THE ONE LEVEL at unfavorable :)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: This EW pair should spend much more time on discussing agreements. Not the first time they did not agree as to a meaning of a bid|pg||
pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|nt|hedyg: opposite a ph pd he could have AKJxx in @s and out?|pg||
nt|lml: even if he raises to 3@H you have a decent chance|pg||
nt|lml: then he bids 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: interesting bid by north here|pg||
nt|ady: 11 tricks in either major     1@H?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now 1@H is a bid i could predict|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ady: east will surely go as high as 5@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|finch: Board 8, in the other room they haven't managed to get to 4@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would pass on a good day|pg||
nt|daman: Charlie will pass|pg||
nt|kareno: Diamond lead needed to defeat 6@h here.|pg||
nt|rodal f: So u're 26 Karen? I'm 17:)++|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: Rod's double showing Trap Pass of 1@S??|pg||
nt|dburn: that plus some suitability for defending against diamonds|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|hedyg: forcing pass by S?|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, 26 and then some :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: automagic trump lead|pg||
nt|bucheister: 64 hands|pg||
nt|panja: @S lead might lead to only 11 tricks...seems 12 should be there...but might not be as easy|pg||
nt|rodal f: My first bidat S wouldhave been 3@S = renons splinter|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: a spec points out taht south was a passed hand ... then @H positive is probaly the right bid over 2@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: great result for e/w  -100|pg||
nt|hedyg: we have bid a vulnerable game, they are defending nv, they are stealing from us|pg||
mb|p|pc|h6|nt|daman: Alphonse/Gaston|pg||
nt|lml: I think it should be a forcing pass but north didnt want it to be anyway|pg||
nt|hedyg: S surely thought his pass was forcing|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lml: I am guessing South agreeds with you Hedy|pg||
nt|po-s: I would have thought it forcing|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|pg||
nt|daman: trump switch |pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ady: may now be an end play for down 1|pg||
nt|po-s: but wouldn´t argue strongly - an overcall and an inviting sound by me, does that force us?|pg||
nt|ady: but more likely will try to make  playing on diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: no but then when partner bids game vul ... yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: no PO, but pd bid 4@H|pg||
pc|h7|nt|finch: Helgemo clearly noticing the vulnerability again - that might be a 1NT NV, but definitely not vul|pg||
nt|daman: @D &   they play 2/4  leads|pg||
nt|daman: @D7|pg||
pc|h4|nt|roswolf: remember the vikings - geir rarely respects vul|pg||
nt|xenya: trump now looks clear|pg||
nt|daman: duh|pg||
nt|xenya: and might result in -2|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|lml: you and me Hedy we should play together|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: now @H misguess??|pg||
pc|h9|nt|dburn: declarer can make this, but he may well not get the hearts right|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|fabsayc: if 2c is natural trump lead is too passive|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lml: we are so on the same wavelength here|pg||
nt|hedyg: :) yes!!|pg||
nt|po-s: yes Hedy, on shape, what do I know?|pg||

pc|c6|pg||
mc|12|nt|bucheister: I think two imps|pg||

pc|c4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't understand why Fleisher signed off in 3@C. 2NT must show some kind of club fit|pg||
nt|joest: it does seem a bit conservative|pg||
nt|joest: as specs point out north has to lead a diamond to beat 5@c b/c the king of hearts ruffs out third|pg||
nt|joest: leading the king just speeds things up :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Many of the matches have broken. When we finish I'll try to get half time scores from the ones that have finished|pg||

pc|cA|pc|cJ|pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||

pc|h5|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|s3|nt|petergill: If @CA and @HK were switched, West's conservative decision at the other table might have been right, but staying out of 3NT vulnerable at imps is not usually best percentage bridge|pg||
nt|joest: true|pg||
nt|joest: this looks to be 11 to Agica|pg||
nt|daman: right|pg||

mb|1S|nt|fabsayc: thrump leads better be right :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 3NT for e/w|pg||
mb|1N|nt|po-s: I agree Magnus, not forcing, but some people hav rule that if we bid game vul, then we are forced|pg||
nt|kareno: They give up tempo.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|kareno: That would be a trap for declarer.|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: looks like  an 8-trick hand in Nt..B61|pg||
nt|kareno: Time about run out for Lambardi|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i lead trumps a lot, but east had a very natural diamond alternative|pg||
mb|3D|nt|lml: definitely something the partnership should discuss|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|kareno: Lucky club lie here.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: note how much different that result if 2@DX = game|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: still I think south thought it was forcing|pg||
nt|lml: otherwise he would have doubled|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: west a little conservative    might have doubled 1st round |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: this should seal the match|pg||
pc|c8|nt|daman: on Board 9 in the OR    NS are in 2@S  on the 6-0   lol|pg||
nt|rodal f: Trump at a partscore often use to be right, at a game u often loose tempo.|pg||
nt|panja: this might bet interesting|pg||
nt|kareno: Certainly looks bad for declarer.|pg||
nt|panja: E cannot unblock @C as S has @CT..|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: if he unblocks, south has his 9th trick :)|pg||
nt|panja: and if S wins, plays a @D to @DK and a @S...E might actually get squeezed in a strategic manner|pg||
pc|cK|nt|panja: possibly E will be endplayed to @D away for the ninth trick..|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kareno: But can that be the right play?  If diamonds are coming, then spades aren't needed.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: that 8 lead should warm him... so may not unblock|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|dburn: this has some chance also, I guess|pg||
nt|bucheister: Courtesy of Bob "Tiger" Morris of Dayton OH; when men were men|pg||
nt|kareno: Well yes, ten of clubs and club ruff in dummy.|pg||
nt|bucheister: I thought NS played precision|pg||
nt|kareno: That raise is pretty alarming though.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope - but their teammates in Open Room are playing Big Club with Weak NT|pg||
nt|dburn: as long as declarer rejects the Principle of Restricted Choice in favour of the notion that East might have led a singleton club if he had one|pg||
nt|poohbear: Hamman played for 8x|pg||
nt|kareno: Correct.|pg||
nt|dburn: still, I guess that playing for East to have the doubleton eight is a much better shot|pg||
pc|d8|nt|roswolf: but no double no trouble:)|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|nt|lml: after you make that lead you spend a while trying not to think about whether that let the contract through|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Laughter at T 1|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, as opposed to specifically doubleton QJ|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ady: will make 11 tricks on K@H lead|pg||

nt|panja: y|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: right Martin|pg||
nt|kareno: Okay, spade now needed.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|panja: a @S now..and E's discard might be the crucial play|pg||

pc|hK|pc|s5|nt|kareno: Ng also knows his probabilities|pg||

pc|d6|nt|sunsamvar: isn't it better to set up the east hand ?|pg||
nt|rodal f: They have given us many nice boards by there active bidding. |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|me argent: me 2 barry|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|pg||
nt|lml: does anybody else think north might have moved?|pg||
nt|kareno: Sort of the wrong vulnerability for that bid by south.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: as north my ho;d long @H|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hold|pg||
pc|c4|nt|roswolf: no real option but to play for it|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|finch: unfortunately he is still short of 10 tricks|pg||
nt|daman: Tiger Woods has announced he will return to golf at the Masters in April|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes indeed|pg||
nt|po-s: how 10 tricks?|pg||
nt|finch: 5 trumps, two clubs, one diamond and one spade is only 9 tricks|pg||
nt|finch: he needed either to set clubs up or to make enough tricks by ruffing|pg||
nt|finch: if he tries to make 6 trump tricks he can never make a diamond trick, it's still not enough tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: but now he won't get a @S trick if E pitches the duece|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|hedyg: bidding 1NT with fit and an opening hand is not what forcing 1NT is about imo|pg||
nt|poohbear: Didnt sto pZia|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|h6|nt|finch: yes, now he is two off (as everyone with GIB already knows)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lml: yes that started things off on the wrong foot|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hedyg: he should have moved over 1@s, not over 4|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|finch: but when he playing to ruff clubs, he needed them to break|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: 3@H should be EASIER versus the big club auction|pg||
pc|h9|pc|d3|pg||
pc|s9|nt|poohbear: i agree|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i'm reminded  it was also Big Club auction at other table -- thanks martin|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: doink is what you hear on BBO when there is a claim    for the hearing impaired it is <doink>|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, that is always more interesting.  However, we have seen some good hands.  Better luck to us tomorrow.|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|roswolf: well this is a bidding test after a weak 2@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: E/W MAY WELL PUNT THE GRAND SLAM|pg||
nt|finch: it's a test of how sound your weak twos are. If partner might have QJ10xx you need to tread more carefully|pg||
nt|daman: as predicted   Zimmerman recouped 11 on Board 10    settled in 3NT|pg||
nt|xenya: i would bid 4@H if that doesn't show a powerhouse|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5NT is a popular bid for the specs|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 5 NT?|pg||
nt|po-s: You have KQx in trumps and suggest that partner should decide...|pg||
nt|lml: brb need lots of coffee|pg||
nt|lml: well you are missing controls in both minors|pg||
nt|bucheister: Too strong a word; OK|pg||
mb|1N|nt|daman: 5NT is very perilous     cannot count 13 tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah science|pg||
nt|lml: I think when you bid 5@H you are saying that you have hearts and spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: it is easy for us, but what about SJ?|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|roswolf: true good point p-o|pg||
nt|po-s: now not many heart ruffs likely in East´s hand|pg||
nt|lml: and if partner has the minors controlled then he should bid it|pg||
nt|lml: back soon|pg||
mb|3N|nt|roswolf: D0P1 here, so 1 ace|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=LR, 4+@S  [rare 3@S]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S = zero game interest|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: RM Precision uses  1@H/@S-3@C as game forcing raise|pg||
nt|bucheister: 3S = probably going down|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Should be a push.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: belay that -- 2N=LR+   |pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: I am a simple soul, when partner jumps to 4S over my 1NT I assume HE (she?) has the spades|pg||
nt|hedyg: what did you say re paralyse PO?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|daman: pass was DOPI|pg||
pc|hT|nt|roswolf: hmm well they tried but no cigar|pg||
nt|daman: 5NT night have asked for specific Kings|pg||
nt|poohbear: correct al|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|po-s: of course he wasn´t going to bid it|pg||
nt|finch: he suspects grand is on the club finesse at best, which is reasonably likely to be wrong|pg||
nt|po-s: but tes, 5NT would have solved the CK problem|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|daman: if partner had bid 5@C  (@CK)    7 was easy|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|cJ|nt|kareno: 3 hearts, two spades, two diamonds - I think best line is to try for two clubs also.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: which minor suit will he go for ?|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|kareno: Diamonds aren't good enough to press out if they don't break.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|nt|panja: this way, with two @C tricks, 8 tricks can be counted..|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||
