mb|p|nt|barnets: look at this heart suit|pg||
mb|1H|nt|barnets: how to play in 6@H|pg||
mb|2C|nt|barnets: for 1 loser|pg||
nt|scotty: E-W missed the pretty good slam in CR|pg||
nt|roswolf: with difficulty|pg||
mb|d|nt|barnets: he Ace and north plays the 10 ?|pg||
nt|scotty: key is for N to play 10 with 10x, K10x and Q10x.  First is easy, last two are dangerous unless you know a lot about the hand|pg||
nt|barnets: if you lead up to the ace and north plays the 10|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: bidding this slam isnt a doddle|pg||
nt|dburn: you can save yourself these agonies by just cashing the ace - that's as good as anything else|pg||
nt|barnets: right he must play the 10 from H10x to give you a guess|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|scotty: North bid 3@c in the other room - but that was after a Strong Club opening|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: finis?|pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: Against almost all opponents, better to lead toward ace - then you pick up KQ10 also|pg||
nt|barnets: so 6 is decent on the cards|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes and neither room got close|pg||
nt|barnets: yes then tou can play the J with safety|pg||
pc|h3|nt|barnets: as theopps have not learned the play of the 10|pg||

nt|barnets: this is a good slam|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|roswolf: well where will the arrow fall this time|pg||
nt|dburn: not so bad - @hQJ doubleton or the club finesse, but they might lead a club to remove an option |pg||

nt|roswolf: a diamond looks best since it cuts communications|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d7|pc|h4|nt|roswolf: but reducing communications is a good principle|pg||

nt|scotty: Game was about 70%|pg||

mb|3N|nt|scotty: Should be a routine slam.  Even 3@c opening by W wouldn't help - 3@s, 5@c, 6@s|pg||

mb|p|mb|4C|nt|barnets: asks for sing|pg||

nt|dburn: you|pg||

mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: spade slam it seems..|pg||

mb|3N!|an|!s support, some singleton|mb|p|nt|jcwla: The 3NT on 22 meant 10 to Scotland.  But a passout on 23 (where 4@H made here) gave 12 back to England to within 2!|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: thanks to viewgraph we know what 3NT means|pg||
nt|jcwla: The OR E counted HCP and @S's and got to 14 -- and elected to tap the table.|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Im not sure they are getting there after this start...|pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: a direct 4@c would also show @c shortage and @s support, I don't know the difference|pg||
mb|4D!|mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: it can be made on a diiferent line I perhaps just AK and another spades|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: persumably its a GS try, but i could do without it..|pg||
nt|jcwla: Ostensibly this looks like a third-round control ask for seven, but have we had a counting error?|pg||
nt|jcwla: OR has lapped us in the meantime.|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: or dropped the 3 of clubs on the floor|pg||
