nt|Walddk4: Hello Jon and Patrick|pg||
nt|patricck: Welcome everyone. Blakset started this match with a carryover of 12 imps. There was a 2 imp swing in the first set so now the margin is 10 with 48 boards to play|pg||

nt|henryb:  Hi Roland and all|pg||
pc|h5|nt|roswolf: could be a straight push|pg||
nt|hedyg: he can make this|pg||
nt|sharkey: I assume 2 NT forcing - S will have to bid game in @H by himself|pg||
nt|sharkey: The .5 point ensures this will not be a tie :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Mountains are higher here than in Norway|pg||
nt|rodal f: @C will kill now|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|roswolf: east showing safety inclinations|pg||
nt|hedyg: but nothing more|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Bad bidding...|pg||
nt|rodal f: They are Hans:)|pg||
nt|patricck: Will North take the push to 3@S and will East double?|pg||
nt|henryb:  Both 6@d, 6@s and 6N will make if declarer guesses both spades and diamonds|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|jbgood: 3@d is not difficult|pg||
nt|patricck: good discipline|pg||
nt|smoller: Hi Roland, henry and all|pg||
nt|jbgood: a max NT hand and a heart fit - guess 4@h is a make|pg||
pc|h2|nt|gulyas: 3@Sx should have been 500|pg||
nt|csabi: 5@C with an endplay|pg||
nt|csabi: no, not|pg||
nt|csabi: sluff and rudd is ok|pg||
nt|csabi: rudd|pg||
nt|csabi: ruff, i van't type|pg||
nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: right no endplay|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup east didnt get his heart ruff|pg||
nt|sstavros: dbl end play = 5@c|pg||
nt|csabi: so 5@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm very lucky with the layout|pg||
nt|gulyas: right, double endplay|pg||
nt|yusufb: en sonunda @s soledi|pg||
nt|rnmalik: game is on for NS-3NT or 5@C|pg||
nt|milton_se: hi all|pg||
pc|h9|nt|rnmalik: can make 6@C also|pg||
nt|rodal f: Only one quest. Any IMP to gain?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: cards are so nicely placed:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree but 6@C and 4 controls missing, might a bit hard.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hello Steen|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sharkey: Sry N  is Dorte - not a "He"|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: sadece 1@s ile uyandýran bir ortaða karþý 4@s biraz agessif gibi|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: diðer odada|pg||
nt|milton_se: EW need to bid this kind of games for having a chance|pg||
nt|milton_se: hej Ralf and Jon|pg||
nt|jbgood: hi Swedes :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|champ i: tahminime göre cl oynayýp 3 nt olcak|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2 rounds of @C and K@H|pg||
nt|rodal f: +Q@C:)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|champ i: ataktan cl çýkýlsa batardý|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Correction: AWFUL bidding|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not that bad. Put @CK at N|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Then East would be a perfect declarer!|pg||
nt|vugraphzex: Nice to see you again Hans, we missed you!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  You know - ironie is not one of my forces...|pg||
nt|rodal f: He have been out running.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  irony may-be...|pg||
nt|vugraphzex: im trying to teach you though|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Those who would (also) have bid 3 NT on this West-.hand can contact me for a free lesson (h-answer@@werge.dk)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Best now is @S for get 7 tricks and fin|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and welcome to Bertil Johnson|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sharkey: 4@S a lot more challenging - @S shift will hurt|pg||
nt|rnmalik: sry for being late|pg||
nt|henryb:  The unfortunate heart duplication of doubletons means there is nothing to chose between contracts|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|adriansou: .|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I have seen all cards:)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and also watching a swedish pair:)|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|nt|vahaboglu: ama tutmuþ|pg||
nt|milton_se: Ss 3-3 should make this easy|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @D play is what matters|pg||
pc|s8|nt|hawe45:  North will play @C, I suppose|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|champ i: kendi maçýmýzada yorum yapmak heyecanlýmýþ|pg||
nt|champ i: kör 2|pg||
pc|hT|nt|patricck: Hard to see where the swing might come from on this one....perhaps a couple of imps if NS managed to play 3@S down 1|pg||
nt|milton_se: no place for false-cards|pg||
nt|smoller: the play of diamonds was fairly automatic|pg||
nt|henryb:  and the diamond division is likely to mislead declarer in spades -- If declarer gets @d right, he can then duck a club and has a show-up squeeze in the blacks|pg||
nt|rnmalik: small @S to the K and @D|pg||
nt|smoller: Is he really  thinking that south is making a Grosvenor coup|pg||
nt|smoller: from j10xx|pg||
nt|milton_se: no need -- no false 10D from J10xx...|pg||
nt|milton_se: should be the Grosvenor then -- not in this match :)|pg||
nt|milton_se: can't understand why he's taking this time|pg||
nt|vugraphzex: Fredin told him to concentrate after putting down dummy|pg||
nt|henryb:  @dQ, then if @d 3-2, claim, ruffing the club loser. If @d 4-1, draw trumps and duck a club|pg||
nt|vugraphzex: so i understand! :)|pg||
pc|h7|pc|c3|pg||
pc|h4|pc|cT|nt|yusufb: 2 batabilir normalde 1 batýyo ama bilmesi zor|pg||
nt|henryb:  then you make if (a) @c 3-3, (b) if the @sJ drops, or (c) if South controls both black suits|pg||
pc|h8|pc|d4|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Not possible for N to balance with 2@S|pg||
nt|cicus: well if OR plays 3NT and the defence is the same ...|pg||
nt|jbgood: so I am the only neutral one here..|pg||
pc|d5|nt|babydolldk: you will then have to find J of @C|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sharkey: Yes - finesse odds on|pg||
nt|henryb:  With the J play, he could now just play @cK, @cA and lose a club|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|d7|nt|vahaboglu: 4 lü @s bile olabilir|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|nt|yusufb: 7 puan var teke karsý K var yinede oluyo bence agresif degil tamam uyandýrma ama eldede 4koz 5431 13 var|pg||

nt|Walddk5: Good morning Anita and Vladimir|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|babydolldk: Hi|pg||
nt|henryb:  no he should not have|pg||
nt|henryb:  but it makes no difference|pg||
pc|c6|nt|patricck: yes that is possible, but bidding it looks so unlikely|pg||
nt|milton_se: became much safer this way|pg||
nt|rnmalik: well done|pg||
pc|cK|nt|babydolldk: In here it looks like we are going to see the Lund Madsen brothers|pg||

nt|rodal f: At non vul for shure.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Did there come a angel or....|pg||
nt|patricck: should be a routine 4@H for NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzex: Peter and Dorthe play 12-14nt in 1st and 2nd seat non vul and 3rd favourable|pg||
nt|milton_se: this may be a good 4-5 level fight|pg||
nt|smoller: 5H N/S on small values|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sharkey: 6@S will run out of gas after 2@D ruffs|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|patricck: 2@D?|pg||

mb|4H|nt|n_aydogdu: fakat koru konusamadýlar|pg||
nt|babydolldk: yes great save|pg||
nt|babydolldk: without the @S ruff:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Dorte makes a pragmatic bid I think|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3NT played by S has a good chance of making |pg||
nt|patricck: would be a shocking contract redeemed only by the fact that they might make it|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: needs some play|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: can't see them choosing that contract|pg||
nt|patricck: neither can I|pg||
mb|p|nt|yusufb: cevapcýnýn x sonra renk solemesini F oynuyolar heralde normal olarak 1@d ye 1@h denmesi lazým|pg||
nt|henryb:  E-W would have done better to let sleeping dogs lie: South was about to play 2@h making 5|pg||
pc|sT|nt|yusufb: maç bitiminde tartýþýrlar buna pas varmýydý|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry Dorthe |pg||
nt|hawe45:  I was cut off here in the french mountains - did Schaltz make the 3 NT?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Looks like a 10 tricker|pg||
nt|hawe45:  To me this is a FAIR @h-slam|pg||
nt|milton_se: 2H seems overly cautious on a 4 loser hand|pg||
nt|rnmalik: he had a choice to bid @C again|pg||
nt|henryb:  Maybe S should do something like bid 4@c over 2@c, showing 5+ @c and a 5+ card major|pg||
nt|vugraphzex: Lars was asked if 4@c would be 5-5, but he wasnt sure|pg||
nt|milton_se: bound for 1 qown|pg||
nt|jbgood: Fredins 4@h was just too much for the opps to cope with|pg||
nt|milton_se: down|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@s is makeable with open cards but...|pg||
pc|sA|nt|xenya: danger of getting too high here -- and so it happened|pg||
nt|rodal f: NS had 2@S by 18HP and will get 50 in I belive. Nice lead Krøj|pg||
nt|rnmalik: lets see 4@H more likely|pg||
nt|henryb:  South took the chance that someone was likely to keep the bidding alive|pg||
pc|s2|nt|babydolldk: and a nice lead|pg||
nt|xenya: not an unreasonable contract -- though a bit of a stretch of course|pg||

nt|jbgood: best contract |pg||
pc|cA|nt|patricck: A@C and another would probably have been better, but the contract would have been safe anyway|pg||
nt|patricck: actually 10 tricks on either lead I think, because after 2 heart ruffs the 8@C will take a trick|pg||

mb|2D!|nt|gulyas: oh-oh|pg||
nt|babydolldk: I don't know their agreements, but this normally shows 7 or?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: By playing the 3@S back N showed 5|pg||
nt|vugraphzex: He said that he should return another spade|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2@D non forcing it seems|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: quite a reasonable opening -- unlikely to work well here though|pg||
nt|cicus: and in fact not a good game|pg||
nt|jbgood: not easy for N to go slamming after S's NT opening|pg||
nt|jbgood: 18-20 NT..|pg||
mb|2N|an|18-20|nt|patricck: agreed, wasn't thinking of it starting with 1NT, what is the range?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well practical if not scientific|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now all East has to do is make it.|pg||
nt|csabi: @HQx in north is the main chance|pg||
nt|csabi: (or 3-3 of course)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if he guesses hearts, the play in the diamond suit could be interesting |pg||
nt|hedyg: 9X @H in S ?|pg||

nt|babydolldk: W did too|pg||
nt|jbgood: 15-17?|pg||
nt|patricck: if it is 15-17 then really the 5 card suit makes it a little too strong for the bid|pg||
nt|jbgood: may just get too high ..|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Many would bid 2 NT - but NOT with the opening bids, we se here|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, hard to bid tho, because there are only 21 points and only a little distribution, but quite a good contract, needs a 3-2 trump break, but might not need the K@D onside - ...|pg||
nt|patricck: discards on @C possibly|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Logical |pg||
nt|cicus: requires friendly spade break + @D finesse on|pg||
mb|p|nt|yusufb: yani oynanan oyunun ihtimali düsük birazda fantezi |pg||
nt|sharkey: Red suit lead cud easily cost and S knows how the @S suit is distributed|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: N not happy now - she knows she may be in trouble|pg||
pc|hA|nt|xenya: note the @CA lead -- normal tactics against the gambling 3N to cash an ace first in the hope to get a few quick tricks|pg||
nt|babydolldk: Pharmaservice is only leading by 10½ imps|pg||
nt|patricck: If the defence is on the ball needs 3-2 trums and K@D  a 34% chance. If the defence don't get to attack diamonds then only needs the trumps which is 68%|pg||
nt|rnmalik: everything working for declarer|pg||
nt|patricck: so how good the game is depends on how good the defence is|pg||
nt|cicus: if we could choose opponents we would bid game on every hand|pg||
nt|patricck: well....that isn't quite true :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: confirmed by the dummy|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vahaboglu: As koyarsa 10 luyu debloke etmesi lazým ancak|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sharkey: Hard to defend - EW need to get @H into play now|pg||
nt|jbgood: guess he didnt want to upgrade with the bad spades and the doubleton diamond honors|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Board 1 6@D made in the OR as well|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rodal f: Surpricing that N want to play at min 51 @S when he know they normaly have 43@H. Could 2@H be at 3cards?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vahaboglu: 9 luda var zannedilebilir|pg||
pc|c6|nt|csabi: ?|pg||
nt|sharkey: and W will not lead low @H|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|jbgood: but nothing big - a few imps ..|pg||
nt|jbgood: she may try to pin the @d Jack of course ...|pg||
nt|jbgood: looks better than finding the doubleton spade honors|pg||

nt|vahaboglu: artýk körlere ulaþýlamýyor|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|nt|rnmalik: I think transfer to @S could be relay|pg||
nt|jbgood: still bid it - wd|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|xenya: if the ace is in the wrong suit you need to switch to the right one|pg||
nt|sharkey: so 8 tricks I think|pg||
nt|rodal f: Notalerted by Matias.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Perhaps that can help Dorthe|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|babydolldk: too difficult to lead @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzex: NS play natural system|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hit the @S?|pg||
nt|vugraphzex: Sorry everyone. connection problems|pg||
nt|rodal f: I saw Matias. 3 tables by 4 went down|pg||
pc|s6|nt|xenya: just like it has been done here|pg||
nt|patricck: so here we are. It is possible that declarer could misguess the trumps, but he has to play them before finding out anything else. 6NT would have been more interesting|pg||
pc|s5|nt|yusufb: esasýnda su squezeleri ve yatýrmalarý bilmesek yada denemesek bi sürü kagýda batmýcaz astarý yuzunden pahalýya geliyo|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry - 9|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ralfwil: This made it easier for N|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|marlowepi: declarer should lead the ten of hearts from dummy at an early stage. this has the most ways to win.|pg||
nt|roswolf: it might come down to south doing a crocodile coup in diamonds|pg||
nt|hedyg: S can always overtake the Q@d|pg||
nt|begse: 6@d ya kör atagý lazýmdý batýrmaya ki zor|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mdgraham: was thinking..lead the @D3...ten, ace then maybe six towards dummy - if S plays low, N wins Q and has to concede a ruff-sluff, if the hand had been eliminated. Not possible now of ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: course|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: Bülent güneyin antresinin ne olduðunu mu düþünüyor|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: ne fark eder ne ise ortaðý ona geçer zaten|pg||
nt|patricck: bidding this game with such poor trumps had one other drawback..If the trumps are 4-1 and you are going down then somebody will be looking at a good enough trump stack to double|pg||
nt|patricck: Then declarer would have played everything else trying to count the hand before committing himself in @H|pg||
pc|h6|nt|roswolf: the club jack is the pseudo threat|pg||
nt|vugraphzfs: maç sonuçlarý, sýralama, butler ranking için www.egebric.org|pg||

nt|ralfwil: @cA and @cK and @hJ|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|yusufb: tersi tabii@c ve @d karýþtý:)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|marlowepi: when S plays the ten od Ds on first round of suit, clear for N to unblock the queen|pg||
nt|marlowepi: then no crocodile necessary|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it will be most annoying for North in the other room if his team-mates come back with -100  |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Frank - many people will be happy, when there is no connection to our table...|pg||
pc|d4|nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the heart length is surely with N, so if he has Qxxx (no nine) the heart ten on 1st round of suit works by brute force. even if he has Q9xx, he may not cover, and if perchance he ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: has Qx after all  it is almost sure he will not cover|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup but.........|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think Hedy's reference to "@H 9x @@ S" was an endorsement of this play|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if hearts are 33 it makes no difference which heart is led from dummy|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe i should not have said it |pg||
nt|roswolf: i think if declarer had ducked a diamond earlier he might have pulled it off|pg||
nt|roswolf: i just dont see how the defenders can go wrong|pg||
nt|roswolf: 10 imps to harangozo rather than a 7 the other way = big swing in a tight match|pg||
nt|jbgood: still the system may have created a swing|pg||

nt|patricck: The second time in this set where there has been 4@S and 6@H opposite a 1NT opening|pg||
nt|patricck: well, the other one was a precision club and 1NT rebid|pg||
nt|cicus: do NS play precision?|pg||
nt|patricck: I presumed so from the first 2 bids on board 2|pg||

nt|hedyg: such as opps playing 3 M and you have AKQJ10 in the suit was the example i was given|pg||
nt|gulyas: slam only goes down cos of the 4-0 trumps in fact|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps a little extreme but sound enough principle|pg||
nt|sharkey: Krøjgaard upgrades with the playing strength|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Easily 800|pg||
nt|cicus: thx for the help|pg||
nt|patricck: Nusine? Is that an acronym for something? or a place name?|pg||

nt|patricck: yes, too nice, not much for us to talk about|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|hedyg: just a little extreme :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4-0 trumps is not enough to beatthe slam, also spades must be 5-1|pg||
nt|csabi: and if they go down in 6@C they still win 11 IMPs|pg||
nt|gulyas: makes no diff, u lose a @D and a trump (discard 4th @H on the @SK at end)|pg||
nt|yusufb: günaydýn herkese|pg||
nt|babydolldk: 2@C a kind of reverse drury|pg||
nt|xenya: probably 2@C was sort of relay (GF?) and 2@D showed a minimum hand|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm told EW play reverse drury over major-suit openings in all positions|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East was ready|pg||

pc|s2|nt|rnmalik: does W hand qualify for reverse?|pg||

nt|rodal f: If all minortrick came, S would have been squized in major at last.|pg||
nt|cicus: hmm, could have taken all th etricks|pg||
nt|cicus: S was going to be show up squeezed|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes-did not go for a squeeze|pg||
nt|jbgood: 4@s duly made on   2 - doubled|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|hedyg: actually he could claim after A@c|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup this could be fun as well|pg||
nt|vugraphzfs: son maçlar oynanýyor, son durumu görmek için www.egebric.org|pg||
mb|p|nt|yusufb: 3@s acýsýna güneyin eliyle konuþmak cok zor x en iyisi gibi|pg||
nt|sharkey: EW may get too high in @H here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This 4 @S looks easy - but with East as declarer, the lead of @H 9 would be interesting...|pg||
nt|patricck: an EW slam, those queens of trumps are dropping today|pg||
mb|2C|nt|hedyg: bergen........|pg||
nt|hedyg: but a wow bergen!|pg||
nt|csabi: 3@C as 0-7? very unusual|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: neden bu kadar battý ki|pg||
nt|sharkey: EW 12-14 NT?|pg||
nt|rodal f: If S don't quit A9@H there can happen something funny in 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: obviously not|pg||
nt|hedyg: more like an upgrade|pg||
nt|yusufb: operasyonel 4nt ama sonuç iyi olmicak|pg||
mb|2D|nt|roswolf: and a lot more!|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South a bit fixed now|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup 3@S would be a shot in the dark|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3C must be megaweak if E is not bidding 3H|pg||
nt|csabi: no problem now, the opp is forced to bid |pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit funny. All 1st bidders have had opening hand so fare.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Again it was the 12-14NT from NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: they are dropping today, Patrick, but not tomorrow on the 8th March..|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|hawe45:  Yes certainly, but as West is the closed hand, you might get a hint, when the @H J is NOT covered|pg||
nt|henryb:  2N or 1@s?|pg||
mb|p|nt|yusufb: elemeler sonunda 11 takým 5 martta baslayacak olan türkiye sampiyonasý finallerine katýlmaya hak kazanacak|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: trafl bozuk da ondan|pg||
mb|4H|nt|begse: buda 4 oluyor|pg||
nt|yusufb: 6 imp daha|pg||
nt|begse: 3 oynarken pik cakadan korkup elden kör oynamýþ olabilir deklaran|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@H forcing looks like|pg||
nt|rnmalik: can lose 2@S and 2@D|pg||
nt|patricck: no way to avoid that on best defence|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: and could easily hit the bidder|pg||
nt|csabi: pass was extra|pg||
nt|gulyas: wow|pg||
nt|mdgraham: what?|pg||
nt|hedyg: something is wrong here imo|pg||
mb|p|nt|csabi: i doubt they hold these cards :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: something missing in the bidding|pg||
nt|marlowepi: some very hungry bidding by W|pg||
nt|vugraphzex: Henrik doesnt understand 4@d|pg||
nt|jbgood: but this one even harder to bid than the previous one|pg||
mb|p|nt|vahaboglu: yanlýþ anlaþýlmasýn "küçük" belediye demek istemiþtim|pg||
nt|yusufb: evet @h acýktan verip @s 2 kere ucurmaya gitmesi makul 3 oynarken|pg||
nt|patricck: however best defence is not always seen :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: 3@s = 4 @s and 5@h|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|yusufb: recainin eline gore ortak 3@s acmýþken 6 yapmamalarý zor|pg||
nt|sharkey: So 2@H game invitational and E looking for slam?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Cam French|pg||
nt|gambit: Hi Roland, Specs |pg||
nt|patricck: beware the 8th of March? Julius Caesar or something? :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|begse: bu eldede fikrim þu 1@h acýlýrsa zon kacmaz onun yerine 2nt veya multi acmayý tercih etmiyorum|pg||
nt|sharkey: EW play 12-14 NT and two way Stayman kib informs|pg||
nt|babydolldk: perhaps invitational+?|pg||
nt|babydolldk: guess not then..|pg||
nt|sharkey: Unfortunate lead from Dorthe - W may pick up the @C suit now|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@D showed max and 3@H|pg||
nt|rodal f: Did S give away tempo by not leading @D?|pg||
nt|milton_se: 1S would have done better|pg||

nt|smoller: There is no eighth trick|pg||
nt|rnmalik: after pitching the @D |pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|hedyg: there must have been a 1@s bid by S we did not see or even 2@H|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rnmalik: he could play on @D 3/3|pg||

nt|marlowepi: but N would not come in 3D without some prior action by S|pg||

nt|rnmalik: There was no way out|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: 2@H plays very well here -- perhaps the defence dropped a trick somewhere though|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: leaddir bid|pg||

mb|1D|nt|gulyas: what spades|pg||

nt|roswolf: magical mystery tour|pg||
nt|gulyas: trust me, he did|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok....|pg||
nt|yusufb: elde ne var anlamadým 3Q 3J puanda yok bu el daveti kabul ederse hangi el etmez merak ettim o zaman davet sekansý oynamamak lazým|pg||
nt|tokay1975: 6nt yapm,s iyi sp cýkýlmassa squize oynarsa  oluyo|pg||
nt|xenya: now for more serious things...|pg||
nt|sharkey: Last hand actually played itself as W needed to find @CQJ bare in N hand to make the contract|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Here we have a fair 4 @S|pg||
nt|smoller: Looks like normal 4H |pg||
mb|p|nt|csabi: ah, Hegedûs's wife has just explained|pg||
nt|hedyg: ?|pg||
nt|csabi: 3@C contains the 0-7 too|pg||
mb|1S|nt|roswolf: really!!!|pg||
nt|tokay1975: defansta  spi teklemek yerine hlerni atmýs kararda kalmamis  oynayana|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 1@S showing 5 card suit?|pg||
nt|jbgood: not a clearcut rebid, guess he tries 2 @h|pg||
mb|2N|nt|gambit: looks like 8 or 9 tricks should be routine |pg||
nt|hawe45:  18-19 balanced, I presume|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2@C is? Matias.|pg||
nt|cicus: game on a finesse for EW|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@H makes whereas 4@S is -1, if I am thinking right|pg||
nt|cicus: may reach the 5 level here|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 4@c 2suiter?|pg||
nt|csabi: (and the 6-9)|pg||
nt|yusufb: tamam :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS playing weak NT as well I think|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|harmon: Hedy!!!|pg||
nt|hedyg: showing @s + @c?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i believe they play that over a preempt 3@d, but here...|pg||
nt|begse: slm lar|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: 1@h overcall yapsa Batý 1 NT diyecekti |pg||
nt|yusufb: antalyada oynamýþtýk 1imp le finale kalamamýþtýk siz þampiyon oldunuz sene:)|pg||
nt|yusufb: mrb tekrar|pg||
nt|xenya: ah i was waiting for that|pg||
nt|babydolldk: 6@D is on:)|pg||
nt|xenya: EW can make 5 in either minor (actually they can make 6 but they'd better not bid that)|pg||
nt|xenya: but if S bids 5@S now -- quite reasonablle at these colours -- what is W to do?|pg||
nt|patricck: I presume that 2@C is showing majors, but even so 4@D is a little bold isn't it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|yusufb: slm nafiz abi hoþgeldin|pg||
nt|gambit: Will N play 10@d trick 2?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y. And 9 if N tell all his minor honors.|pg||
nt|gambit: Not likely....|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3NT played by W also would make but who will bid it on such values|pg||
nt|cicus: my guess is NS will save in 5%H|pg||
nt|cicus: 5@H|pg||
mb|3D|nt|henryb:  I play that 1@h is 3 card support; 2@h is a minimum with 4 @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: e/w maybe just swinging because of ttheir poor set thus far|pg||
nt|begse: bu konuþma artifisyel|pg||
nt|vugraphzex: 2@c is not majors|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2@c usually 18-20 bal, but 4 @d is bold|pg||
mb|3H|an|5+!c|nt|begse: ne oldugunu bilmemekle birlikte)|pg||
nt|xenya: so both sides did quite well here i think|pg||

nt|cicus: but yes, as I a told, if you go down you'd better choose the safer suit|pg||

nt|begse: bu zayýf atlamalar çok zaman ters tepiyor bakýn normalde 3nt ya gelmeyecek el olan 3nt ya sürükleniyor|pg||
mb|p|nt|begse: kontratta direk kör pasý lazým ki mümkün degil  burda da bir batacak|pg||
mb|p|nt|yusufb: batar bence|pg||
nt|n_aydogdu: yapacak bunu demetcý bence|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mdgraham: I think this can be made double dummy |pg||
nt|csabi: sure|pg||
nt|hawe45:  3 NT might be easier|pg||
pc|h8|nt|harmon: not so double dummy on bidding|pg||
nt|csabi: eliminate black suits and lead a trump|pg||
nt|mdgraham: throw in on South|pg||
nt|hedyg: now @c and endplay on S looming if Szalay doesnt play @d|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps even single dummy after north/s bid declarer must surely have great clues as to the layout|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes even on @d return he makes it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes|pg||
nt|yusufb: @h kup var|pg||
nt|tokay1975: etabi h kupu yok varsaydik|pg||
nt|n_aydogdu: kor donmezse|pg||
nt|sharkey: Looks like the par contract here|pg||
nt|jbgood: only way to go plus for EW was to pass 4@d doubled|pg||
nt|smoller: Yes Henry, thast is the way to play it|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @D-lead would have been better - for the defense|pg||
nt|rodal f: That lead, when S show the @S, tell the rest of the story by honors|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y Hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hans I ment|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But still @H Ace and the 10 from South, and a small @H, small from North and declarer might get an idea - which will NOT work|pg||
nt|vugraphzex: 1100 was push|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or a small @C from W and can't fail.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|begse: batmasý için 3 karo vermesi lazým|pg||
nt|rodal f: Some will be happy and other disepointed at that push:)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|hedyg: had to switch immediately after 1st @c|pg||
nt|begse: iyi oyunu buldu|pg||
nt|n_aydogdu: bu el hayatta batmaz artýk|pg||
pc|c2|nt|xenya: so 1 down -- an excellent save|pg||
nt|sharkey: What's W to pitch and the 4th and 5th @S?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Over - 620|pg||
pc|c5|pg||

nt|xenya: yes, that's what i meant|pg||
nt|rodal f: Max for NS, but EW can get 9 in @S|pg||
nt|jbgood: upgrading for another 18-20 NT - may be too high again|pg||
nt|milton_se: good soil in North mediocre 17 being 18|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: it would be a strange way to organize agreements....you can never play 3S|pg||
nt|hedyg: now 3NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: they could try for 6@C|pg||
nt|babydolldk: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yusufb: @c bilmeye kalýr|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: @c Q ý veya @s K yý bulmasý lazým|pg||
nt|sharkey: Schaltz team have picked up 2 IMPs on 4 boards - need a little more than that|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Thw other match was 96-96 at a certain moment, almost like this|pg||
nt|hawe45:  We have NEVER seen so exciting semi-finals|pg||
nt|vugraphzex: this match is 98½-96, ½imps are not compatible with bbo|pg||
nt|vugraphzex: That means if this match ends in a tie on bbo schaltz win|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4@S wount help N to much. N have seen long while ago|pg||
nt|henryb:  Nillson chose the third alternative|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|xenya: 4@H went down on 4 in OR -- 13 ips to Pharmaservice|pg||
nt|gambit: Double was bid your better major?|pg||
nt|vugraphzex: yes|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Too high?|pg||
nt|patricck: needed to be a small diamond|pg||
nt|rnmalik: or a @S-I would have led a @S|pg||

nt|patricck: and probably will go down anyway|pg||
nt|rnmalik: suit worth bidding is worth leading|pg||
nt|milton_se: that lead didn't hurt|pg||

nt|roswolf: DO THEY PLAY LEBENSOHL OVER A DOUBLE OF A WEAK E?|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes they do|pg||

nt|marlowepi: even a passed hand could produce a slam|pg||
nt|hedyg: or at least the CC says so|pg||

nt|rodal f: Are S shure that N have @D control?|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|roswolf: is that why it is often blie?|pg||
nt|henryb:  Best is to cash two top spades then continue hearts|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Why not finess in @c first?|pg||
nt|milton_se: y, remarkable|pg||
pc|sA|nt|csabi: that is max 28 HCP and no known 8-card fit|pg||
nt|yusufb: elden @s J oynarsa yapabilir|pg||
nt|n_aydogdu: batmaz artýk|pg||
nt|begse: 5-5|pg||
nt|hawe45:  You can defeat 5 @H in South - with two @C-ruffs|pg||
nt|hawe45:  That would be a sensation|pg||
pc|s2|nt|yusufb: 10@c atýlýnca oldu|pg||

nt|babydolldk: otherwise it can always win|pg||
nt|xenya: as there are other reasonable choices |pg||
nt|xenya: well maybe i'm missing something -- we shall see|pg||

nt|vahaboglu: güzel eliminasyon oyunu var|pg||
nt|rnmalik: thinking of playing @H from the table to make the hand|pg||
nt|patricck: declarer deciding whether to leave the 3@C winning the trick so as to lead the @H from dummy or to run the clubs and hope to exit for an endplay|pg||
nt|rnmalik: chances of finding E with @HA|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Lost connection and back to your question the X as per agreement in this sequence is for majors only|pg||
pc|c8|nt|begse: þimdi olabilme durumu var ama yinede zor|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|gambit: West trying to get a count on South's hi cards before playing spades |pg||
nt|jbgood: needs to cash the spade ace not to be endplayed|pg||
pc|d5|nt|marlowepi: (a) you might belong in 5C or 4H instead of 3N--S might have QJx of D and no club ace, for example   (b) there is some chance u have a slam;  (c) in all likelihood if u can make 9 ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: tricks at NT u can make 10, so there is safety at the 4 level  (d) S would have been endplayed into bidding 3N on many hands|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4C keeps all those balls in play, at the slight risk of failing in 4N|pg||
nt|begse: 3@h kontur gelebilir ama usta oyuncular bunu 4 pik için deneme oynuyor|pg||
pc|d6|nt|yusufb: yok|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|pg||
nt|jbgood: if Fredin can see it he will discard dummy's last club on the diamond ten|pg||
nt|henryb:  even now: will hold declarer to 4 tricks. as long as they do not concede a ruff with a small spade|pg||
pc|hK|nt|yusufb: 4@d ye @c gidiyo|pg||
nt|begse: yani 3@s rekabet x=trial |pg||
nt|rnmalik: @H back and Q@C|pg||
nt|gambit: I don't know these temas, is one the old guard and another the younger generation - tell us a little about the 2 teams |pg||
pc|h9|nt|smoller: Looks like 5 down, only a small loss for E/W|pg||
nt|henryb:  good!|pg||
nt|jbgood: and now makable.. strange club discard|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sharkey: so off 1|pg||

nt|sharkey: 32 boards left after this session Anita?|pg||

nt|patricck: really shouldn't have been too hard to see that|pg||
nt|patricck: I'm sure he sees it now :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzex: Peter is a very thoughtful player|pg||
nt|vugraphzex: answer to your question: yes he is|pg||

nt|cicus: I think he'll cash another club then switch to a trump|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|tez: vugrafta oynamanin dayanilmaz hafifligi:)|pg||

nt|gambit: run to 2H? |pg||
nt|rnmalik: vul and DBL without a 5 card suit is out of my book:)|pg||

pc|hT|nt|hedyg: ok who overbid?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|roswolf: well naybe a small gain for the trailing team|pg||
nt|begse: pas diyecek davetse|pg||
nt|xenya: classic auction|pg||
nt|gambit: also, better to be behind the NT bidder.....|pg||
nt|jbgood: needed a trump lead to beat it?|pg||
nt|patricck: If your opponents are vulnerable and you are not and they jump to 4@S they will have something special. This shouldn't be too much of a surprise|pg||
nt|patricck: why would a trump lead beat it?|pg||
nt|patricck: diamond lead might have done|pg||
nt|patricck: but only if defence ducks two rounds of trumps|pg||
nt|patricck: one round of trumps|pg||
pc|hA|pg||

nt|babydolldk: perhaps a bal hand with 4@S or strong with @C|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ns time to X?|pg||
nt|smoller: I guess 2S is a least a limit raise of clubs|pg||
pc|s4|nt|hedyg: S has a nice 6-4 hand|pg||

nt|vahaboglu: Yusuf hocam sen de devamlý Hakaný' ý tutuyorsun |pg||

nt|ralfwil: that´s a duty as a good partner:)|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: when north ducks what next?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Could bring 1 IMP for Schaltz|pg||
nt|rodal f: 6@C or 5@S from W|pg||

pc|dK|nt|xenya: ?|pg||
nt|sharkey: lots of work to do|pg||
nt|sharkey: But since West's stiff @S is the 9 shud be ok I think|pg||
nt|babydolldk: yes it's a friendly layout|pg||
nt|rnmalik: even on @C lead N does not have a @C to play 2nd time=so it makes|pg||
nt|hawe45:  South shall lead against 6 @C...|pg||
nt|pelu: ?? Hans|pg||
nt|rodal f: And then we are back to my start. Waisted cards, seen from Dorte's side|pg||
nt|jbgood: in spades you have to cash your five tricks to beat 3 - in hearts you are doomed|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rnmalik: get some imps back|pg||
nt|milton_se: can discard D on QS too|pg||
nt|jbgood: not you, but declarer:)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|marlowepi: though  either defender can make declarer guess by leading an honor on the first round|pg||
nt|cicus: I think it was ill-advised. where are the spades? if with partner, he must be weak|pg||
nt|patricck: I don't like the raise to 4@S...  partner should have some leeway with transfers over 2NT and the fact that partner didn't bid 4@S himself must reduce the chances of getting a good ...|pg||
nt|patricck: enough hand to make|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Rush of blood:) more than logic|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: here declarer did the logical thing, hoping D king an entry|pg||

nt|rodal f: Peter for shure feel that some IMPs are needed and shot the gold bird this time.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|nt|patricck: Both South and North took questionable actions......who do we give the most blame to?|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sooner or later NS will have to break clubs, and they need to start by leading an honor|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer has another entry but not very useful|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W should not be fooled though, given the NS silence, with N known to have S Kxxxx and D ace and heart queen, |pg||
nt|roswolf: fair point|pg||
nt|marlowepi: while S would likely have balanced with club KQ and H QJ|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS play multilandy and he didnt bid 2@s so basically should not be 5-4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry AJ|pg||
pc|dA|nt|babydolldk: no, I don't think so, the clubs are a problem..|pg||
nt|sharkey: Shud know @S4-1 now - W wudn't duck with K9|pg||
nt|sharkey: and no reason to play @S9 with 9x|pg||

nt|rodal f: Will Peter take Monte Phyton after this board? We always look at the bright side of life etc.....|pg||
pc|d9|pg||

pc|s3|nt|begse: irazdan|pg||
nt|pelu: easy play - He need @DK onside|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hawe45:  Next board looks exciting (also)|pg||
nt|pelu: strange thatdennis Bilde discard a 1H - he know from the bidding that decl is void in @C|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he should be content with down one once spades were 5-1 and D king was not an entry|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and heart king not a trick|pg||

nt|rodal f: Sr. Saw the single @H at E but missed to look at S|pg||

nt|pelu: in OR @S lead to King - @H - duck by West - best play - but still 12 tricks on a sort of cross-ruff|pg||

nt|vugraphzex: there could be a time penalty in this match for Schaltz?|pg||

nt|hawe45:  NO - I know PeterÂ´s leads|pg||
nt|Walddk9: Dorthe can't know if she can afford the safety play in hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk9: ducking from dummy|pg||
nt|bessi2: I dismissed the hand as boring flat board in the open room, but seeing all 4 hands can cloud one's perspective, the play in the open room is perfectly correct seems to me|pg||
nt|pelu: if she duck - she has to play N for @dJ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The carryover (12 to Schaltz) may well prove decisive|pg||

nt|gambit: what can poor south do? Run? |pg||

pc|cK|pc|c6|nt|hedyg: needs some luck in @c|pg||

nt|rodal f: Hard to find the lead making problems for W|pg||
pc|c4|nt|gambit: Over here, most play 2@C as Drury, asking about the quality of partner's 3rd or 4th seat opener |pg||

pc|c8|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|gambit: Now most play reverse Drury where rebidding your suit = minimum, the old one 2D = min |pg||
nt|vugraphzex: S says he doesnt understand whats going on|pg||
nt|gambit: so do we show him the cards played? |pg||
nt|rodal f: So don't play with sreens?|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|gambit: I tell my wife I don't understand and she laughs and says figure it out....|pg||
nt|rnmalik: In Board 13, S is in 6NT-flat|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fredin has a unique table feel|pg||
mc|11|nt|rodal f: :)))|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh well, so only 3 IMPs in it|pg||
nt|vugraphzex: drumroll...|pg||
nt|oleberg: now for the decisive deal|pg||

pc|d7|pc|hT|pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|bessi2: indeed, west had to bid a VERY pushy 3@c over 2@s, but if he had, east would surely have bid 5@c over 4@s|pg||

nt|roswolf: very good psychological play|pg||
nt|hedyg: indeed|pg||
nt|Walddk9: Looks like Schaltz has it|pg||
nt|pelu: now last board - looks like a standard 4@S|pg||
nt|Walddk9: Thanks Matias and all commentators|pg||
nt|rodal f: Matias have done a great job. Well done.|pg||
nt|vugraphzex: ty all for watching - see you tomorrow 9 am GMT+1|pg||
nt|jbgood: very difficult player to "read"|pg||
nt|oleberg: If NS, highly unlikely, stays out of 4@H, Blakset wins.|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: and now for the last deal|pg||
nt|patricck: 6@D not such a bad contract...needs either a lucky trump position or the K@C onside|pg||
nt|jbgood: or an opponent who leads trumps against slams..:)|pg||
nt|patricck: you wouldn't expect to find one of those in the final would you?  :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: not really:)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|smoller: Other room: 1D-2NT.3S (non forcing). All pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: in the 1st segment |pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|hedyg: NS CC: http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008MindSportGamesBeijing/Open/Hungary/Harangozo_Szalay.pdf|pg||
nt|roswolf: that may gain further imps on later boards e/w will suspect every card south plays!|pg||
nt|gambit: so in the other room N overcalled W 1@C opening with 1@D and played there doubled |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Last board of the set now|pg||
nt|henryb:  What discipline not to open as West|pg||
nt|henryb:  I approve, but few modern players would|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6NT OR -3|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Brd 13|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Time for some words of appreciation|pg||
nt|oleberg: If they bid it, it takes a thrumph lead and a misguess in spades, for it to go down.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: First of all to our brilliant operator, Matias Rohrberg. Great job for two days!|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|Walddk4: Thanks to Matias, our brilliant operator at the DBF HQ|pg||
nt|oleberg: Not an enviable position for Nilsson.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Also thanks to our many excellent commentators throughout the weekend. You have made the presentation very enjoyable for our spectators|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: for EW i have a similar CC to theirs:|pg||
nt|babydolldk: what a finish by Schaltz in this section...|pg||
nt|jbgood: at least not from the ten doubleton |pg||
nt|Walddk4: In the open room it was even better as South had overcalled|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So a favourite to have @CK|pg||
nt|oleberg: Many kibz points out, that West must underlead the AK of clubs.|pg||
nt|oleberg: I assure you, that Fredin will figure that one out, if he gets the chance.|pg||
nt|oleberg: When in with the @SQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Finally, our gratitude to the Danish Bridge Federation for allowing us to broadcast from this event. Jacob Duschek, Torsten Ørhøj, Jan Nielsen and Matias Rohrberg have been ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: instrumental in setting up a magnificent show|pg||
nt|oleberg: 2NT probably shows long hearts and short spades.|pg||
nt|oleberg: As opposed to 3@H, showing three spades.|pg||
mb|3C|an|seminatural|nt|gambit: forcing for sure - asks shortness? |pg||
nt|vugraphzex: they play romex, so dorthe is looking to bid a long suit trialbid|pg||
nt|pelu: look at 5@C by EW only down 1 on best play|pg||
mb|d|nt|hedyg: http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008MindSportGamesBeijing/Open/Hungary/DanielGulyas_BalazsSzegedi.pdf|pg||
nt|hedyg: Szegedi's CC with another pd|pg||
nt|henryb:  And I would not dream of overcalling on East: you don't want a @s lead, and no reason to suggest values|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|rodal f: Last board at this segment. The next, and last for the semifinal, will start in 50min|pg||
nt|milton_se: time for a X?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 1NT= 8-13 or 16+ bal|pg||
nt|Walddk5: They are running out of time|pg||
nt|patricck: Schaltz started with a 12 imp carryover and that is where we are still at after the 1st of 4 sets|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and to Patrick, Rashed and Gábor, our excellent commentators|pg||
nt|patricck: more imps for the Schaltz team, who are going to have a healthy lead at the halfway point|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: absolutely|pg||
nt|kemeny: 2nt: 8-10 4sp|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c relay so i guess 2NT showed 4@s?|pg||
nt|hedyg: right|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@c 16+|pg||
nt|Walddk5: I mean, they are late|pg||
nt|babydolldk: ok:)|pg||
nt|henryb:  easier on this auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Penalise them 50 IMPs each :)|pg||
nt|christinas: chicken|pg||
nt|smoller: Must have been tempting for South to double|pg||
nt|rnmalik: scared of X an undergame that is the only reason|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|hedyg: brb|pg||
nt|pelu: making on misdefense|pg||
nt|patricck: perhaps one of the least inspired leads we have seen :)|pg||
nt|oleberg: Peter raised his own invite, having no waste in clubs|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk5: The next set is scheduled to start in 1 minute|pg||
nt|vugraphzex: it won't :)|pg||
nt|april7: bye everybody, see you next time|pg||
nt|patricck: Q@D that is|pg||
nt|oleberg: Maybe a Thrumph switch will suffice?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think that when W shows @cA and @cK Dorthe can read the @sA by E|pg||
nt|oleberg: Seems done for.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They can't beat it by force, but she has not got 10 tricks yet|pg||
nt|jbgood: everything quite normal - and a trump in trick 2 will do no good. Fredin was a passed hand, so the spade guess is barely a guess|pg||
nt|oleberg: And no reason for Blakset to be sorry. The imp-difference is 6 times higher than it sometimes is :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzex: in 2006 it was won in a tie...|pg||
nt|vugraphzex: Konow beating Mønsted|pg||
nt|oleberg: (A few years ago, the championship was decided with ½ an imp.)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They could no doubt find those 3 IMPs somewhere, but it's always like that in a very close encounter|pg||
nt|jbgood: i think you are always entitled to be sorry when you lose a championship by a very few..|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rnmalik: I think it is the last board of this segment|pg||
nt|vugraphzex: indeed it is|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Thanks Matias an excellent performance:)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Bravo:) the hand of the segment|pg||
nt|gambit: OK, thx to all our specs, the final looks exciting, tight close match, congrats to the players, they play awful well and sometimes it is too easy to forget that |pg||
nt|jbgood: at least one would not expect the losers to be happy:)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|roswolf: this surely will be a picnic|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk4: Play resumes in about 15 minutes|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugraphzex: the standing is 82½-81 atm|pg||
nt|gambit: special thx to vugraphzex for a wonderful job |pg||
nt|rodal f: As all know scandinavia use to have a high standard at bridge as US - Dutch - Italy - +++ some others not mensiond now.|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|oleberg: Knut and Mathias will be in a good mood regardless.|pg||
nt|oleberg: That seals it.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks rather easy now|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Walddk4: 2@S  0-5  any suit, not good enough for a pre-empt, preferably no ace|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rodal f: May we con grat Blakset and Schaltz with the final tomorrow|pg||
nt|vugraphzex: bye all|pg||
nt|Walddk9: Good night|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c9|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes discard a @s nice!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Again, we will keep this table open to get the announcement of the Danish open team for the Europeans|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It will happen shortly after the teams have scored up|pg||
pc|h5|nt|xenya: this is probably a push|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Blakset's 2@S|pg||
nt|Walddk4: or Toxic 2@S if you like|pg||
nt|rnmalik: He hit the Jack Pot:)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mdgraham: brb|pg||
pc|h7|nt|rnmalik: now small @C to A and small @C|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d6|nt|gambit: Scandinavia famous for herring, bridge, saunas and beautiful blond women, not necessarily in that order....|pg||
nt|rodal f: Was needed|pg||
nt|milton_se: earning 3 imps now|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|d3|nt|hedyg: ok the @s problem persists|pg||
nt|xenya: so 48-20 Pharmaservice in the 1st set|pg||
pc|d7|nt|patricck: a shame, looked like he was about to make, but +2 imps anyway|pg||
pc|hT|nt|vugraphzex: ty all, see you later|pg||
nt|babydolldk: ty and bye|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks all, back soon|pg||

mc|10|nt|Walddk2: If you are leaving us, then bye for now|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: is it allowed to "talk" danish now ?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Thanks all and congrats to team Schaltz! Nice to watch this event!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let me stick my neck out and predict the open team (I have been wrong many times before)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Askgaard-Bjarnarson|pg||
nt|Walddk2: L Blakset-Røn|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bilde-Hansen|pg||
nt|oleberg: Im with Roland on this one.|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2 out of 3 is good, but i suspect you may have them all in Roland|pg||
nt|oleberg: 2 out of 3 is a certainty, when there are only 4 possibileties|pg||
nt|oleberg: :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Good night and bye for now!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2 x Schaltz not available   2 x Lund Madsen not available   K Blakset-Bruun not available, so .....|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: Peter Schaltz will in af few minutes announce the Danish National Team for the European Championship|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The fourth pair in contention is Auken-Christiansen|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: First he is going to make the "Winners speach" for the Danish National Championship|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: That is going to take a few minutes |pg||
nt|jbgood: we are still waiting for the Norwegian team to be picked |pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: Here is the Danish National Team:|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: Gregers Bjarnarsson - Michael Askgaard|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: Lars Blakset - Jacob Røn|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: and Morten Bilde and Jørgen Hansen|pg||
nt|Walddk2: as predicted|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks Matias|pg||
nt|jbgood: Roland was spot on!|pg||
