mb|p|nt|scotty: Only chance is for N-S to convince W that S has @dKxx - SO NORTH MUST GIVE FALSE COUNT IN @D|pg||

nt|brolucius: I wouldn't, not even if vulnerable.|pg||
nt|scotty: aGREED - BUT i PREFER 1@S TO BOTH|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|scotty: You have the high suit, and In second seat you are as likely to be preempting your own side as the opponents|pg||
nt|brolucius: And, of course, you may miss a very easy game by bidding only three spades.|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Higgins became Liggins, thank you operator|pg||
nt|brolucius: That will boost England's chances. Liggins is a good player.|pg||
nt|scotty: But 3@s is truly strange - is partner supposed to raise with two aces and @sxx? - even @s singleton makes game good|pg||

nt|Walddk3: It's systemic though|pg||
mb|d|mb|2S|nt|scotty: When you preempt like that, you need to be partering someone with ESP|pg||
nt|Walddk3: 4-7  5 cards|pg||
mb|3C|nt|brolucius: The fact that Patterson stayed short of game shows how weak 2@S is.|pg||
nt|scotty: So what is 3@s?  4-7 and 6-8 cards?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Something like that|pg||
mb|3S|nt|scotty: That's where you need to be a REALLY good guesser|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cQ|nt|dburn: not really - when you play with Crouch, standard operating procedure is to subtract an ace from whatever you might guess a normal person would have for his bid|pg||
nt|scotty: short should probably not compete over 3@c when his partner had bid 1N over 1@c. No TO double means a good chance they are in a 7-card fit.|pg||

nt|galadriel: Apparently the operator missed the auction from CR on board 1 so E may have inded opened 1@S|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer is unlikely to guess the trumps correctly.|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, he mixes them up occasionally, just to prevent partner from getting bored|pg||

nt|scotty: Could 1@c be a doubleton?  Why not 1@d opening?|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|brolucius: A recent book by Jackson and Klinger recommends a 5-4-3-2-1 point count for balanced hands. South appears to have 18 points on that basis (although it is much harder to count up on ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: this scheme). That would be enough for a weak 1NT opening.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|scotty: 6@d is the making slam|pg||
nt|dburn: I think 1@c is systemic with all balanced hands that don't open 1NT|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: An apparent flaw in the book is that you do not know whether partner is balanced. When he has a shapely hand, it is difficult to switch back to normal evaluation.|pg||

nt|brolucius: He does not agree with that. Michael, when two balanced hands face each other. He says that aces are over-values and Q/Js undervalued.|pg||

nt|dburn: indeed - what are known as Binkie points in our circle involve valuing aces at four and a half, kings at three, queens as one and two thirds, and jacks as five sixths|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk3: lol|pg||
nt|scotty: Even if I accepted that, it would only be true as RESPONDER to a balanced hand.  When you open or rebid NT, you can't yet know your partner is balanced|pg||
mb|d|nt|galadriel: hahah|pg||
nt|brolucius: Of COURSE!  Yes, as I mentioned, that is the main flaw of the book, as I see it.|pg||

nt|dburn: no, no - we are old enough to be able to do mental arithmetic, particularly since we still remember when there were 240 pennies to the pound|pg||
nt|brolucius: Also, it is difficult to count up a 39-point hand. Also the EBU's rules about what hands you are allowed to open would have to be in two different 'languages'.|pg||
nt|dburn: or 60 groats, as we prefer to think of them|pg||
nt|scotty: And while Kxx facing Axx may produce the same tricks as Kxx facing QJx, the CONTROL aspects are totally different - often opponents set up their tricks and top losers matter|pg||

pc|sT|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||

nt|dburn: unclear whether East should bid 3@h or 3NT - certainly his clubs are a candidate for Stopper of the Year in the unbid suit, but those spades....|pg||
nt|brolucius: "I could hardly make a minimum rebid of 2@D with a full 17 points, partner!"|pg||
nt|scotty: S would do well to avoid a club lead vs. 3N|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|dburn: but if he does bid 3@h, West will reassure him that spades are not an issue|pg||
nt|scotty: I'm guessing that it was a pretty prompt 3N bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: East did not want to hear 4@S over 3NT, I guess. By bidding 3@H he allowed partner to suggest spades on a 3-card fit.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: East would never hear 4@s over 3NT if West had only three spades|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3NT means: 'Yes, I do have a possible five stoppers in the unbid suit.'|pg||
nt|barnets: yes he did well there|pg||
nt|galadriel: Responder will often have longer @C on this auction|pg||
nt|dburn: but he might hear "pass" over 3NT if West had only one spade, and the result would be unfortunate|pg||
nt|barnets: 3N by west in the closed room|pg||
nt|brolucius: No, West would probably ahve to pass 3NT. But East might have five spades on that auction and 4@S could be a better game.|pg||
nt|scotty: No lead is attractive with S.  I'd lead a @d - since I have good spots there.  If partner has solid-type clubs, I'll just say sorry - again|pg||
nt|barnets: because of the unusual system e/w play in the closed|pg||
pc|d9|nt|scotty: Well done|pg||
nt|dburn: surely - there are some who would treat 3@h by East as purely a waiting bid, so that East might even make it on a singleton|pg||
nt|barnets: west rebid 1N|pg||
nt|barnets: and north led the @D 10 |pg||
nt|barnets: in the closed |pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, I've heard of that method, but it seems difficult for the opener to judge when 3@H means that.|pg||

nt|brolucius: Of the 8 scored boards, 6 were flat, so unlikely that Ireland can pick up a maximum on such fare.|pg||
nt|galadriel: nasty @S break |pg||
nt|scotty: if declarer had led a @d toward dummy, E would be forced to split j10.  then W must throw @dQ, and E can be endplayed with a spade - I did say double dummy|pg||

nt|scotty: May well make 9 tricks in spades|pg||

mb|3H|nt|barnets: well we will soon find out |pg||

nt|Walddk3: That's why they make it|pg||
nt|brolucius: yes!|pg||
nt|dburn: well, that 5-0 beak may have been better for declarer than 4-1|pg||

nt|dburn: oh, sure - if partner doubles 4@s, West should bid, but I'm still not sure I would double|pg||
nt|dburn: but that is why they leave the likes of me in England, and export the likes of Michael Rosenberg to the USA, where they play bridge properly|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, if East did double, West might bid 4NT rather than 5@c, catering for some East shapes such as 1=4=6=2 - 5@c should be to play even facing that|pg||
nt|dburn: but as to whether West should bid at all, the words of Kaplan (takeout doubles are for takeout) carry more weight than those of Reese (easier to take four tricks than eleven)|pg||

mb|1D|nt|barnets: good morning|pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: hi all|pg||
nt|galadriel: Good afternoon everyone :)|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|brolucius: England have had a good week-end, drawing 15-15 with Ireland (their rivals for the Trophy) and then scoring a maximum 25 against the two NI teams.|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|Walddk3: So David, you against three Scots. How do you like that?|pg||
nt|scotty: Interesting first hand - unlucky 6@h or 6N with hearts 4-1|pg||
nt|brolucius: Meanwhile Wales defeated Ireland 19-11, which was helpful to the England team's chances.|pg||
nt|galadriel: England just need 15 vps to secure the Camrose|pg||
nt|brolucius: I will have to hope for the best...|pg||

nt|galadriel: Although I am using unofficial scores|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Whittaker seemed to play strongly yesterday, in the match that I watched. (He was in the other room, it is true, but he made several good decision in the bidding.) |pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Willie Whittaker ex-Scotland by the way, like Michael and Barnet|pg||
nt|scotty: 3N probably shows some extra values there|pg||
nt|galadriel: We keep losing these good players - very careless!|pg||
nt|brolucius: West's lap to 3NT (on a humbler @CK-x) makes it clear that he does not play fourth-suit forcing to game, which is unusual nowadays.|pg||
nt|scotty: If so, E will certainly drive to slam|pg||
nt|brolucius: ...leap...|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Scotland must be hoping for a lucky bidding misunderstanding here...|pg||
pc|h2|nt|scotty: it is often difficult for two hands in the SNT range to bid to slam after a 1-of-a-suit opening.  That is why the jump is used to show a hand in that range|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||
nt|brolucius: If 2NT was forcing, East would have had the space to rebid his hearts conveniently, |pg||
pc|hK|pc|s2|pc|h8|pc|h6|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s6|nt|scotty: E 4N bid is VERY conservative.  I think he expected a stiff heart opposite, and that's why he went low.  Very lucky, since you clearly want to be in slam.|pg||

nt|barnets: he has to cash the @C A now|pg||
nt|scotty: yes, but if you bid 2N, what does E do wih a 17HCP balanced hand?|pg||
