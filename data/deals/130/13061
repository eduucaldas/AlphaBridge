pc|dA|nt|hedyg: Agica seed 75|pg||
nt|lml: passing on the south hand is a good decision as it turns out|pg||
nt|lml: but there are 14hcp opposite an opening bid|pg||
nt|dburn: South might have take the odd-looking action of reopening with 2NT to show the minors|pg||

nt|xenya: looks like they stopped too early|pg||
nt|daman: Good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|bucheister: It truly is a bidders game; in the old days no one would dream of bidding over a strong NT with that hand, now it is automatic|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h7|pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
pc|s8|nt|xenya: but they are not vulnerable and it's 1st hand|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|xenya: hello George|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|dburn: indeed; was wondering if 2@h showed majors, but it probably does not or Rodwell would have corrected to spades|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|roswolf: its never too early to start losing|pg||
pc|s9|pc|dT|pg||

mb|1D!|an|Could be only 2|nt|roswolf: another fun hand|pg||
nt|bucheister: Maybe that S hand is a little too strong and suited for 1NT at imps|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|daman: lots of shape|pg||
nt|daman: 2@C is the only safe place for NS should they compete|pg||
nt|lml: now that to me is a very borderline opening|pg||
nt|lml: did north really bid 1@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: they will|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|lml: hey sit for it... right its not game|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@H was a transfer bid|pg||
nt|ady: south managed to get into the bidding 2nd round|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|dburn: to some extent, but you could see why he would want to protect his major-suit holdings|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: would we all have bid 2@S over the double?|pg||
nt|bucheister: these are all relays|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15, 2+@D   2@C=one round force   2@H=11-13 bal|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: 2@S forces 2N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N is normal game try|pg||
pc|h6|nt|dburn: 2@h showed a weak no trump, 2@s was a transfer to notrump to get East to be declarer|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|xenya: i confess i would|pg||
nt|roswolf: so would i|pg||
nt|lml: well this got north the spade lead which is a pretty good one|pg||
nt|bucheister: they must always accept the transfer; most of the pair accept with at least three|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|bucheister: If you are going to open that 1NT you have to convince yourself to compete later in the auction|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|nt|ady: this should be a + for n/s    neither quite able to doubvle 1NT|pg||
nt|lml: South had a shot at doubling but not north|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
nt|lml: I think this is pretty normal|pg||
pc|c5|nt|daman: would garbage stayman apply over the double?|pg||
nt|roswolf: where was the axe? somebody asks?|pg||
nt|roswolf: not with me|pg||
nt|finch: it's quite handy to bid a natural 2@C over the double|pg||
nt|xenya: axe? what axe?|pg||
nt|daman: on Board 1   repeated @D tap held declarer to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|daman: I have been advised they use 2@C as either clubs or two suits if run when doubled|pg||
nt|finch: it's very difficult for North to double; his partner has shown nothing other than long clubs|pg||
nt|finch: East could be 5=5 rather than 5=4|pg||
nt|roswolf: very true frances|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|d7|pg||
nt|lml: great defense so far|pg||
nt|bucheister: would a doubleof one heart be a takeout double of 1S?|pg||
nt|bucheister: I don't think game tries are in their vocabulary|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h3|nt|bucheister: or would it be hearts?|pg||
nt|lml: you could play that|pg||
nt|lml: you could play it either way.  you should agree|pg||
nt|ady: I think most play double of 1 heart shows hearts and bid 1 spade with short spades as a take-out|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes 1@s takeout|pg||
nt|lml: ace and out a heart looks decent approach for south|pg||
nt|bucheister: specs should discuss this with their partnerships because this is becoming very common|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|nt|daman: Charlie wants to make sure he takes a trick :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: meckwell game try = bid game, try to make it    [an oldie but goodie quote]|pg||
nt|dburn: they have a number of sequences in which they can in effect discuss which way up to play the final contract|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h2|pg||
nt|poohbear: youd be surprised. They have become more accurate bidders. Dont routinely bid 3NT on every hand|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|pc|c9|pc|d5|pg||

pc|s5|nt|po-s: that silly DJ by North was expensive|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|daman: I would have played the @C J|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d2|nt|hedyg: could have cashed the K@s|pg||
nt|ady: better for south to win ace of hearts  cash diamonds and exit with a heart|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi PO, welcome :)|pg||
nt|lml: this defense isnt bad|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lml: if South cashes the diamond and plays ace and another club they wills till get a club trick in the end|pg||
nt|lml: I dont think they could have done much better than that|pg||
nt|bucheister: a small plus is better than a big minus|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|hedyg: np Richard, sometimes they play too fast for the operator to keep up|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|ady: e/w   likely to end in 3NT|pg||
nt|lml: 3@C looks a bit better than I usually play it|pg||
nt|dburn: now, that is a strange sort of 2@h overcall, but it came to no harm|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all 3rd seat NT opener's are treated as "weak"  so this DBL=14+ HCP|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: not sure what West is supposed to do here - take a view and pass, or scramble to 2@c|pg||
mb|p|pc|h5|nt|bucheister: he certainly has the right cards for partner|pg||
pc|h7|nt|bucheister: You are doing a great job; thank you|pg||

nt|roswolf: all very normal|pg||
nt|daman: back to back 3@H contracts for EW    could have 3 for 3 had West balanced :)|pg||
nt|finch: tHelgemo put off protecting by the vulnerability (and the fact it isn't matchpoints)|pg||
nt|lml: well they now have 9 top tricks |pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure it will come up this hand, but EW play Reverse Smith Echo vs NT|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|hedyg: they always did with the doublefinesse in @d|pg||

pc|hA|pc|hT|pc|h8|pc|h9|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: Rod has so many options while still holding @DA|pg||
pc|d4|nt|po-s: and North will try to cash three spade tricks|pg||
nt|lml: there was never any risk in it anyway|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lml: if South has the @HK instead of the QJ...|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|dburn: but this is becoming serious - covering that club will allow the defenders to preserve communication and collect 500|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d5|pc|s8|pc|d8|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d7|nt|finch: The problem with entering into this sort of auction is that NS have not shown a fit, and there could be a very large penalty|pg||

nt|finch: ....particular if they are going to play in 4@S in the other room|pg||
nt|daman: with apologies to Al Roth|pg||
pc|s3|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @S8 upside down attitude -- does NOT like @S|pg||
nt|dburn: but pitching that spade will send it back to 300|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he did like spades - in effect, he unblocked the suit for declarer|pg||

nt|daman: the Francophones got much too high on Board 3    so 5 more to DeFalco|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|finch: Declarer's problem is that if clubs don't run he doesn't have 10 tricks. Try giving North the same shape but the @CJ instead of the 4|pg||
nt|bucheister: the bid could have worked but probably more suited to MP|pg||
nt|lml: what do they say -1100 is character building|pg||
nt|ady: should be 11 imps for e/w   -1100|pg||
nt|lml: that will build some character for sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: believe me Linda it isnt|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: i missed the opening @D lead :(|pg||

nt|finch: Trumps 3-2 there's not problem, of course|pg||

nt|bucheister: We have two interpretations of 3C|pg||

nt|bucheister: This starting to get away from NG|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|nt|dburn: well, 6@h is a shade better than 50%, since even if South did hold @sK, someone might have the singleton @cK|pg||

nt|po-s: yes, but it might well have been RKCB|pg||
nt|bucheister: Actually standard methods should get you close to 6H|pg||
nt|po-s: perhaps not "well" but who knows|pg||
nt|dburn: yes, but they would not get you very close to 6@h by West|pg||

pc|h3|nt|daman: nailing them in the cusp|pg||
pc|h8|nt|roswolf: nice play|pg||
nt|finch: More perhaps that a spade lead was very unappealing from such a holding with them well stopped on his right|pg||
nt|finch: Dummy will have at most two hearts (no 3@H bid over 2NT)|pg||
nt|daman: Charlie has been through a lot of battles    I'm sure his @H Q was well thought out|pg||

mb|p|an|0-5 or a !H stack|nt|lml: at the OR|pg||
mb|2H|nt|hedyg: agree PO, 3NT looked automatic|pg||
mb|3D|nt|lml: the vulnerable west made an awful overcall of 1NT|pg||
nt|ady: decent 6 spades here|pg||
nt|lml: North should bid again|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: Rod's PASS=0-5 or trap pass  --  but operator already entered that |pg||
mb|3N|nt|lml: okay its tough|pg||
nt|lml: I am looking at the hands |pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: the 3@D bid made it easier for NS to reach 4@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: de falco leaps ahead|pg||
nt|finch: This is another hand that may not be as routine as you think. Where is declarer going to get his 10th trick if the @SA is wrong?|pg||
nt|daman: 14 more to DeFalco after board 9|pg||
nt|finch: Suppose the pointy aces are swtiched|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: he was already ahead|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: although I suppose 3NT will make, what with that club position|pg||
nt|poohbear: same reason 4D makes|pg||
nt|kareno: No guts no glory.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: amazing -- @C position makes this successful game try|pg||
nt|bucheister: pretty lucky but as I said earlier they make their luck|pg||
nt|poohbear: I wonder how Meck copes with a 3@h bid by South|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or is there another option besides @CQ singleton or doubleton|pg||
nt|kareno: Overtrick!  |pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|h6|pg||
nt|me argent: me 2 barry|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|nt|lml: does anybody else think north might have moved?|pg||
nt|kareno: Sort of the wrong vulnerability for that bid by south.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|roswolf: no real option but to play for it|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
nt|finch: unfortunately he is still short of 10 tricks|pg||
nt|daman: Tiger Woods has announced he will return to golf at the Masters in April|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes indeed|pg||
nt|po-s: how 10 tricks?|pg||
nt|finch: 5 trumps, two clubs, one diamond and one spade is only 9 tricks|pg||
nt|finch: he needed either to set clubs up or to make enough tricks by ruffing|pg||
nt|finch: if he tries to make 6 trump tricks he can never make a diamond trick, it's still not enough tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: but now he won't get a @S trick if E pitches the duece|pg||
pc|dK|nt|hedyg: bidding 1NT with fit and an opening hand is not what forcing 1NT is about imo|pg||
nt|poohbear: Didnt sto pZia|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d3|nt|finch: yes, now he is two off (as everyone with GIB already knows)|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|lml: yes that started things off on the wrong foot|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|hedyg: he should have moved over 1@s, not over 4|pg||
pc|c3|nt|finch: but when he playing to ruff clubs, he needed them to break|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H should be EASIER versus the big club auction|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|c9|pc|d4|nt|poohbear: i agree|pg||
mc|10|nt|lml: I agree completely|pg||

nt|hedyg: i would probably have bid 2@c...|pg||
nt|bucheister: You must bid 3H with that hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm reminded  it was also Big Club auction at other table -- thanks martin|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: doink is what you hear on BBO when there is a claim    for the hearing impaired it is <doink>|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|roswolf: well this is a bidding test after a weak 2@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: E/W MAY WELL PUNT THE GRAND SLAM|pg||
nt|finch: it's a test of how sound your weak twos are. If partner might have QJ10xx you need to tread more carefully|pg||
nt|daman: as predicted   Zimmerman recouped 11 on Board 10    settled in 3NT|pg||
nt|xenya: i would bid 4@H if that doesn't show a powerhouse|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5NT is a popular bid for the specs|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 5 NT?|pg||
nt|po-s: You have KQx in trumps and suggest that partner should decide...|pg||
nt|lml: brb need lots of coffee|pg||
nt|lml: well you are missing controls in both minors|pg||
nt|bucheister: Too strong a word; OK|pg||
mb|2N|nt|daman: 5NT is very perilous     cannot count 13 tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah science|pg||
nt|lml: I think when you bid 5@H you are saying that you have hearts and spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: it is easy for us, but what about SJ?|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|roswolf: true good point p-o|pg||
nt|po-s: now not many heart ruffs likely in East´s hand|pg||
nt|lml: and if partner has the minors controlled then he should bid it|pg||
nt|lml: back soon|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: D0P1 here, so 1 ace|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=LR, 4+@S  [rare 3@S]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S = zero game interest|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: RM Precision uses  1@H/@S-3@C as game forcing raise|pg||
nt|bucheister: 3S = probably going down|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kareno: Should be a push.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: belay that -- 2N=LR+   |pg||
pc|d7|nt|po-s: I am a simple soul, when partner jumps to 4S over my 1NT I assume HE (she?) has the spades|pg||
nt|hedyg: what did you say re paralyse PO?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|daman: pass was DOPI|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm well they tried but no cigar|pg||
nt|daman: 5NT night have asked for specific Kings|pg||
nt|poohbear: correct al|pg||
pc|c7|nt|po-s: of course he wasn´t going to bid it|pg||
nt|finch: he suspects grand is on the club finesse at best, which is reasonably likely to be wrong|pg||
nt|po-s: but tes, 5NT would have solved the CK problem|pg||
pc|cK|nt|daman: if partner had bid 5@C  (@CK)    7 was easy|pg||
