pc|dA|nt|daman: would garbage stayman apply over the double?|pg||
nt|roswolf: where was the axe? somebody asks?|pg||
nt|roswolf: not with me|pg||
nt|finch: it's quite handy to bid a natural 2@C over the double|pg||
nt|xenya: axe? what axe?|pg||
nt|daman: on Board 1   repeated @D tap held declarer to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|daman: I have been advised they use 2@C as either clubs or two suits if run when doubled|pg||
nt|finch: it's very difficult for North to double; his partner has shown nothing other than long clubs|pg||
nt|finch: East could be 5=5 rather than 5=4|pg||
nt|roswolf: very true frances|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|nt|lml: great defense so far|pg||
nt|bucheister: would a doubleof one heart be a takeout double of 1S?|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|pg||
nt|bucheister: or would it be hearts?|pg||
nt|lml: you could play that|pg||
nt|lml: you could play it either way.  you should agree|pg||

nt|hedyg: yes 1@s takeout|pg||
nt|lml: ace and out a heart looks decent approach for south|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|nt|daman: in case anyone missed it   Dan Wolkowitz (West) is one of our regular VyGraph operators|pg||
nt|joest: 4@d is both without a slam try?|pg||
nt|joest: in other words, can Weinstein conclude that Levin is tentatively rejecting a slam try?|pg||
nt|petergill: North recognises that @DKQ and @CKJ are not ideal cards opposite both majors 4-4 or 5-4|pg||
nt|joest: b/c if he is, Weinstein is all done it seems to me|pg||
nt|daman: he will give it a nudge|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@H by North = 4 hearts, not as interested in slam as 4@D would be|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6NT is perhaps slightly better than 6@H|pg||
nt|joest: make north's diamond queen the spade queen and it's a good slam.  Presumably Levin would bid differently?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6NT may make even if hearts are 4-1, 6@H has no chance if they are|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Weinstein still thinking about bidding more|pg||
nt|joest: unwinding 5-4 in the majors is sometimes a problem with puppet stayman|pg||
nt|joest: you can't regress to typical 'Smolen' auctions|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C strong, 2@D relay, 2NT strong balanced (about 23), 3@C Puppet Stayman, 3@D at least one 4 card major|pg||
nt|joest: there are various 'tricks' to get around it|pg||
nt|joest: but some influence the ability to send a clear slam try too|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Another opetion is to let 3@S show five spades and four hearts. Different approaches|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@C slam try with usually 4-4 (or 5-4) in majors, 4@h to play, South adds 9 to 23 and realises that slam is touch and go - will he go?|pg||
mb|4S|an|slam try|mb|p|mb|4N|an|Blackwood|mb|p|mb|5C|an|1 or 4|mb|p|nt|petergill: 4@S cue bid, ace or king|pg||
nt|petergill: 4NT asks, 5@C shows one in their methods |pg||
nt|daman: 4@S transferred BW to partner|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Levin searching through his bidding box, can't find the bid he wants. Agica offers him 7NT, he says "I'm bidding 6@H"|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Levin "So is he saying he doesn't care what your minor is?" Agica says he thought that 3@d was pass or correct, so he bid 3@s to show black suits. Now he thinks W just has @ds|pg||

nt|ady: 11 tricks in either major     1@H?|pg||

nt|hedyg: no PO, but pd bid 4@H|pg||
pc|s3|nt|finch: Helgemo clearly noticing the vulnerability again - that might be a 1NT NV, but definitely not vul|pg||

pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: I don't understand why Fleisher signed off in 3@C. 2NT must show some kind of club fit|pg||
nt|joest: it does seem a bit conservative|pg||

nt|petergill: If @CA and @HK were switched, West's conservative decision at the other table might have been right, but staying out of 3NT vulnerable at imps is not usually best percentage bridge|pg||

mb|p|nt|lml: at the OR|pg||
mb|4S|nt|hedyg: agree PO, 3NT looked automatic|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: the vulnerable west made an awful overcall of 1NT|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: okay its tough|pg||
nt|lml: I am looking at the hands |pg||
pc|h4|nt|xenya: the 3@D bid made it easier for NS to reach 4@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: de falco leaps ahead|pg||
nt|finch: This is another hand that may not be as routine as you think. Where is declarer going to get his 10th trick if the @SA is wrong?|pg||
nt|daman: 14 more to DeFalco after board 9|pg||
nt|finch: Suppose the pointy aces are swtiched|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d3|pc|sA|nt|finch: unfortunately he is still short of 10 tricks|pg||
nt|daman: Tiger Woods has announced he will return to golf at the Masters in April|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes indeed|pg||
nt|po-s: how 10 tricks?|pg||
nt|finch: 5 trumps, two clubs, one diamond and one spade is only 9 tricks|pg||
nt|finch: he needed either to set clubs up or to make enough tricks by ruffing|pg||
nt|finch: if he tries to make 6 trump tricks he can never make a diamond trick, it's still not enough tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: but now he won't get a @S trick if E pitches the duece|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|hedyg: bidding 1NT with fit and an opening hand is not what forcing 1NT is about imo|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|roswolf: well this is a bidding test after a weak 2@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: E/W MAY WELL PUNT THE GRAND SLAM|pg||
nt|finch: it's a test of how sound your weak twos are. If partner might have QJ10xx you need to tread more carefully|pg||
nt|daman: as predicted   Zimmerman recouped 11 on Board 10    settled in 3NT|pg||
nt|xenya: i would bid 4@H if that doesn't show a powerhouse|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5NT is a popular bid for the specs|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 5 NT?|pg||
nt|po-s: You have KQx in trumps and suggest that partner should decide...|pg||
nt|lml: brb need lots of coffee|pg||

mb|1N|nt|daman: 5NT is very perilous     cannot count 13 tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah science|pg||
nt|lml: I think when you bid 5@H you are saying that you have hearts and spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: it is easy for us, but what about SJ?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: true good point p-o|pg||
nt|po-s: now not many heart ruffs likely in East´s hand|pg||
nt|lml: and if partner has the minors controlled then he should bid it|pg||
nt|lml: back soon|pg||
pc|c5|nt|roswolf: D0P1 here, so 1 ace|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||

nt|hedyg: what did you say re paralyse PO?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|daman: pass was DOPI|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|roswolf: hmm well they tried but no cigar|pg||
nt|daman: 5NT night have asked for specific Kings|pg||
pc|c2|nt|po-s: of course he wasn´t going to bid it|pg||
nt|finch: he suspects grand is on the club finesse at best, which is reasonably likely to be wrong|pg||
