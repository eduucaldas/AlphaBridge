nt|dohicky:  Mesbur misreading the lead on 27 gives Scotland 5 imps |pg||
nt|chick: This will be the last hand of this session, another session will follow in a few|pg||
nt|chick: minutes|pg||
nt|chick: Lots of thanks to our excellent vugraph operator, Liz Scott!  Thanks Liz, great job|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
nt|chick: a nice solid 4@S to finish this session quietly|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|xenya: of course 5@H was makeable -- on the previous one|pg||
nt|dohicky: yes|pg||
nt|dohicky: not on A and another @h lead|pg||
nt|cicus: oh no, Liz |pg||
mb|1D!|nt|dohicky: A weak 2 in @s with strong options|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|chick: EW do have a possible sacrifice in clubs, but cannot make 5|pg||
mb|d!|nt|xenya: here too|pg||
nt|dohicky: 4@s look ok|pg||
nt|dohicky: looks|pg||
mb|4S|nt|pdjourdain: 3N from north|pg||
mb|d|nt|xenya: a @H lead might be awkward?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@d infrangible as cards lie|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: again|pg||
nt|vugraphzdv: It appears so.  |pg||
nt|cicus: can you please warn them not to do it again for the last two boards?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdv: I can't clearly seethe held hand by east or south|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: but still should make|pg||
nt|dohicky: yes if S ducks a @c finesse after drawing trumps|pg||
nt|dohicky:  2N is probably some form of limit raise in @s|pg||
nt|lestergold: not a bad contract even with spaxdes breaking 4/2 plenty of chance of making as u cab uff a spade high if necessary|pg||
mb|p|nt|dohicky: Missing slam here could be costly|pg||
pc|dK|nt|dohicky: well with a @d lead it was down|pg||
nt|dohicky: well no it wouldnt :)|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think so|pg||
nt|xenya: on a @H lead declarer can work on @Ds making 10 eventually|pg||
nt|dohicky: Another possible 6@h|pg||
nt|lestergold: obviously hand breaks down if both key suits break badly but thats against the odds|pg||
nt|lestergold: i will be surprised if they reach slam of course the lack of wasted in clubs is the reason for the playabkle slam here|pg||
pc|d3|nt|dohicky:  maybe a more balanced version than 2@c|pg||
nt|lestergold: can they identify the fact that they are playibng with a thirty point pack in effect and they hold 27 of those 30 points!|pg||
nt|lestergold: its an aold and familiar story|pg||
nt|lestergold: Short will know his hand is great if south can be relied on for a stiff/void club|pg||
nt|lestergold: now short has a problem how can he show dim support and make a slam try as well?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|eamongall: England 139 Ireland 126 Scotland 114 I think is the current top 3 after 7 matches |pg||
nt|lestergold: looks l.ike short sighneed off in 5@d and south couldnt move|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|cicus: so it was West who opened 1NT and E transferred|pg||
nt|vugraphzdv: I don't think it's their fault - misdealt by me I think?|pg||
nt|lestergold: or can south puntit with those lousy spades?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|cicus: 4@D was another transfer to make the hand be played by West (I am writing this hanging from the ceiling)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lestergold: surely input error|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
nt|lestergold: thx operator|pg||
pc|s9|nt|barnets: ireland in 6@H on the @SA lead|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|nt|barnets: on the last board|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c8|pc|sA|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|hK|nt|dohicky:  Ruffing with the Jack made sure I think declarer may have a chance|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d6|nt|dohicky:  Sorry it wouldnt help always going to make if you get trumps right|pg||
nt|dohicky:  sorry -1 :P|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d9|pg||
pc|hA|nt|barnets: looks like 6@H will make|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d7|nt|barnets: on last board|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|dohicky: Ireland bid a the slam on 13|pg||
nt|barnets: so swing to ireland|pg||
mc|10|nt|eamongall: we have 3 early scores to be entered in other room |pg||
nt|chick: Thanks Everyone !!|pg||

nt|eamongall: 6 imps to ireland on 28 |pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: I don't know idf you can misdeal - boards are prepared aren't they|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|pdjourdain: At the other table Fil Kurbalija made 3Sx for Wales|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@s played by south of course infrangible|pg||
nt|lestergold: all other slams off|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: 1N?|pg||
nt|dohicky: 12-14 :)|pg||
nt|xenya: i can count 6 hcp|pg||
nt|dohicky: I think you missed a pass operator|pg||
nt|dohicky: EWs is 14-16|pg||
nt|dohicky:  1@c 11-13 bal or 16+ any|pg||
nt|eamongall: strong version of the Carrot Club|pg||
nt|lestergold: operator input check please!|pg||
nt|chick: looks like a makeable slam double dummy, but not finding the @HJ10xx will|pg||
nt|chick: probably kill it|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|xenya: yes, pass missed here |pg||
nt|dohicky: 2@d from N is 4@s + longer other or 5+@s|pg||
nt|dohicky:  1@d is 0-7|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh it is right|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry|pg||
nt|lestergold: NI did well to bid this slam in the open room|pg||
nt|lestergold: they will not be unhappy if the Scots miss this|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|dohicky: oh this makes more sense|pg||
nt|xenya: that's even better|pg||
nt|dohicky: An extra pass operator|pg||
nt|dohicky:  1N is 17-19|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdv: Yes but a couple ended up suited so had to be hand done, these seem to be the ones|pg||
nt|cicus: I am not familiar with the technicalities of BBO|pg||
nt|vugraphzdv: Carelessness on my part.  Sorry|pg||
nt|cicus: np, you do a fine job|pg||
nt|lestergold: spec points out that there are squeeze p;osibilities in 6H but it involves ruffing down the diamonds so west has rto guard both minors etc etc|pg||
mb|4H|nt|xenya: but did N really pass over 1N?|pg||
nt|dohicky: another pass missed?|pg||
nt|cicus: 10 tricks expected here with 1@S+3@H+2@D+4@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: this hand is aclassic hand of playing in the 4/4 fit to use the long suit fit for discards|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: I like the 4@H bid, knowing partner has at least 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|pdjourdain: Shields was planning a penalty pass of 2D so must bid 4H now|pg||
nt|xenya: seems unlikely|pg||
nt|dohicky: well he has 2@s as 5@s and a minor|pg||
nt|lestergold: not always correct as sometimes you need to play in the long suit for reasons of control|pg||
mb|p|nt|qwikjanz: so this should catapult wales into the lead|pg||
nt|dohicky: I suppose this bidding makes some sense (except for N first pass)|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|pc|d6|nt|lestergold: south has the club guard so has to bid it maybe is worried about trump quality presumably can enquire about that?|pg||
nt|lestergold: no he has chickened out and this will be very expensive for the scots|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: 13 imps the price|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hK|pc|d2|pc|h8|nt|dohicky: A spec points out that the 3@d showing a doubleton will take the only guess of the hand away|pg||
nt|dohicky: well one of the 2|pg||
nt|xenya: well 5@D is a nice contract -- and perhaps N did pass -- otherwise they would be in 4@S|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|eamongall: seems a decent contract 2@S ..although defence have big trumps but both hands 4333|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|xenya: or not|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe short is more to blame in this auction his hand after all is massive he should b enquiring about the club control|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|dohicky: Down now I think he needed some @c ruffs|pg||
pc|h9|pc|d3|pc|s8|nt|xenya: did 3@D really show exactly 2 cards in @D?|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
mc|11|pg||

nt|dohicky: :)|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: but not so good here for Wales|pg||
nt|dohicky:  Playing a low trump just there would have given an overtrick|pg||
nt|cicus: ??|pg||
nt|lestergold: mayb he thought that he had done that with hiis 4@d cue but south cant be sure about the esxcedllence iof north's 4 card spade suit|pg||
nt|chick:  Join us again in about a half hour for the final session|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|d!|nt|cicus: last hand of the set, thanks all|pg||
nt|vugraphzdv: Transposed again - |pg||
mb|r|nt|qwikjanz: been watching Gold Coast - well done to Hanlon and McGann -unfortunately they didn't win the final|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Last board before scoring break, restart 12.25 Brtish time|pg||
nt|cicus: 1@D is bid by east|pg||
mb|4H|mb|7C|mb|p|nt|chick: yikes!|pg||
mb|p|nt|pdjourdain: now 3C from East is weak|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: Guess he figures they are far behind and need the big swing|pg||
nt|chick: unfortunately it will be a big swing for the other guys when the @D finesse fails|pg||
pc|hA|nt|cicus: pls specs transpose positions|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|c6|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Now double?|pg||
nt|dohicky:  That pass worked|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|cicus: this may go down on a @H lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: excellent lead here|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Well done!|pg||
nt|cicus: but in fact I thought the lead will be from the ace, managed to confuse myself again|pg||
nt|cicus: after 2 rounds of @Hs N wil have to switch so declarer will have time to develop his tricks|pg||
nt|cicus: he can even  play @Ds from the top|pg||
nt|cicus: if S has the ace he will go up anyway to lead a 3rd @H so declarer may place the ace behind the king|pg||
nt|cicus: so there is no way to lose this contract|pg||
nt|cicus: Liz, is S thinking?|pg||
nt|cicus: we are stuck, I believe|pg||
pc|c7|nt|pdjourdain: though i thought South might dble 4C|pg||
nt|dohicky: This will be very ugly|pg||
nt|cicus: well, let me say good-bye, friends, have a good time and fun with the rest of the sessions|pg||
nt|vugraphzdv: Dozing!!|pg||
nt|lestergold: this looks like anothert gain for NI|pg||
pc|c4|nt|pdjourdain: Wales should take the lead at half-time, like a goal just before the break it helps the manager!|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|nt|lestergold: short of a tentth trick|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
mc|12|nt|eamongall: 7 to ireland on 17|pg||
nt|dohicky:  Thanks for watching there's no evening match today back again at 10am GMT tomorrow|pg||
nt|eamongall: and 6 to ireland on 18|pg||
nt|eamongall: and 12 to ireland on 19|pg||
nt|eamongall: the NIBU teams are looking a little tonked ...hopefully they will get some imps on the boards that remain to be entered|pg||
