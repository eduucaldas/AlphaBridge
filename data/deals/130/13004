nt|jwit: two remaining hearts, certainly not easy|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|jwit: With that line of play, he needs North to hold the third trump and also three clubs|pg||

nt|ady: silverstone liekly to open|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@d Multi also played by N/S|pg||
nt|justin c: more slams|pg||
nt|mcphee: that 4-1 fit looked like a tuff one:)|pg||
nt|chick: yes, I was starting to think someone was starting the party early :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: now this hand looks like 4@S may have a decent shot|pg||
nt|mcphee: it doesn't, but close|pg||
nt|mcphee: they must be taking a moment to hit the bar|pg||
nt|chick: may still be trying to get to the right set of hands|pg||
nt|mcphee: this is what we call teeter totter hands|pg||
nt|chick: teetering on the brink of disaster and then tottering back to normalcy?  :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: lets predict an auction|pg||
nt|petepunt: sorting boards out as we speak.  Players have right boards tho'|pg||
nt|chick: I'm starting to worry that the hands they are actually playing are not in the vugraph computer :-\|pg||
nt|vugraphzdt: Thanks first time doing this|pg||
nt|justin c: game likely to be let through if N overcalls 1@S and S raises with @SKQ doubleton (as he might)|pg||
mb|1C|nt|justin c: then north would assume 3@S in S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: likely to play 2H|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm now a real slam perhaps even a grand for the heroic|pg||
nt|justin c: 1NT 14-16|pg||
nt|roswolf: if they lock into hearts they may get into the grand|pg||
nt|justin c: should be able to find out the @DK missing|pg||
nt|roswolf: but diamonds is the likely trump suit = the 1nt opening should see to that|pg||
mb|1N|nt|pdjourdain: Good result for wales there and on board 15 at the other table we will see later|pg||
nt|justin c: nebulous precision type 1@D|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: 3N likely for E/W |pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: 3@C = 6@D i think|pg||
nt|garnetts: North will always bid almost whatever |pg||
mb|2S|nt|roswolf: presumably transfer|pg||
nt|justin c: support X, (3@H)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 3@H PROBE|pg||
nt|garnetts: rdble now catches NS |pg||
mb|2N|nt|ady: needs to shorten trumps as much as possible|pg||
nt|vugraphzdt: Another nine!|pg||
nt|jallerton: there are some entries to hand in @d|pg||
nt|justin c: now 3@S = shortage (maybe)|pg||
nt|justin c: it does|pg||
nt|justin c: 3NT will make EW with @C 4-4|pg||
nt|garnetts: 1NT has no advantage over redouble --in fact it rules out a penalty|pg||
nt|garnetts: However is East worth 3@D?  |pg||
nt|justin c: hard for him to judge|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: no splinter|pg||
nt|justin c: if there is a real @D suit in S, east's hand just falls apart|pg||
nt|garnetts: He was very aggressive on the last hand Non vul but not so here |pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Normal to bid 2D|pg||
mb|3C|nt|roswolf: void splinter|pg||
nt|chick: The vugraph operator is getting caught up on some hands that have already been played, we'll get to live hands soon|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: but difficult to reach|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: they will play 6@D|pg||
nt|justin c: looking that way|pg||
nt|justin c: 5@D okay too|pg||
mb|3S|nt|justin c: nothing wrong with playing this in 2@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|justin c: game needs a @D break and a @C break|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Excellent try|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not so sure Patrick--depends on a number of systemic arrangements|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: 3N lucky to make|pg||
nt|justin c: this looks like making|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: wants heart finesse to lose|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: but if he doesn't take it and South has Kx very bad news|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|justin c: y|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: can take A@S   and 3 spade ruffs   2 diamond tricks and 1 club trick   then exit and wait for 8th trick|pg||
nt|justin c: wont take long|pg||
mb|p|pc|s6|nt|pdjourdain: But well done the Jones!|pg||
nt|garnetts: The system NS were using almost forced this--No reason for EW to worry about a club lead on the auction|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Father Gary is West and son Dafydd East|pg||

nt|vugraphzdt: Connection plasying up bear with us|pg||
nt|lestergold: np|pg||
mc|10|nt|pdjourdain: safe now and will make an overtrick|pg||
nt|justin c: i suppose the problem with a @H finesse is that, N will hold up with Kxx or Kxxx, and that leaves the trump suit blocked with an awkward entry situation|pg||

mb|1D|nt|roswolf: 4@S might make if bid|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|pdjourdain: 3NT likely spot|pg||
nt|justin c: not a good time to try 6@H|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Prepared club|pg||
mb|d|mb|r|nt|justin c: should be able to find the @HAQ missing and stay out|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Doesn't look more than 4@H to me|pg||
nt|garnetts: guaging trump suit quality can be hard--here even 5@H could fail|pg||
nt|lestergold: double now but west will interfere|pg||
mb|2C|nt|justin c: 5@D is a decent contract, failing when the @HA is wrong|pg||
nt|roswolf: north might bid 1nt|pg||
nt|justin c: but 50-50|pg||
nt|roswolf: in some strong club systems|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: 2D forcing|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: non-forcing 2@S|pg||
nt|lml: and not much but trouble for east-west despite west's big hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|pdjourdain: 1@S = @H|pg||
nt|lestergold: now south needs to cue|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: 2@H shows a minimum|pg||
mb|2D|nt|roswolf: if north bids nt at any point south will raise to 3 when the defence will make hay|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: System card doesn't say but I think 2@S was an asking bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: and that will bring north top life|pg||
mb|3C|nt|justin c: looks like 9, losing a couple of @S, a @H and a @D|pg||
nt|lestergold: well west is givimng them another chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: a matter of partnership style whether East should bid 1@s or raise to 2@h|pg||
nt|justin c: declarer could make quite a bit of hay himself if east tries a heart lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: cards lay well  might scramble this|pg||
nt|roswolf: true|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: i think west is failing to downgrade his 18 count|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jallerton: card lie very well indeed|pg||
pc|d5|nt|pdjourdain: If so, 2N denied a high heart and 4@D was a splinter|pg||
nt|justin c: somebody applied the brakes in time|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4-4-4-1  have a tendancy not to live up to their billing often too much to do --especially with a 4-4 fit|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think n/s have underbid this|pg||
nt|lestergold: south's hand is enormous whenever north has a good club suit|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|pdjourdain: On Board 2 England miss the game reached and made by Wales|pg||
nt|justin c: this will lose a couple of trumps, but the rest looks solid|pg||
nt|justin c: :(  thought they might|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|roswolf: south is smelling the proverbial rat|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: They are getting their money's worth before reaching the spot|pg||
nt|justin c: two thin games bid by the welsh here, both succeeding|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|justin c: a few imps will swing on this lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: whoops|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|nt|chick: club is best lead, but without any entries, E may never get to enjoy them|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|justin c: if EAst gets out with @HA and another, S will have to decide what to do with his @D loser|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|nt|roswolf: claim quickly|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Even if declarer makes n o club trick the game is there|pg||
nt|chick: it's always more fun to take 8 bids to 3N where eveyone else just bids 1N 3N :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|pdjourdain: He can throw losers on clubs from north and ruff high once|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|justin c: kibs asking about 4@S NS|pg||
nt|justin c: dec has 10 winners|pg||
pc|c8|nt|justin c: but the defence take two hearts and a club then force south to ruff|pg||
nt|roswolf: but a heart force should sink him|pg||
pc|cK|nt|pdjourdain: There's the Board 2 swing|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Gary jones realised East had only the ace of clubs|pg||

mb|1N|nt|justin c: 4@H here I imagine|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 4@H or3NT is the choice|pg||
nt|chick: predictions?   1@H  2@H  4@H P, down 1 :)|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: 2@C = major + minor|pg||
nt|lml: anybody know who West is... K de R?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ady: now too high|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: 5D is missing three aces and four hearts can be beaten with a ruff|pg||

nt|pdjourdain: but only one off|pg||
nt|justin c: good moment for a coffee|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|justin c: who is leading this event overall?|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: rebid shows 15-17|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: although, E could save the diamond loser by setting up the @SQ for a pitch|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: 2@H was pass or correct bvut the risk was West had spades and diamonds!|pg||
nt|chick: this should tell NS they have a spade fit|pg||
nt|justin c: S contemplating 3@S rather than 2 here (i think)|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: agreed nothing to this |pg||
nt|lestergold: very lucky infrangible with @s A onside|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: difficult to blame east   2NT strong invote with 4 spades   but a simple cu at 2 level would have worked out better|pg||
nt|jallerton: Yes, I prefer to use 2@h as a good 4-card raise (2@c would be a good 3-card raise)|pg||
nt|roswolf: ireland on completed matches by 1 vp|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: 2@C checkback|pg||
pc|dA|nt|pdjourdain: small swing as 5D is also one off|pg||
nt|chick: @SK|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mcphee: might be able to dump the @D loser on K@S|pg||
nt|chick: can't make 4@S unless EW kindly set up a diamond pitch of a heart|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|justin c: might be a nailbiter|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: East denied 3-card hearts|pg||
nt|justin c: wales gained a swing by stopping in 2NT brd 17|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: king asks for count so if south has two West will guess he has three diamonds and East two|pg||
nt|vugraphzdt: Nth Loo break this hand apols !!|pg||
nt|justin c: which would have been a swing the other way if the @D position had been different :(|pg||
pc|cA|nt|garnetts: will play on spades here not hearts especially if a club is led|pg||
nt|lestergold: with 26 cpmbined miltons unlikely to be a swing tho|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mcphee: so may well make this one|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lml: this is a strange auction and it ended up with notrump from the wrong side|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|pdjourdain: the heart goes on the spade|pg||
pc|c6|nt|chick: may not have enough entries for that and twice finessing the @CA|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2NT is useful as a natural call|pg||
nt|lestergold: well west had no choice in most bidding systems but to respond a no trump|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c7|nt|mcphee: so save the @D loser but lose 2@C|pg||

nt|lml: K d R is Karel de Raeymaker|pg||
nt|vugraphzdt: looks like they are wrong way round|pg||
nt|lestergold: in that case lets stick to k de r|pg||
mb|1H|nt|justin c: if 9 tricks were made after that lead, then the @D ruff got away (maybe W ducking when S led a @S)|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: hard rebid here if West responds with 1NT |pg||
mb|1S|nt|ady: 2@H opened on board 2 where Dixon was down 2 in 3NT    2@H failed by 1 trick|pg||
nt|mcphee: 3@S dble 3N |pg||
nt|lml: its okay with me!|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: vul game wins|pg||
nt|mcphee: and should make|pg||
nt|garnetts: But still not easy--might bid 3@C |pg||
nt|pdjourdain: I agree with 2@H (Acol)|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: 4@D splinter possible but unpopular with the ace|pg||
nt|garnetts: In fact that has to be the right choice--might bid 3@H if it was forcing --not keen on splinter as spades might be better than hearts |pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Dafydd wondering what else?|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2NT forcing might be OK too--bot esoteric |pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphzdt: Sorry if I can't keep up but multitasking is not my forte|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: E/W play a special 2@D bid but this is too strong|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: on bd 18 the english bid 6@C for a useful swing|pg||
nt|mcphee: well passing seems a very deep postion here to me|pg||
nt|chick: 3@S can make, but he has to finesse the @S10 on the first spade trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: another dull routine game|pg||
nt|lestergold: might as well blog off|pg||
nt|lml: well K de R is probably thinking its not so routine|pg||
mb|3C|nt|jallerton: undo|pg||
nt|mcphee: or 10@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: 4Nt forcing too --hadn't considered that |pg||
nt|lml: but he is about to find out its not a slam|pg||
mb|3D|nt|jallerton: pass by South|pg||
nt|jallerton: 3@h by West|pg||
nt|jallerton: Helen|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: I think Board 1 was flat not 15 to NI as the score was wrongly entered|pg||
nt|justin c: did he really rebid 4NT here?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well he has great hand but no aces partner is minimum wont get too excited|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: E took quite a view here|pg||
nt|chick: yes, but I think 3N is equally dangerous ... W doesn't have to have nearly as good a hand as he actually has|pg||
nt|mcphee: so remove the Q@D and 3N is still a make|pg||
nt|mcphee: i would not expect my p[artner to dble 3@S facing a passed hand vul with a poor hand|pg||
nt|mcphee: this is no 1-4-4-4 12 count t/o dble|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: they open 2@D with limited minor two-suiters so West may realise East is strong|pg||
mb|4C|nt|justin c: might make 6@S here in absurd fashion|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: the spade overcalll may have kept the irish out of trouble|pg||
nt|chick: yes, in the open room, EW did not make 4@S :)|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: And Wales has stopped in game on board 3 when NI failed in  a slam|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: so once those two are in Wales has a lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzdt: yip|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: The jones bid several thin making games and several thin non-making slams!|pg||
nt|justin c: this one might make|pg||
nt|garnetts: 6@H will likely go off as there is no reason for West to play North for Qxx--can pick up Qxxx in the south hand |pg||
nt|justin c: ruff @H lead, @SA, @DA, @D ruff, Trumps, @C|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: only 8 tricks on heart lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: west may enwuire about aces and then play at 'unsaf' five level but that wont come to harm as dim ace onside|pg||
mb|4H|nt|justin c: W might have passed 2@D here|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: E wont let 3NT play|pg||
nt|chick: E should not settle for 3N, any strong 6-5 belongs in slam|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: 5@C more likely|pg||
nt|lestergold: east is bidding the pips off his 11 count opener|pg||
mb|4S|nt|chick: declarer has a lot of work to do, and the strong hand is exposed |pg||
nt|justin c: this auction is not sound|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: 5@D asked for trump queen|pg||
nt|justin c: West would bid the same way with the @SK, for instance, when 6@H is a claimer|pg||
nt|justin c: as David said, no real reason to get the trumps right here|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: On Board 3 where Jones bid and made the thin 3N Eng are in a thin, but sounder 5@D|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Here Gary will be happy to make 11 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: tempting E hand...|pg||
nt|justin c: 2 trump losers waiting if he moves in @C|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: depends on West having @CJ|pg||
nt|justin c: v hard for E - only needs @CJxx to lay down 6@C|pg||
nt|justin c: y|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: interesting double, which North may regret|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: i think S should have unblocked the J@D after seeing E play the 2|pg||
nt|lestergold: but west doesnt after all lihe his aceless wonder|pg||
nt|lml: good for west to stop |pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|chick: better for S to just bid the 2@H I think|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: thats the slam swing in but the scoring error on the first board has to be corrected|pg||
nt|justin c: @h10 lead maybe|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: when sees dummy wants favourable lie in BOTH minors|pg||
nt|chick: now he needs @CAxx with N|pg||
pc|d7|nt|chick: no need in diamonds, has 4 pitches |pg||
nt|justin c: wrong re lead of course :)|pg||
nt|justin c: thought he might try a deceptive @H in the hopes of offering dec a @H finesse before he knows whether he needs it|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: They can cut him off so not that simple even if North has @CA|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|justin c: hard to analyze this one - potential endplays everywhere|pg||
nt|chick: good example of when a re-transfer bid is needed|pg||
nt|chick: yes, agree|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ady: would rather defend 4@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: strange auction wes shows slam interest east appears to overbid and encourage him and he signs off|pg||
pc|dK|nt|justin c: NS can win this, cash 2@C, put dec in with a @S|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: the first double by Dafydd was "poor diamonds" the second "good hearts"|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||
nt|mcphee: good play|pg||
nt|chick: has unblocked it now :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: now can actually play safe for an over trick!|pg||
nt|mcphee: well like an over trick wif he makes it|pg||
nt|mcphee: this is going to cost 15 imps I predict|pg||
nt|chick: if he manages to work it all out correctly|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|lml: East is Anna Onishuk I am told.  She was born in Russia and we can call her O'nishuk to keep to the theme|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pg||
pc|c2|mc|11|nt|justin c: crouch knows he can promote the @HQ here - but trying to cash a @C first to beat 5|pg||

nt|pdjourdain: NO!|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: ummmm, I don't think that can be right, even if he accidently claims and opps agree :)|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Misscored|pg||
nt|lml: N. Ireland won 5 imps on the board that was whisked away|pg||
nt|lml: Both teams played in 4@S but it was doubled at one table|pg||
nt|lml: K de R keeps getting these interesting hands|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jallerton: is 4@s in any danger on a @C lead?|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: any game will fail|pg||
nt|garnetts: Very difficult hand to bid here--3NT not 4@H or even 4@S |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: likely to play 4@S  e/w|pg||
nt|roswolf: on bd 20 the irish didnt bid game|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: 3N difficult to reach|pg||
nt|mcphee: although 3N is a winner|pg||
nt|chick: the weak 2 will slow them down a bit|pg||
mb|1S|nt|roswolf: double seems ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 1nt is a little obscure|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: It will surprise Dafydd when south runs to spades!|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Declarers don't tell operator the result|pg||
mb|3D|nt|justin c: a @S lead against 3NT would remove the entry to the @D suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: as is pass!!!|pg||
nt|justin c: not so obscure by west :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|chick: some might argue for opening the S hand with 1@S (not me, though)|pg||
nt|justin c: (1NT by N)|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: So 1N is by South|pg||
nt|justin c: sry, meant S|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Still wrong E/W did not bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: ah sense at last|pg||
nt|mcphee: mackenzie taking a dm view of this hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: Problem is playing acol 4@H looks the bid here picture raise |pg||
nt|justin c: four rounds of @D would beat 4@S|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Overbid by Gary I think|pg||
nt|garnetts: it would I agree|pg||
nt|vugraphzdt: apols  no communication|pg||
nt|justin c: one off in 6@C, unless divine intervention|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: TD asks declarers to tell operator "one off" but I'm afraid they often don't|pg||
nt|justin c: Liggins v quiet here|pg||
nt|vugraphzdt: looks like i've had another hiatus NS playing this hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzdt: oops|pg||
nt|justin c: np|pg||
nt|vugraphzdt: Need to concentrate more|pg||
nt|justin c: 1@C-1@H-1NT maybe|pg||
nt|lml: what do you think ... 3NT by East?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lml: a thoughtful 3NT|pg||
nt|lml: West however is not going to be happy with that I wouldnt think|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: slam possibilities are fair   but would fail on the lay out|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: i play penalty doubles after 1N overcall and rescue, not takeout|pg||
nt|mcphee: this is a squence where multi falls short a bit|pg||
mb|4S|nt|chick: would you run to diamonds in N?|pg||
nt|mcphee: note also if declarer plays on @H he has difficulty discarding from hand|pg||
nt|mcphee: so @S is vastly superior|pg||
nt|garnetts: I disagree Patrick--4@H looks right to me|pg||
nt|justin c: tough to get to 3NT with these major suit fits|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: as do I|pg||
nt|chick: no need, W has rescued them|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Gary did not know the double was clearly for penalties|pg||
nt|lml: this isnt a bad spot at all if East accepts it|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: spoke too soon ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: lack of aces is a problem for declarer|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed justin|pg||
nt|lml: no guarantee this will make though|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ady: west  satisfied with game    diamonds are a a bit wesk to look for more|pg||
nt|lml: not a helpful lead|pg||
nt|lml: for declarer|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|chick: if the first X were for penalty, the 2nd one would certainly also be|pg||
nt|mcphee: perhaps S should take another bid|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Though his hand does suggest a NT contract|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|justin c: somebody should put a red card on this|pg||
nt|petepunt: East may have been better passing and picking them up in 100's here|pg||
nt|chick: my thought also, Pete|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: quite a few play the same method as they do over a weak notrump, namely takeout doubles of any rescue|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|jallerton: declarer might start with the @d finesse or maybe just lead @sQ out of hand|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mcphee: if 2@S shows a hand with interst in 4@H|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: 4@H normal but East could be much weaker|pg||
nt|lml: that however is helpful|pg||
nt|lml: East has to decide that spades are 3-3 though|pg||
nt|lml: this is a very tough hand to play and I would take a long time on it too|pg||
nt|Walddk1: http://www.bridgewebs.com/cgi-bin/bwma/display.cgi?pid=display_page5&club=bangorholidaycongress&sessid=545753491721727  for standings before the last round (scroll down)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|garnetts: One for a bidding challenge--but I cannot see how you can get to 3nt|pg||
pc|c3|nt|justin c: but not sure who|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah red cards are banned in bridge|pg||
nt|roswolf: on in football are they relevant|pg||
nt|roswolf: only|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|nt|petepunt: we had the oppossite of this earier in the day where west had a penalty x of 2@S n the same auction and passed.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|chick: same pair?|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|dA|nt|chick: perhaps N could bid 2N (15+), as a spec suggests :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: of course the problem is that S has no idea how many @S holds|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ady: dont like heart play|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Remember 2@H was Acol 9+ with 5@H|pg||
pc|d4|nt|roswolf: declarer knows his fate|pg||
nt|petepunt: no damage though, avoided 4@H.|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|dK|pc|s8|nt|petepunt: yes,  but GJones ahd the non-dbl choice|pg||
nt|mcphee: the N hand|pg||
nt|lml: this line is unfortunate I think|pg||
nt|lml: had diamonds been three three she could have shed a heart but I am not sure where she was going after that|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mcphee: so opportunities for both sides on the first 2 boards|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|jallerton: ...in fact neither.  This line leaves him vulnerable to forces if @s9 had not dropped|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cT|pc|c2|nt|lml: well it all comes back!|pg||
nt|lml: wow|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|vugraphzdt: just to keep you right EW names are wrong way round. Not my fault just the info I was given|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|justin c: why not try for south for 4@S there?|pg||
nt|lml: she has to set up clubs now I think|pg||
nt|lml: okay|pg||
pc|hA|nt|garnetts: depends how they play 2H---take the last hand for example if that is minimum then 4@H looks fine---I can hardly ever remember 3@H becoming the final contract when I played this ...|pg||
nt|garnetts: method|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|pg||
nt|garnetts: So much so that Dixon/Silverstone play 3@H as forcing|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mcphee: wd|pg||

nt|vugraphzdt: That's names corrected|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: thanks|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lml: a truly ugly weak 2 bid and the vul isn't an excuse this time|pg||
mb|d|nt|garnetts: looks like a 2@C bid to me --but what do I know |pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Now East might bid 3@C|pg||
nt|garnetts: just feels right to bid 2@C with xx spades |pg||
nt|garnetts:  should west bid 2@S perhaps |pg||
nt|pdjourdain: If West has a good hand with @HQx you want him to be declarer though not easy to engineer|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ady: part score  hand   20-20    e/w may play in either spades or hearts |pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Playing 14-16 NT East can bid 1NT on 10 points|pg||
mb|3N|nt|justin c: 4@S EW|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: 2@C = @D|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: East wants to show strong raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: maybe good hand for the weak NT here|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Now West might repeat the excellent spades|pg||
nt|justin c: 5@D will take lots on a non-@H lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: should make this one, although could go down|pg||
nt|mcphee: he had 7 tricks, strange|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Yes that may well happen|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: @H rate to be 4-2 so declarer may play on @S first|pg||
nt|mcphee: if so, he will be rewarded|pg||
nt|chick: no scores in the movie, so we'll just have to believe|pg||
nt|chick: but 4S will make on any lead as the cards lie|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|pdjourdain: Good spot making 10 tricks|pg||
nt|lml: not too much problem with this deal after the excitement of the last|pg||
pc|dA|nt|justin c: very hard for south to stay out of this|pg||
nt|justin c: i fear so patrick|pg||
pc|d2|nt|chick: EW play 1N 12-14 in 1st/2nd seat,  15-17 in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: spotlight on south remember|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|justin c: of course, if the lead isnt the @SA, then norths spade goes on a @C|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|justin c: i dont know their bidding methods|pg||
nt|roswolf: i hope they do|pg||
nt|justin c: told 4@D is 'last train' type slam try|pg||
nt|roswolf: blackwood might keep them out|pg||
nt|justin c: if that is right, north cant really know what to do|pg||
nt|vugraphzdt: Pondering|pg||
nt|justin c: if south had the @DK instead of the @CK, this would be an easy one|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: And declarer cannot really go wrong in trumps|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mcphee: bad news here|pg||

pc|d8|nt|roswolf: sign off|pg||
nt|justin c: transfer to the appeals committee|pg||
nt|vugraphzdt: Southerly pondering|pg||
nt|roswolf: bd 23 a disaster for the irish 3NTXX +2|pg||
nt|justin c: north might have cue bid 5@C here, hoping to hear 5@D when opposite the @DK but 5@H otherwise|pg||
nt|mcphee: i would also bid 2@C as N|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: He ruffed it of course|pg||
pc|d5|nt|petepunt: looks like 9 on top in 3NT|pg||

nt|justin c: i am told the other room is in 6@H on the @SA lead|pg||
nt|justin c: (which leaves it with no play that i can see)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mcphee: but it just goes to show you how holding 3 fast losers in the opened suit make it dangerous|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|s2|pg||

nt|pdjourdain: Cards lie well for declarer|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|petepunt: 4@S need good guessinig|pg||
nt|lml: 3NT is the usually bid you here from partner when they really wanted you to pass|pg||
nt|lml: usual|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jallerton: declarer can pick up the diamond suit for no losers - the contract will depend on how he plays the @C|pg||
nt|ady: hand 6   England played 4@S  down 2   when ireland retreated to 5@C after 4@S was doubled    14 imps to Ireland|pg||

nt|pdjourdain: There is a trophy at stake in this match: the Alan Pierce Trophy|pg||
nt|justin c: @HKQx onside does him no harm at all|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: As England won the first weekend Wales has to win by 47 imps to take the trophy but they are close now|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: But Board 31 at the other table was bad for Wales|pg||
pc|sT|nt|petepunt: good @C save for -200 but tough to find|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|mcphee: likely to guess @S right here|pg||
nt|mcphee: no neg dble of 1@H|pg||
pc|hT|nt|pdjourdain: 3N worse if North has 5@H and @SK |pg||
pc|h4|nt|justin c: i guess duck t1, win the next, 3@C pitching a @H, @H ruff, @S finesse|pg||
nt|justin c: just saw it|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||
nt|mcphee: nicely done|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jallerton: he knows @D 4-0 and suspects @s 3-7.  Can he be sure of the heart count?  Dixon should play @H10 on the 3rd round |pg||
pc|h7|nt|justin c: wouldnt try saying that after a few drinks|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|lml: I can sort of see 9 tricks|pg||
nt|lml: two spades, four hearts, two clubs and a diamond |pg||
nt|lml: or maybe an extra club instead |pg||
nt|lml: a heart back from east prob is best for the defence|pg||
pc|d6|nt|roswolf: yes sbriety is required|pg||
nt|roswolf: sobriety|pg||
pc|d3|nt|justin c: wonder if Eng can manage 6@S by S - not easy|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|pg||
nt|lml: wouldnt hurt to cash a heart and it might help|pg||
nt|lml: South can throw a spade easily enough|pg||
nt|lml: south knows where most cards are by now|pg||
nt|lml: cashing a heart and playing a diamond will work well here but then again most things will at this point|pg||
nt|lml: Ireland won a big 12 imps on the last board where east-west played the spade 4-3|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|pdjourdain: guess he threw a heart|pg||
nt|justin c: think a @H went on that|pg||
nt|lml: Hastings and GReer played 4@H which had no chance with the heart break|pg||
pc|h8|nt|lml: I like that play|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h9|pg||
nt|ady: dont think he will go wrong in clubs    surely South would have raised spades with a singleton club|pg||

nt|justin c: hmmm|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: The match is 32 boards with a scoring break after 16 so long way to go for Wales to reach 47 imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|pdjourdain: The 2@D is two-way|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|jallerton: 14-16 NT|pg||
nt|justin c: what could possibly go wrong|pg||
nt|justin c: 2@D 10-13, @D or minors|pg||
nt|chick: neither way will encourage W to do anything though |pg||

mb|p|nt|justin c: will stop in 3@S here|pg||
nt|justin c: wont encourage north to do a lot either|pg||
nt|lml: Do you know what 2NT is asking?  Is it strength or shape?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|roswolf: hmm unusual |pg||
nt|justin c: 4@H going off on a @C ruff|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: 3@S not a game try|pg||
nt|justin c: normally 3@h by E would be a game invitation, 3@S just competitive|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: My guess is that South will lead the J@C against this unless North has another  go--which I doubt|pg||
mb|3N|nt|justin c: south would rather defend 3@DX, if north doesnt...|pg||
nt|roswolf: east will be pleased he has 4 cards in diamonds|pg||
nt|justin c: do that|pg||
nt|roswolf: this now looks like 4@H|pg||
nt|petepunt: usually best to bid 1@S on these type of hand, even with 4points|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Fairly easy 9 tricks|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Wales has one good result to come at the other table on Board 15|pg||
nt|lml: Now that is an interesting development for West!|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: NS play ACOL, so this is all natural bidding|pg||
mb|4H|nt|chick: a WJS 2@S also works|pg||
nt|petepunt: expect 9 with @S ruff|pg||
nt|lml: okay that makes a lot more sense|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: perhaps 1NT-2@C-2@d-2@S would be constructive for this pair|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: PROBABLY SHOULD MAKE|pg||
nt|lml: I suppose North though South must have two hearts for this|pg||
nt|lml: I thought north south was on a different time zone or something|pg||
nt|lml: now it is north who is so hap happy|pg||
nt|lml: a bad one|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: some might try 2@C with south hand and go to 2@S if north does not show hearts   probably not right for their system|pg||
nt|chick: cards certainly lie badly for any contract NS|pg||
nt|lestergold: what kind of an aucrtion is tbhis/|pg||
nt|lml: the 2@S presumably showed both minors so I am not sure what West was doing|pg||
nt|lestergold: does north think they cajn run somewhere/|pg||
nt|lestergold: o mean what about a bit of a tickle|pg||
nt|lml: probably worried about clubs|pg||
mc|7|nt|chick: 5@D Q-ask|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Of course the ACOL 1@D-1@H might get there too if East did not raise to 2@H|pg||
nt|lml: not that it isn't worth a double anyway!|pg||

nt|garnetts: Good save in 4@S here--actaully a little unlucky not to make |pg||
mb|p|nt|pdjourdain: 3@S will probably fail|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Dummy has trump entry for club finesse|pg||
nt|chick: 3@C jump fit ... clubs plus spades support|pg||
nt|justin c: this gets out for one off|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Very tricky and well done by N/S|pg||
nt|lml: I dont think East is worth a slam try without knowing they have a heart fit|pg||
nt|lestergold: east would like tol bid 3 and a half no trumps now|pg||
mb|4N|nt|ady: should west go to 4@H  north would do well to pass  as e/w can make 10 tricks  or possible 11 in no-trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: looks like @H intra finess?|pg||
nt|chick: will be fun to see if he can smother the 10 that way :)|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Cards lie well for 4@H|pg||
nt|garnetts: I would certainly have bid 4@S in the North seat |pg||
nt|justin c: not sure 4@S is a bargain|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: at least two off in 4@S|pg||
nt|justin c: couple of @D, @HA, @CA, @C ruff off the top|pg||
nt|justin c: and dec still needs to drop the @SK|pg||
nt|justin c: E might bid a sixth here?|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: @D lead gives ruff & discard but may still be one off|pg||
nt|chick: ruff/discard does no good at all|pg||
nt|justin c: trump and 2@C to lose here|pg||
nt|justin c: Quite a view for E to let this go|pg||
nt|justin c: @SJ in dummy makes 5@S, when 6@D just one off|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear west is very good and probably has ana cceptance|pg||
mb|5C|nt|garnetts: As the card lie maybe not but 4@H is likely to make and you have a lot of undisclosed playing strength|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: meanwhile declarer is short of entries to take all those finesses in 4@H|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Declarer may have to ruff in hand to retain trump entry to hearts but they don't break|pg||
nt|lml: I would make a slam try if partner bid 4!G over 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: Dixon should have learnt his lesson in that respect!|pg||
nt|lml: 4@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: misundertsanding one is bidding quantittaive the other takes it as blackwood|pg||
nt|lml: West is going for sure|pg||
nt|lml: well in some partnerships I respond to blackwood when I accept 4NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: no play that i can see|pg||
mb|5D|nt|lml: so it may not be a misunderstanding just over exhuberent bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Sometimes it gets you defending 5@H  --I know the cards are bad but was looking at it as a single hand problem|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Declarer might cross to club run @HQ and then switch to diamond finesse|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: that gives him 12 tricks!|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|ady: yes I agree  west should not bid hearts a 4th time|pg||
nt|lestergold: east's 4N is a clearcut overbid|pg||

nt|lestergold: ten count no nermediates and no aces not enuf|pg||
nt|lml: they are too high now I think|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5n isnot too high|pg||
nt|lml: maybe there is a way to make 5NT if they stop there|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5n easy ebuf 3 spades 2 dims 2 hearts 4 clubs even without heart finnese|pg||
nt|lml: if you guess spades|pg||
nt|lml: do they have a way to stop in this auction?|pg||
nt|lml: does 5@S say bid 5NT??|pg||
nt|lml: this is not an auction I use|pg||
nt|lestergold: but in 6 you have to lose a dim aND SPADE IN OTHER WORDS NO WAY IOF COMING TO 12 TRICKS WITHOUT LOSING 2 TRICKS|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: east has raised    but this time wisely no double|pg||

nt|justin c: prob play 3NT here|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: yeah, counting 3 10's as a full HCP :)|pg||
nt|petepunt: not just 10's its the J10 and 1098 combinations too|pg||
nt|chick: the @D8 will be hard to read as a singleton|pg||
nt|garnetts: North might double with two aces--after all partner mentioned he was alive |pg||
nt|justin c: and unnecessary|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: with defensive values 3@S is enough|pg||

nt|justin c: this was their hand in 3@S|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: 3@S from West and 3NT by East?|pg||
nt|lestergold: a formideable player by any standards|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jallerton: should South bid his 2nd suit at the 4-level?|pg||
nt|chick: but if N continues the @DQ, they will set this easily|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lestergold: and a formideable person as well!|pg||

nt|lml: on the lie of the cards|pg||
nt|lml: not even for Rixi (if she were alive)|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think 1 spade bid free bid on two qs was bonkers|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|pdjourdain: Plenty of options for declarer but all work (e.g. playing on spades or diamonds)|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|lestergold: no preemptive value merely designed to encourage his partner to go wrong|pg||
nt|lml: well you see East knows West does miracles|pg||
pc|hA|nt|roswolf: west may duck the heart|pg||
nt|lml: he saw the previous hand for one thing|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jallerton: can get a loser away on the @C as West ruffs with a trump trick|pg||
pc|dT|nt|roswolf: in my dreams|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|justin c: :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I quite like 3@D over the double to show indicate a lead if they bid to 4H from a  Northerly quarter |pg||
nt|justin c: Pinning singleton @S10/9/8 in E, and finding N with @SA98xx or similar would be nice|pg||
pc|h9|nt|lestergold: West will need to outperform all previous miracles on this hand|pg||
pc|s9|nt|pdjourdain: spades look better to me|pg||
nt|justin c: (failing horribly on the actual layout of course)|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: should plan for 1 spade, 1 heart and seven minor winners|pg||
nt|chick: needs to set up the spade while he still has a way to it|pg||
nt|justin c: with the @SJ dropping, the @D 3-3 and the @HA in S, he can do no wrong|pg||
pc|s5|pc|hK|pg||

mb|1S|nt|ady: kib suggesting 4 hearts a make last hand   which look right|pg||
nt|ady: 109 hearts in north hand  and club holding of AJ  very good for a heart contract|pg||
nt|jallerton: Surely West does not have enough to protect here|pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: if he balanced with 3@D  surely east will try 3NT|pg||
nt|jallerton: probably just clarifying the NS methods: 2@h can be 5-4 either way round|pg||

mb|3N|nt|pdjourdain: Yes, you can show shortages, find 4-4 fits AND make opener declarer (see my invention)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: I think we missed a Pass here|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: 3N by SOUTH|pg||
nt|justin c: which would wrongisde @H in the event of a fit there...|pg||
nt|justin c: South has better chances than East of making this|pg||
nt|justin c: it is a vexed question how best to handle 3 suited hands opposite 1NT|pg||

nt|justin c: this could end up anywhere|pg||

nt|justin c: 6@D is a good contract|pg||
nt|justin c: but hard to bid|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: It looks now as if the Pierce Trophy will go to England though at one point the gap was only 6 IMPs|pg||
nt|justin c: needs a @C splinter from S, when Norths hand 'enorms'|pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: and south naturally enough assumed it was hearts|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jallerton: 6@c and 6@h both possible contracts here|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: 4@H suffers a club ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: which led to the unusual spectacle of an 8-5 spade fit being lost|pg||
nt|justin c: the method seems rather prone to that|pg||
nt|justin c: the better your fit is, the less likely you are to believe you have it|pg||
mb|4S|mb|d|nt|roswolf: indeed the method is sub -optimal and prone to give up large minus swings|pg||
nt|roswolf: agree justin|pg||
nt|petepunt: will need care with @C posotion in 6@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: again, 2@D shows hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|pdjourdain: They play my invention of 14-16 NT in 3rd and 4th seat, weak 1st and 2nd|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: specs have pointed out that on last hand a heart lead beats it by virtue of cutting off declarer from the clubs|pg||
nt|lml: yes I was just looking at that|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: england extend lead   got 11 imps on hand 11 when ireland went down 2 in 4 hearts and england played 3NT making 10 tricks|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@s control showing: an ace and a king, or three kings|pg||
nt|jallerton: presumably South can just bid 4@h now|pg||
nt|petepunt: may ruff 3@D in South and rev dummy|pg||
nt|chick: E is happy to defend @Ss|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|d5|pg||
nt|justin c: goig to be close|pg||
nt|justin c: @HA and another?|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: 3@D shows small doubleton with big heart support|pg||
nt|garnetts: maybe no club ruff now |pg||
pc|dK|nt|jallerton: Does 4@C agree @h?  Maybe it does, as South could have responded 2NT to show "any 6-card suit"|pg||
nt|roswolf: this also looks crazy bidding by the english but if you live by the sword occasionally you die by it|pg||
nt|chick: wonder what they play 5@S to show|pg||
nt|justin c: it is a pretty awful idea to break a @H transfer to 3@D unless you have a hand where responder shoulud declare|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d6|nt|ady: 5@S?|pg||
nt|ady: Ireland got 12 imps back on hand 12   found 4@H  when england went down in 3@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzdt: S believes 4n agreed clubs|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|roswolf: but you can also triumph|pg||
pc|cA|nt|chick: oh, never mind, @H is trump, not spades :)|pg||
nt|petepunt: think it needs a @D lead let through|pg||
nt|chick: so EW will get 2 hearts, and if E ducks a spade smoothly, maybe 3 @Ss|pg||
nt|lml: okay I double dare anybody to beat this one|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|pc|c7|pg||
nt|jallerton: to make 6@c he'll need to start with the Q from hand, then take another finesse on the 2nd round|pg||

nt|lestergold: easy|pg||

nt|lestergold: i wonder how it was made|pg||
nt|lml: yes 6NT from West is much better than 6@H from East|pg||
mb|4C|nt|jallerton: dbl shows a penalty double of @d|pg||
nt|jallerton: a matterof agreement what @s holding it promises|pg||
nt|ady: dixon double shows penalty pass of 2 diamonds and cards to compete|pg||
nt|ady: south likely 3@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: N might X when that comes back to him, or W might raise to 4@H regardless|pg||
nt|lml: although many people would transfer with the east hand|pg||
mb|4D|nt|jallerton: I rather like 2NT|pg||

mb|p|nt|justin c: why is this not making?|pg||
mb|4N|nt|garnetts: J@S led in the OR |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: this not likely to go well|pg||
nt|justin c: did i predict something that actually happened?|pg||
nt|justin c: (weird)|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|lestergold: hm Garvey led ten of hearts giving game away perhaps|pg||
nt|lml: in the OR West made it when North ducked everything and was eventually endplayed to lead a spade|pg||
mb|6H|nt|justin c: 4@H risky now - maybe push NS into 4@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: just shows your maturing judgment|pg||
nt|lestergold: thats how ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: lol|pg||
nt|golfsquash: At the other table north ducked an early J@c lead after hearts didn't break. Then declarer read the ending correctly.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|justin c: just saw the play at the other table |pg||
nt|lestergold: a case of ouit for a duck'segg|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ady: surely better to not play A@S first round|pg||
nt|lml: there might always be a squeeze though, if you play for one|pg||
nt|lml: NOrth has to hold the majors even if he takes the club|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|nt|garnetts: has nothing to recommend it does it|pg||
nt|lml: as long as 2 hearts arent played early|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a massive swing here for NI|pg||
nt|lml: which they will be|pg||
pc|hA|nt|chick: I can't see making this with the holey trump suit ... will have to lose 3 trumps|pg||
pc|h5|nt|roswolf: this is doomed too|pg||
nt|justin c: i see 6 trump tricks and a couble of @C|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: 14 imps|pg||
nt|lml: well obviously this has no chance|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h8|pc|h6|pg||
nt|lml: yes does that make it a tie?|pg||
nt|lml: no it gives N. Ireland the lead|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jallerton: Yes, but peraps hoping to gain the lead in @H|pg||
pc|s2|nt|justin c: the other two tricks are more enigmatic|pg||
nt|lml: and the only other comparison missing is good for them|pg||
pc|d8|nt|chick: or maybe only 2 :)|pg||

mb|2C!|nt|jwit: Another slam possibility here|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|eamongall: Tommy Garvey is an intelligent bridge player ... unusual for him to effectively rectify the count |pg||
mb|3C|nt|dohicky: Not the start RoI were looking for they are 11 behind England http://www.bridgewebs.com/cgi-bin/bwma/display.cgi?pid=display_page5&club=bangorholidaycongress&sessid=131041744928728|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|eamongall: carroll and garvey do bid but these are not their bids I think |pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4N|nt|jwit: 6D can be made, but will require careful play with a heart lead.|pg||
mb|p|mb|6D|nt|eamongall: I am advised that Hastings and Greer are heading for the probably not making 6@Ds |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|eamongall: Unusually for BBO ...we are using EW first names but thats ok |pg||
nt|eamongall: except for the records |pg||
nt|eamongall: Hastings Campbell and Greer McKenzie ...|pg||
nt|jwit: Without a heart lead, this is relatively easy.  With one, it becomes difficult|pg||
nt|eamongall: lets see whats led first |pg||
pc|s4|nt|eamongall: ok we don't have a @Hs lead ... but on a @H lead .. ruffing @H and @DJ was suggested by a few kibbers|pg||

nt|roswolf: our toes.|pg||
nt|roswolf: and finally another irish horror show in the other room|pg||
nt|lml: a disappointing board but really east-west did play the wrong contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this slam hand unlikely to produce a swing|pg||
mb|1C|nt|jallerton: Thanks also to my co-commentator, David Edwin|pg||
nt|lml: not in a helpful way for east-west for sure|pg||
mb|1H|nt|chick: This is the last hand of this session.  We will be back in about 1/2 hour for the|pg||
nt|chick: next one, please join us :)|pg||

nt|pdjourdain: England gained on the 5@D freak|pg||
mb|1N|nt|justin c: 5@D seems kinda high...|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: so this 32 board match is very close now|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes they failed to follow the well known principlethat when you have two apprently solid long suits its better to play in no trumps in case one doesnt break|pg||
nt|lestergold: as well as right siding the declaration|pg||
mb|3H|nt|roswolf: scheduld re start in 40 mins|pg||
nt|petepunt: tx cornelia and specs|pg||
nt|chick: Thanks to our excellent vugraph operator, Helen Cole!|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: one good result for England still to show|pg||
nt|lestergold: but lets face it a lot would play this in hearts wrong sided|pg||
nt|lml: this was a terrific match and thank you Mike and spectators for making it so much fun|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ady: thx all    a very swing set     england made 3@SX last hand another large swing|pg||
nt|chick: Thanks to our very excellent vugraph operator, Helen Cole, great job Helen!! :)|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: The other table table also has one board to play|pg||
nt|justin c: 1@S to deny @S here (or 1@S by south - anybodys guess)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well you were on  great formurself Linda!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: 2nd half  of the match coming up in 20 minutes from now|pg||
nt|lml: now East really doesnt have much is he really going to bid 6?|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course non vul opps trying to throw the odd spanner into the works|pg||
nt|lml: the @HK is likely worthless|pg||
nt|lml: he has been the big bidder all day so I think he will step up|pg||
nt|lml: a real pressure bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: in open the NI pair had plenty of information exchan ge no intereference|pg||
nt|lml: West really has a huge hand ... really too much for a one bid in the first place|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2c opener mnorth couldnt inetrfere over that|pg||
nt|lml: with the length of the pause West can hardly bid 6 over 5|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|ady: another mis fit|pg||
nt|jallerton: England did well to stop in 2@s in other room|pg||
nt|justin c: if your mental equilibrium is of value to you, do not look at the auction in the other room|pg||
nt|petepunt: 1n is 15-17 on 3rd pos vuln, hence 1@h|pg||
mb|6C|nt|chick: a very conservative contract, especially vul|pg||
nt|justin c: losing the first 9|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: see you in an hour's time for the final match|pg||
nt|justin c: expensive habit this, vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: Crouch/Patterson play a strong @c system, so West was able to show a distributional hand without huge strength|pg||
nt|petepunt: tx all,  will have right boards on bbo form the start on sunday!|pg||
nt|chick: hehehe|pg||
nt|chick: Peter will see to it personally :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: 2N is 11-poor 14 i suspect|pg||
nt|chick: W doesn't have much to work with here|pg||
nt|petepunt: entries not easy to set up @D|pg||
nt|chick: a hand of aces and small cards is not much use at 3N, despite the point count|pg||
nt|chick: I don't think he can get more than the 2 top diamonds|pg||
nt|petepunt: lack of 10,9's and 8's is unusual|pg||
nt|chick: only 2 spade tricks, 1 club, 3 hearts ... I don't see much hope for a 9th trick|pg||
nt|chick: 13th club possible|pg||
nt|garnetts: hard to avoid leading that card |pg||
nt|garnetts: srry thought he led a spade --better lead than i would have found|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 1@H    1NT    2@S   all pass in OR|pg||
nt|lml: East did step up...well done East!!|pg||
nt|lml: and in a very thoughtful way.  I am not sure I would have thought of 4NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: director called ??|pg||
nt|golfsquash: trump lead best|pg||
pc|c2|nt|roswolf: yes a little surreal|pg||
nt|lml: well one could argue that the length of time for the 4NT bid influenced WEst but I think West has her bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm ducking the Kd could make this hand awakward|pg||
pc|c5|nt|golfsquash: yes|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|petepunt: worth considering using 2@D as 8-10 with 3@H by a passed hand. :)|pg||
nt|petepunt: fav lie of cards here|pg||
nt|justin c: just @DK here or|pg||
nt|justin c: no time to finish that thought :)|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|jallerton: playing Acol, perhaps West should content himself with 2@h over 1NT|pg||
nt|justin c: my 'mature' judgment sees five @H and five @C for dec |pg||
nt|roswolf: ah but in which order?|pg||
nt|justin c: unless of course he goes and ruffs the third @D high, but I dont think he will do that|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|nt|justin c: @H first Geoff, @H first|pg||
nt|petepunt: but too slow |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|justin c: (safety play)|pg||
nt|chick: Yes, will make overtricks and regret not bidding 3 :)|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|jallerton: but you can see how game might be making if partner has the right high cards|pg||
nt|lestergold: now??|pg||
nt|lestergold: brown cow??|pg||
nt|lml: hook the spade :)... not really|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: this is down 2  so some imps for england|pg||
nt|lestergold: er i do not think so|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|nt|pdjourdain: On Board 14 at other table Eng also in 4@H Noth has @CAK to lead and flatten board|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|hA|nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|justin c: thanks all, hope you enjoyed|pg||
nt|roswolf: thx all see you soon|pg||
nt|justin c: see you later|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: count signal north didnt read it|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c7|pg||
nt|justin c: for the second time, one hours time is not the final match|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lml: hard for west to duck with the @HA|pg||
pc|c8|nt|chick: last heart will put a little pressure on N|pg||
pc|s2|nt|chick: Thanks Peter!  Thanks to everyone, see you again soon :)|pg||
nt|petepunt: 13 & 14 to score|pg||
nt|petepunt: 14 likely gain to NI and 13 tough to predict result without A@S lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: was robbed!|pg||
mc|12|nt|lml: well if they duck the diamond WEst could possibly hook the spade|pg||
