mb|1S|mb|2N|an|4 card limit raise|nt|roswolf: 4@H is routine for the bulgars|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ralfwil: a good save in 4@s|pg||
nt|brolucius: Some players use 2@S to show a sound three-card raise of hearts, 2NT to show a sound four-card raise.|pg||
nt|roswolf: and will be reached now since 2nt is limit+ in hearyts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I didn't see an alert on 2NT, but I was distracted by some loud discussion next door & N alerted|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|warrens:  because of each pair having a double fit, 4@H makes and 4@S only down one.  the LAW is adjusted when there's a double fit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: 2NT here is four-card support, constructive or better.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: EW took the save in the other room|pg||
pc|c4|nt|roswolf: must say i think east went too quietly here|pg||
nt|brolucius: A club ruff comes, yes, but the diamond loser will go away.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think the save is correct in the long run|pg||
nt|jtr: Michaels may have induced West to save|pg||
nt|warrens:  Weinstein and Levin usually play very slowly to trick 1.  they look to think through the enire hand.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Levin thought for a while over 1@h, presumably deciding between 1@s and Michaels and having chosen 1@s stuck with that|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jtr: In general, when you have made them guess by pre-empting you should stick it|pg||

nt|roswolf: are they playing polish club then?|pg||
nt|brolucius: They are playing some sort of club system, so I assumed the same.|pg||
nt|jtr: We may find out|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h5|pc|h4|nt|brolucius: Jan Martel said at the start: 'Some sort of Polish Club'.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: From the discussion before they started, they are playing a sort of Polish club, but NV, 1NT is weak|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|h3|nt|roswolf: ty jan|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|pc|h6|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: 2@c is usually natural but includes some balanced medium (17-19 I think) hands|pg||
nt|roswolf: a teammate of n/s says "they play 1 cl could be strong , with transfers on first level"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Here is one who knows the N-S system well, welcome to Rado Radev from Bulgaria|pg||
nt|rado: Hi all:)|pg||
nt|jtr: Welcome Rado|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi rado|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hi Rado|pg||
nt|brolucius: As Ralf pointed out, it was a close decision for West to bid 2@D (with no guarantee of a 4-4 fit) rather than to pass the double for penalties.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|pc|d4|pc|s3|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c7|nt|brolucius: Weinstein must think that his declarer play if better than his defense.|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|rado: NS use polish like 1@C with transfer advances|pg||
nt|jtr: Board 2 was flat|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jtr: So 1@s could be quite strong?|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h2|nt|rado: 1@H/@s normal 2/1 style opening|pg||

pc|c4|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|pc|s5|nt|jtr: 18ish|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|rado: 1NT and 2@C (5+cards) range depend on vulnerability and positions|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rado: pick a minor|pg||
pc|dT|nt|rado: 1@D usually 4+ non balanced except 1st and 2nd non vuln vs vuln when 1+card|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Sorry, shouldn't have gotten involved in the system discussion, he actually ruffed a spade before playing on clubs, so N is out of spades. I'll go back and fix if I have time|pg||

mb|p|nt|rado: nooooooo I just helped them|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: OK, fine|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@H is not really invitational. Some pairs use double as a game-try.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk2: Is 2@H really alertable because it's weak?|pg||
nt|jtr: Depends where you are|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: No, 2@h isn't alertable, but the only way I can explain when they do is to put in the alert box - it wasn't alerted, Levin asked|pg||
nt|jtr: With screens you may as well alert everything|pg||
pc|dT|nt|brolucius: Victor Silverstone suggests that East might have led the @DK to look at dummy.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|warrens:  declarer can get a heart ruff here, but runs the risk of a trump promotion after doing so.|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|warrens:  he can make it if he draws trump, finesses clubs and plays four rounds of clubs pitching one of his losers when they ruff in with the Q of hearts|pg||

nt|jtr: Good exit though|pg||

nt|rado: the inventor of NS sys was late Svilen Trendafilov best theoretician, coach and  great friend|pg||
nt|warrens:  needs to get tot he dummy three times in order to ruff in his hand, but W can pitch clubs on spades to beat it|pg||

mb|1D|nt|xenya: a bit surprising that 2@D was made in both rooms|pg||

mb|2H|nt|bridge_one: 2@H was better|pg||
nt|robbg: 1@d precision|pg||

mb|p|mb|3H|nt|bridge_one: 4@S ON for NS - 4@H 1 down|pg||

nt|daman: surely he can't be thinking about what to play|pg||
nt|robbg: which @h|pg||
nt|daman: perhaps the @H pitch by declarer on the 2nd @S has confused him |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: martel turning head side to side as he reads|pg||
nt|robbg: he should have a count on south's hand now.|pg||
nt|daman: 1825 specs hold their breath|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: dawson motionless|pg||
nt|robbg: but doesn't know about @hJ.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: for the curious, Martel reading a Joe Haldeman novel, Worlds|pg||
nt|robbg: the @hK is kind of a giveaway|pg||
nt|daman: the longer he thinks    the more he will not play another @H|pg||
nt|daman: if declarer had the J   he would never play the K|pg||

nt|ralfwil: -1 after a @d ruff|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|brolucius: East will wonder why he is given only one ruff.|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer false-cards the @D4 to put some doubt in West's mind.|pg||
nt|jtr: The @cK will reveal the defence|pg||
nt|warrens:  Since West has only 2 @d's, I think he might cash the club Ace before playing the diamond back|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes great point Warren|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree warren|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cK|nt|brolucius: Excellent point, particularly as the @D10 is a high card.|pg||
