nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone @H@H|pg||
nt|chick: S is already thinking slam here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's a handicap event, so the underdogs, the OS.se team, has a 20 IMP advantage in the first set|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|lestergold: so cautious bidders lucky day|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont know their methods but 3@h should be a weak bid in most modern styles|pg||

nt|lestergold: as 2@s avaialble to shopw a good raise which of course north has|pg||
mb|3S!|an|Asking for shortness with S supp|nt|peachy: I would tend to agree, in competition weak|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: south should pass whatever the 3@h bid means|pg||

nt|santyclz: 6@h doesn't have any pitfalls, 6@ss is in danger if the defense starts with 2 rounds of @cs.|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 12 was flat. 4@S -1½ in the other room|pg||

mb|p|nt|chick: theoretical danger, but not as the cards lie, I think|pg||

pc|c9|pc|cQ|pc|c7|pg||
nt|chick: if E could both make dummy ruff AND lead a heart to knock out entry, then it might be tougher, but he can do only one of those|pg||
pc|d8|nt|santyclz: Defense would be so much easier if they would let us lead 2 suits at the same time.  Maybe we should write a letter.|pg||
nt|chick: nah, if it were changed, then someone would want 3|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: it would be easier to be declarer if you could play two suits at the same time too.. I always seem to run out of entries for my finesses.. :)|pg||

mb|1C!|an|11-13NT/17+|nt|lestergold: should be aflattie tho|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Very disappointing that a strong club top pair did not bid it next door|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: and Mats Nilsland will be playing for Sweden seniors at the European Teams Championships this summer. Good luck to him!|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: yes, Roland, easy to set up clubs for a heart pitch|pg||
mb|2C!|an|17+, either BAL or !C |mb|p|nt|nilsland:  thx |pg||
nt|ralfwil: On a @s lead to @sJ S should play @sA, not the @sQ|pg||
nt|bucheister: Would be a great time to win the J with the A|pg||
nt|peachy: maybe this would be time to win the spade with ace.... since diamond finesse needed into W|pg||
nt|lestergold: we can predict play win cash top dim enter dummy with club take @d fionesse and then west has no chopice but to switch to a heart|pg||
nt|peachy: heh, you gues are faster typists|pg||
nt|santyclz: My kind of grand.  No finesses, only 1 line and it works.|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|nilsland:  More exciting if East had ventured 3 NT|pg||
nt|nilsland:  would south find the diamond lead|pg||
nt|chick: but such a perfect fit is not always easy to uncover|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|daman: maybe after laying down the @H Ace|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Very strong team. Morath-Flodqvist (Tjolpe), Nilsland-Dahlberg and Bjerregaard-Gullberg. They would have done very well in the Open event I am sure|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Now heart ace is not so good|pg||
nt|daman: nope|pg||
mb|4N|nt|daman: anything but a @H|pg||
nt|daman: clearly 3@S was not forcing|pg||

nt|ralfwil: as @sJ denies @s10.....|pg||
nt|lestergold: but his pard's blood pressure rising as tank goes on|pg||

mb|p|nt|santyclz: Did e ever get to show a long solid suit?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: he showed 6+ @S|pg||

pc|h8|pg||

mb|p|nt|nilsland:  Pity it will not make due to the spade lay|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unfortunately the 4-0 trump break dooms it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Very unlucky, it's a 95% slam, roughly|pg||
nt|othered1: aThe stiff @D devalues south's hand slightly, but it still has enough extras to push on.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|daman: maybe they will avoid the trap by peeking :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: as you can cope with all 4 with West|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The correct play in spades is the queen first|pg||

mb|p|nt|nilsland:  You have to learn it "the hard way"|pg||
nt|lestergold: if west has shown a good raise in spades then east should beexploring because his hand becomes enormous|pg||
nt|peachy: if he went to game, might as well have splintered or done something|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|othered1: south will have to push this the rest of the way|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h8|nt|nilsland:  man or mouse? Man - it seems|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder if north's 4@C control bid was forced or whether it implies slam interest (good trumps are a plus).|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|lestergold: club splinter cant cost|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk2: The fact that the 9 is with AK makes the slam 5% better, from 90 to 95% (half of the 4-0 breaks)|pg||

nt|santyclz: Well, I don't understand the auction but this hand will not send people swarming to learn the system.|pg||
nt|chick: hehe|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 2NT was forcing to 3@C, 3@D asked for short suit with C supp, then cue, cue and uhm.. well..|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|lestergold: well three off now maybe|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @hJ????|pg||
nt|peachy: three for sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: we call it 'eating her own childrfen'|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|nt|nilsland:  3 C was probably a normal raise. South did not whether W had diamonds or hearts really|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: Frissan has lost all of the advantage, and plenty more :(|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the only way to lose 3 @h tricks by his own|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They have not recorded a single IMP so far|pg||
nt|othered1: NS should take a good look at their methods, since a common type of intervention gave them no chance to focus on what's important on this hand.|pg||
nt|nilsland:  If double was take out that would solved the problem, but this is a siatuation that surely was not discussed|pg||
nt|santyclz: ... and uhm |pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: is it her?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Restart scheduled at 20 mins past the hour. Due to the late start we will probably be facing a slight delay. They are on board 8 in the other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzew: 1@H=nat or strong|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But EWs goalkeeper has don his work for EW|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Was the same last Monday when they did not concede a single IMP until very late|pg||

nt|vugraphzew: will be hard if we get to play against them in the final :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Seems like the handicap is inadequate. Same last Monday|pg||

mb|2S|nt|othered1: Thanks also to the Filbyter Bridge Club and Carl Ragnarsson for bringing this event to  BBO. |pg||

nt|chick: I assume 2@D is asking further description|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yes|pg||
mb|d!|an|!D + semi-support !H|nt|Walddk2: Play will resume after a short break, perhaps 10-15 mins|pg||
mb|p!|mb|3H|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|lestergold: yep east backs in|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: and i think pushed n/s overboard|pg||
nt|peachy: N bid again.... I am amazed, in 4-card major system|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: north has not got a vestige of a 3@h bid |pg||
nt|peachy: not impossible to make though, if guessing the lead is singl|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|othered1: Previous hand emphasizes the need to h ave "metaagreements" on handling 2-suited overcalls, so you  have some basis for action if one pops up against you.  A much better use of ...|pg||
nt|othered1: your time than concocting schemes to find third round controls on high minor suit auctions, etc.|pg||

nt|peachy: more hearts please|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Or even 6 @H :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|othered1: @D tap won't beat 6@H?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Very well done!|pg||
pc|dA|nt|othered1: Very well done.  Minor suit slams aren't easiest contracts to find.|pg||
pc|d7|pg||

nt|chick: and now S knows that partner is out of clubs, so a club to him, and heart back|pg||

nt|chick: everyone was getting totally bored with just me :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: if East would have passed, as I think he should have, South may pass 3@C D|pg||
pc|c6|nt|daman: that was a heavy 1@H overcall|pg||
pc|c9|nt|daman: and South found a reason not to raise|pg||
