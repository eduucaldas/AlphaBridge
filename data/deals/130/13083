nt|bucheister: Hi Shirley; I will be with you tonight|pg||
nt|bucheister: Hi everyone; I am John Buchheister and will one of the commentators this evening; welcome all|pg||
nt|lml: very low scoring match so far|pg||
nt|petergill: A few years ago there were big wraps on Eric Greco - Geoff Hampson as the pair most likely to be the successors to Meckwell, but so far the successors to Meckwell as America's best ...|pg||
nt|petergill: pair have been, well, Meckstroth - Rodwell. |pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|xenya: yes, lots of it maybe|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: love the double on 3-4-3-3|pg||
nt|lml: and his son used to play with my son in juniors|pg||
nt|petergill: Team Rosters are at http://www.acbl.org/nabc/rosters/2010/01/VANDPRS/   ... these teams are seeded 3 and 30|pg||
mb|4H|nt|xenya: and the double by W is...?|pg||
nt|hedyg: Fleisher 11 seed|pg||
nt|lml: very top range for 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: the double is support I would think|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: west doubles for pens?|pg||
nt|lml: yep there is the alert|pg||
mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|lml: they are having a great tournament|pg||
nt|petergill: Jessica Piafsky is in her 30s - I played against her in the European Championships in San Remo last year, when her bridge partner was Bob Drijver|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now what?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|roswolf: lively first hand|pg||
nt|dburn: close decision|pg||
pc|d5|nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  need to play game in 4-3 heart fit|pg||
nt|ady: sorry    4 losers in hearts|pg||
nt|kareno: Interesting hand.|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|hedyg: Agica seed 75|pg||
nt|lml: passing on the south hand is a good decision as it turns out|pg||
nt|lml: but there are 14hcp opposite an opening bid|pg||
nt|dburn: South might have take the odd-looking action of reopening with 2NT to show the minors|pg||
nt|lml: I think going for bidding is the concentration of strength in the north hand|pg||
nt|petergill: With everyting friendly, 11 tricks are easy, but the best line of play on unfriendly breaks is not clear. |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 2 @H was constructive.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW carding udca -- 1st count, then attitude|pg||
nt|lml: I think a heart now is right |pg||
pc|c3|nt|lml: going against bidding 3NT is the vulnerability|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lml: that seems more normal|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok now|pg||
pc|c2|nt|petergill: Barry Piafsky is Don's son. He was in Canada's youth (under 26) team in 1997. |pg||
nt|lml: I was thinking about whether to play a club up|pg||
nt|petergill: North might think - if @SK is ofside, perhaps I can dispose of all my spades on dummy's clubs, but entries to dummy are limited, so I will retain @H3 to cross to @H4 if need be|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|davidstern: Hi all so a close match here|pg||
nt|lml: okay that was the other choice|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|nt|lml: they found their minus like they should|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|roswolf: well shouldnt this be game? - east a little wet i think|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like they stopped too early|pg||
nt|daman: Good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|bucheister: It truly is a bidders game; in the old days no one would dream of bidding over a strong NT with that hand, now it is automatic|pg||
nt|lml: yes my son Colin's partner in that |pg||
nt|dburn: tendency is to bid game what it's close anyway, but at these colors staying out of game wins as many IMPs when right as bidding game does when that's right|pg||
nt|lml: yes but the concentration of points in one hand (the openers) makes it a bit better|pg||
nt|lml: on the other hand the only five card suit was clubs|pg||
nt|lml: it is a tough call|pg||
nt|fabsayc: excellent and not especially obvious shift by Lauria|pg||
nt|dburn: sure - you can make game more easily on less than the normal values when one defender has all the strength (and you know it)|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont believe this lead|pg||
nt|kareno: Oh, less interesting.  South's happy - this one he can beat... but not with a club lead!|pg||
nt|lml: keeping that 3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good call peter|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hi all|pg||
nt|lml: hi|pg||
nt|petergill: East flew with @CA in case North had a singleton club and @d losers |pg||
nt|fabsayc: welcome not sunit|pg||
nt|petergill: Hi Sunil|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kareno: North convinced himself that south's second suit was clubs.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h8|pg||
nt|xenya: but they are not vulnerable and it's 1st hand|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|sK|nt|xenya: hello George|pg||
nt|kareno: But west had to take the pitch on a heart!|pg||
nt|kareno: Guess west also convinced himself about clubs in south.|pg||
nt|rodal f: But for shure N knew that S had S. Was it a brain drop? Belive so.|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, the club king was a bizarre lead.|pg||
nt|panja: hi all|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed; was wondering if 2@h showed majors, but it probably does not or Rodwell would have corrected to spades|pg||
pc|hT|nt|roswolf: its never too early to start losing|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lml: well he still has to make 2|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hi Martin and Peter|pg||
nt|petergill: Retaining @HK and @H4 as possible entries|pg||

nt|hedyg: welcome John :)|pg||
nt|bucheister: Welcome to my partners in crime|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ok spectators, not that bad|pg||
nt|dburn: still, 120 was the best that East-West could do here|pg||
nt|lml: the Paifsky's did the best they could... well done|pg||
nt|petergill: @C8 by West at Trick 2  was upside down count, showing 1 or 3 or 5 cards |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: another fun hand|pg||
nt|bucheister: Maybe that S hand is a little too strong and suited for 1NT at imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: par|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|daman: lots of shape|pg||
nt|daman: 2@C is the only safe place for NS should they compete|pg||
nt|lml: now that to me is a very borderline opening|pg||
nt|lml: did north really bid 1@S?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|xenya: they will|pg||
nt|bucheister: Seems like it has been a pretty tight match so far|pg||

mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: Normally others troubles begin when I enter :)|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|lml: hey sit for it... right its not game|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@H was a transfer bid|pg||
nt|ady: south managed to get into the bidding 2nd round|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: Michal Kwiecien won the 1998 World Pairs with Pszczola, who is now an American. Their nicknames, which I will use, are Quick Sand and Pepsi Cola |pg||
pc|h4|nt|dburn: to some extent, but you could see why he would want to protect his major-suit holdings|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C Polish, could be short, includes any 18+ hand|pg||
pc|h2|nt|daman: would we all have bid 2@S over the double?|pg||
nt|bucheister: these are all relays|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15, 2+@D   2@C=one round force   2@H=11-13 bal|pg||
nt|lml: not going to make this one|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S forces 2N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N is normal game try|pg||
nt|lml: I think Don must be very pleased to be playing in this great event with his son|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@S a little surprising, presumably because hampson as passed hand will have tolerance|pg||
nt|lml: the longer he thinks the more I think he might make it|pg||
nt|lml: could East have the hearts?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|dburn: 2@h showed a weak no trump, 2@s was a transfer to notrump to get East to be declarer|pg||
pc|h5|nt|xenya: i confess i would|pg||
nt|roswolf: so would i|pg||
nt|lml: well this got north the spade lead which is a pretty good one|pg||
nt|bucheister: they must always accept the transfer; most of the pair accept with at least three|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bucheister: If you are going to open that 1NT you have to convince yourself to compete later in the auction|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yuck|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ady: this should be a + for n/s    neither quite able to doubvle 1NT|pg||
nt|lml: South had a shot at doubling but not north|pg||
nt|panja: 11 tricks because after @SQ drops...@SJ can be finessed|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|lml: I think this is pretty normal|pg||
nt|kareno: The percentage on the heart finesse was not 50-50, rather it was three to one.|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|daman: would garbage stayman apply over the double?|pg||
nt|roswolf: where was the axe? somebody asks?|pg||
nt|roswolf: not with me|pg||
nt|finch: it's quite handy to bid a natural 2@C over the double|pg||
nt|xenya: axe? what axe?|pg||
nt|daman: on Board 1   repeated @D tap held declarer to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|daman: I have been advised they use 2@C as either clubs or two suits if run when doubled|pg||
nt|finch: it's very difficult for North to double; his partner has shown nothing other than long clubs|pg||
nt|finch: East could be 5=5 rather than 5=4|pg||
nt|roswolf: very true frances|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|s4|nt|lml: great defense so far|pg||
nt|bucheister: would a doubleof one heart be a takeout double of 1S?|pg||
nt|bucheister: I don't think game tries are in their vocabulary|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i was wondering if trump return could ever be wrong|pg||
nt|lml: same defense in the CR|pg||
mc|9|nt|bucheister: or would it be hearts?|pg||
nt|lml: you could play that|pg||
nt|lml: you could play it either way.  you should agree|pg||
nt|ady: I think most play double of 1 heart shows hearts and bid 1 spade with short spades as a take-out|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes 1@s takeout|pg||
nt|lml: ace and out a heart looks decent approach for south|pg||
nt|bucheister: specs should discuss this with their partnerships because this is becoming very common|pg||

nt|daman: a lovely 5-1 fit|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|hedyg: np Richard, sometimes they play too fast for the operator to keep up|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|ady: e/w   likely to end in 3NT|pg||
nt|lml: 3@C looks a bit better than I usually play it|pg||
nt|dburn: now, that is a strange sort of 2@h overcall, but it came to no harm|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all 3rd seat NT opener's are treated as "weak"  so this DBL=14+ HCP|pg||
mb|2D|nt|dburn: not sure what West is supposed to do here - take a view and pass, or scramble to 2@c|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|bucheister: he certainly has the right cards for partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|bucheister: You are doing a great job; thank you|pg||
nt|dburn: that he does - slightly surprised that South did not bail out into 2@d|pg||
nt|fabsayc: undo|pg||
nt|kareno: Operator I am sure it is north who bid 3@d|pg||
nt|panja: 3Nt is the limit for NS here..|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: I do not ... just the other table of this match|pg||
mb|3N|nt|dburn: awkward, that South hand - no comfortable fit into any category (one-bid, pre-empt, pass)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: all very normal|pg||
nt|daman: back to back 3@H contracts for EW    could have 3 for 3 had West balanced :)|pg||
nt|finch: tHelgemo put off protecting by the vulnerability (and the fact it isn't matchpoints)|pg||
nt|lml: well they now have 9 top tricks |pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure it will come up this hand, but EW play Reverse Smith Echo vs NT|pg||
nt|panja: but S has opened 'natural' 1@C|pg||
nt|gambit: marginal opener |pg||
nt|fabsayc: tit for tat, attacking communication|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: spade lead would have proved better for the def |pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: they always did with the doublefinesse in @d|pg||
nt|ady: likely 10 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: now can make 10, yes|pg||
nt|lml: yes they can make 10 now and probably will by the double diamond finesse|pg||
nt|panja: and North has natural Club suit..so naturally, N has higher ambitions|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lml: guessing they would end in the same place after an opening pass|pg||
nt|petergill: EW are the rare Polish pair who play Standard, not Polish Club|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|nt|fabsayc: transfers over 2nt rebid would work better|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: I'm sorry ... N, not W bis 3@D|pg||
nt|fabsayc: np|pg||
nt|kareno: I use Gladiator after 2nt rebid.  Then 3@c - 3@s - 3nt is suggesting club slam but south would quit.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this auction completely off the rails now|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or 3s over 2nt with transfers also ending in 3nt|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: Rod has so many options while still holding @DA|pg||
nt|panja: In the OR, S opened a Prec 1@C, it seems like, so they had time to explore below 3N and stop at 3N|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|po-s: and North will try to cash three spade tricks|pg||
nt|lml: there was never any risk in it anyway|pg||
nt|lml: and this is easy now|pg||
pc|d7|nt|lml: if South has the @HK instead of the QJ...|pg||
nt|petergill: I think a club switch is best now|pg||
nt|lml: it would be easier to do with 2 of them|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure about the spade lead - that would have guessed spades for declarer, who could then make simply by taking a heart finesse|pg||
nt|petergill: Then if declarer plays spades, the defence continues spades while the hearts are blocked, so |pg||
pc|d4|nt|dburn: but this is becoming serious - covering that club will allow the defenders to preserve communication and collect 500|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|pg||
nt|petergill: Spades don't break|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|petergill: after a club switch, declarer might have to unblock @HA then guess spades|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c4|pc|sK|pg||
nt|finch: The problem with entering into this sort of auction is that NS have not shown a fit, and there could be a very large penalty|pg||
nt|finch: You just take the odd below-par partscore result|pg||
nt|daman: stay fixed|pg||
nt|finch: ....particular if they are going to play in 4@S in the other room|pg||
nt|daman: with apologies to Al Roth|pg||
nt|lml: he has 9 tricks anyway|pg||
nt|lml: sorry I miscounted|pg||
nt|petergill: I can see 8 of them|pg||
pc|h9|nt|gambit: 3NT went off one in the closed room  (as predicted by someone ) on board 33 for 5 Imps to VP |pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: @S8 upside down attitude -- does NOT like @S|pg||
nt|dburn: but pitching that spade will send it back to 300|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he did like spades - in effect, he unblocked the suit for declarer|pg||
nt|dburn: @s8 may have been upside-down suit preference for clubs, rather than reverse attitude in spades|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|petergill: The play could be very interesting|pg||
pc|s4|pc|c5|nt|petergill: Declarer mwill have to guess the ending to make this|pg||
nt|petergill: When South discard a @D, East will stop to think|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|d5|pc|c2|pc|d9|nt|fabsayc: how does he do that?|pg||
nt|lml: cute play will make it with the finesse|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|sunsamvar: hi all|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|dburn: but whatever it was, it was a card with which West could not afford to signal, though it was almost impossible for even Meckstroth to know this|pg||
nt|ahollan1: most Q3 scores [all but 1] now available at  www.usbf.org|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|bucheister: maybe S did not realize that the double was a strong hand and not the normal Meckwell|pg||
nt|gambit: cash th aces, exit with a spade|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: squeezing defense down to all winners|pg||
nt|petergill: the tricky bit is to cash @CA after winning @HA, playing for East to have started with one not two clubs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is this right??|pg||
nt|lml: this is an amazing match.  the score is so low because they are playing so well|pg||
mc|9|nt|petergill: Jacek Kalita - Krzysztof (pardon my spelling) Kotorowicz at the other table would be in their late 20's - they used to play in Poland's World Junior Team for many years. |pg||

pc|sT|pc|sA|nt|finch: Declarer's problem is that if clubs don't run he doesn't have 10 tricks. Try giving North the same shape but the @CJ instead of the 4|pg||
nt|bucheister: the bid could have worked but probably more suited to MP|pg||
nt|lml: what do they say -1100 is character building|pg||
nt|ady: should be 11 imps for e/w   -1100|pg||
nt|lml: that will build some character for sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: believe me Linda it isnt|pg||
nt|dburn: I suspect that 2@h doubled would have cost quite a lot more than 800|pg||
nt|gambit: Even my mama says if you never go for a digit - you're not bidding enough.....something I fail to heed adhering to Alvin's philosophy :) |pg||

nt|finch: Trumps 3-2 there's not problem, of course|pg||

pc|d3|nt|bucheister: spade lead was probably more aggresive than a diamond anyway|pg||

nt|fabsayc: anyway defense off to a good start, with many entry problems for declarer|pg||
nt|dburn: so that the Dutch-Canadian alliance is now 14 IMPs to the good|pg||
nt|lml: he knows where the clubs are which should help|pg||
pc|s6|pc|dQ|pc|d9|pg||

nt|xenya: not clear why N went up with the ace |pg||
pc|d8|nt|daman: or    it might be the blending of the names of his dogs :)|pg||
nt|finch: the club switch cleared up the suit while a heart switch would have led to some potential problems|pg||
nt|finch: Of course the defence don't know what declarer's problem is|pg||
nt|lml: later much later North has to repeat to himself I wont make bad overcalls vulnerable after 1NT|pg||
nt|rodal f: pass for a|pg||

nt|petergill: If South retained his clubs and pitched his hearts, there might be no endplay for the overtrick that doesn't risk the contract|pg||

pc|d6|nt|kareno: That is a sick-looking preempt!|pg||
nt|lml: this vulnerability is just too tempting|pg||
nt|fabsayc: preempting with this hand type invites opponents to bid 3nt|pg||
nt|lml: they were always going there|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@CX, very hard to double it admittedly, would be 800 I think|pg||
nt|fabsayc: true but when you can rely on the preemptor to have no entry, is much easier|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|nt|hedyg: very friendly hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not a misprint -- leads are 2nd/4th so SMALL from doubleton|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s impressed by the vul went very quietly - far tooo quietly for me|pg||
nt|bucheister: pretty routine hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: black suits lie just right|pg||
nt|lml: on a diamond lead east would have to guess spades|pg||
nt|lml: here it is not so important|pg||
nt|petergill: The 3@C bid helps declarer work out how to play the hand|pg||
nt|kareno: But can you?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|petergill: I think it would till make if the 2nd @d is ducked|pg||
nt|petergill: still|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lml: yes I think so too|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|finch: Well, this time if NS want to come into the auction they can go for a very juicy penalty|pg||

nt|daman: people have no sense of humo(u)r    I tried to make a joke and I get 300 messages|pg||
nt|kareno: Everyone liked the east hand for 1nt.  I'm not mad about it but it's not a terrible bid.  All roads lead to 3nt and diamonds don't break so push board.|pg||
nt|petergill: At the crossroads now - does North try to set up the 5th @h, or do something else?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|kareno: Seems like the hearts is the way to go |pg||

pc|d8|pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@S has better chances than 3NT|pg||

nt|gowdy: no  end play w  for a @s|pg||

nt|lml: not all that crazy about that overcall either... probably just me|pg||
nt|gambit: how about Pass from W now...yikes, 1NT ....|pg||
nt|lml: not lead directing, doesnt take space|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: not all players open a weak 2   with 4 in the other major|pg||
nt|finch: he's right, though, because NS are making game|pg||
nt|panja: tricky bidding situation|pg||
mb|3N|nt|USBF: Probably they're just going on to the next board so the director can think about whatever issue was raised|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: N/S don't have a copy of the ACBL defense printout|pg||
nt|kareno: I think the Poles, who play forcing club, are well aware how useful it is to break up these auctions if they can.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you add options with double|pg||
nt|lml: double didnt seem to do much|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I never like this auction but this is a good hand for it|pg||
nt|petergill: Cornelis van Prooijen at the other table is a different Dutchman from the van Prooijen who won the Spingold last year|pg||
nt|kareno: Would 3@c be a fit jump?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: anyidea of the scores in the other matches ?|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|finch: even playing in 2NT is better than 2H making or 2H off one|pg||
nt|panja: good 4@C bid..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Q3 scores are posted at  www.usbf.org|pg||
nt|lml: so 3NT or 4@S with a bad break|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: Meckstroth and Rodwell need the ACBL defence to a Multi?|pg||
nt|panja: and now they are on track for a slam..|pg||
nt|kareno: And if spades are 4-4 you go down on a cold contract?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: perfect fit here leads to 12 tricks in black suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|bucheister: I agree but everytime you pass the opponents find their fit|pg||
nt|hedyg: N showed 5-7 hcps with 3 card fit or up to 10 hcps with 2 cards in @s|pg||
nt|lml: thats why I dont like this auction|pg||
nt|ady: this should just make     |pg||
nt|lml: it is too vague|pg||
nt|lml: what do you think about an overcall of 1@S on west's hand|pg||
nt|poohbear: thats pretty unreasonable|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kareno: 2nd and 4th leads.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: according to 2008 Convention Card  Kwiecien DBL = @H|pg||
nt|lml: that does make more sense to me|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that makes more sense|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, sensible now in the context of the auction.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bucheister: One thing is that it makes balancing more difficult not knowing if they have an eight card fit|pg||
nt|hedyg: terrible|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pg||
nt|hedyg: what should he overcall?|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  only lost 3 imps on hand 20    690 made in OR|pg||
nt|lml: I dont mind it white but it is a bit rich red|pg||
nt|panja: nobody has asked Aces yet..|pg||
pc|h2|nt|panja: how did they come to know 6 was the limit?|pg||
nt|gambit: I guess Lauria has seen those overcalls a few times |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|daman: they can make 4@Ds|pg||
nt|finch: while opening a weak two with a 4-card major on the side is not traditional, with that hand you want to play|pg||
nt|finch: in hearts even if partner has four spades, which makes the 2@H opening better|pg||
nt|daman: actually   can make 5@D probably|pg||
nt|finch: NS may only be able to make 4@D but they can make 3NT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3nt not forcing so 7 out of the question|pg||
nt|lml: ignoring the bid Lauria finds the best lead :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: but it's A LAW  [as opposed to THE LAW]|pg||
nt|dburn: Versace's bidding throughout his long and hugely successful career has always been based not on "what have I got?" but "is it my turn?"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i haven't seen that interference to Big Club before   DBL=@H  1@D=@S  1@H/@S/NT=2-suit|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|bucheister: It is a bidders game; |pg||
nt|petergill: Easy to make this looking at 52 cards, but looking at 26 cards the best line of play is unclear|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: ruff a @D and throw 1 on the @HA|pg||
nt|petergill: Only 9 easy tricks if @SK is offside|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if you trust the lead plan to ruff a diamond|pg||
nt|gowdy: the auction gives us a plan  @S 's on side  and @C on side|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and i tend to trust polish leads to be honest|pg||
nt|kareno: Seems pretty clear as a line of play.  Concede a heart, a spade and a diamond.  |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: w/o the @H lead maybe establishing @C might have been the chosen option|pg||
nt|petergill: EW lead bottom of doubletons so East will not have a doubleton @H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 8-6 of @H can not be from a doubleton|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|nt|petergill: East might have falsecarded in @h, but Polish experts (except a few such as Pepsi and Balicki) are not known for a lot of falsecarding |pg||
pc|dA|nt|gambit: cute|pg||
nt|fabsayc: which leads to a new strategy, bid no trump with no stopper and all side suits covered|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@H is normal in Lauria - Versace's style. Their aim as a passed hand is to get into auctions on 5 card majors at the one level whenever possible, for various reasons.  |pg||
nt|fabsayc: and the worse the suit the better|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|poohbear: poor gamesmanship on the part of MW|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|panja: 20-21 2Nt..Change W's @DK to @SA..and 7 would be on cards|pg||
nt|lml: going down 1 here|pg||
nt|lml: after the good lead|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|nt|poohbear: assuming thats the issue|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|lml: it might work on this hand if you push north-south to 3@S|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|cT|pc|c4|pg||
nt|bucheister: Well, if its not allowed its not allowed; no matter who you are or playing against|pg||
nt|po-s: Is this considered a long enough match to allow it? My guess is that it is allowed BUT you must provide a written def|pg||
nt|petergill: East did not want to falsecard in case partner has stronger spades and a @D shift was needed to genuinely beat 4@S|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hedyg: making an overcall with that hand is not what i would call bidding|pg||
pc|h3|nt|dburn: well, we don't know what's really going on - I'm sure Jan will keep us posted|pg||
nt|dburn: not completely clear why East did not bid 2@d, mind|pg||
pc|c9|nt|poohbear: I wonder if it would be an issue if they were up 50|pg||
nt|petergill: Martin's comment has some truth in it, even if he was joking. If you have overcalled 1@H on an ordinary suit and partner doesn't raise and they reach 3NT, you might lead something ...|pg||
nt|petergill: else. Their overcalling style and opening leads are very much interwoven. |pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|dburn: in the meantime, speculation is entertaining but fruitless|pg||
pc|cK|pc|s3|nt|finch: as he's not in 3NT he probably isn't giving the overtricks his full atttention|pg||
nt|baylind: 7*9 arasý gece bbo|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lml: it was just pointed out that Barry might have bid 2@D which was safer than 1NT|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|nt|kareno: Probably ruff high|pg||
pc|s2|nt|po-s: so Linda, what would you do on West, and what do you do if you actually have your bids but happen to be white?|pg||
nt|lml: it only works because partner has cards and a fit|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|lml: I wouldnt overcall vulnerable|pg||
nt|lml: I would overcall white and partner should treat it as a sensible overcall but be just a tiny bit cautious|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: nice @C discard on the @H|pg||
nt|petergill: North wisely pitched his 2nd club on @HA|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h5|pc|s5|nt|sunsamvar: now cross ruff|pg||
pc|c3|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Brad asked about 2@d and 2NT so I was able to put the information into the bidding box|pg||
pc|c2|nt|debrose: My understanding is that it's a good idea to overcall very aggressively vs. Polish club, since you can make life very hard for opps to sort out which hands|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Brad asked if 2NT showed exactly 5 spades, and K says yes. They also asked about the HCPs promised by 1@s but I'm afraid I didn't hear the answer|pg||
nt|debrose: On the other hand, when get doubled vul, hard for them might be getting 1400 instead of just 1100|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Specs tell me 1@s promised at least 7 HCPs|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2NT shows 5 or more spades and 7+ hcp|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@S would show 4|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: When Brad asked about 2NT he was told exactly 5 spades|pg||
nt|debrose: The club 2 lead is probably "3rd and low", so declarer has no idea about the location of the club honors|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'm also told 5@S and min so closer to 7|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Yes, I don't remember if he asked on this hand but they have asked before and Fred & Brad lead 3rd and low|pg||

nt|bucheister: we will find out on this hand|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@C-1@D:1N=18-20, so my guess 1@H=2 or 3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: Kwiecien is known for creating variations on standard Polish club|pg||
pc|d8|nt|daman: I might have passed 2@D|pg||
nt|hedyg: welcome Richie :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@S=hold and S signed of since now hold at @C|pg||
nt|kareno: I think north should bid 4@h over 4@d as a possible place to play.|pg||
nt|petergill: Last board: If Barry did bid 2@D, then North would have doubled for take-out, reaching and making 2@S by South. I think  that's why, with 2-2 in majors, he avoided bidding 2@D|pg||
nt|petergill: @D lies well for the defence - declarer has a lot of work to do to make 1NT, despite his 10 count|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 1 @D I mean|pg||

pc|d4|nt|daman: when I do that    my partner has a 6 card @C suit|pg||
nt|dburn: this is a touch unlucky - a vulnerable game on a 3-3 break is just about with the odds at IMPs|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ady: strange hand     n/s can make 3NT    looks lije a round 9 tricks in spades|pg||

nt|ady: hi Richie|pg||
nt|lml: hi |pg||
nt|reisig: hi hi|pg||
nt|petergill: With 3 jacks, no long suit, no tens, 10 points might be an overstatement of the West hand's real value|pg||

nt|fabsayc: what now?|pg||
nt|poohbear: bracket sheet up http://www.acbl.org/nabc/brackets/2010/01/vanderbilt/|pg||
nt|petergill: so this match, and Team 38 (with four Bulgarian stars) v Meltzer, are the only two where the underdogs (by seeding) are well placed  |pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|nt|lml: its borderline|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|po-s: and some imps surely|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|petergill: Any card that is not "high and red" should lead to -1, I think - but North doesn't know that, so he will think|pg||
nt|fabsayc: low club coming|pg||
nt|kareno: Not @s 8?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Greco asking several Qs about auction ... possible holdings, etc.|pg||
nt|petergill: According to the Kaplan and Rubens Evaluator of a hand's worth at http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi, the West hand is worth 8.55 high card points|pg||
nt|gowdy: the 2@H a @Sand a @C could cost  a @H never|pg||
nt|fabsayc: when i can take .55 of a trick i will use that evaluator|pg||

nt|Walddk4: He has his defence ready should Fred ask|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|Walddk4: "If you can have 4 hearts for 1@H, I can have four spades for 1@S"|pg||
nt|panja: 22HCP between EW...but they will likely make only 6 tricks here..|pg||
nt|debrose: Attacking the suit where you are missing the Ace is a good general principle in playing NT contracts|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: at equal vul, 3rd, I don't see the point in anything but your normal opening, promising values|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But he is in 4th, my mistake|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kiwibridge:  more so in 4th|pg||
pc|h2|nt|panja: Note that EW have all the J's, NS' the Ten's|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|panja: in common HCP count, J's are slightly overvalues, and Ten's aren't counted at all...|pg||
nt|panja: overvalued..|pg||
nt|debrose: However on this hand it will allow the defender's to set up South's spades|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s8|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Walddk4: Yes, they should adopt my HCP scale. Ace = 6.13  King = 3.21  Queen = 1.97  Jack = 0.38  Ten = 0.22   It may not be so easy to remember, but it's more accurate|pg||
pc|c3|pc|dT|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: are calculators allowed at the table Roland, seems a great scale|pg||
nt|Walddk4: "I had 18.52 hcp, partner, I think"|pg||
nt|panja: a little simpler is A 4.5 K 3 Q 1.5 J 0.75 and Ten 0.25|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|panja: it sums up to 40...|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|debrose: North had a tough discard here, and probably thought his partner didn't have another diamond.  South decided his priority was to set up his spades|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|nt|debrose: the diamond discard was probably best, as a club discard (unless the Ace), would have made it possible to never get to the South hand|pg||

nt|hedyg: he is actually sure of it|pg||
nt|bucheister: Is that forcing?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: ... the players must have 2 copies of the ACBL defensive printout on the table ... they do not.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C=6+@H, INV|pg||
nt|bucheister: thank you|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 6@D?|pg||
nt|daman: gag|pg||
nt|finch: at my local club there would be plenty of pairs in 3NT. A good pair will get to 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@D looks like a splinter to everyone, right?|pg||
nt|bucheister: We have two interpretations of 3C|pg||
nt|po-s: of course...|pg||
nt|dburn: tough to sort this out - if West had @cK instead of @cQ, seven hearts would be a decent contract|pg||
mb|3H|nt|lml: no but he thinks game is unlikely opposite a passed partner|pg||
nt|bucheister: But 1nt may be a much better contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: YUP I AGREE BUT THERE IS A PLETORYA OF CONTROLS|pg||
nt|finch: A 2NT rebid makes it much easier for South to insist on spades|pg||
mb|4C|nt|kareno: I think east's is an overbid.|pg||
nt|lml: he could have done better though|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: from the usual unauthorized sources?|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|bucheister: Slam try by Meckstroth|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: this is a good pair, so 4@S it is|pg||
nt|daman: tah dah|pg||
nt|roswolf: soory for the shouting:(|pg||
nt|po-s: rightsided...very clever system|pg||
nt|dburn: as it is, 6@h needs some luck - North rather than South needs to have @sK|pg||
nt|bucheister: Picked the right side this time|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: @H not bid until the 6-level!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: pure luck of the draw that North holds @SK|pg||
nt|bucheister: Winners make their own luck Al|pg||
nt|po-s: perhaps 4D was RKCB|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you need an agreement about 4 level delayed bids in partners suit, cue bid or choice of games|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: well they have agreed hearts I believe|pg||
nt|lml: and are looking for slam|pg||
nt|ady: 6NT  best    as 6@H would fail on bad trunp split  however the spades lay|pg||
nt|bucheister: This starting to get away from NG|pg||
nt|ahollan1: their 2008 European Teams Convention Card + Supplemental Notes|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|nt|dburn: well, 6@h is a shade better than 50%, since even if South did hold @sK, someone might have the singleton @cK|pg||
nt|gambit: EW a little greedy on that one, poor fit(s), modest texture,|pg||
nt|lml: a heart lead is the best I think|pg||
nt|fabsayc: then will versace take first round diamond finesse|pg||
nt|lml: but a club does look attractive|pg||
nt|petergill: What should East do if heart is led and @D10 is led from dummy at Trick 2? J, A or low?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|gambit: low smoothly |pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|lml: this is going to be tough|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|nt|petergill: Boring 11 tricks|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|pg||
nt|ady: they are going to be lucjy which ever slam|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ady: the gap might be closed here|pg||
nt|hedyg: the kind of slam i like, cant go wrong|pg||
nt|lml: it is a pretty normal slam to bid really... the OR should get there|pg||
nt|lml: the defense has 5 tricks now if they realize it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: there will be a little think about 4-1 heart breaks now|pg||
nt|petergill: On Board 53, the game swing was in aprt due to East's 3@C preempt backfiring, in part due to NS bidding at the other table, and in part due to declarer play. |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|petergill: This spade play is perhaps designed to put the opponents off playing spades|pg||
nt|fabsayc: versace fishing for heart continuation|pg||
nt|petergill: if so, it did not work|pg||
nt|lml: interesting|pg||
nt|gambit: Nice play by West |pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|bucheister: I think the other pair will also bid it; 50% minus 33% I think|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes you do.  I have that auction often enough to know that it shows honor and one in pard's suit.|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|nt|lml: it will be easier now!|pg||
nt|petergill: The discouraging @H2 at Trick 1 got the job done|pg||
nt|gambit: club through?|pg||
nt|lml: very nice play by West|pg||
nt|petergill: Then true count at Trick 2, when many players give Smith Signal here, helped West find the best defence. |pg||
nt|fabsayc: after the discard he can play hearts|pg||
nt|lml: it was just pointed out that all eight boards at this table have been played in notrump|pg||
nt|petergill: Barry Piafsky might be trying to work out why Versace has chosen such an unexpected line of play|pg||
nt|gambit: and why toss a heart?|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|petergill: Otherwise, this match continues to be very low scoring, with low error rates|pg||
nt|ahollan1: who keeps inventory of all those parts?|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|nt|po-s: not to mention the possibility of a different lead|pg||
nt|po-s: two shades...|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, as a practical matter 6@h may have been better still - although if 4@d really were a splinter, you could expect a spade lead a lot of the time|pg||
nt|po-s: yes, but it might well have been RKCB|pg||
nt|bucheister: Actually standard methods should get you close to 6H|pg||
nt|po-s: perhaps not "well" but who knows|pg||
nt|dburn: yes, but they would not get you very close to 6@h by West|pg||
nt|bucheister: Especially if you play minisplinters|pg||
nt|bucheister: So true|pg||
nt|bucheister: Feels like we are having a biological break|pg||
nt|poohbear: meck smoke break|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Now playing Bd 37 in 4@H W ... can not enter play-by-play|pg||
nt|poohbear: they are replaying the board|pg||
nt|othered1: May a pleyer who smokes demand the time to go smoke, or might it count against any time limits on play?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from OR auction, looks like their EW also playing a Big Club [yes, or Polish Club]|pg||
nt|poohbear: board 37|pg||
nt|ahollan1: time limits?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but note that some of the fastest players do partake of the tobacco -- Meckstroth & Balicki-Zmudzinski comme to mind immediately|pg||
pc|hA|nt|gambit: what?|pg||

pc|h2|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|debrose: That last one was a potential swing deal, if either N-S had been playing a system where they'd open 1@C allowing East to get in a 1@S overcall for the lead|pg||

nt|ady: 980 was flat on hand 24|pg||
nt|hedyg: as expected|pg||
nt|lml: on the lie of the cards you make a lot of hearts or spades east west|pg||
nt|po-s: so now PP1D to East?|pg||
nt|ady: this should finish in 4@H e/w|pg||
nt|po-s: Easy 4H for those of us who can see all cards|pg||
nt|hedyg: slowly...|pg||
nt|panja: there is just not enough space after 2@C opening to manage things gracefully|pg||
nt|lml: and in fact they did win 5 imps on the previous board|pg||
nt|lml: since they did get to game in the CR|pg||
nt|petergill: On Board 57, the play at the other table of 3Nt by South is similar to here, top @h lead, club ducked (to minimise defensive signalling), spade to ace, club ducked, spade to queen|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|petergill: In last year's Spingold, Cayne lost in the Round of 64 to the team seeded 62 in unusual circumstances, and this time Team 63 are giving the same Cayne team a tough match|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i just think 5@H is going to gain nothing -- does it ask for @H, ask for @S, ask Exclusion ???   takes too much space to be so non-descript|pg||
mb|2H|nt|po-s: would everybody bid 2H now?|pg||
nt|hedyg: it might end here|pg||
nt|lml: I would want to bid something|pg||
nt|po-s: gambling that partner has his values (some) outside hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|roswolf: now this could be a fascinating 3nt|pg||
nt|lml: so did he|pg||
nt|ady: now easy|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@H is an overbid, even for a passed hand|pg||
nt|lml: and there was no other sensible bid so you are forced into it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: sure there is, south could wait or positive with 2d|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-16|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|po-s: No Linda , tiy must be very catious - partner is whitr|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@H is a possible contract|pg||
nt|petergill: which would almost certainly fail as the cards lie|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@S cue, 1st or 2nd round control|pg||
nt|kareno: Too many spaces between the aces for slam I think.|pg||
nt|kareno: If they get to slam they likely won't make it either - spade suit plays badly.|pg||
nt|petergill: If hearts are 2-2, or on an unbid-suit spade lead (not on this layout), slam might well make|pg||
mb|4C|nt|lml: yes it is but you think you have too much to pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but holding @CAK - when is south supposed to bid slam?|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@C puppet?|pg||
mb|d|nt|hedyg: what is the redeeming value of the hand? the 4 small @ds?|pg||
nt|lml: sad when you actually have to work hard and play go bridge to stay in the vanderbilt|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: am i the only one surprised to see Meck 1N with 4@S & 5@H?|pg||
nt|kareno: I absolutely agree!! The heart suit is NOT good enough to use all that space showing it.|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: NS use Smith Echo|pg||
nt|xenya: this may be a killer?|pg||
nt|lml: I agree 2@H is an overbid|pg||
nt|gambit: no easy matches here |pg||
nt|lml: not at this point|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: It used to be a cakewalk! |pg||
mb|p|pc|cQ|nt|roswolf: yup going for the weak spot|pg||
nt|lml: I know just what he was thinking though|pg||
nt|petergill: aces, promising side suit, looks good for slam, but xxx trumps looks bad - 3NT might have been serious slam try over 3@S. 4@C is cue, 1st or 2nd round control|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|po-s: Me, I would bid 2H, but my partners may have a good hand even white|pg||
nt|lml: partner can have a wide range of hands and I hate to pass |pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|daman: nailing them in the cusp|pg||
nt|petergill: Interesting that L-V prefer to respond 2@D, not 1@H, on the weak North hand|pg||
pc|h4|nt|roswolf: nice play|pg||
nt|finch: More perhaps that a spade lead was very unappealing from such a holding with them well stopped on his right|pg||
nt|finch: Dummy will have at most two hearts (no 3@H bid over 2NT)|pg||
nt|daman: Charlie has been through a lot of battles    I'm sure his @H Q was well thought out|pg||
nt|xenya: S's spade holding is too unattractive to lead from|pg||
nt|roswolf: now needs to play a heart i think|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|daman: gag|pg||
nt|roswolf: not good enough i fear|pg||
nt|daman: If he led a @H   he shd continue|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed george|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lml: yes thats it|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|hK|nt|daman: Dano could have played 10@H|pg||
pc|h9|nt|roswolf: yes would have assisted south|pg||
nt|daman: Charlie had to have led from QJ9|pg||
nt|lml: exactly|pg||
nt|hedyg: "maybe my pd has 16 hcps with @h fit and a singleton @D so i better bid"?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lml: or he has 16 points and really good spades and your hearts are a help (and your spades)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i've seen other 5422 but don't recall seeing both majors|pg||
nt|bucheister: No they tend to open any balanced hand with 1NT|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes I agree Martin... what was the need to give a positive with a bad @H suit and singleton @DK|pg||
nt|kareno: I learned long ago not to get in the way of partner's prepared auction without a VERY GOOD REASON and KTxxx of hearts is not good enough.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: presumably trying to block opponents bidding spades|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|xenya: perhpas that's what S thought when he switched|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|daman: playing Foster    you play your 2nd highest when you cannot beat dummy     |pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|h2|nt|hedyg: and if he doesnt have any of those?|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|lml: then he bids 2@S|pg||
nt|lml: or even passes|pg||
nt|petergill: Perhaps East, who can see that bad breaks will trouble a close 6@H, might not dbl 4@C, since the dbl discourages NS from bidding too high. |pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c9|nt|kareno: I agree on that point, Peter, absolutely.|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|panja: here again, 2@H rebid to limit the hand...|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|panja: What is 3@D rebid though? does anyone know?|pg||
nt|debrose: On a club lead, declarer can't make 6@H even with a ruffing finesse in diamonds because West will be able to overruff before declarer can get to dummy to throw his club |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Nothing has been alerted, and they're very clear about their alerts|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|debrose: clearly South thinks 3@D is conventional, so if North didn't alert, seems like a misunderstanding|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|panja: it seems like some misunderstanding|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: could be another disaster team poland :(|pg||
nt|debrose: those looking for swing boards will get one now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Fred asked about the auction and something (probably 3@d) showed 6 hearts. 4NT was Keycard and 5@h showed 2|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|debrose: Gittleman will consider his lead some, but will eventually lead a club|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||
nt|panja: right, S had to show his 6-cards sometime, 2@H merely  showed lower end of the range opening|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: K asks about the club Q lead "natural" and then clarifies "not Rusinow?" "no"|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pc|h5|nt|debrose: Gitelman, that is.  you'd think I might know that by now.  Among other things, I've played against Fred for about 20 years now|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|panja: E more likely to hold the @DK now..empty spaces, more of them with him|pg||
nt|debrose: N-S lead Rusinow at the 5 level or higher they told me|pg||
nt|debrose: So although we can see that nothing declarer does will work, he has a lot to think about|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: K has put his cards on the table and also his head (arms crossed, head in them) and is thinking about this|pg||
nt|panja: can this not make from here with @D and @S guess?|pg||
nt|debrose: Moss will certainly cover the !Q, as he knows partner has the @HQ from the bidding.  Declarer denied it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Now his head is up and he's looking at the dummy |pg||
nt|panja: right...@DK cover needed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Now ready|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Even if diamonds could provide two quick tricks, declarer would still have a spade problem|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|debrose: Again, the diamond ruffing finesse does not work, as West will get to overruff before declaerer can pitch club|pg||

nt|petergill: If the defence had kept another heart and switched to a low heart not @HQ, then unblocked @CK under the ace, 3NT might have failed|pg||
nt|lml: with 9 top tricks we move along ...|pg||
nt|petergill: One of my best friends says that experts make way too many lead-directing doubles which help the opponents judge how high to bid|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: great observation Peter|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Sory, I miscounted the tricks|pg||
mb|1N|nt|hedyg: opposite a ph pd he could have AKJxx in @s and out?|pg||
nt|lml: even if he raises to 3@H you have a decent chance|pg||
nt|lml: then he bids 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: interesting bid by north here|pg||
nt|ady: 11 tricks in either major     1@H?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now 1@H is a bid i could predict|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: east will surely go as high as 5@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I do that some times when watching... funny its easier to do it watching than playing|pg||
nt|kareno: That is likely to end the auction|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|nt|finch: Board 8, in the other room they haven't managed to get to 4@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would pass on a good day|pg||
nt|daman: Charlie will pass|pg||
nt|kareno: Diamond lead needed to defeat 6@h here.|pg||
nt|rodal f: So u're 26 Karen? I'm 17:)++|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: Rod's double showing Trap Pass of 1@S??|pg||
nt|dburn: that plus some suitability for defending against diamonds|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hedyg: forcing pass by S?|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, 26 and then some :)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: automagic trump lead|pg||
nt|bucheister: 64 hands|pg||
nt|panja: @S lead might lead to only 11 tricks...seems 12 should be there...but might not be as easy|pg||
nt|rodal f: My first bidat S wouldhave been 3@S = renons splinter|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: a spec points out taht south was a passed hand ... then @H positive is probaly the right bid over 2@C|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@S = as previously discussed - if you are an Italian and have a 5 card major which you can overcall at the one level, hey presto|pg||
nt|fabsayc: as usual|pg||
nt|lml: it was the 7 that did it|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ady: great result for e/w  -100|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
pc|cK|nt|daman: Alphonse/Gaston|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|lml: I am guessing South agreeds with you Hedy|pg||

nt|daman: trump switch |pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ady: may now be an end play for down 1|pg||
nt|po-s: but wouldn´t argue strongly - an overcall and an inviting sound by me, does that force us?|pg||
nt|ady: but more likely will try to make  playing on diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: no but then when partner bids game vul ... yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: no PO, but pd bid 4@H|pg||
nt|petergill: and loses oppsite aq|pg||
pc|d4|nt|finch: Helgemo clearly noticing the vulnerability again - that might be a 1NT NV, but definitely not vul|pg||
nt|daman: @D &   they play 2/4  leads|pg||

pc|c5|nt|roswolf: remember the vikings - geir rarely respects vul|pg||

pc|s3|nt|dburn: declarer can make this, but he may well not get the hearts right|pg||
nt|gambit: lucky 7?|pg||
nt|petergill: Good point Linda - much easier when commentating, as it is so much easier to be distracted when commentating (compared to playing) by reading other comments etc|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|fabsayc: if 2c is natural trump lead is too passive|pg||

nt|rodal f: Agree Martin. The rule for thrump lead is....|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|s9|pg||
nt|petergill: If parner has @H headed by Q10, declarer might have thought longer about putting the jack in from dummy, so K is better than 9 perhaps|pg||

nt|petergill: No lead directing double ---> 6@H -1 on Bd 59 |pg||
mb|3N|nt|ady: west a little conservative    might have doubled 1st round |pg||

mb|p|nt|daman: on Board 9 in the OR    NS are in 2@S  on the 6-0   lol|pg||
nt|rodal f: Trump at a partscore often use to be right, at a game u often loose tempo.|pg||
nt|panja: this might bet interesting|pg||

nt|panja: E cannot unblock @C as S has @CT..|pg||

mb|p|nt|kareno: But can that be the right play?  If diamonds are coming, then spades aren't needed.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: that 8 lead should warm him... so may not unblock|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: this has some chance also, I guess|pg||
nt|bucheister: Courtesy of Bob "Tiger" Morris of Dayton OH; when men were men|pg||
nt|kareno: Well yes, ten of clubs and club ruff in dummy.|pg||
nt|bucheister: I thought NS played precision|pg||
nt|kareno: That raise is pretty alarming though.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope - but their teammates in Open Room are playing Big Club with Weak NT|pg||
nt|dburn: as long as declarer rejects the Principle of Restricted Choice in favour of the notion that East might have led a singleton club if he had one|pg||
nt|poohbear: Hamman played for 8x|pg||
nt|kareno: Correct.|pg||
nt|dburn: still, I guess that playing for East to have the doubleton eight is a much better shot|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: but no double no trouble:)|pg||
nt|kareno: 6@h is really flying close to the sun.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|fabsayc: versace preparing for hearts offside|pg||
nt|petergill: so the only two swings have in some way related to East at this table bidding more clubbily than his counterpart|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lml: after you make that lead you spend a while trying not to think about whether that let the contract through|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Laughter at T 1|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, as opposed to specifically doubleton QJ|pg||

pc|s7|nt|panja: W showed 4@H 5@S with his 3@H bid...this way, Nt opener becomes declarer even in a Major suit contract|pg||
nt|debrose: Smolen is an almost universally used convention, for the reason panja explained.  |pg||

nt|panja: a kib asks why 3@s, why not 4@S, and the answer is E does not W's strength, 3@S allows a slam exploration should W have a strong hand..|pg||
nt|debrose: Then one would jump in the 5-card suit over 2@D to show a game forcing hand.  Smolen simply reverses the 3@H and 3@S bids|pg||
pc|h6|nt|debrose: As is so often correct, declarer attacks his side suit before drawing trump|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 17+ bal [but not 19-20 BAL]|pg||
nt|fabsayc: had three trump winners if he exits a spade, assuming play correct to that point|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|po-s: I am surprised he bid only 3C over patner´s 2NT|pg||
nt|lml: a number east-west on the 3@C hand|pg||
nt|petergill: Repeating, Scores at half-time in each match are at http://www.acbl.org/nabc/brackets/2010/01/vanderbilt/|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: at the OR|pg||
nt|petergill: Regarding two of Poland's top five pairs being seeded 30th - about 24 of the 26 top seeds are a client hiring a team, only about 14 of the other 62 teams have a client in them  |pg||
mb|1S|nt|hedyg: agree PO, 3NT looked automatic|pg||
nt|panja: that was GIB conclusion|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: the vulnerable west made an awful overcall of 1NT|pg||
nt|ady: decent 6 spades here|pg||
nt|lml: North should bid again|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: Rod's PASS=0-5 or trap pass  --  but operator already entered that |pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: okay its tough|pg||
nt|lml: I am looking at the hands |pg||
mb|2C|nt|xenya: the 3@D bid made it easier for NS to reach 4@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: de falco leaps ahead|pg||
nt|finch: This is another hand that may not be as routine as you think. Where is declarer going to get his 10th trick if the @SA is wrong?|pg||
nt|daman: 14 more to DeFalco after board 9|pg||
nt|finch: Suppose the pointy aces are swtiched|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit sad. A coffeboard came.|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: he was already ahead|pg||
mb|2N|nt|dburn: although I suppose 3NT will make, what with that club position|pg||
nt|poohbear: same reason 4D makes|pg||
nt|kareno: No guts no glory.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: amazing -- @C position makes this successful game try|pg||
nt|bucheister: pretty lucky but as I said earlier they make their luck|pg||
nt|poohbear: I wonder how Meck copes with a 3@h bid by South|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or is there another option besides @CQ singleton or doubleton|pg||
nt|kareno: Overtrick!  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=8-11 HCP, 0-4@S  says nothing about @H|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C strong, Precision style|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: isn't it better to set up the east hand ?|pg||
nt|rodal f: They have given us many nice boards by there active bidding. |pg||
nt|petergill: Team 38, a very strong mainly-Bulgarian team is winning 92 -33 against Meltzer. |pg||
mb|3N|nt|me argent: me 2 barry|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: does anybody else think north might have moved?|pg||
nt|kareno: Sort of the wrong vulnerability for that bid by south.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: as north my ho;d long @H|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hold|pg||
nt|lml: the Europeans are often under seeded|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: no real option but to play for it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: http://usbf.org/   for 3/4 scores|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT is easy. How does 6@D play - it looks very close. |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|kareno: This doesn't look like a swing hand either.|pg||
nt|petergill: In Standard, does everyone open 1@S as South, or would some of you open 1@C?|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||
nt|petergill: After 1@S in Standard 3NT looks inevitable, but after 1@C, 6@D is not impossible to reach|pg||
pc|c3|nt|finch: unfortunately he is still short of 10 tricks|pg||
nt|daman: Tiger Woods has announced he will return to golf at the Masters in April|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes indeed|pg||
nt|po-s: how 10 tricks?|pg||
nt|finch: 5 trumps, two clubs, one diamond and one spade is only 9 tricks|pg||
nt|finch: he needed either to set clubs up or to make enough tricks by ruffing|pg||
nt|finch: if he tries to make 6 trump tricks he can never make a diamond trick, it's still not enough tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: but now he won't get a @S trick if E pitches the duece|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|hedyg: bidding 1NT with fit and an opening hand is not what forcing 1NT is about imo|pg||
nt|poohbear: Didnt sto pZia|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||
nt|finch: yes, now he is two off (as everyone with GIB already knows)|pg||
nt|kareno: I open 1@c|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lml: yes that started things off on the wrong foot|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hedyg: he should have moved over 1@s, not over 4|pg||
pc|h8|nt|finch: but when he playing to ruff clubs, he needed them to break|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: 3@H should be EASIER versus the big club auction|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|nt|sunsamvar: what is the logic for opening 1@C with 5-5 in the black suit?|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|poohbear: i agree|pg||
nt|kareno: Ease of rebids.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lml: I agree completely|pg||
nt|kareno: Zia too believes no guts no glory :)|pg||
nt|kareno: I play that a high reverse shows substantial extra values.|pg||
mc|11|nt|ahollan1: hand worth "Hi Reverse" in my tattered book|pg||
nt|kareno: So I bid clubs, spades, spades.  In this case I would jump rebid spades - it's a very good hand.|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Fred asks about the auction - everything was natural and 2@s promised 18+ HCP and 5+ @ss|pg||

pc|h9|pc|h2|pc|s6|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed, out of the running unless an explosion last 2 boards|pg||
nt|debrose: However, Team Poland had a lead going into the set, and both of the big swing boards could have been duplicated at the other table from their point of view|pg||
nt|debrose: So the players will still be fighting for every trick.  Nobody wants to rush the last couple of boards and then find they've lost by an IMP or two|pg||
nt|panja: would they sense enough to try to swign on next two?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Brad just pointed out to declarer that they only have 21 minutes for this board and the next two - he made a point of saying he knew it wasn't any one player's fault, just that ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: they didn't have much time. So he can't be too sure his team is ahead, wants to get all the boards played|pg||

nt|bucheister: Too strong a word; OK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C =    no fear :)|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|daman: 5NT is very perilous     cannot count 13 tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah science|pg||
nt|lml: I think when you bid 5@H you are saying that you have hearts and spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: it is easy for us, but what about SJ?|pg||

mb|1H!|mb|p|nt|roswolf: true good point p-o|pg||
nt|po-s: now not many heart ruffs likely in East´s hand|pg||
nt|lml: and if partner has the minors controlled then he should bid it|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@D=4+@H   1@H=2/3@H non-force|pg||
mb|3C|nt|roswolf: D0P1 here, so 1 ace|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=LR, 4+@S  [rare 3@S]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S = zero game interest|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: RM Precision uses  1@H/@S-3@C as game forcing raise|pg||
nt|bucheister: 3S = probably going down|pg||
mb|4H|nt|kareno: Should be a push.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: belay that -- 2N=LR+   |pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: I am a simple soul, when partner jumps to 4S over my 1NT I assume HE (she?) has the spades|pg||
nt|hedyg: what did you say re paralyse PO?|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: pass was DOPI|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: hmm well they tried but no cigar|pg||
nt|daman: 5NT night have asked for specific Kings|pg||
nt|poohbear: correct al|pg||
nt|petergill: People who play the transfer responses to 1@C tend to open virtually all 11 counts in my experience|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 3@C showed 5-5 in the red suits|pg||
pc|d4|nt|po-s: of course he wasn´t going to bid it|pg||
nt|finch: he suspects grand is on the club finesse at best, which is reasonably likely to be wrong|pg||
nt|po-s: but tes, 5NT would have solved the CK problem|pg||
nt|kareno: And presumably forcing|pg||
nt|petergill: Ten tricks if NS cash their spades when they win @HA|pg||
nt|kareno: Still no sign of a swing to Poland|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will @D lead translate to trying ruffing finesse in @C?|pg||
nt|petergill: 3rd and 5th, perhaqps declarer is trying to decide if @D are 5-1 (or @H 4-1) in which case going for early spade discards on clubs could be worthwhile|pg||
nt|petergill: A club finesse would seal victory for Diamond's team|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|daman: if partner had bid 5@C  (@CK)    7 was easy|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: which minor suit will he go for ?|pg||

nt|kareno: Bergen raise I suppose.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: thanks to our outstanding operator in Reno ,Richard Schiveley !to my excellent fellow commentators PO Sundelin, Linda Lee, David Edwin and John Buchheister for donating their time ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: and expertise to guide us through these boards.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: why am i missing out the vowels|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=12+ HCP, 5+@C|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes (do I risk being sacked as a commentator?), a polished gem of a match played by the Diamond team|pg||
nt|kareno: n/s will make as many of a black suit as they like.|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|rodal f: Last board for this day. More to come tomorrow: http://www.acbl.org/nabc/index.php?a=2010&b=Spring&c=daily_bulletins|pg||
nt|lml: this also wont take long|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|kareno: Ouch, Peter!|pg||
nt|petergill: The vulnerability scared EW from disturbing the Strong Club auction|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT on Bd 62 at other table, so Diamond is safely through to tomorrow|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: should get to 6@C here|pg||
nt|petergill: A good hand for using Voidwood? |pg||
nt|gowdy: if 3 @S  then 4 D  then perhaps more|pg||
nt|petergill: or Exclusion RKCB or whatever you call it|pg||
nt|gowdy: not with jxxx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: better for Hampson to ask in @C [he has the @D control]|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C Strong Club, 2@C looks likke a positive with clubs, then 3@C shows 6+ clubs|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but he cannot know of North's @H void and solid @Ss|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C = 12+ HCP & 5+@C|pg||
nt|gowdy: 4 @C then 4 @D  the 5 @H|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i am with Peter on the Exclusion RKCB |pg||
nt|ahollan1: for some -- after 4@C  4@D would be minorwood [RKC @C]|pg||
nt|petergill: 7@S is best opposite xx, Ax, AKx, Axxxxx, so perhaps 3@S now? |pg||
nt|gowdy: before or after the @D Q ?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|hedyg: Our appreciation to the ACBL for ensuring that this prestigious event is brought to BBO vugraph. Jeff Johnston and Jan Martel (there she is again) have been instrumental in setting ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: up a magnificent show|pg||
nt|po-s: are the standings in different matches a secret as usual in US Nationals?|pg||
nt|hedyg: special thanks to our specs for joining and for your kind and helpful comments,we hope you enjoyed the show|pg||
nt|panja: note that @SK is wasted opposite @S stiff...|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: even more so today :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: we will be back in 2 and half hours|pg||
nt|kareno: How are you going to collect a penalty if north takes out the double?|pg||
nt|petergill: 5@D would have been doubled by Versace for 500|pg||
nt|gambit: as my partner Zia used to say to me - claim before you make a mistake |pg||
mb|4D|nt|kareno: Yes, it is.|pg||
nt|gowdy: now 4 @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: dont think they play pen doubles over 1nt karen|pg||
nt|bucheister: seems like a solid pass; even have a five card suit to lead|pg||
nt|kareno: Ahh .. not a penalty double.  Takeout I guess.  I'd be passing anyway.|pg||
nt|gowdy: now 5 @H|pg||
mb|5H|nt|po-s: perhaps 5NT hasn´t reache Norway - OR Helness didn´t want to hear 7H|pg||
nt|roswolf: competent sequence|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: EW cold 4 1nt on the expected @H lead|pg||
nt|bucheister: Maybe they are playing double as a one suiter|pg||
nt|me argent: NS sorry|pg||
nt|me argent: EW double sorry|pg||
nt|petergill: Geoff Hampson might have bid 2NT over 2@S, but with a probable slam-going hand, he thought it more important to show his sixth club|pg||
mb|6C|nt|petergill: 4@D cue|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how does this help find @CQ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: good bidding.. now to sign off in 6 when @Cq is missing|pg||
nt|gowdy: 63  guess it|pg||
nt|petergill: 5@H Exclusion Key Card, excluding the heart suit in the responses|pg||
nt|gowdy: or claim|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but isn't 5@H EKC for @S???|pg||
nt|kareno: Your namesake believes that when they are 6-3, the Qxx is over the three, John |pg||
nt|kareno: So he would make seven anyway :)|pg||
nt|gowdy: only at deat hands|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@C = two|pg||
mb|7S|nt|po-s: does the operator know abt the other matches?|pg||
nt|panja: else 4@H would have been a cakewalk..the bidding does not uncover it as it has gone too fast for that..|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: the van Prooljen team didnt play badly at all at this table but they will have some work in the last quarter to win|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: A little excitement!|pg||
nt|kareno: Ace of hearts ends the hand early.|pg||
nt|gowdy: great bidding |pg||
pc|s2|nt|hedyg: probably not|pg||
nt|kareno: Thanks to our excellent Operator!!|pg||
nt|kareno: You think... great?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @CQ lead speed up play too|pg||
nt|petergill: Spades were agreed, so he didn't know about @CQ. |pg||
nt|kareno: Standard lead against a grand slam|pg||
nt|gowdy: but he knew 6 3 fit  |pg||
pc|s4|nt|lml: thanks everyone|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sunsamvar: precision lead too :)|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hedyg: Jan said she would try to find out but dont know if she did|pg||
nt|ady: 9@C  dropping helps|pg||
nt|lml: well ALL of the imps so far have gone to Fleisher|pg||
nt|lml: 31 to zip|pg||
nt|ady: think should have played low in west hand on the heart|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lest we forget -- kudos to a great job from our operator -- sorry, i never got his/her name|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lml: a schneider as they say in gin rummy|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|lml: thanks and good night|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: On B28 S said he nthought his pass was forcing.|pg||
nt|bucheister: thank you all see you in a little while|pg||
nt|kareno: And to the commentators :)  And the specs for keeping us on our toes.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lml: thanks to everybdy and see you the next quarter when I will be propping my eyes open |pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|petergill: The lack of heart intervention  over the Strong Club, missing 11 hearts, suggests that clubs are more likely to be 2-2|pg||
nt|gowdy: 6 a nd 6 plus 1 = grand !|pg||
pc|sK|nt|panja: thx Karen, kibs, BBO, all|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h7|nt|bucheister: Yes and thank you Al for helping us out|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kareno: And of course to ACBL for allowing us into their great tournaments.  To Jan Martel for organizing the vugraph too.  And of course to BBO for the marvelous platform for watching ...|pg||
nt|kareno: great bridge week after week after week!|pg||
pc|s9|nt|daman: 10 more to Zimmerman on Board 11|pg||
nt|petergill: A nearly perfect 16 boards from the Diamond team. |pg||
pc|d8|nt|gowdy: may think  @C are more likey with w |pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually @DAK first adds squeeze to potential lines -- not just guess @C|pg||
nt|petergill: spsde break might suggest long clubs with West, so some danger here|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|nt|bucheister: Maybe the operator will keep the room open for scores update?  |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: His/her name is Richard Schiveley ... thanks!  :)|pg||
nt|bucheister: good night all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I KNOW Richard!!|pg||
nt|bucheister: Thank you Richard; you did a great job|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: You're too kind.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: next set scheduled in about 30 minutes, but once Jan Martel finds a team - it can start whenever they are ready|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Yes ... hello Al|pg||
pc|cA|nt|daman: making 3NT|pg||
nt|gambit: V-L, very tough, not counting Seamon at the other table..... perhaps a little "swinging" in the last quarter |pg||
nt|fabsayc: what is interesting here is how Lauria-Versace win with what in effect is a very natural and simple system|pg||
nt|gambit: tell that to Murray - Kehela|pg||
nt|lml: back in about 45 minutes|pg||
nt|gambit: thx all|pg||
nt|lml: definitely going to need lots of black coffee but it will be worth it|pg||
nt|petergill: Long story: In last year's Spingold, Cayne and Team 62 were almost tied at halftime. Midway through the 3rd quarter, hotel staff came to the table and told Cayne's opponent that he ...|pg||
nt|petergill: must take a phone call. "No way," he replied. "But you will be in contempt of court if you don't  take the call." So Cayne's opponents asked Cayne's kibitzer if he could play ...|pg||
nt|petergill: bridge. Yes. Cayne has no objection to the kibitzer (who had perhaps 10 masterpoints) filling in for several boards....   |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Word of explanation:  Sometimes the play at this table goes very fast, and one player doesn't show his cards very well, so I got behind once or twice....|pg||
nt|fabsayc: thanks all, i suspect we will be switching match for 4th segment|pg||
nt|petergill: Up by about 30 imps with 16 boards to go, Cayne would normally sit out his own partnership for the last segment, but against a team who has the kibitzer fill in, he decided to play ...|pg||
nt|petergill: the last 16 boards of last year's Spingold, and Cayne's team lost the match by about 2 imps. So this time you can expect the Italian and Polish pairs to play the last 16 boards of ...|pg||
nt|petergill: this match. |pg||
nt|petergill: This really happened. The story has not been told in writing before, anywhere.|pg||
nt|petergill: Bye everyone. See you in 35 minutes. |pg||
nt|petergill: In reply to a spec's question: Team 38, who so far v Meltzer are producing one of the big upsets of this round, is Trendafilov - Karainov who were near the top of the datums in the ...|pg||
nt|petergill: 2009 Bermuda Bowl, Vlad Isporski - Val Kovachev who narrowly missed out on making last year's Bulgarian Open Team, and Walter Johnson - Dennis Dawson. |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|daman: ciao everyone|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Comparison break|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|nt|kareno: It's 52-48 for the break here.|pg||
nt|petergill: No overcall of Strong Club with ten red cards - will silence in the bidding get a reward?|pg||
nt|gowdy: no @H bid and a stiiff C  na|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh my has been called|pg||
mc|12|nt|poohbear: theyll be happy that they cant lose the match|pg||
nt|kareno: Still thirty-one IMPs before this hand.|pg||
nt|petergill: Diamond happy to be 31 imps ahead with only this board to be scored. |pg||
nt|kareno: Are all the other comparisons in?|pg||
nt|poohbear: prob checking BBO computer |pg||
nt|ahollan1: karen -- how would Barry Crane react to 7@S -50 from teammates??|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, one day I'll tell you Allison's Law on Grand Slam bidding :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Has been a pleasure watching this high quality performance from Diamond|pg||
nt|kareno: Barry Crane never lasted three rounds of a Vanderbilt :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Karen - is it "don't bid 7 unless you can count 14 tricks." ???|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one of kings of 20s/30s  P Hal Sims is said to have gone into tantrums if teammates bid grand -- even if it made!!|pg||
nt|kareno: No, Peter, it's not.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 15 tricks??|pg||
nt|kareno: I promise to tell another day.  Tired tonight and I've still got a report to write.|pg||
nt|petergill: Someone once worked out that in Australia's first ten years of international open bridge, if they had bid no grand slams at all, they would have been better off in imps. |pg||
nt|kareno: Have we got a definitive final score?|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Brad asks about auction - 3@s showed a good suit; 5NT showed 2 keycards, the trump Q & 1 King|pg||
