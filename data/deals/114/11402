mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|sybarra: Hi Rashed |pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @S for e/w |pg||
nt|sybarra: most likely |pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|rnmalik: 5@D would not be bad contract for NS|pg||
nt|sybarra: and how many @D's does bid now to get there?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|cuttysark: The alert of 2@S seems a little strange|pg||
nt|vugraphzyc: 2@S 7+ 11- thats why the alert|pg||
nt|sybarra: if playing 2/1,  no need to go jumping around |pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @C was already the game force |pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|sybarra: not sure I like the 2 @S bid,   for me it promises 4 @S |pg||
nt|sybarra: its style,  but I dont raise with 3 spades |pg||
nt|sybarra: Iverson had a 27-0 set on the last set |pg||
nt|rnmalik: true not me either. I would rather bid 3@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: but they may not be playing 2/1, and hopefully this is forcing?  |pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|cuttysark: Some difficulty in reaching dummy for the club finesse|pg||
nt|sybarra: I can bid 1 nt with N hand over 1 sp |pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|cuttysark: (Thank you for the information, Thorvald)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: chased them into better spot |pg||
nt|rnmalik: with 5@D prefer 2 or 3 @Ds|pg||
nt|sybarra: my rebid of a minor suggests a 6 card suit |pg||
nt|sybarra: so doubt I would rebid that suit |pg||
nt|sybarra: but |pg||
nt|rnmalik: The declarer has to play the K@S to make the hand-DBL by W of 4@S showed shortness|pg||
nt|sybarra: wtih the 2 hts bid in the middle,  (which I was not seeing)  I rebid 3 @D |pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|rnmalik: interesting hand to play|pg||

nt|sybarra: a bit unlucky.....spade break bad, and off, and k of clubs off |pg||
nt|sybarra: well if it was "unserious"  would the rebid be 4 @S? |pg||
nt|vugraphzyc: 4@s = no interest in slam|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure E should be interested really....but then really just needs good spade coveer cards by pard |pg||
nt|sybarra: not so out of the question given the bidding |pg||

nt|granguru: who is defending here?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyc: but very few tricks in the 5@C contract|pg||

nt|daman: unless he is certain @S shows a a void|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure what N can do but bid 5 @H |pg||
nt|daman: 6@H by North would be very presumptuous|pg||
mb|5N|nt|cuttysark: He should win ace and play a low diamond?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzyc: Killing lead|pg||

nt|daman: now there's a bid that wouldn't be on everybody's radar|pg||
nt|sybarra: not even sure what it means |pg||
mb|6C!|nt|cuttysark: Moller will wait a long time before partner leads a spade through|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: Or a @H finesse to throw the @S|pg||
mb|6H|nt|dburn: ...it's going to be hard for the defence to work out just how good it is|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: they are about to put another 11 IMPs in their pockets|pg||
nt|sybarra: "houston we are arrived"  (lets not talk about the journey) |pg||

pc|s9|nt|dburn: still, I guess North might shift to a diamond anyway|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Aha - distributional information! Now heart finesse, take pitch, diamond up |pg||
pc|h3|nt|haans: the sputnik double tends to tell = 20-20 between us|pg||

nt|sybarra: as spec points out, ONLY CHANCE J109@c|pg||
nt|dburn: well, or a heart-club squeeze|pg||
nt|rnmalik: we know it is not there|pg||
nt|dburn: which would work if South had @hQ and any four clubs|pg||
nt|rnmalik: the key cards in different hands. Lets convince E:)|pg||
nt|dburn: I guess East is weighing up the chance of the squeeze against the chance that North has @hQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: or we are losing connection |pg||
nt|vugraphzyc: ur not|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure, but South's lead might have been from 42 doubleton - I don't know if the North-South pair lead low from two small|pg||
