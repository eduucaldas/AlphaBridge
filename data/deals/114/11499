pc|c9|pc|d9|nt|hedyg: then*|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer is squeezing his hand too|pg||
nt|chmitty: but of he drops a @h he could still have 5 to start with|pg||
nt|hedyg: true|pg||
nt|chmitty: but East may think that with only 3 @h West would have dropped the last one|pg||
nt|roswolf: that is a chimera i think|pg||
nt|hedyg: 7@H back from Damiani would have been clearer|pg||
nt|chmitty: In these situations at the table, you think to so many things|pg||
nt|chmitty: and never know if you forgot one|pg||
