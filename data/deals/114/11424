nt|andyv:  @s partial here|pg||
nt|sharynr: some aggressive pairs might bid 1S-2S-4S|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think W will slow S down|pg||
nt|sharynr: what can he bid if south opens 1@S though?|pg||
nt|andyv:  1N|pg||
nt|sharynr: maybe East will preempt|pg||
nt|xenya: oh i'm wrong -- sorry|pg||
nt|mdgraham: first glance would seem to indicate a heart slam EW|pg||
nt|mdgraham: secind glance confirms it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there are people who might deem that South hand a weak 2@S opener  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: or a "Garbage Multi" 2@d, which is getting popular in England|pg||
nt|mdgraham: don't think so|pg||
nt|vugraphzxh: sorry, mistake|pg||
nt|xenya: lol Mike|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Pity West isn't called Darth|pg||
nt|mareczek: now are leaders|pg||
nt|mareczek: 6.400|pg||
nt|mareczek: 64.00%|pg||
nt|mareczek: Kwiecien Jagniewski second 63.90|pg||
nt|xenya: getting the @Ds blocked was a big mistake|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I can't believe a player like Martens would discard a club there - very strange|pg||
mb|2C!|an|prec|mb|d|nt|mdgraham: I don't think that was passed out, unless EW were playing a forcing pass system and East thought his fourth-in-hand pass was forcing  |pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|andyv:  now you may see your sequence;)|pg||
nt|sharynr: 1nt is pushing it, especially when most of his high cards are in opps suit|pg||
nt|xenya: no!|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|mareczek: responsive double showing 4@s (I suppose)|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@C natural, limited|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ritong: one way or another they will discover the @c lack|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mareczek: this can drive them to the game|pg||
nt|granguru: then not a traditional responsive|pg||
nt|granguru: I would better believe it is a transfer|pg||
nt|mareczek: it is an old fashioned responsive double|pg||
nt|granguru: old fashioned promess 4-4 in minors...|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  if you play 15-18 NT overcalls, I don't think 1N is overboard|pg||
nt|andyv:  and if you make bad leads, you need to bid as much as possible|pg||
nt|vugraphzxh: yes, he really discarded a club, no mistake|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I have a possible solution - (if I have the right NS CC) - Q lead shows QJ10, denies K, so maybe Norht thought East had @CK |pg||
pc|cA|nt|xenya: thanks Agne|pg||
pc|c2|nt|xenya: S should go up now -- i think he will|pg||
nt|xenya: N rather|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, the danger is obvious|pg||
nt|xenya: if E was clever enough to lead from the K, let him reap the reward|pg||
nt|ritong: and he does need two @d tricks, but this is matchpoints|pg||
pc|c7|nt|granguru: with 4 spades he just bids it|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|granguru: with no major and one minor bids the minor|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s8|nt|mareczek: I say about really old fashioned... from 60-ties and early 70-ties|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|mdgraham: K would show KQ vs. NT|pg||
pc|sT|nt|xenya: not easy for E to find a @C swithc...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: thanks to specs for suggestion, you were right|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sharynr: @H are nicely positioned for declarer, unfortunately not trumps|pg||
pc|s6|nt|xenya: but maybe he will|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|h4|nt|granguru: as analyzed in Mike lawrence The Complete Book on Overcalls|pg||
nt|mareczek: 3@h undoubled can be quite sensible result|pg||
pc|hK|nt|granguru: edited in 1979|pg||
nt|mareczek: as in spades 8 tricks are easy|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ritong: on the other hand, declarer does not look worried about trumps or ruffing @hs|pg||
nt|xenya: and he did -- anything else might be even more dangerous|pg||
pc|c8|nt|xenya: from his perspective|pg||
nt|ritong: and he denied @c control in a slammish auction|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sharynr: i cant imagine my partner holding the !K if declarer has a 4@S bid|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sQ|nt|sharynr: @Ck|pg||
pc|s9|nt|andyv:  at least a little luck in the @s suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  W might have ducked that trick|pg||
nt|sharynr: so this looks like a make|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|granguru: well 80's is not so old in fact|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the failure to play on diamonds would seem to indicate that they are solid, question is whether NS can cash out |pg||
nt|mdgraham: not much left but to play a heart though|pg||
pc|h3|nt|andyv:  it should makenow|pg||
nt|mareczek: yes, there are people who play bridge longer :)|pg||
nt|mareczek: 3@h -1 is actually 44%|pg||
mc|8|pg||

mb|p|nt|sharynr: 4@H E-W?|pg||
nt|andyv:  reasonable... but should be a spirited auction|pg||
nt|sharynr: not biddable though|pg||
nt|sharynr: North may have a tough time bidding anything now|pg||
nt|andyv:  if S bids @cs, W has a neg. dbl and that may get them to 4@h|pg||
mb|1S|mb|4D|nt|sharynr: west may choose to pass 2@C as well|pg||
nt|sharynr: not a fan od DBL|pg||
nt|andyv:  strange dbl|pg||
nt|mareczek: :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|granguru: NS might make 3@C|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, there's a bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: *of|pg||
nt|andyv:  W has a raise|pg||
mb|4S|nt|granguru: EW 2@S|pg||
nt|xenya: pure and simple -- remains to be made|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: par |pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: indeed -- still  it  failed to do the job|pg||
mb|5D|nt|sharynr: wow, South really likes his hand!|pg||
nt|andyv:  and that should get them to 4@h|pg||
nt|sharynr: trump lead, may defeat|pg||
nt|andyv:  S is from school that never picked up thirteen cards they didn't like|pg||
nt|sharynr: lol|pg||
mb|d|nt|xenya: a @D lead would have beaten it but hard to find|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: oh my!|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: you will often see good players leading an ace from anything in this type of auction, especially playing mps|pg||
mb|p|nt|mareczek: brave 4@s vulnerable!|pg||
nt|mareczek: 4@h makes|pg||
nt|xenya: 5@D is a nice save though|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mdgraham: say Eat bids 2@D - South will double - now North has to make a decision - 2@S or 3@S|pg||
pc|h2|nt|andyv:  so much for how to make 4@h:)|pg||
nt|granguru: a @C lead permits W to make 3N|pg||
pc|h8|nt|granguru: extraordinary lead|pg||
nt|granguru: the killing one|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@H on this auction has it's usual effect of being a transfer to 4@S|pg||
pc|s4|nt|andyv:  S REALLY liked his hand|pg||
nt|sharynr: maybe North should have passed 1@S DBL|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mareczek: to underlead a king after 2NT of West was uneasy|pg||
nt|granguru: Just usual Martens one some are saying|pg||
pc|s8|nt|andyv:  good play|pg||
nt|mareczek: 4@s down one when EW manage a ruff|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ritong: of course, now and then it costs|pg||
pc|s3|nt|granguru: this will bring around 80% score to NS|pg||
nt|granguru: which will probably maintain them in 1st place|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ritong: but less than a blind lead|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mareczek: I assume that @sQ will be found|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North would certainly be taking the spade finesse after the 4@D bid, so he would have made 4@s |pg||
pc|h3|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|mareczek: buy even after this start declarer has some comunication problems|pg||
nt|mdgraham: why cash @dA unless it is a singleton? |pg||
nt|mdgraham: The question is, how many pairs will bid it  |pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|nt|granguru: 4@S -1, close 80% for NS (see runnin scores - http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/2009/zagr2009/Vilnius/vilpairs.html )|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: making now|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|granguru: @CA and @D6!!!|pg||
pc|d8|nt|andyv:  5@d would be a good game try if trumps weren't involved|pg||
nt|andyv:  -800|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|granguru: great|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h4|pc|s6|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|c6|pc|cK|pg||
nt|granguru: squeezed...|pg||
mc|8|nt|granguru: @CA was a must|pg||
nt|xenya: -500 -- beats the tables where 4@S will be reached|pg||
pg||
qx|o13|st||md|3SK542H876DK95CAK2,S873HAKQ4DQ3CJ976,SAQJ6H92DJT764CT3,ST9HJT53DA82CQ854|sv|b|nt|sharynr: either way a bad score for NS|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you don't want to be to harsh, but West should have realised @DA was a singleton - go up with @CA and give East a ruff|pg||
nt|mdgraham: many have pointed out that there was no need to lead @cQ - and they are right |pg||
nt|mdgraham: a small club makes it easier for West. |pg||
nt|mdgraham: however, if there are two clubs to take (West having four rather than five) then Q@C be be ok.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Tough game, this|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Danny Sprung points out that East could have led the @dA at trick one - then they can use the heart suit for transportation|pg||
nt|mdgraham: small break, Sniedze?|pg||
nt|xenya: not that small...|pg||
nt|granguru: 1@S probably|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, it beats the tables where 4@S is bid and made |pg||
nt|xenya: oh sure|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|granguru: 2@S?|pg||
mb|1C|nt|xenya: interesting 1@S from S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and finaly the last round - aciu Agne|pg||
mb|d|nt|granguru: pass ok|pg||
nt|xenya: i think there is another round|pg||
nt|vugraphzxh: this is the last :)|pg||
nt|xenya: but i'm usually wrong about that sort of thing|pg||
nt|xenya: OK|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sharynr: a dbl of multi should have some definition|pg||
nt|mareczek: not vulnerable Martens Jassem play a strong (15+) club|pg||
nt|mareczek: and 1 level openings 9-14|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, if they have a weak two, it is really weak, seems|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|granguru: ahh|pg||
nt|mareczek: 2@h and 2@s are 3-8 PC, 5+@h/@s and 4+ minor|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ritong: multi 2@d?|pg||
nt|xenya: it's a "strong weak" so to speak, but it would seem they must have something for this sort of hand|pg||
nt|mareczek: yes 2@d weak two in any major|pg||
nt|ritong: really weak, then:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 4@C asking for a transfer response |pg||
nt|granguru: max tricks NS can make is 9|pg||
nt|granguru: with normal defense|pg||
nt|granguru: as EW can always cash @SAK and minor Aces|pg||
nt|granguru: W led @H as 1@D is a transfer to @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: 4@H wrongly sided here|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ritong: west did not try to save what could be saved by doubling|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: West leads the right king|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: typical pairs auction|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nice spot for NS|pg||
pc|sT|nt|xenya: 2@H-4@H would almost certainly produce an overtrick|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|ritong: i tend to disagree, since with his hand chances are good that 3@c makes|pg||
nt|mareczek: kibitzers say that thay play 2@d for majors 5-4 at least, weak|pg||
nt|ritong: okay, so no w2  i like that|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s9|nt|xenya: good @D shift by W -- declarer had to be careful after that, now he may go down|pg||
nt|xenya: anyway we seem to know the winner already: Michailovas/Lukinslas -- they are unreachable with 65.91% |pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that is a huge score over five sessions|pg||
nt|vugraphzxh: we had no running result during the last session - because of safety reasons|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|andyv:  amazing how, after trick 1, S's hand was done for|pg||

nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzxh: last board of the turnament|pg||
mb|1D|nt|andyv:  nice @s slam|pg||
nt|andyv:  and 6N|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|mdgraham: easy 4@H here NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: EW will reach game, but which one....|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: probably 3NT|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mdgraham: 3N too|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c2|nt|mdgraham: club lead = four for the defence, the rest to declarer|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mareczek: 150 was worth 59%|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|sharynr: i don't what range 2NT showed, bit South certainly could do no more|pg||
pc|c5|nt|xenya: this is too high -- even if @Cs are 3-2|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|c9|pg||
nt|xenya: frankly, i don't understand EW's bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzxh: 2D was question|pg||
nt|ritong: a bit steaming after having given 3@s maybe|pg||
pc|c4|nt|pamela: hi|pg||
nt|xenya: hello|pg||
nt|xenya: and 3N would pay more|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 10 easy - only question is whether South can manage one more |pg||
pc|h5|nt|xenya: good lead and another fine score for NS|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c8|pg||
pc|c6|nt|andyv:  this is not an auction to show to your kids|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mdgraham: don't think many pairs will be in 3N though|pg||
pc|cT|pc|dT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: fourth highest of longest and strongest does work sometimes |pg||
pc|h3|nt|xenya: he can't i think -- @SA is wrong and there is no endplay|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mdgraham: don't really understand why South didn't cash @HA first|pg||
nt|dburn: interesting line, that @dA, but was expecting ace and a heart to the king after that|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sharynr: a claim is hopefully imminent|pg||
nt|andyv:  a lot of 2/1 players will play a relay sequence over 2@c/2@d, to show a bigger NT|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sharynr: but even if 25-27 is shown, does south necessarily have a slam force,|pg||
nt|xenya: all hopes shattered...|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: what's going on here - declarer has thrown a heart from dummy, which was a winner|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|s9|pg||
nt|mareczek: 10 tricks pays 66% for NS|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h2|pc|sA|nt|xenya: the @D finesse is on, but it's a small consolation|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
mc|8|nt|mdgraham: discarding winners to keep losers is not optimum strategy |pg||

nt|xenya: Hello everyone and welcome to the final two sessions of the Vilnius Cup. MP Pairs. 2 segments of 10 boards each.|pg||
nt|mareczek: Hi all :)|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Marek|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good morning all, and welcome to the lovely city of Vilnius for this session of the Open Pairs|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone and welcome to the final session of the Vilnius Cup. MP pairs. 5 rounds of 5 boards each.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: although it will be afternoon in Vilnius by now |pg||
nt|xenya: sorry -- 5 rounds of 2 boards each|pg||
nt|xenya: NS are a well-known Polish pair, lying currently 3rd.|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||

mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|xenya: http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/2009/zagr2009/Vilnius/vilpairs.html  for running scores|pg||
mb|3H|nt|xenya: slam on a finesse here -- it fails|pg||
mb|p|nt|mareczek: dbl=transfer for @s|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|xenya: NS are a well-known Polish pair, currently 2nd, EW are from Bulgaria (53rd)|pg||
mb|d|nt|xenya: last 5 rounds of 2 boards each today|pg||
nt|mareczek: seems like 3@h is the limit for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  ran out of momentum|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: i've got a feeling they'll bid it|pg||
nt|granguru: hi all|pg||
nt|xenya: this is MP Pairs |pg||
mb|p|pc|s4|nt|mdgraham: might stop in 5@D if they find two key cards missing|pg||
nt|mareczek: 4@s can be made if defense will not play diamonds|pg||
nt|xenya: this looks like down 1|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this was a vey aggressive 1@S entry, more for the lead than anything else |pg||
nt|xenya: a somewhat scary double by N|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|nt|xenya: they should now actually -- at MPs|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mdgraham: the problem, of course, is that playing 5@d will score less than a "field" 3N|pg||
pc|sA|nt|xenya: exactly|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so there is a tendency to bid 6 and hope it makes|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mareczek: Martens jassem are 5th after first 10 boards with 64,8%|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|mareczek: clubs can provide discards for 2 diamnonds|pg||
nt|xenya: transportation seems to be an issue -- with trumps 4-0|pg||
nt|mareczek: yes, trump 4-0 makes the game impossible to make|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|mdgraham: well, if 3@H is making then he needs to double in order to try for 300 - 50/100 won't be much good if other NS pairs are +140 |pg||
pc|hA|nt|mareczek: http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/2009/zagr2009/Vilnius/Vilpairs.html|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|xenya: i mean he can't both draw trumps and ruff his losers|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now NS need to cash out|pg||
pc|h4|nt|xenya: 3@C might have been a make -- and as it is, 4@H seems to be cold|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|mdgraham: @HJ|pg||

nt|sharynr: 4@H here..|pg||
nt|sharynr: dummy is not reachable so a @D lead would not be necessaray|pg||
nt|xenya: i hope it was not N thinking|pg||
nt|mdgraham: in my experience 50% slams fail at least 90% of the time|pg||
nt|granguru: 5@H NS|pg||
nt|xenya: another dull hand it seems|pg||
nt|mdgraham: -100 should be quite good for EW there|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, i agree, N had to double at matchpoints|pg||
mb|1S|nt|xenya: :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: interesting - with the friendly diamond position you can make 7@S |pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|xenya: NS can make 4@H here|pg||

nt|xenya: will they?|pg||
nt|xenya: we shall see...|pg||
mb|4N|nt|andyv:  3N might be the only makeable game contract here|pg||
nt|mareczek: NS when nv play a strong club with 10-15 PC openings in a suit, weak not rump|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|xenya: of course it's not easy to get there |pg||
nt|mdgraham: sledgehammer approach|pg||

mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mareczek: 2@h...|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: easy 10 now|pg||
nt|mareczek: but not vulnerable NS open 1 in a suit 9-15 PC|pg||
nt|xenya: OK|pg||

nt|mdgraham: 4@C by East much better - get a 4@D reply from West and then RKCB is a stand-out |pg||
pc|s4|nt|xenya: and yes, it's even safe to try for slam reaching the 5-level|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however, stopping in six is reasonable - get a heart lead and you might not even make six if @DQ is offside |pg||
pc|s2|nt|xenya: good lead|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mdgraham: not a good time to duck  |pg||
pc|d7|nt|granguru: the tipical hand 38 out of 40 make 11 tricks...one pair - against the room plays @CA @C10 finessing...|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
nt|sharynr: hard not to lead a @S after pard bid them though|pg||
nt|mdgraham: RKCB = Roman Key Card Blackwood. There are a few variations|pg||

qx|o17|st||md|3SK84HK7653DQ753C7,SAQJT7HT42DA8C432,S962H98DKT4CAKQT9,S53HAQJDJ962CJ865|sv|o|nt|sharynr: 3NT looks like the NS spot here|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N by NS|pg||
nt|sharynr: e-w must be getting tired of defending :)|pg||
nt|xenya: how could it happen?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxh: misclick|pg||
nt|xenya: np Agne|pg||
nt|xenya: lucky 3N for NS here -- and they might bid it i think|pg||
nt|granguru: 22 points|pg||
nt|xenya: yup|pg||
nt|xenya: but the long suits...|pg||
nt|granguru: need to guess @CJ..right play is playing from top around 55% to get that @CJ in 3 rounds|pg||
nt|xenya: not a good game of course|pg||
nt|granguru: @H 4-3 reduces it to 27%|pg||
nt|granguru: @SK right to 13%|pg||
nt|mdgraham: in its simplest form 5@C=0/3 key cards, 5@D=1/4 key cards (these can be swapped round), 5@H=2 without the trump queen, 5@S=2 with the trump queen. 5NT and 6@C can be assigned ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: meanings as well |pg||
nt|mdgraham: key cards being the four aces and the trump king |pg||
nt|mdgraham: the 5@C response, on one key card, would indicate that NS play 1430 (a useful mnemonic), but their CC seems rather silent on the issue |pg||
nt|xenya: awkward hand for NS|pg||
mb|1N|nt|xenya: weak NT...|pg||
nt|xenya: i think NS are stationary at this table, EW will move?|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: how weak is it though?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mdgraham: what can West do?|pg||
nt|mareczek: 2NT minors of course|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@h is surely passed out |pg||
mb|2S|nt|andyv:  not only that... their cards have made it impossible for them to even get involved in the auction.|pg||
nt|xenya: they will probably win the auction, but it's not clear whether they'll get a plus|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: @c4?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  and this appears to be a pair event which would explain the change in EW and the delay after 2 boards:)|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: EW are 66th|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: S bids on in view of his nice clubs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1NT=12-14 not vulnerable|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mdgraham: so South is being very aggressive here - no guarantee of a fit|pg||
pc|s2|nt|granguru: @SKx in a 6-2 8% makes finally a chance of around 10%|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
nt|andyv:  declarer will have to untangle and cash out @hs before he runs the @ds|pg||
nt|sharynr: playing matchpoints, I suppose it is right to unbock @HK and play for @DJ to be dropping = 11 trcks|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|xenya: looks like 2 down, on the surface -- might not be so bad against +110 for NS|pg||
pc|s6|nt|andyv:  which runs a slight risk of @ds being 4-1|pg||
nt|xenya: sorry 12th :)|pg||
nt|xenya: i9t's not often that you can see a 1-level contact being played at MP|pg||

nt|mdgraham: -50 might not be too bad fo EW|pg||
nt|xenya: 8 tricks -- should be good enough for NS|pg||
nt|xenya: should be a very good score for NS|pg||
mb|2D!|an|malti|nt|xenya: N has an interesting hand...|pg||
nt|xenya: the defence was not exactly ideal though|pg||
mb|d|nt|xenya: N should have played a @D at some point -- no promotion is needed here|pg||
nt|mareczek: 2@c or 4@c?|pg||
nt|xenya: double?|pg||
nt|mareczek: dbl... interesting choice|pg||
nt|xenya: the last thing that would come to my mind|pg||
nt|vugraphzxh: sorry, misclick :)|pg||
nt|xenya: i, too, go for 5@C as N|pg||
mb|2H|nt|andyv:  @d partial?|pg||
nt|mareczek: young pair EW|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  support dbl here|pg||
nt|mareczek: will bid 5@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  1N old fashioned strong NT by S|pg||
nt|sharynr: love the diamond stopper :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mareczek: yes, it was|pg||
pc|d3|nt|andyv:  so much for support dbl:)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|andyv:  this will make at least one|pg||
nt|mareczek: I think S hand is worth more than 2@d|pg||
nt|mdgraham: perhaps they play some kind of 2@C negative over a double|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: curious - here South goes passive|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't know NS's methods against a multi, but it certainle seems they haven't done enough|pg||
pc|dA|nt|xenya: must be that, Mike|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|pc|d8|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mdgraham: as otherwise, yes, 2@D does seem rather pessimistic|pg||
nt|xenya: of course, 5@S by E is overopimistic|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h4|nt|mdgraham: 5@D has excellent play here - you might even make six|pg||
nt|xenya: but E's pass over the double is a bit surprising|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: possibly a second double would have been for penalties|pg||
pc|c6|nt|xenya: http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/2009/zagr2009/Vilnius/vilpairs.html  for running scores|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mdgraham: but you don't want to defend 2@H in a pairs when you have decent values and nine spades - and not at teams either, come to think of it|pg||
mc|10|nt|mdgraham: average round :)|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|mdgraham: over a Multi 2@D, some pairs in England play 2@H=take-out of hearts, double=take-out of spades|pg||
nt|mdgraham: obviously you have to remember what 2@H means....|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, it's useful to distinguish between the two|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so here, 2@d-2@h (t/o of @H) and North can bid his spades merrily|pg||

nt|xenya: meanwhile NS have dropped to 4th place|pg||
nt|xenya: EW are from Russia|pg||
nt|mdgraham: anyway, next board|pg||
nt|xenya: of course the question remains what to do with a strong hand, not of a takeout type |pg||
mb|1C|nt|andyv:  I don't think N passed|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: and they are somewhere near the bottom of the field|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mdgraham: 1@S double? really? |pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes. There are various 2NT/pas/double combinations |pg||
mb|d|nt|andyv:  this auction won't go far|pg||
nt|xenya: weak NT... 3@C=@D?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|xenya: 3N was also cold on the last hand|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|andyv:  wrong again...S may push this one|pg||
nt|xenya: i think W should bid now|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|granguru: 3@C was par of the hand|pg||
nt|xenya: and she did|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: this cannot be this board, unless the drinks have been spiked|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  @c opener must be their catch all bid|pg||
pc|d5|nt|granguru: no double no trouble.|pg||
nt|xenya: very well done by NS, bidding this game|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mdgraham: or maybe it can - but where West got his double from is a mystery|pg||
nt|granguru: NS can get 6 tricks|pg||
nt|granguru: 5 tricks|pg||
nt|granguru: so around 85% score|pg||
pc|dA|nt|xenya: i'm not sure about the 3@S by E -- pass looks clear to me|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|andyv:  I'm always mystified why players just don't like leading their suits|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, the club position is favourable|pg||
pc|d8|nt|xenya: however he caught a beautiful dummy|pg||
pc|h6|nt|xenya: of course NS did very well to push EW to an uncomfortable level|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: possibly @SA, @S ruff, club from the table|pg||
pc|hA|nt|andyv:  was there any reason in the auction not to lead a @h?|pg||
nt|xenya: this auction is not likely to occur at any other table|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: apart from his bididng box, of course|pg||
nt|xenya: cold as the cards lie, but declarer doesn't know that -- so there is still room for a mistake i think|pg||
pc|sA|nt|xenya: 4-1 trumps may be a problem, but the contract rates to succeed|pg||
pc|s5|nt|granguru: now @C and another S|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|c2|pc|sK|pg||
nt|sharynr: i can't see any|pg||
nt|andyv:  lead of 9@d must be one that may or may not have the 10@d|pg||
nt|andyv:  so, it might have been the "sexier" lead:0|pg||
nt|xenya: 3-1 trumps is no help either|pg||
nt|mdgraham: variation|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|h5|pc|d4|pc|d7|pg||
nt|xenya: well getting the @Ss wrong prove sto be costly...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, it's very awkward now|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like he is down now|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|xenya: of course declarer won't take another finesse in @Hs -- he knows N has the King|pg||
nt|xenya: and it drops|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c3|pc|s4|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, strange all that|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|pc|c5|pc|c6|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mdgraham: might have been better for East to win and play a trump |pg||

nt|xenya: but a top score for NS |pg||
nt|granguru: xx shows 10+ usually|pg||
nt|xenya: well he would have made it the way he played if the @Hs were 2-2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I think that was one down - South can ruff a club safely  |pg||
nt|xenya: yes, it was 1 off |pg||
mb|1C|nt|andyv:  that would be 9 tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|sharynr: hasnt knocked out the @D yet|pg||

nt|xenya: should be a decent score for EW|pg||
mb|3C|mb|d|mb|p|nt|granguru: so probably best bid was jumping in @H - not doubling|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|nt|andyv:  ah, right|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|sharynr: is this what they call "garbage stayman"?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|granguru: 1@h is probably a transfer showing 4+ @S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: presumably take-out, but AKQ9x of spades seem to be worth a mention|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East presumably thinks West only has four spades, not five  |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  it qualifies|pg||
nt|sharynr: :)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|granguru: 10 tricks it seems|pg||
nt|xenya: 3!N is a nice spot|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as long as East ducks the first club - should not be too difficult on the bidding |pg||
pc|c2|nt|xenya: no game makes here -- 4@H looks better but is also hopeless |pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm|pg||
pc|s6|nt|granguru: losing 3 black tricks|pg||
pc|s5|nt|xenya: declarer will see that 4@S also makes, so he will have to try for overtricks|pg||

pc|s7|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you don't get rich at pairs defending 2@D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: most of the time, anyway|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|nt|sharynr: interesting leading the @H2|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|andyv:  W doesn't expect @hs to be 4-1|pg||
nt|sharynr: K@C?|pg||
nt|andyv:  thinking S has the J@c|pg||
nt|sharynr: a bit dangerous assuming partner has the J|pg||
nt|andyv:  fortunately for NS, on this hand it doesn't matter|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sharynr: true|pg||
nt|andyv:  so, waiting for next pair now|pg||
nt|sharynr: i dont think North should have led @SA when W showed majors|pg||
nt|sharynr: but I guess no difference in the end|pg||
nt|andyv:  I agree...if anything, holding stiff trump, I'd look for the tapping game... mainly the club suit.|pg||
nt|xenya: strange he won 1st club, yes|pg||
pc|d6|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|s9|nt|xenya: meanwhile Martens/Jassem have dropped to 10th place|pg||
