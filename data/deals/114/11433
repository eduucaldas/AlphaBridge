nt|athene: he went on over 3@S|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H had to be either choice of games (intending to pass 3n if partner bid that)|pg||
nt|brolucius: As for responding 2@S, I agree with Cindy that North was too strong for that. Four trumps, an ace and two kings. |pg||
nt|athene: or helping out with a possible slam auction|pg||
mb|1C!|an|could be 2|mb|p|nt|cindy:   i dont think so, Bill|pg||
mb|1D|an|Walsh style|mb|p|nt|athene: if 3@H is a game-try, why didn't north pass 3@S?|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H "partner, should we play game?"|pg||
nt|athene: 3@S "no"|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|cindy:  and not just an ace and two kings but an Ace/King and a King|pg||
nt|brolucius: Good point. Doesn't add up, really.|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S "oh, go on, you're just saying that!"|pg||
mb|2D!|an|art GF|mb|p|nt|dburn: to see this, consider that if West held @sQ, 3@s was too high, and North got his side to at least that|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|athene: north was obviously intending to go to game always after 3@D, which was fair enough, in my view - it was 3@D that was an overbid|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|cindy:  thats ok   N still has to bid his hand and not worry about  "what ifs"|pg||
nt|cindy:  2@d artificial game force i guess|pg||
nt|athene: anyway, NS having another fun auction but this time they have the hands to back it up :)|pg||
mb|4N!|mb|p|nt|athene: yes all looks natural with 2@D GF|pg||

pc|c8|pc|c3|pc|cJ|nt|brolucius: I am not generally in favour of making an apparent game try (Waterlow's 3@D) on a hand that is worth a slam try. That's because you need different values for a slam than for a ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: game, where an extra queen may be good. However, it is possible that 3@D also made sure that North had four-card trump support. |pg||

nt|sharynr: hi Pam :)|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|roswolf: 3nt looks normal to bid here|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s play a natural system|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S  looks the likely conract    likely to fail  with 2 trump tricks offside|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi David|pg||
nt|lestergold: Well I have to disclos some bias here altho its a confused bias|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|lestergold: N/S are my sons team mates who are playing in the open room|pg||
nt|lestergold: However I taught Cameron Small top play bridge 30 years ago - my instructiion did not include his 2Hbid with that collection|pg||
nt|pamela: it looks like a pretty nice one to with just one sp laser on a good day|pg||
nt|pamela: poser|pg||
mb|4N|nt|roswolf: who are e/w?|pg||
nt|lestergold: Here we have N/S a very accomplished senior opartnership Paul Hackett just back having won world seniors in Brazil in the seniors|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry duplication of chat|pg||
nt|lestergold: Butthese are a very regular and successful pair on antional and international level too|pg||
nt|lestergold: and of course twoo well known players hailing form The North of England i blieve|pg||
nt|roswolf: very true have played in open championships for england|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: mind you Heather does have a losing play option available|pg||
nt|sharynr: looks like only the @S slam will make though|pg||
mb|5H|nt|ady: this could go down if Heather decided on the club finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: if she judges east to have short club for his bid she might considr finessing the first club to cater for J or more to 4 with West|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmmmm i cash out the clubs - whats the problem|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|nt|lestergold: Im not suere about the N/S agreements here but im sure that that Erichsen would like his S bid here not have been forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: indeed e/w are solid players|pg||
nt|lestergold: SAo Small's cheeky intervention has helped push Irens overboard here|pg||
nt|ady: unlcuky hand for n/s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: if she does i will sympathise|pg||
nt|lestergold: and Mr. Osborne has given his opinion of that contract one which I share|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: 4D looks a little over reached here|pg||
nt|sharynr: the play should be fairly straightforward|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: but she hasnt|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|ady: no   playing from the top|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s2|nt|roswolf: whats the problem!?:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: not too many entries to dummy and heather doesnt want to use the only one for  a play of borderline validity|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|lestergold: with both heart honours wrong contract is doomed|pg||
nt|lestergold: well do you want to be i9n game opposite a weak no trump with no disclosed spade support with south's hand David?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|pamela: Sharyn do we know  if they play  a canape style  bid the 4 card frst.. a kib asked why they did not bid 2D first beeing the longer suit|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|roswolf: i believe e/w again play a natural system|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ady: the game is a good one    but Norths hand is suitable in trhat it is limited but has 3 aces|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|pc|sJ|pg||

mc|12|nt|yo_yo: Great double by Osborne here|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Kath|pg||
nt|Walddk5: I can assure you that Hackett and Waterlow do not play canap√©. It's stone-age Acol|pg||

nt|yo_yo: hi there|pg||
nt|sharynr: and yet another potential slam here!|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|roswolf: going down in 1nt was unexpected on this layout|pg||
nt|lestergold: good one witout the weak jump on his right not that good could easily have ben 2 club losers on other days instead of 2 spade losers|pg||
nt|lestergold: it was thin for a nonm vul game in my opinion|pg||
nt|sharynr: albeit worse|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|sharynr: so is this a weak NT or a promoted strong NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: the key situation here is whether derek can pick two tricks form hearts|pg||
nt|roswolf: south has an unattractive choice|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1nt maybe?|pg||
nt|lestergold: South has very little and not in one of North's suits|pg||
nt|lestergold: and they are vulnerable|pg||
nt|lestergold: scope for getting into trouble here|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lestergold: Mike Gold here popping in to see what the chip off the old block is up to|pg||
nt|mmmakela: Hi all and welcome!|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: and Waterlow simply bidding the lower ranking of his two three carders|pg||
nt|roswolf: the axe falls|pg||
nt|lestergold: what else can he do?|pg||
nt|lestergold: pity Waterlow was not able to bid 1N he doesnt know about North'sspade holding |pg||
nt|lestergold: Hacket has no real reason here to bid over tyhis double|pg||
nt|lestergold: well most say that he is the old block himself now was 30 the other day|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lestergold: three tricks available in clubs in theory if the entries were available|pg||
nt|ady: n/s have found the only game that can make|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a min no trump and a min raise but helpful lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: this may well make|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: true but he knows his fate!?|pg||
nt|lestergold: another Tank Waterlow knows they are in serious trouble|pg||
nt|roswolf: south must take his medicine|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's the nightmare of bidding 1NT with a 5 card major, dummy goes down with 4 |pg||
nt|yo_yo: but on this occasion  4@S no good|pg||
nt|lestergold: Jd nicely placed for declarer i dont think defence can get at more that2 dims and 2 club tricks here|pg||
nt|ady: might be a swing for n/s  here   4 spades has no chance|pg||
nt|pamela: worse with cards in right places cannot argue with succes if they bid it|pg||
mb|3H|nt|roswolf: and does|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: and it will be a large does if Hirst kicks off with trumps|pg||
nt|lestergold: dose|pg||
nt|pamela: 12-14 NT I guess.. |pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Andy Bowles|pg||
nt|sharynr: hi Andy :)|pg||
nt|pamela: hi Andy|pg||
nt|gnasher: Hi everybody|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ady: not clear for 7 tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes not the best lead i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Andy is on the Howard team, sitting out in this set|pg||
nt|sharynr: maybe Andy knows their style and system?|pg||
mb|4D|nt|roswolf: looks -2|pg||
nt|dburn: odd, that - no real reason for Jones to raise to game|pg||
nt|lestergold: Today Dabid Gold is playinmg with his occasional partner David Bakshi hisn reguilar pard Townsend is in Poland on paternity leave|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Read above :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: good point David|pg||
mb|4H|nt|roswolf: well -1 now i think on normal play - but why spurn the club finesse?|pg||
nt|lestergold: when the 9H appears Derek will have sonmething to think about onm the second round of that suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: and might have tried 3NT if he was going to bid game in any case|pg||
nt|lestergold: a lo of davids around here|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: two playing and one commentating|pg||
nt|pamela: Andy might have a bit more of a definition than " stone age acol" |pg||
nt|gnasher: hackett waterlow play 14-16, 4-card majors, occasional canape|pg||
nt|Walddk5: But it is|pg||
pc|s2|nt|yo_yo: home now|pg||
nt|gnasher: 2/1 FG except 1M-2C is two way|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|nt|lestergold: adn good bye 4S|pg||
nt|lestergold: David Gold at unfavourable vulnerability not shy to make life awkward for his oppos|pg||
nt|mmmakela: the good thing for EW is that 3 @S was already too high|pg||
nt|dburn: well, 4@s had not really been in the room long enough to receive a welcome - no one will notice its departure|pg||
nt|lestergold: not to mention aggressive actrion by the other David|pg||
nt|lestergold: well it wont depart unkless Bakhsgi plays a diamond now|pg||
nt|dburn: or a club, perhaps|pg||
nt|lestergold: or i suppose a club will do for two off|pg||
nt|lestergold: thats what hes tanking abiout i dont think hes likelyto take the risk but he has seen david gold's suit pref|pg||
nt|dburn: anything else would be vaguely quixotic, but he has to think - does partner have a stiff club, or @dA?|pg||
nt|lestergold: adn as he has both he cant really go wrong|pg||
nt|dburn: as it happens, partner has both, but|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|sharynr: so Andy does bd 1 qualify for a their canape response?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: OK, modified stone age Acol then :)|pg||
nt|pamela: we wondered about that canaape  bit|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: seems just 6 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: specs are quesioning Hackett's original ouble- Hacket has a good 14 count with the other tqo suits and he has a couple of aces- no i would not think his bid was unreasonable just ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: very unlucky here|pg||
nt|lestergold: they have managed to avoid their 9 card spade fit obviously selway is a student of Kantar's who's dictum is do not stayman with 4333 distribution|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i might record this hand to use in my defence for future occasions|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: well played |pg||
pc|h3|nt|roswolf: well now this is close but should now be -1|pg||
nt|lestergold: always easily to criticies players for stricking out thei necks at unfavourable vulnerability but if you do not bid you also can come a cropper|pg||
nt|roswolf: certainly north's style is to bid as often as possible|pg||
nt|lestergold: itsa damn good example|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hackett cannot be certain that E/W are not stealing the hand- many times whenyou hear this bidding and your side is cold for 4H|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: lack of entries to manufacture more than 2 club tricks|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lestergold: of course playing the jH from =dummy was unfortunate on this layout|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|gnasher: Don't think they normally canape as responder with nineteen Miltons|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|lestergold: On eof Gold's strengths his carding is so accurate|pg||
nt|lestergold: and reliable|pg||
nt|dburn: the club is more sadistic - when Rosen saw it, he must have thought he was going to make|pg||
nt|sharynr: On this hand, once South could not cue bid @C, North signed off in game, quite correctly|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|roswolf: i would have doubled as well:):(|pg||
nt|ady: even 3NT though is somewhat fortunate|pg||
nt|pamela: and then played it for no heroics|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|lestergold: and I frankly|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course 3N verylucky to make needed two finesses right|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|pc|h6|pc|s4|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hackett is a world class and experienced player- he does not engage in too many lunacies|pg||
nt|gnasher: As in Milton-Work Count|pg||
pc|dT|nt|roswolf: hmmmm he is certainly the former but the latter is not so true|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i wonder if Allerton plays a strong NT and opens it with a 5 card major? |pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
nt|lestergold: well that is debatable i agree the Hackett family afre known for their aggresive bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Director called for |pg||
nt|lestergold: one off is  a damage limitation it could have been worse|pg||
nt|lestergold: why director?|pg||
nt|lestergold: tell us more pleade!|pg||
nt|lestergold: please|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmmmm misexplanation!?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: different explanatios|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: different explanations for the double|pg||
nt|lestergold: so who calle the director?|pg||
nt|lestergold: Waterlow?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Waterlow read the note as Not interested in penalty|pg||

nt|lestergold: he used to write articles headed the convict club in which he used to lampoon london's leading rubbe bridge players - they were brilliant |pg||
nt|sharynr: what does the panel think East should bid if North transfers 2@H|pg||
nt|gnasher: That's a double of 1NT, we think|pg||
mb|2S|mb|d|an|t o|nt|ady: did well to keep low in OR    2@H  on 4-3 fit plays ok|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2H does not look like automatic make here|pg||
nt|roswolf: so far identical auctions|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so they dont play support x  obviously,  x shows strong hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup kath|pg||
nt|lestergold: Heather will not eant to encourage anything here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i am an advocate of the support X   but not all my partners share my enthusiasm|pg||
nt|roswolf: for a vul overcall the west hand is yuk |pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N happens to be frigid too|pg||
nt|lestergold: he is himself a great rubber player and one of the best partners you could ever wish to cut|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i know Erichsen of course, very familiar at tournaments|pg||
nt|gnasher: Good hand for it|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|roswolf: east probably thinking|pg||
nt|sharynr: so it does not mean "lead hearts?:|pg||
nt|gnasher: Without that agreement, I'd bid a slightly scary 3D|pg||
nt|sharynr: and now showing diamonds as a second suit?|pg||
nt|gnasher: No, just 15+,|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: Espen Erichsen a very fine player and geat cashp too|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and he recently won the Norwegian premier league |pg||
nt|sharynr: and perkins dbl??|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: SILLY DOUBLE BY EAST |pg||
nt|lestergold: Hackett must know he has a slam going hand because of the identified short spade in south's hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s will diagnose the 30 point pack|pg||
nt|lestergold: on the other hand Waterlow has not exatly bid the full value of his hand here|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think 3h could have been bid with a much weaker hand unless they are playing lebensohl|pg||
nt|lestergold: I of course know Small i taight him bridge and physics he only practices one of these i believe|pg||
nt|lestergold: I do not know Osborne|pg||
nt|gnasher: No idea |pg||
nt|sharynr: brave :)|pg||
nt|pamela: he heard|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: and will make most likely 12 tricks|pg||
pc|sA|nt|roswolf: 3@H?|pg||
nt|lestergold: yep Richard has understandably mad a try here sadly at least one level too high now|pg||
nt|mmmakela: or not.....|pg||
pc|s4|nt|yo_yo: Fleet now shows his support at the 3 level, that's the price he pays|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 4@S looks better here but difficult to bid |pg||
nt|lestergold: problem with this contract isthe severe shortage of entries to dummy|pg||
nt|ady: club position very good for Osborne    but will do well to make this|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it looks a nightmare to play|pg||
nt|lestergold: he has to use the spade to play club to the ten Selway will duck and that is the end of dummy|pg||
nt|ady: if he enterst dummy with A@S and plays a club to the 10  north should duck to prevent a 2nd entry to the east hand for a heart finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe an end play will produce a ninth trick but then diamonds are vulnerable to attack|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Osborne must have thought 2@S was a stronger hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: i said that david|pg||
nt|lestergold: Selway is much too good a defender to allow any additional; access to dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: however Osborn is rightly in the tank he may need the spade finesse here he doesnt know whats working and what isnt|pg||
nt|lestergold: he has a serioustank|pg||
pc|s9|nt|roswolf: TOO AGGRESSIVE IMO|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hackett is not messing around|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Osbourne is going through all the options   |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|sharynr: Take out for everything but diamonds ;)|pg||
nt|gnasher: Some potential to mess this defence up|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|sharynr: If @HA drops K, then south will have to give north 2 ruffs (keeping spade K for entry)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: E/W having done their best to keep Hacket informed about the spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: not so lever really|pg||
nt|roswolf: educated punt|pg||
nt|lestergold: clever really|pg||
nt|lestergold: not against a player with Hackett's judgement|pg||
nt|yo_yo: looking for miracels|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|lestergold: having doubled on the previous round 3H was very risky only having 3 card support and not really necessary|pg||
nt|pamela: yes tricky  on the face of it  2H 1D and 2S to take.. oops|pg||
pc|h5|nt|roswolf: why 3@H if dbl=good hand?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: lets face it, he has a very good hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: The layout here makes even 2H likely to have needed helop from teh defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: O(f course Waterlow a stady expert player but very much the anchor man in this partnership leaves the flair stuff to Hackett|pg||
pc|h7|nt|dburn: fourth highest of longest and strongest - never fails|pg||
pc|d7|nt|lestergold: so we have here avery likely swing in the pipeline|pg||
nt|roswolf: flair - hm|pg||
nt|roswolf: sometimes daylight robbery!|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|lestergold: well his first effcommentator's curse|pg||
nt|gnasher: Still OK - get two ruffs instead|pg||
nt|pamela: oh well maybe 2D instead|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||
nt|lestergold: I know Gold would sooner lead away from an unsupported ace than an unsupported K|pg||
nt|mmmakela: would earn a lot of matchpoints that lead|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: ok he is a bit ofa Dick Turpin of bridge but he has done it for decades with many different partners|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ady: surprised     North took A@C|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's one|pg||
nt|lestergold: well two errors in the spade of one second by Selway after i have praised him to the hilt|pg||
pc|d9|pc|hT|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: Heathe rhoping for the ed suits to both break but saly neither do|pg||
nt|lestergold: Derek will no doubt tap heather with clubs|pg||
nt|gnasher: What they couldn;t do was play SAK, HA|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: i dont think this would have made against best defence|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well osbourne gave them the opportunity to make errors so all credit to him|pg||
nt|lestergold: however im not saying that best defence was automatic to find|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sharynr: right|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|pamela: the (sp warned off that though did it not|pg||
nt|pamela: 9S|pg||
mc|8|nt|dburn: to be hones, I was expecting a club lead and 11 tricks, but this is better|pg||
pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|an|2/1 GF|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: perhaps S could have done something in the bidding to get a spade lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: A worthwhile slam, but it proved difficult in the bidding because North held great trumps and no control to cue-bid.|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|dburn: he bid spades, didn't he - what more do you want?|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Same sort of auction here... so far.|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder what 3NT over 3@S would have meant?|pg||
nt|brolucius: This is a frequent problem in 2-over-1 auctions. 2@S did not limit the hand, so 3@S is not a particularly strong slam try (necessarily).|pg||
nt|athene: if it meant "good trumps, nothing to cue", that would work like a charm |pg||
nt|athene: yes, this is a BIG problem with 2/1 auctions - neither player has a clue whether his partner has a monster, so both sides make courtesy control-bids and things often go wrong|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for me, 3N would say: my hand has something extra but i cant cue|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and these trumps & 6 LTC would qualify|pg||
nt|brolucius: Good point, Marshall. You need such a bid, it seems. |pg||
nt|dburn: for me, 3NT would say "3NT might be a better contract than 4@s"|pg||
nt|cindy:  i dont think it is a 2/1 problem|pg||
nt|athene: David should publish his system|pg||
nt|cindy:  4@s says im not interested in slam|pg||
nt|brolucius: But he does hold great trumps.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the best part about having such a bid is not that it helps you get to slam. it is that it can help you stay at the 4 level|pg||
nt|cindy:  3@s says i am potentially (at least) interested in slam|pg||
nt|brolucius: If South had been able to make a clear-cut slam invitation, North would not sign off with those trumps.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cindy:  in 2/1 N can bid 3@s over 2@c showing great spades and it doesnt show extra values  |pg||
pc|d7|nt|brolucius: That is a valuable understanding.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d9|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, but these trumps do not qualify for a jump to 3S|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|s6|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pc|s5|pc|sT|pg||
nt|cindy:  thats true also|pg||

nt|roswolf: a routine game now for e/w|pg||
nt|lestergold: part scores only here|pg||
nt|sharynr: and might even have been interpreted as suit pref along the way :)|pg||
nt|gnasher: Another possible slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: hmm a chance for Dhondy|pg||
nt|lestergold: Selway should have recognised that with a stiff spade marked by declining the finesse that Osborne was in trouble and that is where you do not rush in with aces|pg||
nt|sharynr: and yet a 3rd potential slam|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|lestergold: well partner made a free heart bid and all Hackett has done basically is to play his partner for the qH and either a spade void or the lub Ace|pg||
nt|lestergold: hard for N/S to compete and stay low here|pg||
nt|ady: part score in clubs for e/w   possible they may get too high|pg||
nt|ady: 2@C  inverted minor raise   |pg||
nt|yo_yo: that @D bid  marks the end of 3NT for EW|pg||
nt|ady: westlikely 2@H   and East 2@S  showing stoppers|pg||
nt|pamela: juicy cards|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|lestergold: another opportunity for a swing this time in favour of Dhondy|pg||
nt|ady: 5@C     makes      4@S   good contract   but bad trump split|pg||
nt|lestergold: and maybe a little help in diamonds or som more clubs as was thec case here|pg||
nt|lestergold: Bakshi will try 3s  no doubt|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - this is not a good start for North-South|pg||
nt|dburn: no, he won't|pg||
nt|lestergold: no hesc passed buck backwards|pg||
nt|dburn: double did not show spades, just a decent weak no trump|pg||
nt|lestergold: Gold may well float this with 3 bullets and no clear game bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: west passing cos hes rock bottom|pg||
nt|sharynr: how many "miltons" is this hand Andy :)|pg||
mb|2D!|an|5+ spades|nt|lestergold: east can bid again|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: he also knows that WEaterlow is a cautious bidder|pg||
nt|lestergold: very solid player Mr. Waterlow|pg||
nt|dburn: North should probably pass, but that's easier said than done|pg||
nt|lestergold: welll that is judgement on a pin head phew anyone wouldthink this was mps!|pg||
nt|dburn: but now, it is easier done than said|pg||
nt|yo_yo: pass probably shows a weak NT|pg||
nt|ady: west kept quiet with minimum after intervention|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lestergold: Gold is a courageous player knows that passing has more upside than struggling on with such a g=heavily defensive hand but opoor offensive holding|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 5@C is the spot|pg||
nt|lestergold: no can their natural bidding teer them into the making 5C|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: probably under instructions from Hackett to bid conservatively|pg||
nt|gnasher: That's natural game-forcing or invitational 3-card raise, I think|pg||
nt|pamela: he is not going to get excited |pg||
mb|4S|nt|lestergold: i think this will end the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well Heather casnnot now bid 3N|pg||
nt|lestergold: and look at this trump lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: east got the message and settled for a sensible part score|pg||
nt|sharynr: with no cue from North, south should assume super spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzsg: crouch asks how many spades Heather could have|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm 4S is better spot than 3N but the 5/1 beak|pg||
nt|roswolf: Waterlow is his own man but i agree he is a solid conservative citizen as far as bridge is concerned|pg||
nt|lestergold: in danger of going for 500|pg||
nt|dburn: I am looking at it, but I cannot see what effect it will have|pg||
nt|pamela: but lets see  calls for a wee try surely  oh |pg||
pc|d6|nt|lestergold: helpfuol lead and a diamond loser has dissappeared|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lestergold: well Rosen can set up club to get rid of dim loser as  alternative to ruffing in hand but the defence has put him under a bit of pressure|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: and tapped immediately|pg||
nt|ady: routine contract on reasonable spade split    |pg||
nt|lestergold: its gonna be very hard no to suc cumb to two further tricks in the trump suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: Ive known him for 40 years and i have a lot of respect for his game|pg||
nt|lestergold: and indeed for him|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: in fact two have|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: beterr to play dim and then trump trump and has to play a spade and another diamond gets played before club established|pg||
pc|dK|nt|roswolf: me too!|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|yo_yo: for those wondering about comparisons,  the other room start on board 17|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: is that wrong David?|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|nt|ady: can discard on 3rd hearft|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|yo_yo: this is bad luck for NS|pg||
nt|lestergold: so no great wing here |pg||
nt|yo_yo: I bet 3NT by South would have made|pg||
nt|lestergold: playing in the 4/3 fit should have rewarded them after all contract is figid on a 4/2 spade break|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup but surely unbiddable|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|nt|dburn: no, that is correct - a diamond would have been better than a spade at trick three|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: ei8ther my fingers or my keyboardare a sandwich short of a picnic today|pg||
nt|yo_yo: just close your eyes and bid 3NT after 3@C?|pg||
nt|roswolf: :0|pg||
nt|lestergold: and as for Hackett maybe the Arthur Daley of bridge but a damn good player and nice liekable chap|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks -2 for 3 imps to crouch|pg||
nt|lestergold: why should they punt 3N when they can explore for the best contract accurately|pg||
nt|roswolf: agree mike|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ok 3@D - 3@S - 3NT?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Now up to Crouch to lead A@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: biding omp will rewars them for playing in eiher 4s or 5c and penalise them for the lazy 3n punt|pg||
nt|lestergold: so the trump lead made it possible to get two off but Bakhshi didntfolow it up|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|roswolf: agreed|pg||
nt|lestergold: a real character|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: but now will lose 2 spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: however he will lose 2 spades instead of one so profit on lead was only one trick|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i bid 2@D partner for the lead!!|pg||
pc|cK|nt|yo_yo: anyway they reached a very good contract, 4@S would make on most days of the week|pg||
nt|roswolf: -3 now?|pg||
nt|lestergold: so far both sides have bid and played soundly except for a doubtful but not ludicrous bid of 3H by Richard earlier on|pg||
nt|lestergold: the hands have been excrutiatingly dull|pg||
nt|lestergold: and prdocued the greattwins of course|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sA|nt|athene: not the killing lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the more general point, though, following up on Bill's accurate observation about the murkiness of many 2/1 auctions, is that the "saving space HAS to be a good thing" mantra is ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: erroneous, and when a "picture bid" is available it should be used even if not maximally economical|pg||

nt|dburn: at this vulnerability?|pg||
nt|gnasher: A trump switch is needed now|pg||

nt|athene: the main issue if you are considering opening 4@H is, "do i have a clearcut action if they bid 4@S over it?" if not, maybe you shouldn't open 4@H|pg||

mb|1D|nt|roswolf: 4@S for e/w?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a botdferline 4S could be on here for E./W with every finesse in sight on Hirst can wheel out his overbidding boots with impunity|pg||
nt|lestergold: we have a lot of strong women players and I think more of you could do more in the open game|pg||
mb|1S|nt|roswolf: indeed which was a very good question|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: SW even!|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm swing possibilities here|pg||
mb|d|nt|yo_yo: ah I was just pondering that Ant :)|pg||
nt|dburn: given the methods in use, a heart lead was more or less normal|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|dburn: now, I say nothing about the methods in use - very fine methods they are, no doubt|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: he will try and Hassett will acceopt|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lestergold: If Richard keps his bidding boots on - this time he can amke game|pg||
nt|roswolf: if he invites east will accept|pg||
nt|lestergold: Im not convinced he knows that cklubs were natural that gold has shown a suit oriented hand and is strong why not lead his suit|pg||
nt|dburn: but the game was perhaps a little easier when if you had clubs, you could show them by bidding clubs|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|lestergold: 3H the limit for N/S|pg||
nt|ady: 9 tricks available in hearts for n/s|pg||
nt|yo_yo: club pips interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: and he will noww|pg||
nt|roswolf: well the moment of truth|pg||
mb|5D|nt|lestergold: but Gold has denied a no trumpish hand here|pg||
nt|lestergold: but e/.w cannot compete against hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: heart game can be made     |pg||
nt|lestergold: hm how ironic this time his pard makes two take out doubles and having had his fingers burned Richard goes chicken .... att he wrong time....|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: seems 3NT would have been better than 3@S?|pg||
nt|gnasher: Competently bid|pg||
nt|pamela: I was thinking that W would bid 3NT|pg||
nt|sharynr: with no raise in @S by north, he could gamble  it|pg||
nt|gnasher: He doesn't  know that the diamonds are running|pg||
pc|sA|nt|roswolf: since south could have a yarborough surely he has the values for game!?|pg||
nt|lestergold: so his club isnt likely to be prepared|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, 2NT was also close to unspeakable - if Jones had bid 4@s like a normal person, no one could have shown clubs at all|pg||
nt|lestergold: he could have 18/19 balanced i suppose thats notout of the quesion but then what are e./w bidding on vulnerable?|pg||
nt|ady: this should be 1 too high|pg||
nt|sharynr: no he doesn't, but his partner DID jump in the suit missing the ace|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: sorry they werent vilnerable|pg||
nt|lestergold: but still what were they bidding game on?|pg||
nt|lestergold: but there was room for doubt about the lead i conce3de|pg||
pc|sT|nt|roswolf: i think a clear error|pg||
nt|lestergold: he is boringly flat and his q spade is worthless|pg||
nt|roswolf: in both rooms|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Neither North nor South know how strong the other one is  - very difficult|pg||
nt|lestergold: but he still has an 8 count opposite an announced strong hand|pg||
nt|ady: game is against the odds  K@H more likely to be wrong |pg||
nt|yo_yo: I have been there a million times myself|pg||
nt|roswolf: precisely mike 2 of his points are useless and they still make game|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|sharynr: so he will score up 12 tricks|pg||
nt|sharynr: on that lead|pg||
nt|pamela: with the 3D bid surely it would show at least  top  honours though in this case he has the quantity if not quality|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: heathe rof course is just about minimum for the second takeout|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: three rounds of diamonds will prouce 2 dims and a tump trick by force but thereafter Hasset cant  really go wrong|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that 9@C may come into play here|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: on another occasion i think Richard would have bid 4H but hes been so unlucky with his bidding in this session that he has decided to go onservative|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: im not convinced by Selway's 4h bid here a takeout double followed by a further heart bid shows his values|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 8@C rather|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho the duplication here unfortunate the heart finesse being wrong expected on the opening bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: all in all i feel too pushy for a non vul game|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lestergold: if he is shortned in hand he will not be able to afford the ruffing fibnesse in clubs|pg||
nt|dburn: odd, that - would have expected Jones to compete further|pg||
pc|dA|nt|roswolf: not an acceptable reason imo|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|mb|2H|mb|3D|nt|brolucius: Two rooms in agreement so far.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|marlowepi: going back to the last hand, if S had had a small stiff diamond instead of the queen--which is three times more likely--then 5D would have been in peril & 4CX would still have been ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 800. i will assume that sequence was a rare occurrence or the partnership might not be so enduring|pg||
nt|cindy:  going down the path of destruction ?|pg||
nt|athene: that will surely be west's 3@H call?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyj: No, south|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: well, it's silly, then|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that is the only merit of the 3H call, but even that would be useless if EW play--as they should--that a X of 3H says "i was going to bid 3H"|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@H is s surprise for me. Yes, North has shown a good hand, but what does South have to add with only two-card support?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S is trying to take away the 3H bid from W|pg||

nt|brolucius: On a heart lead, declarer can try three rounds of clubs for the discard and North has only the ace to ruff with.|pg||
nt|athene: or perhaps West shares David Bird's attitude to the frivolous Beer Card culture|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|nt|yo_yo: Yes David, that's a good point|pg||

nt|gnasher: Another makeable slam|pg||
nt|gnasher: Though it's lucky to make on a heart lead|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lestergold: and an infrangible one at that|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lestergold: well n?S could get too high here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: nice double fit  with good clubs on the side    6@D  best as in OR|pg||
nt|lestergold: easy 4H here|pg||
mb|2C|nt|lestergold: slam certainly off in spades and looks awkward in hearts but possible as cards lie|pg||
nt|dburn: and that 4@h opening is... well, it might miss a slam opposite some very routine passes|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5D if allowed to play only two off but unreacheable vul after the preempt likely to be flat this board|pg||
nt|lestergold: quite heavy for a 4H opener isnt it- more like a texas stule 4 bid|pg||
nt|dburn: still, I guess you'd rather deal with 4@h - 4@s - pass - pass (when you have a clear double) than with 1@h - 4@s - pass - pass, when you have a headache|pg||
nt|lestergold: i meanhad east held Kc instead of q slam would have been a goodm prop|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3D|nt|lestergold: not completely automatic to bid its a 30 point pack with the lack of duplication in hearts|pg||
nt|roswolf: the heart save is cheap for n/s|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if Crouch doubles then they find the @D fit  but @S OK  if not better|pg||
nt|lestergold: this time not too lucky for Small|pg||

mb|3H|nt|lestergold: now will Peter go|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hackett will certsinly try|pg||
nt|lestergold: in hearts he can opt to dicard a spade and ruff the k out to make|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes he should be safe at the 5 level|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: no he is worried about diamonds|pg||
nt|yo_yo: wowee|pg||
nt|ady: Kay doubled after 1@H in OR|pg||
nt|gnasher: They've both made non-forcing bids, so probably|pg||
mb|4D|nt|roswolf: a major swing back to dhondy|pg||
nt|lestergold: but surely he had a trie he has a monster hand dim finesse at worst  probably|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is the first big error of the session|pg||
nt|roswolf: a cautious view|pg||
nt|lestergold: no they are leading and do not need to bid any dodgy slams|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: im still a bit surprised  Hackett has a monster of a hansd|pg||
mb|5D|nt|lestergold: sorry plus another ace|pg||
nt|lestergold: Selway is delighted with this contract doesnt want them playing elsewhere like for example ion diamodns|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: a firendly lead!!|pg||
pc|hK|nt|pamela: though  looking at it again  you are right  the poor N has to ruff with Ace Diam and H goes away|pg||
nt|pamela: lucky|pg||
nt|gnasher: Yes, but it needs either that layout or clubs breaking|pg||
nt|pamela: definitely not the greatest of slams to be in.. |pg||
nt|gnasher: so about 40%|pg||
nt|sharynr: Andy, what does the winner of this event achieve, besides glory :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lestergold: im getting tired but unlikely to be reached if east held the key cards|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|pg||
nt|yo_yo: East had  2 of the 3 key cards Crouch was worried about|pg||
nt|ady: the take out-double rather than the michaels seemed to work better on this hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: not a frightener|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|ady: well he had to do something with his 15     maybe top heavy for 1NT in pass out position|pg||
nt|yo_yo: has South enplayed himself here?|pg||
nt|lestergold: i double and if pard biods only two clubs i pass only tajke action if that is doubled|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no, his partner has|pg||
nt|lestergold: i am very strict about suit lngth and quality at the 2 level|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d8|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hJ|nt|yo_yo: Did Crouch show his massive hand here?|pg||
nt|lestergold: thats true Kath and why do you tyhink so many top players ome from London- I could reel off a lot of  names|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and you need a bit of cash to play in the big money games in London|pg||
nt|lestergold: some of the Manchter players too have their highish stake game|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they depend on poor players with lots of money |pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|h2|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: its a very big downside at imps vulnerable when you lose12 imps for not bidding ur vul slams|pg||
nt|dburn: but it seems to me a little paranoid to suppose that when RHO has passed, the opponents will be in 4@s before you have a chance to bid again|pg||
nt|lestergold: it desnt matter too much what preempt style u use but u must be consistent and keep to agreed ranges and principles when you do these things in fron of unpassed partner|pg||

nt|vugraphzsg: Crouch: "I didn't know what you might have"|pg||
nt|lestergold: and very expensive|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think in practice slam would have failed|pg||
nt|lestergold: would have taken same line basically|pg||
nt|lestergold: i tink ive been commenatting since 1045 without hardly a break|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i guess they dont make money from each other,  they make money from the rich punters|pg||
nt|gnasher: Probably, but it depends what happens|pg||
mb|1H|nt|yo_yo: I play that a cue bid by the michaels bidder shows a strong hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes it did - most pairs dont practice constructive bidding after michaels and therefore fail to have accurate agreements|pg||
nt|roswolf: now a tempter for e/w|pg||
nt|lestergold: and usually with only one other commentator so hard work!!|pg||
nt|lestergold: I dont think its about making money- money concentartes the mind more than master points|pg||
nt|sharynr: so far we have only 2 comparisons!|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|pamela: did they start later? or just slow|pg||
nt|gnasher: Hackett 'ss|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lestergold: what we are4 seeing tho is players who are getting pessimistic because they keep going off in conracts|pg||
nt|lestergold: when you review ur errors and work out that they just cost you 250 quid you learn more easily from those errors|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: this has been a lot of scores above the line|pg||
nt|ady: 25 hcp   but 4@H  hopeless     3NT has play|pg||
nt|roswolf: east may just bid 5@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5C looks ok|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 3NT e/w     if west plays  J@C lead would beat it    somewhat unlikely|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah I see Cameron has switched to transfer bids over 1@c opener|pg||
nt|gnasher: Hacket's takeout double is very modern for a man of his age|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|pamela: lol |pg||
mb|2S|nt|roswolf: yes e/w favorite to go down in something|pg||
nt|lestergold: whatever one says almost all bridge players are influenced by the precious session history which in theory they shouldnt be|pg||
nt|ady: likely to reach 4@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: previous hands i meant to type|pg||
nt|pamela: bet he is glad to see the opps bid the cl|pg||
nt|sharynr: I was just about to say N-S avoiding the spade fit :)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lestergold: west has good trumps and tweo bullets but otherwise minimum|pg||
nt|roswolf: HMM not my choice 3@H splinter was possible|pg||
nt|roswolf: by east of course|pg||
nt|lestergold: west dutifully cues the diamond east should cue hearts now|pg||
nt|roswolf: now east will be worried about missing slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: but then west should sign off and east should passhaving bid his full values|pg||
nt|lestergold: but as they are behind they may push that boat out into the deep blue sea|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think reaching slam on this auction is quite likely|pg||
nt|lestergold: you are not wrong but it woulod be indisciplined|pg||
nt|lestergold: making tries and cues os not mean that you have to bid a slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: you are allowed to put the brakes on|pg||
nt|sharynr: I think I would play South for a good 3 card @S holding on this auction|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pamela: he wants to x I feel it in my water  but 3D will end it then.. if he does|pg||
nt|gnasher: Unfortunately the other table started with boards seventeen onwards|pg||
nt|sharynr: I think 3@C might be a bit much, is he not happy defending a @S contract?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: now 3NT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i cant see North leading @C on this auction|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm is 3n going to be wrong sided?|pg||
nt|ady: likely to make 10 tricks on a spade lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: North may ask a few quesions before leading|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: and here is another likely game to be bid which has litle hope against the 4/1 trump brwk|pg||
nt|lestergold: but this time pessimism has paid off!|pg||
nt|lestergold: but a spade looks like the marked lead rue|pg||
nt|lestergold: true unlesss... erichsen doubleas for a club lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: auction not over|pg||
nt|gnasher: Perhaps he'd like to defend 3S|pg||
nt|sharynr: wouldn't we all :)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|nt|lestergold: actually Hasset has judged well not to cue his hearts beause he has no aces|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed but the adrenaline rush sometimes makes you do it|pg||
nt|lestergold: slam actually makes as cards lie it makes by an unusual means|pg||
nt|roswolf: but neverthess well done to e/w to reach a sensible contract|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: Peter has devalued his spade holding because of hearther's somewhat dubious noise here|pg||
nt|ady:  how doestheir relay system allows them to stop so low with 25 hcp and major suit fit?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes the strong no- trumpers might bid it 1NT - 3NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: its amazing how players always feel when not vul that thye have to get their pesky 5 card spade suits in however useless teh suigt and however useless the hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: rudd high he will|pg||
nt|dburn: ah well - someone at least led a club in case his partner had them despite having bid them|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes commentator's curse spared me for once|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lestergold: and the dimaond finesee will see Gold home|pg||
nt|lestergold: the discard on the club q had no value inj any case|pg||
nt|lestergold: i like the way you put that david|pg||
nt|yo_yo: does this ask for @C?  I expect so|pg||
nt|ady: dbl interesting|pg||
nt|lestergold: first suit b id b y dummy traditionally|pg||
nt|lestergold: definitely says do not make ur normallead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but will Selway lead J?   |pg||
nt|lestergold: however has to be J|pg||
nt|ady: I think selway will find the J@C lead|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|roswolf: these are 60 bd matches (3 x20) and the VP scale applicable means that it is very hard to score big wins to get a max 25vps you need + 80 imps|pg||
nt|lestergold: Gold will cash diamond ace in case before leading up to the q|pg||
nt|lestergold: or may play a no cost small diamond away from hand sometimes catching east napping with a doubleton K|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i think so but last tim i expected selway to make a good play he didnt|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh well its all academic small has chickened|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s8|nt|lestergold: the JT spades mans spades can be set up for onlyu one ruff and that produces 4 discards for the  daimonds!|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind you doe sthat work there are not necessarily enuf trumops to deal iwth the heart losers it could be too much work to do |pg||
nt|lestergold: at any rate who want s to play in slam here|pg||
nt|lestergold: not even Roland|pg||
nt|roswolf: i do if it makes!|pg||
nt|lestergold: and can go off undoubled in 4dimaonds instead|pg||
nt|ady: still needs to find J@C lead to beat 4@D|pg||
nt|lestergold: no reason not to any more than against 3N|pg||
nt|pamela: big sigh of relief from NS  on this one|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lestergold: well done Norman back to the old Norman Im used to|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well done to Selway|pg||

nt|lestergold: all is forgiven|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: we all do but we dont have the benefit of hindsight in tis game |pg||

pc|s5|pg||
nt|lestergold: the cat that it makes no odds here of course makes it aademic|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d4|pc|dK|nt|roswolf: true:(|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course ducking the ace of spades would finish off any slam i fear in any case|pg||
nt|dburn: that is a relief, for if he does not, the slow play fines might vitiate his lead in the match|pg||
pc|dA|pg||

pc|c5|nt|lestergold: yep 11 tricks looks the limit|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3 trumps and a diamond to come whats th problem|pg||
nt|roswolf: may have miscounted his tricks?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Director called by Hackett|pg||
nt|lestergold: well what can he do ruff spade cash dimaond and claim|pg||
nt|roswolf: what for a revoke!?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: I think 4@d was explained as keycard to him|pg||
nt|lestergold: who is directing Mike Amos?|pg||
nt|roswolf: so what !?|pg||
nt|roswolf: probably|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: the miable Mike will say the same thing - so what!|pg||

pc|h9|nt|yo_yo: Dont you play in this league usually Geoffrey?|pg||

nt|lestergold: David has probably maximisd his chances in the dim suit this way|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry Gold|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: of course this now efectively serves as the England trials|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: amiable Mike who is of course also one of our fellow commentators|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ady: apparantly made 10 tricks last hand    seemed 4 losers|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: anyone bidding 6@D here is a genius|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well south has taken a conservative view|pg||
nt|lestergold: well even these two are surely going to settle for a part score|pg||
nt|roswolf: difficult for him to come in i think|pg||
nt|gnasher: It looks like on e of EW should have bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: Kantar may have been very great but I disagree because you are blanaced it doesnt guarntee that patner is - i think point count texture of hand and the way the points are ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: distributed ae lall factors to be taen into account|pg||
nt|lestergold: but its this care to tyhe nth degree over the technical possibilities in card play which distinguih=shes the top experts from the ordinary mortals|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe 2@s shows a good weak two bid and 2@d (or some such) a bad one|pg||
pc|h4|nt|roswolf: not seemingly|pg||

nt|roswolf: 3nt!?|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm |pg||

nt|lestergold: For players like Gold,a finesse is his last option|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: i dont like to mny NEVERS in bridge|pg||
nt|ady: assume 2@D   shows hearts|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I think Kantar has won more things than most of us  |pg||
nt|dburn: well, when partner opens 1NT, there may be some indication that he has a balanced hand|pg||
nt|ady: all major suits splitting badly|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh we have an interloper hi David!!|pg||
nt|lestergold: aceless wonder|pg||
nt|dburn: otherwise, it isn't easy to see why South moved over 2@s|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|dburn: not guaranteed nowadays, of course, but...|pg||
nt|lestergold: half his points in quacks|pg||
nt|roswolf: well normally you cant pass a conventional bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: well even Roland wouldnt because 6D is too good fro him|pg||
nt|sharynr: I mean West|pg||
nt|pamela:  not attractive suit for E to bid  but he would have been in with a noise from W for sure|pg||
nt|gnasher: West might have doubled in the passout seat, but they probably play that as a spade stack|pg||
nt|sharynr: logical|pg||
pc|d2|nt|roswolf: hi david|pg||
pc|d6|nt|roswolf: what did i tell you|pg||
nt|lestergold: even the juniors on fire wouldnt bid tis surely|pg||
pc|h3|nt|yo_yo: David been dropped ?|pg||

nt|sharynr: but how high do you really want to get with the E-W cards, surely not higher than 2@H|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|lestergold: sadlythe bold bidding this time not rewqarded by any kind card holdings with the defence|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah well e/w are seniors and were never juniors!|pg||
nt|gnasher: Well, perhaps thbis hand shows why it's better to play it as balancedish hand, around opening strength|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|lestergold: aheavy 2S at fav vul with two aces im a little surprised|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: well 2S equally unofrtunate so not likely tio produce any swings|pg||
nt|ady: nice return from Fleet|pg||
nt|lestergold: the absolutely killing lead has killed the contract dead at birth|pg||
nt|ady: Osborne can make 11 tricks   but will probably safety play the diamonds and make only 10|pg||
nt|pamela: true|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|c9|nt|dburn: was expecting Richard to lead that heart a trick earlier than he did|pg||

nt|yo_yo: i wonder why he doesnt claim|pg||
nt|ady: might get a spade |pg||
nt|ady: Selway has to gues which black suit to play|pg||
nt|lestergold: he can just ask if spade finesse is right claiming 1 or ten accordingly|pg||
nt|lestergold: 11 or ten accordingly|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but yes david, he might lead @S|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: that is true|pg||
nt|sharynr: but you can always play that 2@C "Takeout" bid with that balanced hand|pg||
nt|pamela: this hand is sort of coming together for N|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ady: now the bad news|pg||
nt|lestergold: well no question that Gold would acept any hint o an invite|pg||

nt|cindy:  partner is a passed hand...i would bid more than one|pg||

pc|dK|nt|athene: assuming you play sensible methods where you can show @S+@D, i mean|pg||
nt|dburn: but in this case East had jumped to 6@h, so North's double probably should carry some lead-directing significance|pg||
pc|hT|pc|d7|pc|d2|pg||
nt|dburn: no doubt Ranis hoped Callaghan would also understand double as Lightner, even below the slam level|pg||

nt|brolucius: A very large number of IMPs will leap from one column to another after East's failure to cover with the @S10 with the @SJ at the other table. |pg||

nt|lestergold: good enuf for the governor of course|pg||
nt|yo_yo: will our rubber bridge play bid 2@H?|pg||
nt|sharynr: another slam!|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lestergold: 4s great if undoubled as 3N on for N/S|pg||
mb|2H|nt|yo_yo: oh yes, by East OK|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 4S can make heredepending on wehether north gets a diamond thru befor clubs are used for discards|pg||
nt|ady: still needs a diamond lead to beat 4@S  by west|pg||
nt|lestergold: and 3N icy if they decide to playthere|pg||
nt|roswolf: i expect e/w to play in a making contract|pg||
nt|dburn: crikey - this is either the Crouch Natural System or the Crouch Strong Club System at work|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind you there is a hazard in 3N|pg||
nt|sharynr: but only in clubs|pg||
nt|pamela: this one should be exciting|pg||
mb|2S|nt|lestergold: so a chance for crouch to put on some more to their lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: the latter david|pg||
nt|lestergold: strong cl|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure which, but both equally incomprehensible|pg||
nt|lestergold: super science today|pg||
nt|roswolf: i am glad you said that|pg||
nt|dburn: trust me, I've played them|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
mb|4D|nt|ady: must avoid playing 3NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course along with all other bridge players i would think|pg||
nt|lestergold: rubber even more so because of the hundred honours pard|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think 50 available now for e./w no reaaly enough|pg||
nt|lestergold: 500|pg||
nt|lestergold: dont think Small will float it with 4 hearts to the 9|pg||
nt|ady: east might bid 3@H|pg||
nt|ady: still wondering whether they will play 3NT |pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n no play of course|pg||
nt|ady: high level club contract not that obvious|pg||
nt|sharynr: Reissman will surely like his hand|pg||
mb|4S|mb|6H|nt|lestergold: 4H ?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: you need a super duper memory we have decided|pg||
nt|dburn: at any rate, West is now declarer if they play in hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 8 easy visible tricks here|pg||
nt|lestergold: its the 9th which needs some massaging one way or another|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5C may be difficult to reach in spite of the 12 tricks we can see available|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: East if they play in notrump|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N cold from either side too|pg||
nt|dburn: and spades have yet to get a mention|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they have agreed @S|pg||
nt|roswolf: no @S it is|pg||
nt|lestergold: and if Patterson mentions them  now it makes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they might get too high|pg||
nt|roswolf: my thoughts too kath|pg||
nt|lestergold: it may happen on lead of course either f card suit will yeild it |pg||
nt|lestergold: four card suit|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Cameron Small had a difficult bid there |pg||
nt|sharynr: dbl?|pg||
nt|pamela: now a double from N|pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: the hazar is when clubs are played and east drops the  or Jack declarer will have arestricted choice losing option|pg||
nt|lestergold: and its diamonds|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: Small decided to take whatever plus in 2@HX|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i do not agree with Small's flotation sometimes these contracts even make|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no @H stop, no 4 card @S,  no support for @C|pg||
nt|lestergold: I like better trumops tio defend 2 of a major doubled into game|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: this sounds distinctly slammish|pg||
nt|lestergold: he has no guarantee that even his AK of diamonds are standing up|pg||
nt|sharynr: no where to run|pg||
nt|gnasher: Maybe it will be a flat board|pg||
nt|sharynr: Very difficult to avoid|pg||
pc|sT|nt|roswolf: agree|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like 4S is the contract|pg||
nt|sharynr: huh?|pg||
nt|gnasher: COVER|pg||
nt|pamela: poor S  ohoh|pg||
pc|s6|nt|dburn: for the moment, yes, but I expect Derek Patterson to pack it in now|pg||

nt|ady: but what action should Small take if not leaving the double?|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: an overtrick will be made|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed but still 40+ boards to play in this match|pg||
nt|lestergold: just the two trumps to lose|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: 60 boards in total in this match, played over three weekends|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i cant think of a sensible bid David|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s5|nt|lestergold: his pard has shown extras so he wants to play in gae i think 3H|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ady: Dhondy unfortunate in OR   spades have to be 4-1   A@d wrong  and a diamond lead |pg||
nt|pamela: jeepers|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lestergold: mostly 3N will go off if played with the odds|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: osborne has a broken club suit and only one heart stop one that he cannot hold up so he can rebid 4C and Small can raise to 5|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lestergold: why not unblock the club first|pg||

nt|marlowepi: against hearts  (4) you will learn more by listening   (5) might be more likely to be doubled making if you start slow   (5) your hand is pure, so if you push them to 5C they are ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: likely to make it|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|dburn: not if partner has the jack of spades, it isn't|pg||
nt|dburn: but he was completely safe at the five level (surely South would not have queen-high spades), so he could at least have made one more effort|pg||
nt|vugraphzyj: back to 11 now|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: if S can have Kx or Kxx in hearts, then maybe a redouble should confirm that there are not TWO losers in the Qed suit rather than confirming first round control. after all, there ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: is still room to confirm the latter via 5H if need be|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Some players would have doubled 1@D on the East hand, despite the shape.|pg||
nt|athene: does that 2@H balance count as "aggressive", David?|pg||
nt|brolucius: I will have to think about it.|pg||
nt|athene: if it pushes opps into 3@D-1, it's aggressive; if it goes for 500, it's foolhardy|pg||
nt|dburn: seems all right - East is supposed to have something for this auction|pg||
nt|dburn: still. North could have four hearts, so it's not completely obvious|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sA|nt|marlowepi: credit Edgar Kaplan for that one, Bill|pg||
nt|athene: passing 1nt might have been more pre-emptive|pg||
nt|athene: when partner bids 1nt over 1@D he is supposed to have clubs, so passing was possible|pg||

nt|lestergold: well this slam is too good for Rland|pg||
nt|ady: Small must think there are some extra honor cards in the pack|pg||
nt|lestergold: Erichsen opening a disciplined 1H rather tyhan 4 because he has 3 first ound controls much too good to preemp|pg||

nt|lestergold: as for Osborn's 2s bid i would only even consider it at green against red|pg||
nt|gnasher: Yes.  Especially in a doubled slam|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jaapfr: a simple 4@S not much commentating here at all:)|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: need favourable club position   either KX     or stiff 10 with east for slam|pg||

nt|ady: non club lead 6@H could be made|pg||
nt|yo_yo: @S lead lets in 6@H |pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: Hirst hates it but hes swallowed it|pg||

pc|sA|nt|ady: tid turned for Dhondy|pg||

nt|pamela: maybe wrong person on lead|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|lestergold: might be flat but i doubt it the 2S bid pushed them in truth North will decline slam tries on this hand with his aceless wonder|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|ady: 6@H is very lucky to make   ace and king of diamonds with east   and no club lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Q@D   and small?   what will he do|pg||
nt|lestergold: he has no real option but to make it|pg||
nt|lestergold: the 4H bid tells him that east has a monster hand|pg||
pc|d7|nt|yo_yo: but West may have started with Hx in @D|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|lestergold: we often forget the downisde of these barrage tactics|pg||
nt|yo_yo: same barrage in both rooms Mike|pg||
nt|dburn: odd, this - Richard doubtless weighing up the chances of singleton rather than doubleton @cK with West|pg||
nt|lestergold: sill leads to abit of guesswork and on this occasion it was guessed correctly herw  and incorrectly in the open room|pg||
nt|lestergold: or i should say successfully rather than correctly|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: It should be obvious from the E/W bidding that partner is overcalling on length rather than points.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what would you have N do, David?|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he has a maximum for his original pass and wants to compete|pg||

nt|vugraphzyj: Small leads Irens (+11)|pg||
nt|dburn: a white feather, by the sound of it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am afraid double seems obvious to me. if N isnt supposed to bid with a super-max passed hand including 4 controls, then why would S ever overcall?|pg||
nt|cindy:  heh|pg||
pc|dK|nt|dburn: put it this way - if West had passed over 1@h, should North do the same?|pg||
nt|cindy:  i havent seen this e/w pair open less than a solid opener yet|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if pd has long hearts as we suspect, he is obviously going to pull. my diamonds holding could not be better and suggests both kings are working|pg||
nt|cindy:  dont expect they started on this hand|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: doubling looks ok; you might find 4-4 spades, or the 1NT might only be 3 hearts|pg||
nt|brolucius: You expect partner to have 8 or 9 points and you know the hearts are sitting badly. But I know the world respects overbidders more than those who wisely hold their peace...|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|pc|d2|pc|d8|pg||
nt|dburn: it's not as though 1NT would have gone down, after all - and quite often on this kind of hand 1NT will make and so will 2@h|pg||

nt|pamela: he is still outnumberd  we have his measure|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is a hand -type which n/s seem to have difficultoes with|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|sharynr: North could always pass:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: now a DD 6@H C but will it be bid?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well as cards lie N/S have 6 infrangible hearts|pg||
nt|dburn: well done indeed - that was a bloody good effort by Neil Rosen|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|lestergold: Selway has changed his opening bid policy|pg||
mb|p|nt|gnasher: This is game-forcing with clubs or a 3-card raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well no future in the blocked club suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: but slam is not favourite to be reached here |pg||
nt|roswolf: north and south did not explore|pg||
nt|lestergold: flat 19 opposite a an unexciting nine with an 8 card minor suit fit|pg||
nt|lestergold: not that awful a slam basically on the club finesse and no disasters elsewhere|pg||
nt|jaapfr: effective effort indeed:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: here he does have a good 5 card suit and two aces tho|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is the trouble a gadget when you dont need 1|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sharynr: Before he rebid 2@D to show 5@S, so now they are forced to the play a 4-3?|pg||
nt|sharynr: Should those responses not be reversed?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: unlikley to reach it tho|pg||
nt|lestergold: cards not lying too well here for N/S|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: inless he runs the J clubs |pg||
nt|ady: dont think so Mike   this hand has a resonable suit  and 5-4-2-2    he would always open that|pg||
nt|lestergold: well not in black suits better in the reds|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ritong: the pushy 3@d might help  bakshi will like his flat hand with every high card working|pg||
nt|lestergold: i do agree David|pg||
nt|gnasher: They'd prefer to play 2S in a 4-3 fit than 2NT|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: whioch he has|pg||
nt|pamela: so H is H then  2D =  5+ sp and 2S is 4?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|dburn: why 2@c, I wonder?|pg||
nt|sharynr: Seems that 2@D to show 4 card @S, would still allow south to bid 2@H|pg||
nt|gnasher: And I expect 1S-2C;2D-2H shows the club game-force with hearts|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jaapfr: problem is not a real way to show @CQJ which are vital|pg||
nt|lestergold: well he deosnt like his qd so fla woking 1 cou8nt does not look that slam going|pg||
nt|lestergold: a2 count|pg||
nt|ritong: he bid 3h as an effort|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|roswolf: playing 4 card majors( a crazy system) THIS 2@C THING IS FULL OF HOLES IF OPPS BID|pg||
nt|pamela: we should suggest that to Paul Sharyn .. lol|pg||
nt|gnasher: You can't waste the entire two-level on the three-card raise|pg||
pc|h3|nt|yo_yo: Liggins came in  with an asptro type bid in the OR , as NOrth|pg||
nt|lestergold: but still cannot make|pg||
nt|lestergold: not that easy to set gthe bidding on fire|pg||
pc|hK|nt|dburn: what would 1@s have meant?|pg||

nt|lestergold: yes can make 3 ckubs a spade 2 hearts and a very lucky 3 dims|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ady: East may have done better to switch to a heart to kill the  entries to the club suit|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|gnasher: Back in 2S, this ought to go a couple down|pg||
nt|roswolf: you can if playing 5CM|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|lestergold: yes but Gold had shot his bolt with the splinter nothing more Gold could justify saying especially as he had splintered with a stiff ace as opposed to a low stiff|pg||
pc|hT|nt|gnasher: But |pg||
nt|gnasher: East may get endplayed|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|lestergold: well osborned has traded a spade trick to set up a long spade for himself|pg||
nt|lestergold: but it isnt enuf to beat it|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|nt|roswolf: this area is where n/s dont have much success - they can never play in @H if it was right to do so|pg||

nt|athene: big chance for Hackett here|pg||
mb|1D|nt|brolucius: Not even this hand, but one where West had a different heart holding.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in my view, if doubling 1NT is an overbid on that hand, then opening a 4333 17 count with 1N is an overbid|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|dburn: indeed, and the best thing to do with an 11 count after partner overcalls is not to sit there and defend 1NT like some blancmange|pg||
nt|cindy:  lol|pg||
nt|cindy:  no name calling !   :-)|pg||
nt|athene: this is tough slam to bid - that singleton @DJ is worth a lot|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is not even a blancmangy 11 count--it is top of the line|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|an|alerted|nt|dburn: especially with ace and three deuces in the suit opened to your left|pg||
nt|brolucius: In general, that is true. But the 1NT bid from West should perhaps cause North to re-evaluate.|pg||
nt|athene: it's a bit like the hands Bridge World Magazine has in its "challenge the champs" feature|pg||
nt|athene: where a singleton queen in pd's suit is worth about 6hcp always|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|cindy:  true   you are allowed to listen to the bidding and reevaluate as needed|pg||
nt|brolucius: In Challenge the Champs, you have the advantage of knowing for sure that the sensible bid will not work.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|athene: yes, so you always play partscore with 26 count and game with 22|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure whether East thinks West is cue-bidding for diamonds|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3NT shows a hand based on long diamonds, since with 18-19, you would rebid 2NT nowadays.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h5|nt|athene: people often say that responder's new suit after opener's jump rebid, should be a cue|pg||
nt|dburn: no - he thinks it was all natural|pg||
nt|athene: but then they pick up a real 2-suiter and find that actually you might want it to be natural|pg||
nt|athene: here, east didn't actually make a jump rebid explicitly but 3nt effectively does that|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dint think it wwas at all obvious for W to bid on over 3N|pg||

nt|marlowepi: well maybe so but E is not going to bid it|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|brolucius: West concedes a trump trick now, so that North cannot interrupt the flow of the diamonds.|pg||
mc|12|nt|marlowepi: from E perspective 4S could be cold with 5D down |pg||
nt|athene: yes, this is one of the few times when you have to lose a tempo to draw a master trump|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: no probs at this nice low level|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lestergold: well defence have 4 theoretcial tricks aginst 4S but unlikely to make all of them as we can see|pg||
nt|lestergold: and the lead resolves any spade guesses|pg||
nt|roswolf: a damp squibb of a hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: a man overboard likely here|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3@H has a chance to be made though|pg||
nt|lestergold: itll go off whoever oplays it unless Selway leads a spade which I do not think is likely|pg||
nt|gnasher: 2C is a weak 2 in diamonds or an Acol Two in any suit|pg||
nt|gnasher: Hence the 2D response|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|lestergold: if Rosen plays the cards like he did in5D he may well manage it|pg||
nt|lestergold: but Gold is still at it!|pg||
nt|lestergold: and the lad is well overboard this time|pg||
nt|ritong: astute 4@c bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: well Gold specialises in capsizing te oppos |pg||
nt|ritong: his plan is clearly to ruff a @c when pard keeps his @d entry|pg||
nt|lestergold: the auction hasnt finished yet|pg||
nt|dburn: if it does, North-South are not in their best spot|pg||
nt|jaapfr: can S think of anything else than 4@D??|pg||
nt|dburn: sure he can|pg||
nt|lestergold: definitely in  burn's law contradiction at present|pg||
nt|dburn: I mean, East-West have not bid clubs|pg||
nt|ritong: mm|pg||
nt|dburn: so that 4@c ought to be a long-suit trial bid, not a singleton|pg||
nt|ritong: most of the time, 3@h indicates a long @c suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: well remember this partnership is very unpractised theyve played occasionally and of course good friends on the personal level|pg||
nt|gnasher: I think 3C showed diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: If opps promis to lead a @C or @h i want to be in 7@D|pg||
nt|sharynr: from the East side....|pg||
nt|roswolf: west has a difficult decision here|pg||
nt|gnasher: 6D by E needs CK lead to take it off|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: oh dear well another swing to Crouch here|pg||
nt|lestergold: Yes but were they ever likely to be cahse who is leading diamonds here|pg||

nt|gnasher: Declarer coild trick ducking, unblocking Q|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: Fleet having had one or two misadventures has gone fairly conservative lately and unofrtunately choosing a few wrong monets to do so|pg||
nt|lestergold: moments|pg||

nt|lestergold: no other viable play tho for Selway but to continue clubs whatever|pg||
nt|lestergold: i wold imagine that the 2h bid was forcing Kath|pg||
nt|lestergold: presumably game forcing or why did Small sign off in H with his minimum|pg||

pc|d5|nt|sharynr: staying low was good for NS|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|dburn: well, North opened 1@s because he had spades|pg||
nt|dburn: then East doubled because he was too strong for 1NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5D is an excellent game an unsound slam which makes because all finesses  guesseshappen to be right|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
nt|lestergold: Dhondy wont miss this game|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|nt|dburn: or at least, that is what he might have done, but he didn't|pg||
nt|lestergold: adn all his friends are delighhted for them and wish them very well|pg||
nt|yo_yo: @H suit very nice for declarer|pg||
nt|ady: lovely lay for Osborne|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lestergold: what !|pg||
nt|dburn: that is a nineteen count, right?|pg||
nt|lestergold: I have been struck down by commentator's curse|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is a typical example of why 4 card majors are no good -you end up playing in the wrong partscore|pg||
nt|sharynr: Always a good play to make your opponent think you just guessed the @C right|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|ady: 2 down    and very cheap|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's the second 6/5 hand  they didnt bid up|pg||
nt|lestergold: Im not asking for personal appreciation but all specs should know that we do this for the love of the game we do not get paid a penny|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: hah what a layout on this lead  all 1 are available|pg||
nt|lestergold: 13 on any lead in fact|pg||
nt|lestergold: but the slam isnt even ood enough for Roland not even the small slam|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: no maybe only 12 have i over counted|pg||
pc|d8|nt|yo_yo: what do they say about 6-5 hands?|pg||
nt|lestergold: a surprisingly timid hand evaluation here by Dhondy|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||
nt|roswolf: roland provides virtual cokes mike:)|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|nt|lestergold: Roland dosnt get paid either|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lestergold: Fleet has made a jump raise at unfavourable vulnerability albiet after an initial pass|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|yo_yo: "6-5 come alive"|pg||
nt|dburn: and an initial failure to double 1NT, noch zu|pg||
nt|lestergold: and Dhondy knows that any finessesa re working |pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Crouch asks about discards: reverse count|pg||
nt|dburn: but the bidding would have been the same if South had not had the jack of diamonds|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lestergold: so I tyhink thi swas another lost opporunity to take eithjer the vul game or a 500 penalty|pg||
nt|jaapfr: iit is a minor detail but better technically in this 1nt to play @S9 in dummy tr 1|pg||
pc|s2|nt|dburn: and then nobody would be criticising anyone for anything|pg||
pc|c8|nt|lestergold: but he gives virtual kroners and virtual danishj pastries and real tellings off!|pg||
nt|lestergold: and feree slam bidding advice|pg||
nt|roswolf: a spec says he would pay most commentators in Creosote.... they sit on so many fences .... hee hee :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: I dont tho|pg||
nt|lestergold: I got told off because I dont|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|roswolf: i am obviously in a grumpy mood today|pg||
nt|pamela: grumpy is OK  |pg||
nt|sharynr: Had south started with 1@C, would they not still end up in 1NT|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|roswolf: aaaaahhhhhhhhhh:)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: of course 13|pg||
nt|lestergold: the club 8!!|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: the lead provided the 13th|pg||
nt|ady: 13 with the club lead   and the great lay out    12 without club lead|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|sharynr: 1@C - 1@D - 1@S - 1NT|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sK|pc|d7|nt|sharynr: possibly 3@C thoug, right|pg||

nt|vugraphzyj: This is the last board in this session, next begins in approx. 45mins|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: remarkable auction at the other table - did South really overcall 2@c and not double 1@s?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: another remark about the spade overcall. it is very ingrained to overcall with 1S, but there is often a downside....when S opens a minor there are many fitting hands N can have ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that fall between the cracks of most systems. not infrequently overcalling takes N off the hook by allowing him a cuebid in your suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c6|nt|athene: that south hand does indeed look like a clear double of 1@S|pg||
nt|dburn: still, once again it would have been a good idea for a 4=3=3=3 10 count not to raise one of a major to three|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|pc|cK|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|sK|pc|s8|pg||

nt|athene: shouldn't 3@S make?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h7|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|dburn: perhaps it should, what with the diamonds as they are|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|athene: just one loser in each suit|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|athene: club goes on heart|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|h4|pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: might take a certain amount of manipulation but not too much|pg||
nt|vugraphzyj: Asks about discards - rev att|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h2|pc|s9|nt|athene: i agree though if you are going to play a spade partscore, 2@S is a better one than 3@S|pg||
nt|athene: in general|pg||
nt|athene: but it's not allowed these days if you have a 5-4 fit|pg||

nt|roswolf: ensuring that this fine event is brought to BBO vugraph. Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentators David x2, Mike, Kath and Roland for their wit and perceptive comments and ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: to our specs whose contributions keep us on our toes!|pg||
nt|dburn: and I would probably have doubled 4! with the South cards - how much more defence do I need?|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|roswolf: another near slam hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s failing on club ruff ot ruffs|pg||
nt|pamela: oh there is action in OR |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: thx all and thx fllow excellent commenttaors twas a good show|pg||
nt|roswolf: another stretch|pg||
nt|ady: I suppose  could make 13   with 3 entries to dummy  by playing J@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think Osborne and Small have been getting the better of this session on the whole|pg||
nt|lestergold: hvae played pretty well|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: but 4h n/s looks makeable|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jaapfr: even 5 theoretical losers|pg||
nt|jaapfr: in 4@S|pg||
mb|2C|mb|3C|nt|dburn: well, East-West will be in game here|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@c = 4+ hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: well slams by south have a few more chances than ones by north|pg||
nt|ady: Selway may take a view to pass this|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course N/S have had their moments too|pg||
nt|gnasher: That's a strange choice|pg||
nt|gnasher: Looks like a takeout double to me|pg||
nt|pamela: board 10  EW x in 5H making 7|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|dburn: 2@d = two hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: however hearts are ruled out|pg||
nt|lestergold: for amkeable slam purposes that is|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: the debacle with the double fo 3n mush to their credit|pg||
nt|lestergold: well Smalls may have a 6 card suit and 2 bullets outside but the pips are not exactly 100 honours partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: Bahkshi gonna take the phantom here?|pg||
nt|lestergold: yep|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: or "at most two hearts", since Crouch is perfectly capabale of having a singleton for 1NT|pg||
nt|ady: there is play for 3NT   making 5 diamonds 3 hearts  and a blck trick     nice lay with 10X@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: if south enters with a double life might have been easier for n/s|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lestergold: o0f course horrible duplication in diamodns 3 of the combined 30 points straight into the skip|pg||
nt|roswolf: artificial relays show their potential|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's a brave pass by selway|pg||
pc|s5|nt|roswolf: play resumes in55 mins at the top of the hour|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm this time Crough's upgrade and Patterson's reasonable optimism has pushed them overboard|pg||
nt|dburn: haven't yet known him to have a void, but only because he has not yet tailored the system so that he can show one|pg||
nt|ady: this could be a nice swing to Ierens     nothing much on for n/s    and a penalty here|pg||
nt|lestergold: and the cards are spitting at Small this will cost|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: its sort of insurance a disaster if 4s was making|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: 4H the only reasonable spot here|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps east should have doubled 2@D?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6N on the non diamond lead and backwards spade guess|pg||
nt|lestergold: all fantasy land stuff|pg||
nt|roswolf:  spec suggests 5D by waterlow now |pg||
nt|lestergold: well they asre on a bidding roller coaster|pg||
nt|lestergold: on as steep dive into   the......|pg||
nt|lestergold: which mire?|pg||
nt|lestergold: they had better stop ion 5H|pg||
nt|roswolf: well 5@H can be made|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes and it can also fail|pg||
nt|lestergold: ultimately it will need as good view in spades|pg||
nt|ady: Irens|pg||
nt|lestergold: the children had beet rbe sent out of the room|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sharynr: quite a swing on bd that 6@H X hand...Reissman will be very hard on himself I am sure,(and so should Waterlow)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|roswolf: south whatever he bids has confirmed the diamond lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: well yes the clubs do set up for a discard|pg||
nt|lestergold: but what about this contract???|pg||
nt|roswolf: off|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|roswolf: oh well what do i know|pg||
nt|lestergold: a friednly lead |pg||
nt|lestergold: can make now|pg||
nt|lestergold: commentator's curse is out to get us|pg||
nt|lestergold: but here it was a lost opportunity but not too shabby a decsiison in the circumstances|pg||
nt|roswolf: not a fan of the singleton trump lead|pg||
nt|gnasher: South was quite lucky that it didn;t cost|pg||
nt|sharynr: all of a sudden the match is close (sorry Andy)|pg||
nt|pamela: there is always one hand that will do the rounds after a match  and board 10 will be this one|pg||
nt|gnasher: Actually, we've just lost our lead.  Our team missed the slam on board 12|pg||
nt|sharynr: oh my|pg||
nt|pamela: oh :( sorry Andy|pg||
nt|roswolf: not good for the nerves commentating on your own team|pg||
nt|gnasher: In 3S, declarer can play a heart to the queen, setting up a discard for the club loser|pg||
pc|sT|nt|yo_yo: he might well get the @H wrong here|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|nt|roswolf: yup the minors need to be left alone|pg||
nt|roswolf: this will do as well i think|pg||
nt|gnasher: This is still OK, because North can't get in twice|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|ady: could go wrong in hearts though if north covers the jack   but understandingly will probably not|pg||
nt|lestergold: has to make now|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: In the old days experts used to talk about tricj taking security when vulnerable|pg||
nt|lestergold: now no one bothers about pips buty on a hand like this look at the difference betwen KJT(xx and KJ spanner spanner spanner spanner|pg||
nt|lestergold: all the minnows will be gobbled up by bigger minnows|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: unluck that 3 of east's points are on the scrap heap of course|pg||
nt|lestergold: he may of course be misled by Gold's jump to 3H which sounds barrage like|pg||
nt|lestergold: especially over the redouble|pg||
nt|dburn: I guess you might take the view that once you'd doubled 1@s, you should retire from the fray thereafter|pg||
nt|lestergold: and he made a take out o=double on shape and fave vulnerablity not on high cards|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y it felt that way but what can N bid else|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he could have bid 2@s|pg||
nt|lestergold: but one off for insurance is not a disaster its not a full blown phantom disaster|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont bl;ame anyone here but its not a disaster at imps|pg||
nt|lestergold: its just on this hand the wrong side of the fence but you cant balance every angel on a pin head on very hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: every hand|pg||
nt|jaapfr: specs suggest N to bid 2@S on XX but imo too strong bid or desperation:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: lets face it had Souht held Jd the bidding would have been the same and 5H would have been frigid|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pg||
nt|dburn: North won't cover the jack - that would be absurd|pg||
nt|lestergold: and unlucky that Dhondy was awake too|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so now it's home |pg||
nt|jaapfr: oh sorry did not see Davids 2@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: yum|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|nt|lestergold: maybe Bahkshi sjhould have been influended by the defensive upside of his stiff club|pg||
nt|lestergold: that to me is the strongest reason for him considering defending|pg||
nt|lestergold: vulnerable opps often bid unsound games in order to terrorise non vul opps into phantoms|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||
nt|lestergold: 500 against aip|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lestergold: zip|pg||
nt|ady: looks like -500|pg||
nt|lestergold: to borrow a transatlantic word|pg||
nt|roswolf: diamond up?|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|nt|lestergold: providing Waterlow plays on spades not hearts now|pg||
nt|lestergold: but the lead looks like from three small|pg||
nt|roswolf: nothing would suprise now|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think Watrlow will make the wrong choice here|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vugraphzsg: Thanks everyone|pg||
nt|dburn: North doesn't know that declarer has five solid diamonds, nor that he does not have @hJ10 doubleton|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|roswolf: bye all for now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: thanks everyone|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: oh|pg||

pc|d2|nt|roswolf: yes probably|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|nt|lestergold: kill poin now leave those hearts alone Topny|pg||
nt|lestergold: Tony|pg||
nt|lestergold: can you hear me|pg||
nt|roswolf: definitely|pg||
nt|lestergold: you are risking a re-commentator curse as it were|pg||
nt|roswolf: when he studies the replay|pg||
nt|lestergold: he may switrch back to spades|pg||
nt|roswolf: MAY/|pg||
nt|lestergold: and you get the egg on face|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is a coin flip|pg||
nt|lestergold: odds with the spades 6 missing compared to 5 hearts |pg||
nt|lestergold: and club break heavily suggests the short hearts with west|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: not that S was even essentially unsound its only off because of the club ruffs|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d8|pc|s4|pg||

mb|p|mb|4D!|nt|brolucius: With East holding 0 pints in diamonds opposite West's void, a high-level contract is possible.|pg||

nt|cindy:  nothing in short suit|pg||
pc|d5|nt|brolucius: Excellent bidding. Well done.|pg||
nt|athene: the problem with showing a void OR a stiff ace is that if partner then uses blackwood, he doesn't know what you have|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||
nt|cindy:  not the stiff A that is a problem   its the void that is the problem|pg||

nt|pamela: when you see all four hands  hard to see how it would go down.. |pg||
nt|gnasher: Oh no, not another slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|lestergold: I think Waterlow played that on tilt personally|pg||
mb|p|nt|pamela: yessss|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed and may be difficult to bid now|pg||
nt|sharynr: hard to bid this one on limited high cards|pg||
mb|2C|nt|lestergold: so we have a pretty british commentating team for a very british event playing a uniquely british version of acol N/S weak nt and 4 card majors|pg||
nt|lestergold: he is given greek gift and sends it back|pg||

nt|sharynr: magically east having nothing in diamonds|pg||
nt|gnasher: West wil splinter|pg||
nt|roswolf: will they diagnose the perfect fit|pg||
nt|gnasher: And East will like his prime values outside diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: hi roland|pg||
nt|lestergold: liking driving on the left we have to be different most of out non native specs will be bemused by this quaint british bidding style|pg||

mb|4D|nt|lestergold: well only two apparent losers in 5D but maybe too much work to do|pg||

nt|gnasher: I expect them to bid this one|pg||
nt|gnasher: Surely there's no stopping East now|pg||
nt|sharynr: me too, (now)|pg||
nt|roswolf: might bid the grand as well?|pg||
nt|gnasher: That would be nice|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|lestergold: in 3rd position Richard is happy to open a weak 2 even possesing 4 in the other major|pg||
nt|lestergold: i am given to understand that th e late denis spooner used to write waterlow articles in btween the avengers series|pg||
nt|dburn: hard to play this in diamonds at all|pg||
nt|lestergold: will Bahkshi reverse into diamonds now?|pg||
nt|lestergold: show his shape and extra strength?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it does seem a long 2 hours|pg||
nt|ady: this should cause no problem   even on a heart lead as east has no entry |pg||
mb|p|mb|r|nt|lestergold: yes i agree|pg||

nt|jaapfr: due to my Spanish wifi (not wife:)|pg||
nt|dburn: if he knew that 2@d was natural, he might already have passed it|pg||

nt|dburn: 2@h mysterious|pg||
nt|lestergold: why 2h here by Gold|pg||
nt|lestergold: snap David|pg||
nt|lestergold: bery odd|pg||
nt|jaapfr: what wrong with 3@D?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 9 tricks but awkward to take|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: ah yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed silly double by north imo|pg||
nt|sharynr: 5@C- 6@C?|pg||
mb|5C|nt|lestergold: Peter Crouch perhaps siesly keeping quiet|pg||
nt|lestergold: wisely|pg||
nt|jaapfr: by N|pg||
nt|dburn: well, you can understand it as a kind of game try, but...|pg||
nt|lestergold: well wavelengthhere has not been too good|pg||
nt|pamela: Howard team could do with this swing.. if they get there|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@C WOULD BE 1 WAY OF PROCEEDING|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|nt|yo_yo: yes I suppose in 3rd position anything is allowed|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: yes it is good to see Richard back playing high level bridge again|pg||
nt|roswolf: nice |pg||
mb|6H|nt|lestergold: better 'sign off' in 3D and hope that its passed out|pg||
nt|lestergold: but he has counted his 8 points and is reluctant to abandon game possibilities|pg||
nt|jaapfr: anyway 2NT unbeatable|pg||
nt|lestergold: Bakhshi knows that his freverse on a misfiitng 16 has not gone too well|pg||
nt|jaapfr: assuming after X he finds @CJ:)|pg||
nt|dburn: what "reverse"?|pg||
nt|pamela: I hear you!|pg||
nt|sharynr: surely a try for 7|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: but 2N is in fact infrangible|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well i wouldnt call Waterlow a palooka more of an honest expert as opposed to awily one|pg||
nt|lestergold: diamonds behave very well|pg||
nt|gnasher: W needed Kxx AKxx xxx Kxx|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: yup an unlucky expert perhaps!?|pg||
nt|roswolf: gsf try east should accept|pg||
nt|gnasher: But even then grand isn't certain|pg||
nt|sharynr: might have tried the intra-finesse in clubs and gone down in 7|pg||
nt|gnasher: East hasn't been invited to bid a grand|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lestergold: well 2D not technically a reverse I know but it would tend to imply reversing values in this sequence|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d7|nt|lestergold: its actuially 2 and a half hours Kath thats maybe why!!|pg||
nt|ady: how many more hands?|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|lestergold: Richard a very distinguiehes senior figure in British bridge selectoe non playing captain u name it and a fine player in his own right|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 3 more|pg||
nt|ady: ok     thx|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|sharynr: i think east made a grand slam try already with 6@C, didnt he?|pg||
nt|gnasher: Yes,  But He wasn't in control - that was just bid on the way to 6H|pg||
nt|roswolf: no because @H were agreed - i am used to a stayman where 2@H shows spades!|pg||
nt|gnasher: W knew that his man couldn't have Kxx AKxx xxx KQx, because1NT was 12-14|pg||
pc|h6|nt|yo_yo: Heather dhondy one of our best English lady players, maybe the best ?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sharynr: but he could have Kx in @C|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jaapfr: 4@D 3@C 1@H or 5 losers indeed always made|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||
nt|lestergold: i know Erichsen is often an extremely slow player competing perhaps with Robson for the title|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|c7|pc|d2|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|athene: and north will double it...difficult to say where the music will stop|pg||
mb|d|mb|2C!|an|clubs or two suits without clubs|nt|athene: if east runs to clubs, the question is whether south should make a t/o double |pg||
mb|d!|an|t/o|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Many thanks to Ant, our operator, for the explanations.|pg||
nt|athene: some people don't like to double here with a singleton because when partner leaves it in with four, it doesn't work so well|pg||
nt|athene: but south really doesn't have any other sensible action|pg||
nt|cindy:  maybe but thats pushing it a little  dont you think ?|pg||
nt|cindy:  pass is sensible|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cindy:  you dont even know if E has clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy:  partner could be doubling on long clubs|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: north decides his club texture isn't good enough so goes for the vulnerable game|pg||
nt|brolucius: North is obviously expecting more than a 4-count for the double.|pg||
nt|cindy:  well  yeah|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|nt|brolucius: It would be fine to double 2@C for t/o in the pass-out seat (on South's values), but here it is better to play that a pass is forcing and you pass initially on the 4-count.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|d4|pc|d8|pg||
nt|athene: this comes home courtesy of @HJ dropping and 3-3 diamonds|pg||

pc|d6|nt|athene: not any more, though|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c4|pc|cT|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c2|nt|athene: but he didn't know the @HJ was dropping|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: this is why it can be better just to "take the money" (i.e. the penalty) - you might lose a bit when you get only 500 against your game, but you gain big when your game isn't ...|pg||
nt|athene: making and you still gain 300|pg||
pc|h8|nt|brolucius: It depends on whether your defending is better than your declarer play.|pg||

nt|lestergold: maybe he was a palokka in the old days of the harrow bridge club where we all used to play when we wore short trousers|pg||
nt|sharynr: mow we have comparisons|pg||
nt|sharynr: 3NT seems to be a bit of an overbid?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: E/Walso a strong player with a good record of high level success|pg||

nt|sharynr: surely south and west have nothing to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: now we will see a few relays from e/w. Peter Crouch is one for all theory gadgets|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Heather's bio on:  http://www.ebu.co.uk/general/biographies/players/heatherdhondy.htm|pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: well we ae back in the infrangible 3n department|pg||
nt|dburn: "frequent upgrading", as Meckwell's convention card says|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: this is a coffee break hand|pg||
nt|sharynr: a 2-way double ? :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: south will move|pg||
nt|sharynr: with 3@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well defence has the points and the tempo so i dont see any honey here for  Bahkshi needs to hold it to one off to avoid a loss|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: no alert for 2@H?|pg||
nt|lestergold: Heather has a good reputation not only in the ladies game but also in the Open Game|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: yes 2@H alert|pg||
nt|ady: ok|pg||
nt|roswolf: everything is likely alertable until the final bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: incroyable|pg||
nt|pamela: well only 180 on a bad day|pg||
nt|pamela: or a good day|pg||
pc|hT|nt|roswolf: 180 more like 380|pg||
nt|sharynr: maybe a @H start will be good, tapping declarer and promoting a trump for North perhaps|pg||
pc|hA|nt|yo_yo: Peter Crouch a great theorist |pg||
nt|roswolf: ok perhaps only making|pg||
pc|h8|nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|roswolf: finis|pg||
nt|lestergold: well today we will see some theory put into practice|pg||
nt|yo_yo: you have to have a super duper brain to keep up with his bidding techniques|pg||
nt|roswolf: a good memory is essential too!|pg||
nt|lestergold: a push if CT led|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm the 4@S -1 hand was made in the other room - a @D was led!|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i see 7 tricks................................................. for defense:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: they win race|pg||
nt|lestergold: er i think Mr. Bahkshi will have some explaining to do about the double he found in the open oom against 4S|pg||
nt|yo_yo: crikey yes|pg||
nt|ady: Irens on a loser here    1190  in OR|pg||
nt|lestergold: his opartner opened the bidding and he had one apparently viable trick in the ace of diamonds which of course happens to be as non viable asthe Qs he tipped the opps off about|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lestergold: only ten tricks here so one pesky imp to Hassett|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: we cant all share one of those with you Kath|pg||
pc|s2|nt|yo_yo: :)  i wish!|pg||
nt|lestergold: my brain is dooper but im not sure about the super|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|roswolf: lol|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's a good one :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: does this qualify for a roland slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes if it makes!|pg||
nt|lestergold: only just it needs a 3/2 club break and 2 finesse which is above 12.85%|pg||
nt|lestergold: Roland is very scientific about these matters Geoof|pg||
pc|dK|nt|yo_yo: I can never understand why Crouch hasnt made it into the international field more |pg||
nt|lestergold: the more i look at the open room auction the more bewildered i am -Gold made one opening bid at favourable vul and N/S powerd to game and the double was made with that nearly ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: useless collection sitting under the spade suit|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: seems an easy 11 tricks with clubs 3-2  and K@D  on side   can force 2 entries in the clubs for heart and diamond finesses|pg||
nt|yo_yo: some have a rule that when partner opens, opps bid game , I have an ace, then X|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphzsg: Q asks for att|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade plays by Rosen hacve made it easy in that department|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|pc|d4|nt|lestergold: now a heart swirch is needed to ensure defeat|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|dT|pc|d6|nt|lestergold: not one that I follow|pg||

pc|hK|pc|c2|nt|jaapfr: if rosen can not show that:)..........................|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lestergold: Maybe has not had a long enough run with the right partner - |pg||
nt|roswolf: 20 board sets will need stamina|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: especially for me!|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|nt|lestergold: well that qwasnt too difficult Rosen discarded the suit he didnt want played|pg||
pc|sT|nt|yo_yo: yes Ant  it's a lot of concentration  |pg||
nt|lestergold: British birdge is beset with very talenmted payers who are extremely unlucky in buiding and sustaining effective partnerships|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|pamela: nothing  to be done now |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: oh i thought Wasterlow would flamboyantly discard SK here|pg||
nt|lestergold: downside adds up when oppos send those doubles back|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: so a simple push|pg||

nt|brolucius: South has the one 5-5 shape where opinions differ as to the best opening bid.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|dburn: well, in that respect 3NT was a good save against 2@c doubled, which was cold|pg||
nt|cindy:  yes   used to be more people opened 1C but think its changing a little|pg||
mb|3C|mb|4H|nt|Walddk3: I think it's wrong to pass 1@S at these colours|pg||
nt|brolucius: Some open 1@C when they are strong enough to expect to be able to rebid the spades. |pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|cindy:  i totally agree, Roland|pg||
nt|cindy:  think initially it was to be able to show both suits below the 3 level|pg||
nt|brolucius: Even though the E/W game was bid vulnerable, there is no reason to play a 'forcing pass' here, I would say. But opinion may differ.|pg||
nt|cindy:  but wasnt that when most people didnt play 2/1  (talking usa here)|pg||
nt|athene: most people play that just bidding and raising a suit never sets up a forcing pass|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|athene: west had to do something other than 4@H if she wanted to set up a forcing pass|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Good point.|pg||
nt|vugraphzyj: Brunner writes that she is not sure if pass was forcing|pg||

nt|roswolf: we have a strange attitude to sponsors generally|pg||
nt|lestergold: and as we can se the double in open oom simply helped the overtricks|pg||
nt|gnasher: That takes the difference back to IMPs overall|pg||
nt|gnasher: to 4 IMPs |pg||

nt|roswolf: well there was excitement in the other room|pg||
nt|lestergold: well could be duplicated hee|pg||
nt|dburn: odd, that - why would you raise 3@h to 4@h in the auction at the other table?|pg||
nt|ady: 6@H   on spade guess|pg||
nt|sharynr: 5@H undoubled, turned out to be a good save against 5@S|pg||
mb|2S|nt|roswolf: an acol opening from south - 1NT for the rest of us |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: unlikely to identify this perfecto fit|pg||
nt|pamela: 4 Sp now with H not even mentioned at this table|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|lestergold: hm Irense powered their way to 4h quite difficult to stayout of 4h hereon an uniterrupted auction|pg||
nt|ady: 4NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: no way can richard move opposit Heather's epected ore emptive raise|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes 3@S will be pre-emptive|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is this premier league part of the trials this year?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|jaapfr: this logic 2@D bid does help opps|pg||
nt|lestergold: well at this vulnerbaility Gold will always bid with this type of hand|pg||
nt|jaapfr: me too|pg||
nt|lestergold: the downside of not ensuring a dim lead against 3N is too compelling|pg||
nt|sharynr: North passed 1@S opening in OR|pg||
nt|sharynr: so East had a chance to balance|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lestergold: of course the game does require diamonds to behave as well as no nasty breaks so its below 50% which is not good odds for a non vulnerable game|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Fleet looking at convention card|pg||
nt|roswolf: but with a few less guarantees - especially for the europeans|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: now EW's system file|pg||
nt|lestergold: no i think Hacjkett's decsion here a lot soundr than north's in the open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: norths hand very suitable   both queens pulling weight|pg||
nt|lestergold: sadly dimaonds dont behave and it costs 500 so not taht great a save but its still a profit|pg||
nt|lestergold: has to play it carefully|pg||
nt|lestergold: not to lose 800|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry im blind its only 300 of course not vul im gettinmg tired even better praise for Hackett|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lestergold: open oom decision very poor|pg||

pc|s3|nt|pamela: nothing to the play |pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|sharynr: good lead, only one to hold it to 4, i think|pg||
pc|s5|nt|roswolf: heather understandably did think her hand was a GOOD raise|pg||
nt|lestergold: i prefer playing a heart to the ten here|pg||
nt|lestergold: as it happens here it has only cost a measly imp|pg||
nt|ady: might get out for down 1|pg||
nt|lestergold: that is also possible|pg||
nt|ady: if defense plays 2 rounds of spades   can get an elimination and ace and another club|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like 2 club losers to me unless defnce does something silly|pg||

pc|sT|nt|roswolf: so do i|pg||

nt|jaapfr: 2@D does cost here 6 imps|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|gnasher: Waterlow made a game try, then bid S when his partner signed off.  Does that mean he was making a slam try?|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d4|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course eaqst cannot take advantage of what seems to have been a frare card play error by Hackett|pg||

pc|s4|nt|yo_yo: declarer might still get the @C wrong  but after the long pause, prob  not|pg||
pc|s6|nt|yo_yo: it's not quite a preemptive raise  nor good enough for a limit raise, one of those annoying hands|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think that 3S is a perfecly normal raise over 2H she simply cannot make an unassuming cue bid raise with taht colelction|pg||
nt|lestergold: that  was  hard one for erichsen|pg||
nt|lestergold: a toss up id say|pg||
pc|s2|nt|yo_yo: I dont know much about Patterson   does anyone else?|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|sharynr: i would assume it was a slam try|pg||
nt|gnasher: Maybe he just changed his mind|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lestergold: thats unfortunate but this is why these trials involv playing enuf boards to uiron out the luck lement|pg||
nt|jaapfr: see other room bidding which looks strictly normal to me|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jaapfr: although i bid 2@D too|pg||
nt|lestergold: interesting about the price one pays for tanking|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d5|pg||
nt|ady: if erichsen had switch to a low spade   Selaway needs to win and play a low club to the 9 in South hand to get 2 down    a spade continuation would have resulted also in down 1|pg||

nt|athene: 3@C reverse Bergen, i suppose|pg||
mb|3D|an|trial bid|mb|p|nt|athene: or some variant thereof|pg||
mb|3H|an|trial bid|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|brolucius: South is uncertain whether to bid game and asks for further assistance. (Blame-passing game try).|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cindy:  haha|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: in that case, 3@H must have been probing for 3nt|pg||
nt|cindy:  N could hardly have more|pg||
nt|brolucius: He could have better shape, I suppose.|pg||
nt|athene: or maybe north thought that south might have a very strong hand for 3@D and was bidding 3@H as an advance cue|pg||
nt|cindy:  S hand is the suspect one    |pg||
nt|brolucius: Seems that South overbid by not signing off. His hand was not very special. (Eight losers).|pg||
nt|athene: a good illustration here of just how bad 4333 hands are - a loser in each suit and nowhere to put them|pg||
nt|athene: you have to play for some sort of elimination i suppose? try to draw trumps and strip the clubs and then cash the red ace-kings and exit, hoping for a ruff-sluff|pg||
nt|brolucius: South has plenty of losers, too. @CK-Q is not good value for five points. Why should he expect to make game facing a passed hand? |pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: yes, south was aggressive |pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|cindy:  their methods are the real culprit|pg||
nt|cindy:  Drury would have given them more room to determine how high|pg||
nt|brolucius: 'Aggressive' is the expert term for someone who has overbid. It sounds very commendable when phrased in that way.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|pc|d7|pc|dA|pg||
nt|athene: obviously, south's hand will make game facing a miracle dummy (short hearts) but this isn't happening very often|pg||
nt|athene: i think you can sign off over 3@C; if partner doesn't force to game facing a 4th chair 1@S, you won't make it|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||

nt|cindy:  what do we think of 3@h    should he just bid 3@s over 3@d ?|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h4|nt|dburn: no - he should have passed over 2@s, which is what North should have bid|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|brolucius: No, the North hand was OK for his bidding. It was South who said too much on an 8-loser hand.|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s9|pc|s6|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|cindy:  im talking about N's 3@s bid|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c2|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|cindy:  3@h bid|pg||
pc|c9|mc|9|nt|cindy:  i think it is far too good for 2@s|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@H was fine, as I see it. He expected South to hold more for his game-try. 3@H meant: 'You're not sure? Neither am I!' |pg||

nt|roswolf: whose contributions keep us on our toes!|pg||
nt|sharynr: last board coming up|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: ah, I see. If you think East's raise to 4@h is "normal", all I can say is that you and I have differing views of the game.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 6S is enormlous here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: last one  |pg||
nt|sharynr: ty Geoffrey, glad you came in time to give us that closing :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: yes won the Gold Cup and regular high finisher in national events - based in Kent|pg||
nt|lestergold: they need to bid it to retain thier nice lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: another transfer opposite 1@C opener|pg||
nt|roswolf: next set scheduled to start in 45 mins approx|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: part score hand    2@S  for e/w  abouth the limit|pg||
nt|roswolf: nice auction by n/s in the other room|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but not all of us go to 7@H here:)|pg||
nt|ady: thx all  some interesting hands    thx specs|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lestergold: it will be hard here for Peter to not bid too many spades at some point|pg||
nt|pamela: his mood has mproved though  not grumpy any more |pg||
mb|2C|nt|lestergold: one wasted K and duplication in the heart suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: or then lead will shift to Irens|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lestergold: 5C the best spot of course but 3N is infrangible as cards lie|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that probably shows 3@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 6@S   |pg||
mb|4S|nt|yo_yo: splinter by East|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4C wont excite Osborne|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: mind you thats the advanatge of a strong club system|pg||
nt|lestergold: it can stop here|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps peter's system is quite good at staying low but.....|pg||
nt|lestergold: and it needs to!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: lets see|pg||
nt|ady: yes many might get overboard here with that great spade suit     can be thatg those opening 1@S  may be better placed   might be passed out|pg||
nt|lestergold: well its not normal Davuid but its a tempter when your q of hearts is a worker its often goijng to be enif tomake a vul game|pg||
nt|lestergold: Small has enuf for anmother try|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Small wont stop|pg||
nt|lestergold: its all on whether Osborne acceps the next try|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he has a strong 2 opener and partner opens the bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: south might bid this game too|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: not many pass these days with a 5 count though|pg||
nt|lestergold: obsioly those points randomly scattered and itys a pass|pg||
nt|roswolf: he did|pg||
nt|gnasher: Both NS pairs seem to have taken a rosy view of their hands|pg||
nt|sharynr: does everyone want to be in game opposite a passed hand with 5 HCP in opps suit?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: a lot of players would wheel out 4S to begin with|pg||
nt|lestergold: well stopped!!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well done EW|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah well|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5H would be my choice that should get them there qith good spades and the diamond bullet|pg||
nt|pamela: only if it makes!|pg||
nt|gnasher: 4S seems a poor bid with those club honours|pg||
nt|roswolf: no but the lure of a vul game is irrestistable|pg||
pc|dK|nt|yo_yo: disappointing after a good set for the Small team|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear what an excitement the lead shifts tio Irens on the last hand|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: and unlucky that the 3H jump is about minimum for the bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: surprising Small is a forward bidder this has surprised me very much|pg||
nt|ady: come back for Irens     small lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: yep what a turnaround at the elevnth hour|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a lot of good bridge mixed wit h afair number of errors in this session|pg||
nt|lestergold: hope the specs enjoyed the show thx very much to the excellent fellow commentators|pg||
nt|ady: if 1@S by Osborne limite the hand to a minimum  maybe he could have helped with 4@D  over 4@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: and operator|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|ady: bye|pg||
nt|lestergold: bye for now|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: forced spade finesse 9 tricks|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|lestergold: no chance here that the defence would fail to cash their 5 tops|pg||
nt|lestergold: well fortunatley for Irons teame/w has also gone overboard here notin to quite as deepwaters|pg||
nt|jaapfr: many would bid 1@S with KJxxx x  xxxx  xxx then Jxxxx  QX  xxx  KTx is a powerhouse! |pg||
nt|lestergold: of course west having the full monty in his second suit a bit wasted and a lousy holding in his first suit|pg||
nt|dburn: well, there were some bids between 3NT and 6@h|pg||
nt|lestergold: K think 6H was an overbid myself how they reached 7 in open is beyond comprehension|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 6NT had much better chances|pg||
nt|dburn: well, 6@h is not down yet, I guess|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed Mr.jone casnt be worried about the black suits on the bidding and his trump suit is dire|pg||
nt|lestergold: well south would be misere to jump in here|pg||
nt|jaapfr: not if @C return:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: thats true |pg||
nt|lestergold: well if he jumps i  he will so i think we can say this is going down|pg||

nt|lestergold: h ha dbetter banish that thought form his head pretty quickly|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is just summoning up the courage|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sharynr: but should have returned it if he did|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps |pg||

nt|lestergold: I must admit ive seen a lot of card play errors by Waterlow over the years|pg||
