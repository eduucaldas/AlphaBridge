nt|jcwla: Hi all and welcome to the Closed Room for the 8-board Segment 5 of this Semifinal of the Vinoble Cup.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi all, and welcome to the last 8-board segment of this semifinal.|pg||
nt|vugraphzyc: hi guys :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyc: and girls|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: Hi Rashed |pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @S for e/w |pg||
nt|sybarra: most likely |pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello again! Let us hope for interesting boards. 18 IMPs are not so much|pg||
mb|2D|nt|jcwla: 4@S here N/S -- only issue avoiding slam.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hi Jordan!|pg||
nt|jcwla: X|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 5@D would not be bad contract for NS|pg||
nt|sybarra: and how many @D's does bid now to get there?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: hello again!|pg||
pc|cK|nt|cuttysark: The alert of 2@S seems a little strange|pg||
nt|vugraphzyc: 2@S 7+ 11- thats why the alert|pg||
nt|sybarra: if playing 2/1,  no need to go jumping around |pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @C was already the game force |pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi, Ralf.  Great to be with you again.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Rehi, Ralf!|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|nt|sybarra: not sure I like the 2 @S bid,   for me it promises 4 @S |pg||
nt|sybarra: its style,  but I dont raise with 3 spades |pg||
nt|sybarra: Iverson had a 27-0 set on the last set |pg||
nt|rnmalik: true not me either. I would rather bid 3@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: but they may not be playing 2/1, and hopefully this is forcing?  |pg||
nt|ralfwil: Thanks, I have the same feeling|pg||
nt|jcwla: Some play that this second-round jump to game shows a "picture bid": no ace, king, singleton, void in clubs or diamonds (having bid hearts and spades).|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|jcwla: Ralf, I would double here as North, how about you?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|cuttysark: Some difficulty in reaching dummy for the club finesse|pg||
nt|sybarra: I can bid 1 nt with N hand over 1 sp |pg||
pc|cA|nt|jcwla: Others might not use it in this auction.  When it does come up, however, it's very useful.  Allows opener with a good hand but a missing control to stop on a dime.|pg||
pc|c9|nt|cuttysark: (Thank you for the information, Thorvald)|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|sybarra: chased them into better spot |pg||
nt|rnmalik: with 5@D prefer 2 or 3 @Ds|pg||
nt|sybarra: my rebid of a minor suggests a 6 card suit |pg||
nt|sybarra: so doubt I would rebid that suit |pg||
nt|sybarra: but |pg||
nt|rnmalik: The declarer has to play the K@S to make the hand-DBL by W of 4@S showed shortness|pg||
nt|sybarra: wtih the 2 hts bid in the middle,  (which I was not seeing)  I rebid 3 @D |pg||
nt|ralfwil: hi Jordan |pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yes|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|rnmalik: interesting hand to play|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Welcome back everybody|pg||
nt|cuttysark: looks as if EW play transfer responses to 1@C|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome back Liz and Hans|pg||
nt|Walddk5: and to Thorvald, our operator|pg||
nt|haans: ty|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with that lead N has to take 3 rounds of @h|pg||
pc|c3|nt|cuttysark: He has to cash @DA, then play @SA and another to endplay West - not sure even that is enough|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good morning everyone and welcome to headquarters of the Danish Bridge Federation for the annual VINOBLE Cup. Semi-finals, six segments of eight boards|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good morning Liz and Thorvald|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @H's cue |pg||
nt|sybarra: and we are over board |pg||
pc|d5|pc|cT|pc|c8|pg||
nt|vugraphzyc: 3 nt unserious|pg||
pc|h8|nt|cuttysark: Nice to hear from you Roland - have you visited all the other rooms?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Indeed I have|pg||
nt|sybarra: a bit unlucky.....spade break bad, and off, and k of clubs off |pg||
nt|sybarra: well if it was "unserious"  would the rebid be 4 @S? |pg||
nt|vugraphzyc: 4@s = no interest in slam|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure E should be interested really....but then really just needs good spade coveer cards by pard |pg||
nt|sybarra: not so out of the question given the bidding |pg||
nt|sybarra: we have seen in previous sets, East take some time playing a hand |pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|cuttysark: Tried to reach dummy with @SJ - no luck|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|dA|pg||

nt|haans: i see 4@H by EW?|pg||
nt|sybarra: W may regret that X |pg||
nt|rnmalik: positively|pg||
nt|sybarra: easy to see how both tables got overboard on an unlucky hand  |pg||

nt|jcwla: Well done to stay nice and low.  1@D o/c not a thing of beauty.|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
nt|sybarra: Iverson in second set came from behind  with a 27-0 set   to bring it close |pg||
pc|s2|nt|gambit: and guess what?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 9 tricks. |pg||
pc|s7|nt|cuttysark: Combined 25 count, but does not look as if this will play very well either|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Too many losers for this contract, over board I think|pg||
nt|cuttysark: He will go after diamonds, but they do not lie well from his point of view|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Strong indicaion that East does not have a spade to lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: and "on the way" cue bid  |pg||
nt|rnmalik: Slam interest|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|s9|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not to worry - he has a club guess, sems to have gone wrong|pg||
nt|sybarra: and sorry I know nothing about the n/s pair |pg||
pc|h5|nt|cuttysark: Important for East to cover here - always cover a doubleton honour when you also have a doubleton|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|rnmalik: true|pg||
nt|cuttysark: He may cross to dummy now to finesse @D9, hoping for Q10x in East|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|c5|nt|cuttysark: West worried about conceding an unnecessary trick - the club switch is safe but he does not know that|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Happens to the best of us, Thorwald|pg||
nt|sybarra: "we should bid these slams"   not sure that is clear |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Here's Rodal's honorary coffee break board.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|cuttysark: The Open Room started with boards 7&8, so no comparisons for a while|pg||
nt|cuttysark: East-West's turn for some cards - and their game is going to make|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@H EW looks alright but can they bid it|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Bidding test for NS - can they reach 7@D?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Slam for NS but what you call it Roland slam:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes think it is for Roland |pg||
nt|daman: EW should end up in a passive 2@S or 1NT|pg||
nt|gambit: wel all, exciting hands and close match that probably just got closer (no result yet from open room) |pg||
nt|jcwla: Given how little room a 1@D overcall takes up, I think it should either be a better hand or better suit than this.  However, will catch pd with a good @D holding.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|haans: i say that opps bidding make it easier|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: bd 9 (hand before)  e/w had many more points but bad breaks they went down |pg||
mb|3N|nt|sybarra: may try junk stayman here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: you mean a flat and simple  4@s?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: After D from P i prefer to show my @s even if I have a 7-card @c suit, But perhaps next round...|pg||
nt|gambit: West won't be able to pass fast enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: ?????|pg||
pc|h9|nt|rnmalik: Q@H makes it possible for 3NT also|pg||
nt|haans: eureka|pg||

nt|rnmalik: why not 3 @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder |pg||
nt|sybarra: 3  is better than 4 |pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree|pg||
nt|ralfwil:  now one more trick in 3nt|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sybarra: making 6 now |pg||
pc|h7|nt|jcwla: North is the only one who cannot be faulted here.  South needed to show the @S's -- 2@C should deny four @S's.  Meanwhile, East might have put the pressure on right away, but ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: better late than pregnant.|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|cuttysark: good hand for Blackwood|pg||
nt|vugraphzyc: 5@S and often 4@H|pg||
pc|s3|nt|cuttysark: Yes - @SK in dummy means declarer can hold up, may well play hearts from the top since he does not care if North gets on lead|pg||

nt|daman: what if south held K109xx  Kx  Q9   K109x   would it be a good contract?  |pg||
nt|daman: by Roland's standards it would because it might be a shade above 12%|pg||
pc|d6|nt|rnmalik: a @S and a @H|pg||
nt|daman: but the luck of the @H position and the 2-2 @C break will bring it home|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jcwla: In the Open Room, Iversen did sniff at slam on 1 and got to 5@S down one.  11 IMPs to Blakset.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|pg||
pc|h6|mc|11|nt|cuttysark: Blakset pick up 5 imps on board 2 for going just 2 down in 3NT - they were -4 in the Open Room|pg||

nt|jcwla: South had a tough decision with a hand that was worth one bid, made a reasonable choice.|pg||
mb|1D|mb|2C|mb|2H|nt|granguru: EW can make 4@S depending on the @C guess|pg||
nt|sybarra: that should be a reachable slam at the other table also |pg||
mb|3C|nt|cuttysark: Might not need it - a club goes on the 4th heart|pg||

nt|daman: with a magical view in trumps he might bring this home|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sybarra: S needs the rabbi.....|pg||
nt|sybarra: rabbi rule:  play ace when K is singleton offside |pg||
nt|jcwla: It's much harder to bid over 2@C than over 1@D with so many hands.  That's why Sabine Auken in "I Love This Game" exhorts readers to find reasons to overcall 2@C over 1@D.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|cuttysark: A Mixed Raise - 4 card support, scattered values - but this looks a little strong so perhaps it means something else|pg||
nt|granguru: right Liz..thanks..5 am here :)|pg||
nt|haans: 1@S must be forcing?|pg||
nt|gambit: game try if hearts is the suit |pg||
nt|ralfwil: four boards to go and 2 not counted. There still is a chance for Iversen|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra: not an easy hand to bid |pg||
nt|jcwla: Not to mention another 8-board segment.|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not necessarily  -  partner only passes if very weak|pg||
nt|sybarra: 7 nt also makes |pg||
nt|sybarra: with ak of @C |pg||
nt|rnmalik: the key is the play of AK@C|pg||
nt|daman: or maybe not magical after all    he might just attenpt a 2-2 split and hope the @Cs come home|pg||
pc|hA|nt|daman: great switch|pg||

pc|h4|nt|jcwla: A little birdie told me 7 and 8 were action boards, so don't go anywhere.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|granguru: The lead helps a lot for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 3NT by South would be in some peril on a heart lead, but West cannot lead hearts to advantage - the suit gets blocked|pg||

mb|p|nt|cuttysark: He should win ace and play a low diamond?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzyc: Killing lead|pg||
nt|dburn: well, yes, but...|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes  and thx to  Bjorn our operator   Terrific job! |pg||
nt|sybarra: so 5 nt?  |pg||
nt|sybarra: not my choice|pg||
nt|daman: now there's a bid that wouldn't be on everybody's radar|pg||
nt|sybarra: not even sure what it means |pg||
nt|gambit: 4c was pushy |pg||
nt|ralfwil: very optimistic from N in my opinion|pg||
nt|gambit: now S thinking about 4S |pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Moller will wait a long time before partner leads a spade through|pg||
nt|jcwla: 2@S/E making 5 gained 3 for Iversen on 5 as against 3@D/E making in the OR.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|granguru: Or a @H finesse to throw the @S|pg||
pc|s5|nt|dburn: ...it's going to be hard for the defence to work out just how good it is|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|daman: they are about to put another 11 IMPs in their pockets|pg||
nt|sybarra: "houston we are arrived"  (lets not talk about the journey) |pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|cuttysark: No hurry for the heart finesse - needs to get some diamond ruffs in dummy|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|dburn: still, I guess North might shift to a diamond anyway|pg||
pc|dA|nt|cuttysark: Aha - distributional information! Now heart finesse, take pitch, diamond up |pg||
pc|d7|nt|haans: the sputnik double tends to tell = 20-20 between us|pg||
nt|sybarra: S likely to get stuffed in I think |pg||
nt|sybarra: might be some relief in seeing the spade void |pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|h2|nt|sybarra: I do not see a way to make it now |pg||
nt|rnmalik: -1|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good defence|pg||
nt|dburn: there isn't one, but East is more relcutant than we are to come to that conslusion|pg||
nt|sybarra: as spec points out, ONLY CHANCE J109@c|pg||
nt|dburn: well, or a heart-club squeeze|pg||
nt|rnmalik: we know it is not there|pg||
nt|dburn: which would work if South had @hQ and any four clubs|pg||
nt|rnmalik: the key cards in different hands. Lets convince E:)|pg||
nt|dburn: I guess East is weighing up the chance of the squeeze against the chance that North has @hQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: or we are losing connection |pg||
nt|vugraphzyc: ur not|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure, but South's lead might have been from 42 doubleton - I don't know if the North-South pair lead low from two small|pg||
nt|dburn: so declarer has a genuine problem, and it is not surprising that he is taking his time|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|d4|nt|daman: this hand is ovah|pg||
pc|dT|nt|dburn: well, he made his decision - I confess, I would have gone the other way, and gone down just the same|pg||
nt|daman: as they say in Boston|pg||
nt|sybarra: wd n/s |pg||
nt|daman: ciao everyone|pg||
nt|sybarra: back after a short break |pg||
nt|vugraphzyc: bye|pg||
nt|sybarra: cu all  |pg||
pc|s6|nt|sybarra: back in about 15 min  |pg||
nt|sybarra: (I think) |pg||
nt|rnmalik: Thanks all and C......................U.|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|h5|nt|cuttysark: East should have ducked to let West ruff and play another trump|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|hK|pg||
nt|granguru: Erick Eide is a World Master ranked 420 in the WBF ranking|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|c3|nt|ralfwil: denna hade en 5-kortsfärg och K10xx i @c så den var väl inte så dålig..... Kolla gärna i en budtävling|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, as we reach the end, a big thank you to Roland, Ralf, to our excellent VG operator and to all specs.  Congrats to the winning teams and good luck in the finals.|pg||
mc|9|nt|cuttysark: Somebody had to leads spades :)|pg||
