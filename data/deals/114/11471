mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|jallerton: 3NT was played by W = presumably the @s lead was avoided |pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w will do well to bid 3nt here|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|ady: 3NT in CR  fortunate to make|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: and maybe here as well|pg||
nt|jallerton: @cA is a big card, so West is persuaded to bid on over 3@c|pg||

nt|ady: almost impossible|pg||
pc|c4|mc|9|nt|roswolf: 1 imp to the trailing team|pg||
nt|jallerton: Might as well run the @c here (rather than claim).  defence may discard enough @s to make knocking out @dk safe|pg||

pc|cT|pc|c5|pc|c7|pc|cA|pg||
nt|lestergold: the latter has forced patner to bid but I think 3h was the limit on next round|pg||
nt|lestergold: exacly Bill|pg||
nt|athene: if you want to show partner your spades, remember he will see them when you put dummy down :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: had to restrain on the nexy=t round|pg||
nt|lestergold: I am in favour of a disciplined pass not expecting auction to end with 2D and then I will act later according to what I hear|pg||
nt|rodal f: Do u know if EW use 2NT as force here? If so the 3@C are ok and E might have only for 3@H.|pg||

nt|rodal f: Agree|pg||
nt|lestergold: quite|pg||
nt|athene: and east has the same shape here - his partner opens 1@H and he has 6@S-3@H|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|nt|athene: time to raise hearts|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|d|nt|athene: ...which i assume is what 2@D is|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: hm|pg||
mb|2S|nt|lestergold: King has to act here|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: S in for a problem here|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lestergold: and completes his description with 3C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s5|nt|lestergold: problem in this contract is of course the lack of ntries to dummy|pg||

pc|sA|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|nt|athene: he can lead a top club and when the @C9 falls, lead @C10 preparing a finesse|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cK|pc|s6|nt|athene: then he only has to reach dummy once to pick them up|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pc|s3|nt|athene: but he prefers the simple line of playing for decent break|pg||

nt|lestergold: 6C a likely make in practice if they reach it of course|pg||
nt|rodal f: Some fight to come before bidding ends|pg||
nt|athene: a perfect fit - no wasted cards whatsoever|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: perfecto of course|pg||
mb|2D|nt|athene: 3@D overcall asking for a stopper, perhaps?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lestergold: played by south it means no trump can be lead and time to set up the ruff of two dims in dummy|pg||
nt|athene: they may not play that and south may think it's a bit pushy even if they do|pg||
mb|3D|mb|d|nt|lestergold: underlead of diamond too late only one trump can be drawn|pg||
nt|lestergold: but i predict they wont reach the slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|rodal f: I belive 6@C will not be reached, might even not over 5@D as a sac from EW|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: too many specific cards to d=identify|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|athene: they could have beaten this with a spade ruff but no reason to lead anything other than @DQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this looks an unlucky hand or the declaring side|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|athene: of course declarer may well give them a second chance to find the ruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: no may make because of the spade suit layout|pg||
nt|athene: a tricky hand to play....you want to lead lots of things from hand|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: this a strange effort by King|pg||
nt|athene: declarer would be most unlikely to play like that with the @SA in his hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: will East play pard for spade ace on this play?|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|lestergold: but never easy at the table|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lestergold: doesnt make snse the play if North holds the spade A|pg||
nt|athene: so east should be able to see what's going on|pg||
nt|lestergold: so East should bang that pesky King on the table|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d9|pc|dA|pg||
nt|lestergold: quite a well known  tactic play the suit ur scard of before the opps play it|pg||
nt|athene: there's no rush, really, though - if north could pitch losing spades on anything he would already be doing that :)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lestergold: well|pg||
nt|lestergold: King may have played the spade suit down all by himself|pg||
nt|lestergold: Cope can rise and play another spade or duck and wait|pg||
nt|rodal f: Had a question. As I use trancfere @S for @C - NT for @D. Then NT opener can send a invit for 3!N bu 1 top honor by the bid between the color showed. U then need to use 2@C to make ...|pg||
nt|rodal f: a invit for NT. So 2@C do not promiss 4card major|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S = @C; 2NT says "if you are inviting 3nt, i have the right hand, with a club honour"|pg||
nt|rodal f: For specs: http://www.tgrsbridge.com/Super_League.html|pg||
nt|lestergold: Cope is wondering what king is up to|pg||
nt|athene: 3@C says "no, i wasn't"|pg||
nt|lestergold: w can see it dosnt matter|pg||
nt|athene: he is wondering where King is coming from (and where the king is)|pg||
nt|athene: it doesn't matter...just follow suit and you'll be fine|pg||
nt|lestergold: King's play doesnt make a lot of sense if he holds kS|pg||
nt|athene: i am not sure it made so much sense even if he didn't|pg||
nt|lestergold: operator is there a problem here or isit just  a tank?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well I do not know why this appears frozen I do not think Cope ould be tanking this long here|pg||

pc|d5|pc|s5|nt|lestergold: especially as K is on lead|pg||

mb|3S!|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: 3@S shows a raise to 3nt with four hearts?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Must be|pg||
nt|athene: that does conceal opener's spade suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: not a difficult prediciton its a good 9 count andits right to do so|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lestergold: diamond lead does not hurt a lot|pg||
nt|rodal f: But many use it as single @S|pg||
nt|athene: defence have all the time in the world to play clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: a lot of work to do unfortunately and this contract unlikely to survive a club attack|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|athene: if they never touch them, declarer might come to three spades, two hearts, three diamonds and a club, i suppose|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
nt|lestergold: the club switch easy form north not so easy from south|pg||
pc|d7|nt|lestergold: but the hearts have to be tackled  or King in with dim and he will switch to club very quickly indeedo|pg||
nt|athene: the defence might not be able to untangle all the clubs they have a right to, but they don't need them all|pg||
nt|athene: two clubs and one trick in each of the other suits will do nicely|pg||
nt|lestergold: only needs two club tricks along with a dim and the wo bullets|pg||
nt|lestergold: east was minimum and tricks were needed from three suits to make this so it looksmlike another unfortunate little whammy for Townsend|pg||
nt|rodal f: If N get the @D trick at 3rd @C comes auto. So E better put a small at bough hands here|pg||
nt|lestergold: Kin by now will know where evry pip in the pack is|pg||
nt|rodal f: Belive so, but the only try for EW|pg||
nt|roswolf: the running score after 22 bds i make is 19-69 to dunn|pg||
nt|lestergold: the diamond lea looked helpful to bin with but this contract needed more help than that|pg||

nt|lestergold: now watch the speed of teh club switch|pg||
nt|lestergold: well the speed of the play of he ace of hearts apparently not lightening|pg||
nt|athene: a club switch would help declarer if he just held the ten|pg||
nt|rodal f: Km. 0.07?|pg||
nt|rodal f: :)|pg||
nt|athene: king might duck the heart to see what happens|pg||
nt|lestergold: well in these 24 combined 3n contracts pips get promoted to the importance of aces|pg||
nt|lestergold: look att he dim pips on anothe rday the lead would cost 4 dim tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: i mean would picl up all 4 dim tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: King can afford a duck|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|lestergold: no more ducking|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|lestergold: King worried about who has ten of clubs of course|pg||
nt|athene: even a spade beats because King can then win the @DQ and play a club and declarer can't get to his last spade|pg||
nt|lestergold: can he see that he must get busy now with the club|pg||
nt|athene: (he has to use a spade to reach dummy)|pg||
nt|athene: i think the spade back might now be correct, because it's winning even if declarer has the @C10|pg||
nt|lestergold: in theswe tight contracts it is often wrong to get busy- can King deduce that here he must|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think on analysis he should work it out|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sT|nt|roswolf: any black i think defeats the contract|pg||
nt|athene: he knows the whole hand pretty much (except for @C10) and i think the spade is right|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|athene: now he wins @DQ, and plays club|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
