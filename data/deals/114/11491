nt|Walddk5: Hello Andy and Ed|pg||
nt|andyv:  Good morning Roland and Ed|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Andy!|pg||
nt|andyv:  first hand seems a simple 4@h |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  good morning everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hello Mike, Momchil and Deyan|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzym: Good morning, Andy|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Hello, Andy |pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Hello, Roland|pg||
nt|othered1: kThe prevfious match featured a number of very unusual auctions.  Wonder if it will continue here.|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Hello, Ed|pg||
mb|1H|nt|vugraphzym: Hello, Roland |pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Hello, Star6i|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|vugraphzym: 2@H is 13-16 points 5+ @H|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Deyan:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  2N probably an inquiry as to type of 2@s raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: rehi, everyone!|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: rehi, Ed|pg||
nt|mamos: game for ew|pg||
nt|mamos: although North doesnt think so|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  Hi Deyan:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: hi all|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vugraphzym: that 3@D bid gives chance to EW to find the 5@D save|pg||
nt|andyv:  if NS find their game|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Roberto Mart√≠nez|pg||
nt|ybob: Hi all :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Hello, Roberto|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: although 4@S is a bit double dummy|pg||
nt|othered1: normal auction, so far, good suit in south making up for 1/2 point high card shortness|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think S hand worth more than an invite|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome back to Rado Radev|pg||
nt|rado: hello:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Hello, Rado|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ybob: Hi Deyan|pg||
nt|andyv:  they may be pushed into it... although it looks like NS are out of ammo|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@s looks too expensive now|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: he can make 4@S |pg||
pc|d7|nt|vugraphzym: has to play small @C to earn an entry|pg||
nt|andyv:  2N is a mp bid|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk4: Hello Ed and Andy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and Deyan, our operator|pg||
nt|othered1: west reasonably passed over 1N.  Not sure if it was judgment or a systemic lack of an appropriate call (i.e., double has a conventional meaning)|pg||
nt|othered1: HI, Roland!|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Hi, Roland|pg||
nt|andyv:  good morning everyone|pg||
nt|andyv:  but N sees losing the first 3 tricks and still not sure where rest of tricks are coming from|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: good part score for EW|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: N can make 6@S and 4@C |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|andyv:  as it turns out|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ybob: nice bid 3@S :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: looks like it can make|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't agree.  depends on actual 1N range and non-vul considerations aren't all that different from matchpoints.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|othered1: Hi, Andy!|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pg||
nt|ybob: maybe lead @S defeat|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d9|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Momchil Aleksandrobv|pg||

pc|c5|nt|rado: after friendly lead declarer has 9 top tricks and will try @D to develop more|pg||
pc|d5|pg||

nt|vugraphzym: sth strange happened|pg||

nt|lestergold: im not normally awake at this hour so I may make more errors than the players!|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Andy|pg||
mc|9|nt|andyv:  this hand going painfully slow...and I can imagine NS not happy the way things are unwrapping|pg||
nt|andyv:  i don't need that excuse Mike:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like E may have trapped himself in his hand and was unable to get @hs started?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: yes at the end he had to play A@H and a @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: but I didnt understand how that happened|pg||
nt|lestergold: My geography was not my best subject at school could you enlighten me as to which countries these respective teams belong to?|pg||

nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|Walddk4: N-S  Romania    E-W  Bulgaria|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Stara Zagora is the organiser of the event.It is in Bulgaria. And the other team is from Buchurest (Romania)|pg||
nt|lestergold: thx Roland|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N looks playable for EW|pg||
nt|star6ija: nice distribution|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzym: EW are playing precision|pg||
nt|star6ija: 7@c is possible, but...|pg||
nt|mamos: grand certainly looks a possibility|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: he put 1NT and then changed it :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Dayan, do you know their NT opening ranges?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: I think it is 15-17|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|p|nt|vugraphzym: 2@C should be @S and another suit|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rado: W has minimum neg dbl here|pg||
nt|othered1: this should go very quickly -- you have a 20-count and partner jump supports  you . . . |pg||
nt|andyv:  AQ10xx suit will almost always produce 4 tricks and 5 tricks a good portion of the time|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 3N by West probable diamond lead and no sweat|pg||
nt|andyv:  if 2N is invite, it is a heavy one|pg||
nt|andyv:  but, matter of style, I guess... I like being aggressive with those hands.|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: as Roberto pointed out the timing is very important in such boards - as we like to say in Bulgaria "1 second careless = dead for the rest of your life" :)|pg||
nt|rado: E has a choise rebiding weak @H, 3 cards 2@S or upgrading to 2NT protekting minor Kings|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good morning to Ed Shapiro|pg||
mb|p|pc|sK|nt|andyv:  wow....wonderful!!!|pg||
nt|andyv:  oops:)|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@S?  |pg||
nt|othered1: Fast arrival?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: 2NT should be invitational hand yes|pg||
nt|rado: hi Ed|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone, from chilly central Pennsylvania, USA|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Hi, Ed|pg||
pc|s3|nt|andyv:  good morning everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Good morning, Andy|pg||
nt|andyv:  E sequence usually reserved for hands that are just short of game forcing  bids|pg||
nt|lestergold: any lead except a club helps and no one is kicking off with the stiff club ace|pg||
nt|star6ija: this 2@s bid from S is not good option... in this vulnerability strong club has to be sa descriptive as quickly as possible|pg||
nt|mamos: have Ns agreed a suit?|pg||
nt|star6ija: @Ss? :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: I think 1@C is natural, star6i|pg||
nt|mamos: was 1@C strong or nat?|pg||
nt|star6ija: if so ok|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS sure have a lot of points on this hand|pg||
nt|othered1: Agree for playinig for 9 tricks.  But it's likely you'll be playing for 10 in @H with flat hand v. flat hand|pg||
nt|othered1: 7N is off the top and playing 7 elsewhere is just running risk|pg||
nt|andyv:  then bid 2@c and jump to 3N;)|pg||
nt|othered1: That's the auction you find in the post-mortem, but not at the table by either the players or commentators.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lestergold: even a spade lead sets up a spade trick for declarer|pg||
nt|andyv:  Ed, ever have hands where you just have too many bids?|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ybob: :)|pg||
nt|star6ija: theyare trying to strike back immediately|pg||
nt|othered1: very rarely, but in my partnerships (the few that remain) we define things very tightly.|pg||
nt|andyv:  the N hand would give me a headache here|pg||
nt|othered1: 5N?  2 keys, plus Q, plus void?|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like it|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|nt|sharkey: Good morning|pg||
nt|andyv:  this auction will run out of steam quickly|pg||
nt|mamos: North thinks it's Hearts :)|pg||
nt|star6ija: 7@cs depends on some precautions which should've benn made by declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: it will be interesting if 6@H are bid wheather E will double :)|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello Andy and Carl|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Carl and roland|pg||
nt|ybob: down 2 AK @S low @C , later ruff @S|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@s would have set trump and asked for cue bids|pg||
nt|mamos: ugh|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: 7@S* looks the minimax|pg||
nt|mamos: well it makes but this has not been a good auction imho|pg||
nt|star6ija: 12 tricks are easy|pg||
nt|othered1: I like the 1@H response, to get a natural rebid from partner.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|andyv:  all roads lead to 9 tricks, Mike? :))|pg||
nt|othered1: second best spot, but safe here.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|c7|pg||
nt|andyv:  they got there.... good thing this isn'|pg||
nt|andyv:  isn't a BAM event:)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|andyv:  and Deyan:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: it didnt run out of steam that quickly :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  they decided to bring it to a boil:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - this auction not for the faint hearted...|pg||
nt|andyv:  so, the question is why E didn't simply open 4@s if that was what he was intending to bid all the time?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well ironically a club lead and declarer has to do abit of guesswork|pg||
nt|andyv:  probably no over tricks|pg||
nt|rado: lack of communications between NS will help declare for 8 tricks|pg||
nt|othered1: this will claim as soon as both follow to one trump|pg||
pc|c8|nt|andyv:  this can go down 500 easily|pg||
nt|ybob: 4/2 @S shows even and interest @C|pg||
nt|star6ija: but @d now will bring the contract home|pg||
nt|othered1: Right -- a hand worth 2@C in playing strength but with inadequate high cards for the call.|pg||
nt|othered1: maybe even 9|pg||
nt|rado: sure with @S suit favourable|pg||
pc|c3|nt|othered1: I thought that was standard, but east's action here is what I see regularly at the table.  Times changed, I guess.|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sharkey: set before they get started|pg||
nt|andyv:  a pretty steep price to pay to protect against a partial|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|h4|pg||
pc|d2|nt|andyv:  I don't think so Ed.|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: N had played 2@D on the A of spade so he was obliged to play it|pg||
nt|lestergold: well no he doesnt of course because then there has to be a switch!!|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d6|pg||

nt|vugraphzku: but there is an obvious break of tempo|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@D is a lucky make, requires trumps 3-3|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: so they landed on their feet|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: all of the W bids were relays - until 4@cs W showed 3-5-2-3 distribution, and over 4@ss (KCB with @cs agreed) he responded 2 key cards without trump queen|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: relay responds I meant|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What was 1@C?|pg||

nt|sharkey: yes - if make only lose 170 points|pg||
nt|sharkey: not the game bonus in addition|pg||
nt|andyv:  2 questionable bids (2@h and 4@s) produce an inadaquate result|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: This is the ranking after the previous round : http://bridge.bg/ranking163.html|pg||
nt|star6ija: I think that Romanians made it well, as far as agressive Bulgarian pair at the other table might have reached grand and clubs and to chose losing option which is equal as ...|pg||
nt|star6ija: percentage to the winning one|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  easy slam for EW and easy safe for NS|pg||
nt|andyv:  save|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h for EW|pg||
mb|1H|nt|andyv:  right|pg||
nt|ybob: 4@H EW|pg||
nt|othered1: 6@D is cold, but 6@S is a fine save.|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  yes, 6@s almost makes|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mamos: South's Pass is interesting|pg||
nt|mamos: North's 4@D is more interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: On a good day, 6@S might even make|pg||
nt|andyv:  6@d now|pg||
mb|2N|nt|andyv:  W thrilled with pd's dbl|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS still not underbidding...|pg||
nt|sharkey: especially S|pg||
nt|andyv:  how would you have bid the W hand, Ed?|pg||
nt|ybob: cold 7 tricks|pg||
nt|rado: and again some chases for more|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|andyv:  3@h a bit aggressive|pg||
nt|mamos: West has tremendous playing strength|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: the minimax here seems to be 6@H*|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: looks like down 1|pg||
nt|othered1: Not that way.|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think this is the optimum way|pg||
mb|3N|nt|othered1: though 4N, if clearly unusual, is decent, planning to convert 5@C to 5@D, thus a slam try (if partner doesn't think you have a red 2-suiter)|pg||
nt|andyv:  would you think about passing the first time and "limping in" later?|pg||
nt|star6ija: playing yes but not defensive|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well in spite of 4/1 heart break and unfavourable position of KS E/W have  plenty of strength t make 4h here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Results and standings after 3 rounds at   http://bridge.bg/ranking163.html|pg||
nt|andyv:  @s lead will make it very tough|pg||
nt|lestergold: lose a dim and 2 spades must just take care with the timing|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: this makes it very untough tho|pg||
nt|andyv:  it would seem so|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: This makes, doesn't it?|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes... shoud make 5|pg||
nt|andyv:  should|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mamos: surely East will bid 5@s|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphzym: she just claimed|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sharkey: unless something happens in the @D suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  should be able to make 9 tricks|pg||
nt|othered1: At his vulnerability, all passing would do is give NS a chance to find an eventual save.|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: South may be thinking that the best defnce holding 4 trumps is to try and set up a force in which case diamonds was the best prospect|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lestergold: bearing in mind that the diamond bid didnt promise diamonds|pg||
nt|andyv:  don't understand the need to play @ss immediately|pg||
nt|andyv:  now @d and @d ruff, forcing E to ruff with Q may create real problems|pg||
nt|lestergold: shout a dim straight back altho better if draws a trump ot so first|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ybob: 8@C look to @S|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mamos: thats quite some three boards to start with|pg||
nt|star6ija: 17 IMPs back to Romanians|pg||
nt|mamos: why do you think South passed as dealer?   too good for 2@H?  too poor for 1@H?|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: he should not play K of @H to make 9 I think|pg||
nt|andyv:  right...needs to play to Ace|pg||

nt|andyv:  W was too cute with his hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: here is an interesting hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a roland favourite|pg||
nt|andyv:  avoids making errors:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Whatever EW did there, it's hard to justify and game-lam swing|pg||
nt|othered1: a game-slam swing|pg||
mb|1H|nt|andyv:  board 2 cast Leromain 9 imps as they played 1N in OR|pg||
nt|andyv:  cost|pg||
nt|lestergold: 20/20 hcp division|pg||
nt|andyv:  and plenty of action|pg||
nt|lestergold: N/S 4S?|pg||
nt|andyv:  vul will stop E from jumping too high|pg||
nt|lestergold: E/W 8 top tricks in diamonds or No trumps for that matter|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: I need a coffe break... will be here again in 10 minutes :) don't change the channel :)|pg||
nt|rado: 5@C makable with unlikely @S guess|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|sharkey: shud end here|pg||
nt|mamos: double by South seems normal|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lestergold: I expect N/S to reach 4S and eith diamonds bid declarer will play play spades for only one loser|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: looks like N needs to play the right @S honour in 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: I open south's hand, but our initial actions are sound and wouldn't criticize a pass if they open lightly in 1 and 2 pos.|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but it is both the natural way to play the spads and the indicate way on the overcall|pg||
nt|mamos: problem on next round|pg||
nt|andyv:  S should dbl here|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: you can find results here : http://bridge.bg/ranking163.html|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rado: good 3 card raise - nice distribution and Txx in trump|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 3@H makes |pg||
nt|andyv:  who wants to be in it?|pg||
nt|andyv:  borderline hand but you do have the majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: in any case a small spade from hand and a cover of any spade that east plays is a safety pklay here|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  this should go down 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: 2@H looked like last makeable spot but you cant blame S for bidding on|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mamos: no |pg||
pc|d7|nt|lestergold: should always only lose one sapde trick with this combined holding|pg||
pc|d2|nt|andyv:  this contract should be no problem|pg||
nt|andyv:  not gung how about the 2@h bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  can easily go down 2 or 3 vul against a partial|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rado: declarer must restrict his loser to 2 Aces and 1 trump|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cQ|nt|sharkey: yes - shudnt be hard to find @D shift when N in with @SK|pg||
nt|othered1: You want to play  trumps to avoid 3 losers there, if the rest of the hand allows that|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|othered1: I consider the raise normal, though it might be heresy in some parts of the world.|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d4|pc|dT|pc|dK|pg||
nt|andyv:  very little for the defense to initiate...just have to wait for declarer|pg||
nt|mamos: on Board 2 reaching 6NT was a fantastic swing for NS as in Open Room 6@H was not a success|pg||
nt|ybob: i cant understand @C at trick 2 ...|pg||
nt|rado: 1@D ruff and 1@d on Q@h and then trumps|pg||
nt|rado: maybe 3of@D from E suggested @C shift?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ybob: A @S, @D ruff ...|pg||
nt|rado: declarer still under control|pg||
nt|rado: K@S A@s, @D ruff Q@H and @C:)|pg||
nt|othered1: is that a reasonable line?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: isnt he down now ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  this isn't the way to make the hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: E should overtake and play ruff and discard|pg||
nt|lestergold: can declareralays trump coup west here|pg||
nt|rado: no:)|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|nt|ybob: 10@H stiff make this easy|pg||
nt|lestergold: certainly this is the most challenging defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: a matter of timing here|pg||
nt|andyv:  but he will shift to @c|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: is there a trump coup? I think no|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: in this cases the best analizer is GIB :) too bad vugraphs cant use it |pg||
pc|s4|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|ybob: is this a reasonable line :) ?|pg||
nt|othered1: could the @S return have been a clue?|pg||
nt|rado: now @C and trump back for down 2|pg||
nt|ybob: E with Q @S return @D |pg||
nt|othered1: brb|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|vugraphzym: I think he is 1 down now |pg||
pc|h2|nt|sharkey: N don't have to worry about the @D shift...|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|ybob: K @H + @H win |pg||
nt|othered1: I'm told east was 3rd in this year's Bermuda Bowl, which may put 2@H bid into context.  Players who are successful at that level have confidence they'll make whatever they bid :)|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h5|nt|andyv:  needed to win @c in hand, i think|pg||

nt|lestergold: another diamond would have been more challenging|pg||

nt|othered1: hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|andyv:  wow... that's a bit rich for me even with this vul|pg||
nt|lestergold: well wrong reasoning only chance was attacking the trump holdings playing a dianmond what does declarer do ruffs with K then west sluffs a heart which would cut down declarer's ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: options|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzym: hello ed|pg||
nt|ybob: Hi Ed !|pg||
nt|andyv:  E must be impressed with the outside strength of his hand|pg||
mb|4N!|nt|andyv:  i would bid 4 with S hand|pg||
nt|othered1: 10 cards in 2 suits, favorable vul: bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  don't understand that lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  any game try will get NS too high|pg||
nt|lestergold: well South should be content with 2H his pard hasnt made an unassuming cue bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s too high at 2H!|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6 losers 2 spades 2 dims a club and a dim ruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: admittedly north's raise with two trumps and a collection of quacks under the openiong bid wa pretty pointless|pg||
nt|andyv:  true|pg||
mb|5S|nt|othered1: 3@C a relay?|pg||
nt|andyv:  appears to be|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: GF with @C I suppose|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: 4+ cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: wd|pg||
nt|andyv:  and S has yet to be shy in this set:0|pg||
nt|sharkey: i agree Andy|pg||
nt|andyv:  ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: you pass with north because you o not want to see pard's expression when you table that as dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: N thought for a long time and passed|pg||
nt|lestergold: and his partner could be splinering as it was it was close to a splinter|pg||
nt|ybob: 5@H = 300 |pg||
nt|rado: 5@h is cheap but 5@S easy too|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  N 1N opener hit pay dirt|pg||
nt|sharkey: "looks like 1 NT - open 1 NT"|pg||
nt|andyv:  agree... i like 1N with N cards....too awkward to describe hand if you open 1@D|pg||
nt|sharkey: Leromain picked up another 5 IMPs when W opened 1 NT in OR and played there|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: he just claimed|pg||
nt|ybob: 2@H = 5+ @H  13/16 pts |pg||
nt|ybob: WOW|pg||
nt|othered1: but it's a good one, I think|pg||
nt|andyv:  gave up a club trick so I'm no so sure how good it is|pg||
nt|othered1: gave up a trick?|pg||
nt|andyv:  it hasn't yet but it's frozen the suit so N can never lead it|pg||
nt|othered1: What other lead beats it?  South wins @D and plays another @C before east can drive last @S, no?|pg||
nt|andyv:  now E can play the hand straight up|pg||
nt|mamos: 43 imps have changed hand son Boards 1-3 so -300 may be the flattest board yet|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: you can go down in 5@S|pg||
nt|ybob: defeat 5@S|pg||
nt|andyv:  7@c great contract except for 4-1 break|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: and still you can make |pg||
nt|othered1: very careful auction by west.  an immediate 6N, just quantitative, would appeal to many|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Nice pass by east, for play in @D, but 3N is there for the taking.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this is 2 off at least|pg||
nt|ybob: good lead|pg||
nt|rado: yes due unvaourable trump break|pg||
pc|dK|nt|andyv:  all 7@c requires is 1 @s ruff|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sharkey: in my book N hand a clear 1 NT opener|pg||
nt|lestergold: a trump lead would have been  reasonably murderous|pg||
pc|d2|nt|othered1: It's good to have very tight agreements when  you embark on an auction like west's.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|othered1: is 4N a sign-off?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: looks like RKCB|pg||
nt|othered1: coiuld be, or west could be cue-bidding in rank order.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|othered1: what, then, is 5@S?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|othered1: playing K may mislead south|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think anything else beats it... I just don't understand leading from Jx of a minor when pd has opened a major.  Why not lead pd's suit?|pg||
nt|othered1: inspiration counts|pg||
nt|andyv:  it would also make me open suits that I don't want the lead because I know pd will never lead my suit:)|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't hate that lead at all.  South does have enough @H length that he might decide to try to attack elsewhre|pg||
nt|andyv:  would you hate the lead if the club honors were split?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: some talking about the bidding between W and S|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sT|nt|sharkey: 4@H OR as well|pg||
nt|mamos: well not many points here but the contract looks a good one|pg||
nt|rado: facing 5th fit and heraing 4@C values + fit @D lead is logical|pg||
pc|sA|nt|othered1: Pays your money, takes your choice, it says.|pg||
nt|andyv:  end result was disappointing (to the specs and us, that is)|pg||
nt|othered1: Wow, after the double, that @SJ promotes.  Wonder if west had alternatives to 6N?|pg||
nt|othered1: alternatives that would have continued the auction|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|c2|nt|sharkey: EW have to their @S trick or making 12|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|pc|d6|nt|andyv:  just for partnership trust, I don't think N could ever pass 3@c|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2 off end of story|pg||
nt|othered1: 2 rounds of @D and claim|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h4|nt|andyv:  now he leads a @h?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|andyv:  game set and match|pg||
nt|lestergold: two bad bids Andy|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|othered1: But maybe north should have enouraged @C at trick 1, or if they play upside down signals south should have continued|pg||
nt|andyv:  J@c turned out to be a good lead... S had to follow thru|pg||
nt|othered1: did north discourage or did south ignore it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: N could have ducked @D to hand and then it would have been down 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: W went out|pg||
nt|othered1: Little old ladies at the club would have gotten there in 2 bids and wouldn't have put pressure on the partnership's confidence in their agreements|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: by north|pg||
pc|s7|pc|d4|nt|sharkey: cud have been interesting if E held the @DK and returned a @C at the end...|pg||

nt|vugraphzym: players are on a five minutes rest. Seems all of them are smokers|pg||

nt|andyv:  friendly hand for 6N by N|pg||
nt|sharkey: 11-13?|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: i doubt if vul opps are going to enterb this fray|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  really?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: yes :) |pg||
nt|andyv:  one thing for sure...3N probably won't give declarer any problems|pg||
nt|sharkey: 19 and 5 card suit... hmmm|pg||
nt|andyv:  you may be right Carl..11-13... that's the only way you can explain the 3N bid|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder if redouble is just power or shows specific @S length, strength to be determined later.|pg||
nt|rado: this might end in 3NT|pg||
nt|othered1: very finemethods *and judgment*, I should say|pg||

nt|vugraphzym: This is the results after the round robin http://bridge.bg/ranking163.html|pg||

nt|othered1: yes, assuming south has a reason to overcall, north's auction looks very normal, though some might cue-bid to show support or take other positive action, per system.|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzym: I think E explain sth about the 1@D bid |pg||
nt|vugraphzym: but cant hear and I dont understand romanian :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|andyv:  4@s the most likely one|pg||
nt|andyv:  auction should end at 2@s|pg||
nt|rado: "conservative" 2@S at favourable:)|pg||
nt|rado: and brave 3@C overcall|pg||
mb|d|nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|ybob: 500 5@D X , cold 5@S|pg||
nt|star6ija: this is a typical example of "Partner, only me and not you know that 3N is more expensive than 2 or 1" from both sides of the table - invitation with 8 points and accepting with 15|pg||
nt|ybob: hand  with 50 hcp to E|pg||
nt|rado: some will open even 4@S at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|Walddk5: I am one of those|pg||
mb|2S|nt|othered1: 3N best, as independent of @S suit|pg||
mb|3C|nt|othered1: This NS pair like to get in at the 1-level.  Some, if playing weak jump overcalls, might have bid 2@D on morth's hand.|pg||
nt|lestergold: wahtr about ending at 2C|pg||
nt|lestergold: easty might venture in |pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: 1N seem useless and gave west the free cue-bid|pg||
nt|ybob: I think they play jump overcall 12/16|pg||

nt|andyv:  i don't understand N's pass|pg||

nt|rado: 5@D down due to @S ruff, 5@s ok|pg||
nt|rado: most probably E will dbl|pg||
nt|andyv:  no appealing lead for S but still found the suit his pd wouldn't bid:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 2d meaning Andy?|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: I like intermediate jumps, but not at this vulnerability.|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: he explained it is a "forcing bid. Nothing about @D"|pg||
nt|lestergold: checkback?|pg||
mb|p|pc|sA|nt|mamos: this time I have more sympathy with NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: I actually like the 3NT by N :) he has terrific 15|pg||
pc|s5|nt|othered1: Thanks, I've seen hand 13, which went by before I arrived.|pg||
nt|ybob: :9|pg||
nt|ybob: :)|pg||
nt|othered1: 6@D or 6N is simply on finesse|pg||
nt|ybob: better 500 to NS|pg||
pc|s9|nt|sharkey: in my book 1 NT rebid wud show 18-19 and Dbl the actual hand|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|andyv:  if they play variable NT, this might have a different meaning for them|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - obviously|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3C looks makeable|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@d has to be some type of checkback, but 2@s looks like sign off|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|nt|othered1: So, slam and no slam are both reasonable|pg||
nt|andyv:  6@d not even on a finesse|pg||
nt|othered1: really?|pg||
nt|andyv:  and 6@s can't make|pg||
pc|s4|nt|andyv:  but otherwise I agree..1N shows about 18-19|pg||
nt|andyv:  this has a chance now|pg||
nt|sharkey: N willing to push to 4@H here - to much when pd didnt superaccept I think|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|othered1: how do you make 6@D without finesse?|pg||
nt|andyv:  you are right...need the @c hook to dump the @s|pg||
nt|andyv:  early morning disease...stupidity|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: cant you discard your @C on hearts|pg||
nt|andyv:  but still have a @h and @s loser if you do that|pg||
nt|othered1: yes, then lose @HA and @S|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: I see|pg||
nt|andyv:  and there we have it|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N with qxx of dims somehat foolhardy|pg||
nt|rodal f: Squize at N now:)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: defence can only cash first 7 triks|pg||
nt|andyv:  conceivable for EW to take the first 7 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: you can find results after 3rd round here -> http://bridge.bg/ranking163.html|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: dimaond lead guaranteed|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: is the 4 the right @D to lead ? |pg||
nt|lestergold: even if for any reason declarer was allowed to win this trick its cold off|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: I think so|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: cant you block the suit ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  i think 4@d is ok here|pg||
nt|andyv:  but J@d better|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes you can but doesnt matter with east havinmg an entry and if east hasnt an entry the contract would make|pg||
nt|andyv:  suit will block up period|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: I would have led the J or even the K probably|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|othered1: This can put EW right back into the match, if OR pair takes the other side of the 50-50 shot.|pg||
nt|othered1: Or could lose a couple of imps if they play 6N|pg||
nt|andyv:  I'm trying to find the part of the auction which shows the @d fit has been found|pg||
pc|dK|nt|andyv:  ugh|pg||
nt|lestergold: stuill only 8 tricks for declarer|pg||
pc|d6|nt|othered1: 6@D, choice of slams?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: I think 5@D might suggest @D game but not sure|pg||
nt|othered1: allowing a trick 1 claim|pg||
nt|andyv:  that sounds plausible|pg||
nt|rodal f: :(|pg||
pc|d7|nt|andyv:  ugh|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: and I dont like this 4@H bid by N because still S can have only 3@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: there is possible endplay now|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: no there isnt sry|pg||
pc|d9|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d8|nt|othered1: 5?|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|andyv:  backward squeeze:)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|othered1: Board 4 was a swing when NS played 2@H in OR, making and holding loss to 5 imps v. the EW 2@H here -300|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|nt|sharkey: but things happen...|pg||
nt|andyv:  E needs to learn patience on defense|pg||

nt|vugraphzym: best now W to discard the K@D :) |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|mamos: but here North hopes that West has all the values in @D and that the NS hands will fit   I think this is a bit unlucky|pg||

nt|lestergold: east has to play pard for K three dims to beat it|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|cK|pg||

nt|lestergold: East playing pessimism bridge|pg||

nt|andyv:  from going down to making|pg||
nt|lestergold: contract now firgidised by east|pg||

nt|lestergold: frigidised|pg||
nt|andyv:  E is not playing bridge... just throwing cards now|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: still hasnt played it |pg||
nt|vugraphzym: holding the A in hand |pg||
nt|lestergold: then what was partner getting in with to lead his presumed QJ( of spades through with|pg||

nt|lestergold: Andy you are trying hard to be polite straining at the seams Id say|pg||
nt|andyv:  See Ed...board 5 was a swing board:))|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  empathy, Mike... we've all been there and done things at the table that later on we have no idea what we were thinking about.|pg||
mb|2S|an|5+!S, not F|nt|vugraphzym: I think S's hand was pretty good and there was a finesse on and still down 1|pg||
nt|ybob: slam time|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|andyv:  wonder if EW are playing non forcing free bids...that would explain double instead of 1@S bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: not clear who is buying this hand 3h N/S limit already reached|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sharkey: yes - some of it not suitable for the Family Hour :)|pg||
mb|4C|nt|andyv:  12 imps picked up on Board 7 as strangely, they didn't get to that fine 4@h contract:0|pg||
nt|lestergold: c|pg||

nt|rodal f: Sr for interrupting. Could not stand it. Leaving in ten min for my next set.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 3S a brave effort vul all on his own|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: oh|pg||
nt|rado: but he decided to jump reverse immy|pg||
mb|4D|nt|sharkey: 2@C a variation of New Minor Forcing...?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@D I mean|pg||
nt|ybob: i prefer play 10 from dummy to invite another @D round|pg||
nt|andyv:  E came here to bid:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: prtner has promised a good hand with a good 6 card suit he happens to have neither|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@d very playable|pg||
nt|lestergold: but if west is going to bid it should be 4s|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5D needs a lot of good guessing|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2c a dim  heart and a spade to be lost on a bad day|pg||
nt|andyv:  only @d hook... but if N covers 10@S immediately, 5@d will go down|pg||
nt|ybob: yes|pg||
nt|othered1: after west supports @H, east will push the rest of the way|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: no way they can miss the slam now|pg||
nt|rado: facing strongest sequence available E has to check key  cards only for grand:)|pg||
nt|othered1: East's black honors are key in an auction like this.|pg||
nt|andyv:  always welcome Frank|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  i play it as forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: 5@D goes down with a @C switch aftrer K @H|pg||
nt|rado: rkcb for @H maybe|pg||
nt|othered1: Only question for east may be whether a black suit might be more solid than @H.|pg||
nt|ybob: 5@H = 2+Q @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: this is a nice event... actually it started in the year of 2005 as Balkan Championship|pg||
nt|othered1: with west having a possible pitch on the @D.|pg||
nt|rado: AQJx Qxx x AKJxx might be W's hand:)|pg||
nt|ybob: i play 6Nt with E hand|pg||
nt|othered1: That's what I was considering|pg||
nt|rado: so after KC reply some pick a slam bid would be nice|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: W is holding his head|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: he seems not to understand 4@S bid|pg||
nt|othered1: if you have a pick a slam call available after setting trumps with RKC|pg||
nt|ybob: kickback ?|pg||
nt|rado: if E had 4-4 in Majors with FG he may bid 4@S directly, so now he has more|pg||
nt|ybob: i dont like a 4¬∫ suit in a Fg sequence|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzym: W alerted 3@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4d may have a more realistic chance of a plus score|pg||
nt|andyv:  if they find the switch...pd doesn't always have 5 for his 3 level raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: now he alerted and explained RBC|pg||
nt|rado: btw other room stoped at 4@H|pg||
nt|rado: so a swing expected|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sharkey: agree Andy - 2@H may have been non-forcing|pg||
nt|andyv:  looking for @c slam?|pg||
nt|othered1: I'll settle for a 1-imp loss of 5 when I stop short of the grand.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Thx Andy, the humorist by swings|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sharkey: has it chances... but will probably fail|pg||
nt|star6ija: Mr Toni Rousev from Stara Zagora, supported by some local enthusiasts helped the idea to come true|pg||
nt|sharkey: how many nations participate Momchil?|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS used their rabbit's foot on this auction|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|pg||
pc|cA|nt|andyv:  slam asperations died a quick death|pg||
nt|sharkey: this may be trouble too...|pg||
nt|star6ija: 2 years ago Balkan Championship started to change its locality... Bucarest year ago and Novi Sad (Serbia) - November this year|pg||
nt|lestergold: partner can show count|pg||
nt|othered1: In other room, I think east didin't give enough value to the black honors|pg||
nt|andyv:  tough to stay out of gameon this one but well done by EW|pg||
pc|d5|nt|othered1: A little lucky that 6@H is so playable,  6N didnt seem to be under consideration.  Guess ruffing out long @C suit was possible|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: and still looks like they are going down|pg||
pc|c5|nt|andyv:  if N is listening:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: or dont they have such sophisticated kit|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok, Mike, pay up:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: pay up?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: they are playing only 4 :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: although if W didnt have J of @C a club switch would have been vital even in 4|pg||
nt|andyv:  still, they should try to defend it properly|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ybob: What if W hand was AQJX QXX Q AKJXX ?|pg||
mc|10|nt|star6ija: we have record concerning the number of the participants this year|pg||
nt|andyv:  probably want to take @c hook thru N|pg||
nt|ybob: or AQJX QJ X AKJXXX|pg||
nt|othered1: 23 highs and misfit isn't automatic to push to game.|pg||
nt|andyv:  need @d switch|pg||
nt|othered1: won't @C back also work?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: see you after lunch break :)|pg||
