nt|haans: yes they will cry after that :)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|roswolf: REAL CUTE ED|pg||
nt|othered1: vul weak 2's on ragged 7-card suits seem to be the thing to do today.  Saw a bunch in the university games BBO webcast, but those are younger players.|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h9|nt|roswolf: i agree ed but if you play the multi you dont have to be solid any more with weak 2's|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|s4|pc|d9|pc|s7|pg||
nt|aupillon: there is Cindy overthere too :)|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|dT|nt|marlowepi: for some it is not an issue of solidity but rather of partner being able to judge the auction because he knows how many cards we have in our fitting suit|pg||
nt|othered1: Why?  May be tougher to penalize (is that true?) but what does it do to constructive bidding?|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed in europe it is quite fashionable to use the multi to show rbbish and 2M as solid weak 2's|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi all:) was commenating in other room and slipped through hole in wall:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: anyway bye for now - restart in 10-15 mins|pg||
nt|othered1: Ok with that distinction it makes some sense to my conservative eyes.  But still why throw the cards up in the air 1st seat vul?  |pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes Geoff i play the same method but i still would not open a 7 card suit with a weak 2. matter of style and philosophy|pg||
nt|othered1: For a rare occasion, I agree with Marshall about an initial action :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 7 card suits are for the 3 level. if ya cant stand that much heat then ya pass and bid later|pg||
