nt|daman: related*|pg||
nt|brolucius: A big hand to welcome us all to the event.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We will probably see Angelini's version of Precision at this table|pg||
nt|lml: hello Sabine|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think both pairs play 2/1|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: Good Morning =) Buon giorno|pg||
nt|sharkey: so almost half way and a close match it is|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Victor is probably disappointed that we won't see Acol in action|pg||
nt|hedyg: depends if you want to watch something different lol|pg||
nt|daman: Alfredo is nice to watch :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: Buon pomeriggio a tutti! Good evening to everybody! =)|pg||
nt|brolucius: And the tight scoreline is a bonus.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: N-S play Precision a la Angelini|pg||
nt|ritong: ciao roberta|pg||
nt|andyv:  Good morning, Roberta:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS CC: http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008Pau-european/OpenTeams/Italy/angelini-sementa.pdf|pg||
nt|hedyg: i have no idea what system EW play, but we will see|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Angelini will likely open 1NT passed to West|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yesterday we had several deals where the points were divided 20-20 (not usually a good sign for entertaining viewing). I see here that the Great Dealer has made it 21-19 for a ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: change. Ah, yes.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: who will double, presumably|pg||
nt|andyv:  strong finish in the last 4 boards in the previous round surged Padova ahead|pg||
nt|mariner1: Hi all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you can have my share of the danish wine when it comes, rob|pg||
nt|bridge_one: of course Gazzilli (1Maj 1NT, 2@C=gazzilli to introduce natural hand or many strong hands)|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S NS seems easy enough here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes 18/19 (20)|pg||
nt|cicus: there was a hand yesterday when the bidding was at 5@D with Fantoni thinking|pg||
nt|cicus: I went to have dinner and when I returned he was still in thoughts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Team Villa Fabbriche from beautiful Tuscany, Angelini from (also beautiful) Rome|pg||
nt|daman: and we're off.....|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Avram|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008MindSportGamesBeijing/Open/Italy/fantoni-nunes.pdf|pg||
nt|ralfwil: The same players an the session before?|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW in @S partial here|pg||
nt|brolucius: If you needed to pick up 90 IMPs in 16 boards, you would not wish to see the opponents' seats occupied by Nunes/Fantoni.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|daman: want a big hand?   clap clap clap|pg||
nt|mariner1: very close match after this many boards|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: =) ty|pg||
nt|haans: Padova Bridge are not a team to run over|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and they're off|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@D = 4 cards|pg||
nt|jcmax: Will w show his 2-suiter over a 1@S opening?|pg||
nt|april7: Hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 10-15  5+ diamonds, unbalanced|pg||
nt|ralfwil: as...|pg||
nt|cicus: this does not look like a deal of fireworks|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: So 1@C  16+|pg||
nt|daman: uh oh|pg||
nt|hedyg: 12 -15 NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good morning Liz and David|pg||
nt|bridge_one: both team are playing in the best formation|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The gap even bigger in the women's final. Catania up by 98 IMPs|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jcmax: How many rounds have been played so far?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D  0-7|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: BUONA SERA A TUTTI!!!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Semi-finals now, knockout|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS CC http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008Pau-european/OpenTeams/Italy/angelini-sementa.pdf|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A surprise|pg||
nt|andyv:  xfer to @hs apperently|pg||
nt|bridge_one: gazzilli convention was invented by ... mister Gazzilli :)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Good morning, Roland and everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 10-13  sorry|pg||
nt|bridge_one: also 9|pg||
nt|sybarra: it is unbalanced |pg||
nt|bridge_one: Pulgo is a slow player|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Pulga|pg||
nt|roswolf: nortth should raise@S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: technically very strong|pg||
nt|daman: East will bid his @Cs no matter what|pg||
nt|sybarra: I bid on with 652... |pg||
nt|hedyg: no slam here|pg||
nt|andyv:  a possible 6@h hand that won't make|pg||
nt|brolucius: No, some say that the Great Dealer does not approve of bridge being played on a Sunday and therefore provides a moderate collection of deals.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 4@H seems simple enough here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or his two half-suits?|pg||
nt|april7: 4@S down from the top and 4@C makable by EW|pg||
nt|sybarra: (maybe be wrong) but shape is tooooooooooo  good |pg||
mb|2C|nt|hedyg: looks like a transfer|pg||
nt|andyv:  Angelini replaced by Lauria|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No point in my opinion since it's not your hand. Then all you achieve is to give the show away|pg||
nt|cicus: now a somewhat unlucky 4@H to begin with|pg||
nt|cicus: gm Liz and David|pg||
nt|april7: what does 21d opening sow?|pg||
nt|daman: most of us would open the East hand at the one level notwithstanding|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@S for NS, 4@C for E/W|pg||
nt|roswolf: I think everyone would but over 5@S at some point!?|pg||
nt|roswolf: was rdbl conventional?|pg||
nt|cicus: a spade partial to be expected, I guess 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: looks like 3 NT has some good prospects here EW|pg||
nt|cuttysark: no contract is comfotrable when they hold all the aces|pg||
nt|daman: I don't think the auction will reach 5@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 32 hp on EW - let us see what happens|pg||
nt|daman: doesn't seem to be a slam in sight|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nunes doubled a 12-14 NT in the other room|pg||
nt|andyv:  W looking at the security of the @h suit instead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: North escaped to 2@C and is playing there|pg||
nt|bridge_one: a strong player in 60/70|pg||
nt|bridge_one: from Milan|pg||
nt|april7: what's 2@D opening?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think Rinaldi will bid 4@h now , instead 4@S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D 5+@D 9/12|pg||
nt|april7: tu|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think I might have bid 4 @H on the way |pg||
nt|roswolf: if it just shows a max pass + spade support then north should bid on now|pg||
nt|daman: North's hand is significantly devalued on the auction|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 10-13 (good 9) it reads on their CC|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: 2@H will result in a minus for EW|pg||
nt|jtr: Good morning people|pg||
nt|andyv:  specs already active...a slightly worse 6NT that might make|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c relay?|pg||
nt|brolucius: West can more or less tell that a slam cannot be better than a finesse, facing a passed hand.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 15-17 NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's not so much a question of Sunday, more like what *time* on a Sunday|pg||
pc|d7|nt|daman: that makes|pg||
nt|andyv:  misfit may slow them down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Only 11 tricks on this layout. No squeeze|pg||
nt|brolucius: Five hearts, a diamond and a spade - one down.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If they switch to spades in time|pg||
nt|daman: I'm sure they will|pg||
nt|Walddk2: TRue, but hearts could have been 2-2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It is not fair to start in the middle of the night|pg||
nt|brolucius: North decides that there is not much point in raising to 2@S immediately, since South bid only 1@S in response to the negative double. South would have bid 2@S if he had anything ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: approaching what is needed for game.|pg||
nt|cicus: i'm up since 7 in the morning|pg||
pc|d4|nt|andyv:  3 or 4N likely spot|pg||
nt|daman: do we know what system EW are playing/|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but a throw in for 12 - or?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: undo please|pg||
nt|odysseus69: whenever I commentate I notice that every man opens balanced 11 - I wonder if the disease has spread to wwmens bridge|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It has, mostly because N-S can't attack spades. The suit is frozen for the defence|pg||
nt|andyv:  should be -1 but @h leads may create more problems for declarer|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@H could be better to give at the pattner more information about to decide after a 5@c by West|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1NT by E would deny 4 @hs|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hedyg: 2NT=22-24|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N or 4@S plays ok,,,,,,,|pg||
nt|mariner1: dbl of course takeout|pg||
nt|andyv:  a Roland slam missed|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe but for a sac it is good since opps hands have improved|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, Roland 13 is the limit of 2open by E/W|pg||
nt|mariner1: same spot in Open Room|pg||
nt|jcmax: good view by Lauria. Game might have play opposite a perfect hand. But perfect hands are so rare. He has played so long, he knows that very well :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I donÂ´t like the pass on 1@s from N|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|andyv:  I like 3N by S|pg||
nt|odysseus69: nice easy game to start|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - the 9s and 10s coming into play here|pg||
nt|hedyg: Angelini will want to show AK@C?|pg||
nt|daman: a plus for NS    but, probably a push|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d showed @hs thus the 3@H bid|pg||
mc|7|nt|lml: 3NT is a fine contract |pg||
nt|jcmax: hmmm good double fit , I am not so sure it is not EW's hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@S is 6 cards|pg||
nt|marlowepi: agree totally roland but we all know that many top players don;t worry so much about that|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Indeed - I predict a flat board|pg||
nt|cicus: I expect a push, though|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N asks |pg||
nt|brolucius: No, with the singleton diamond, game could have been there. |pg||
nt|cicus: surprise, surely S was expected to bid 2@S?|pg||

nt|odysseus69: more work in 3NT here|pg||
nt|brolucius: So, only a humble part score but there was a good point of interest.|pg||
nt|hedyg: in the mean time 2@c was down while 2@D would probably make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: pass  1@H   4@D?|pg||
nt|mariner1: now this is a Roland slam|pg||
nt|andyv:  now this is  a serious slam|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW in Open Room in 4@H DBL on 1|pg||
nt|jcmax: Maybe not. He probably just figured with a sure trump trick there still would be time to switch back to @H later after the count in @D was known. Very good play by versace!|pg||
nt|cicus: as for opening 4@H , I expect somewhat risky actions from the underdogs|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: and we did not get any score here|pg||
nt|andyv:  I imagine made 5|pg||
nt|daman: there will definitly be a swing    depends on who is on the winning end|pg||
nt|andyv:  multi 2@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: We are back in business in the slam zone again|pg||
nt|andyv:  and another slam hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: this time its infrangible|pg||
nt|daman: would any of us open 1@H?|pg||
nt|daman: there's that word again|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not after a multi opening. Way too good in most people's books, but not for E-W here.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes I had opened 1@h|pg||
nt|lestergold: i prefer a heart to weak 2- too much outside tehheart suit|pg||
nt|daman: too many syllables    gives me a headache|pg||
nt|hedyg: might not have been exactly as we saw|pg||
nt|Walddk2: East discarded a diamond? Then declarer pitched a winner?|pg||
nt|mariner1: Open Room is in 6@S there|pg||
nt|andyv:  with this vul, even 5@d has to be considered|pg||
nt|brolucius: Twelve tricks can be made in spades.|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D|pg||
nt|jcmax: Lauria I meant :)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Another 4@H maybe - needs a spade lead to make|pg||
nt|jtr: 4@h looks normal to me in 3rd position|pg||
nt|april7: thats an easy 4@H without competition|pg||
nt|roswolf: a choice of games here|pg||
nt|daman: 4@H?  or 3NT?|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to pick 4 @H |pg||
nt|bridge_one: sry, i told both team with the best formation - no true - in open room Versace Angelini (i thought Versace Lauria)|pg||
nt|mariner1: well @D postion helped after all|pg||
nt|hedyg: great hand in S|pg||
nt|haans: 6@H|pg||
mb|1D|nt|bridge_one: Failla Attanasio, plying in open room, are clients of BBO - each day Failla play here|pg||
nt|jtr: Here also maybe|pg||
nt|hedyg: i would not pass|pg||
nt|haans: easy to bid|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@S except for a small issue - 6 @H except for another issue|pg||
mb|1S|nt|brolucius: Commentating.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Double seems normal now|pg||
nt|andyv:  opposite a passed pd, 4@d still leaves a bit too much room to N/S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Most top pairs play take-out double through at least 4@H|pg||
nt|brolucius: It would make the game more interesting if Hedy helped the team that is behind.|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: LOL|pg||
nt|cicus: again, as usual, no upgrade from Fantoni|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 6@h on a finess|pg||
nt|brolucius: North might hold 3-3-3-4 shape, a 9-count with no stopper in hearts.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now a possible, hopeless 3NT, bid by Versace-Giubilo in the open room|pg||
mb|2S|nt|lestergold: my weak 2s dont have ak combos outside the trump suit not in forn of  partner im avers to missing gamers|pg||
nt|andyv:  should show max w@hs|pg||
nt|daman: ogusty|pg||
nt|brolucius: West might bid just 2@S, meaning that will be high enough if partner has spades. But they play their multi quite strong (as is apparent), so West bids 2NT with 16 points in case a ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: game is there by sheer power.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: slam there better than 50%|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or negative doubles if you like|pg||
nt|hedyg: and now?|pg||
nt|hedyg: S has a good hand for playing in @s|pg||
nt|daman: unlikely he will pass|pg||
nt|cuttysark: One of the stronger 1@H overcalls I have seen|pg||
nt|april7: W could overcall 1@S, modern style, but doesn't consume biddingspace|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@c= 14+ nat or 15+ balanced|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@h= @s|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@c= f1|pg||
nt|haans: spec do not like spade lead :)|pg||
nt|jcmax: very good choice of opening bid by giubilo here|pg||
mb|3D|nt|brolucius: Quite good, yes, but is it worth bidding at the five-level?|pg||
nt|hedyg: however on the bidding @ss might well be 4-1 or even 5-0|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@C by S?|pg||
nt|mariner1: nice call|pg||
nt|jcmax: it will not be easy for NS to judge the exact right level now|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@C suggesting a major slam|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It takes a very good day to make it|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lestergold: club finesse or no spade lead too|pg||
nt|andyv:  may get there now|pg||
nt|daman: West might not expect such a good hand|pg||
nt|daman: sorry  :(|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl again|pg||
nt|bobh1: this one about the same as the last one with one difference|pg||
nt|andyv:  2N=slam killer|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D 18-19?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H or 3N both have play here|pg||
nt|cicus: good idea, that double|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now 2@C by North i think is conventional, similar roudy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now Giubilo will double 6@H for the lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: K&R (KQ8654 KJT83 6 7) = 14.00 |pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 1@H could be bid with 0 hcps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fantoni has shown 0-11 so far|pg||
nt|andyv:  they will push it to 3@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: a little more work to do here|pg||
nt|daman: I would be a bidder|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would also pass and bid 5@S now, even considering six|pg||
nt|mariner1: all of Roland's slams are serious (to him) :)|pg||
nt|bobh1: slam makes|pg||
nt|jtr: This is getting unpleasant|pg||
nt|cuttysark: East has done well - he wanted to play in spades!|pg||
nt|cicus: Fantoni is waiting with the axe but Nunes will not cooperate|pg||
nt|Walddk2: At some point he will if they keep bidding|pg||
nt|cicus: there is chance the defence slips though|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: defence on top and this looks tough|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Seems nobody bids their 5-card suits nowadays|pg||
nt|cicus: Rinaldi may not take 2@S as a transfer|pg||
nt|cicus: 2@H, I mean|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lestergold: if west makes a try tho east will accept|pg||
nt|hedyg: George pls stop clicking on the commentator's curse button|pg||
nt|brolucius: Six too much, surely?|pg||
nt|bobh1: the hook is on and the @ss are guessable|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 12 tricks on a finess and solving the @s|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H seems like an unusual call here|pg||
nt|andyv:  anyone know what 4@h is?|pg||
nt|haans: no takers :)|pg||
nt|bobh1: clearly @cs with slam interest lol|pg||
nt|andyv:  a spec says 5@c slam try|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty|pg||
nt|bobh1: 4@s u mean rob|pg||
nt|mariner1: oops yes 4@S|pg||
nt|haans: why not 1D lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Double is the so-called Lightner Double|pg||
nt|jcmax: I am being asked whether W should dbl 6@C conventionally in order to get a different lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: I was not following such a low part score at this time in the morning!|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sharkey: agree|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I suppose a heart to Jack and diamond to Q|pg||
nt|sharkey: Even if W gets 2 @S tricks cannot see making|pg||
nt|sharkey: may be then - two @D tricks|pg||
nt|bobh1: 4@h might also|pg||
nt|jtr: Odd|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4333   109x in @C AJ10 in @D may be 3Nt better for N|pg||
nt|daman: nice bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@S is rather too high, with potential losers in every suit. 2@S is a good stop.|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, but would you pass with N hand in balancing position?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Oh dear, that was meant to be private. My secret is out.|pg||
nt|cicus: although it is not likely that E won't switch to a @D after 2 rounds of @Ss|pg||
nt|cicus: we have already known that David|pg||
nt|brolucius: Known, or suspected?|pg||
nt|cicus: known, definitely|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well, I will surprise you then, by watching this 3@C closely.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|brolucius: South's double of 3S was dubious, with two kings in unbid suits.|pg||
nt|daman: the double of 3@S might give him pause to think partner would have values outside @Ss|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@s by W would have gotten a 5@d bid|pg||
nt|jcmax: Intersting the @S suit never got mentioned here. But I guess no need if there is no fit.|pg||
nt|daman: hah!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes David, therefore "considering"|pg||
nt|bobh1: i'm judging by his hand not what i know of their system|pg||
nt|mariner1: Open Room is in 3N here|pg||
nt|bobh1: 4n probably says no interest|pg||
nt|andyv:  i play 4@s as 4-4 minors slam try makes sense to use 4@h as a 5 card minor suit slam try|pg||
nt|bobh1: so NS will get credit for trying but no actual imps most likely|pg||
nt|ralfwil: For me 4nt is what I want to play if partner has any other vision|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in the old days this 3C bid would mnean N knew where their fit was|pg||
nt|mariner1: same spot in Open Room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: "I have a void, partner, find it"|pg||
nt|haans: not clubs not hearts find it|pg||
nt|hedyg: @s more likely than @D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and not diamonds after South showed both majors|pg||
nt|jcmax: In my opinion no, already because it may have the effect that he will be on lead himself and couldn't dbl for a 1S lead then|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open Room a @c was led as W was on lead|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: onbiously they are used to opening heavy multis|pg||
nt|cicus: N relieved|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lauria will surely lead a spade|pg||
nt|hedyg: not sure why W doubled in OR|pg||
pc|cT|nt|hedyg: just find A@C in W and ruff 1@H for 6|pg||
nt|daman: Rusinow leads|pg||
nt|mariner1: kibbers suggesting @S lead into 6n makes the slam easier|pg||
nt|haans: 4nt can never be blackwood but maybe Turbo|pg||
nt|mariner1: well now its into 4N|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@D over 3@C would ask for full layout|pg||
nt|cicus: I don't think he felt very optimistic at 2NT vulnerable|pg||
nt|april7: 10 or  11 tricks depends on @D play|pg||
nt|jcmax: Depending on what a dbl of 6@C would have meant in this partnership the dbl over 6@H now could have a very specific meaning|pg||
nt|Walddk2: These guys never get it wrong|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mariner1: Q@S on and 3 3 means no issue here except how many he makes|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3Nt is more probable that 4@S|pg||
nt|jcmax: In case anyone is wondering why N bid 2NT instead of just 3NT, he was probably catering to his partner holding a 6-card @S suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Would seem natural to set up a couple of heart tricks first. He can always come back to spades|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I should pass as N|pg||
nt|hedyg: all his strength is in @c|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|andyv:  six no picnic with small @c lead from W and we saw some similar action yesterday those type of leads|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont think he will attack spades right away|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|daman: nicely done|pg||
nt|jtr: Why not double 2NT?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Can't understand the 2@S bid - if they can open 1@C with 5 diamonds why not give South the chance to rescue himself?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You have to avoid a spade or club lead if you want to defeat 4@H|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I mean the 2@H bid of course|pg||
nt|andyv:  can't win if you pass with those hands|pg||
pc|cA|nt|brolucius: Pretty neat, anyway, to reach a slam after a multi opening.|pg||
nt|jtr: We knew:)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sharkey: Since @H is the communication 4th @H may become good|pg||
nt|haans: N may have corrected to 6nt|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jcmax: East's pass over 1@H is also interesting. In my view passing with that kind of hand makes it so much easier for the opponents to come into the bidding|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps he rated Pass and 5@S (removing the double) as stronger than an immediate 5@S. But I'm not sure whether the hand is worth such a meaning. He has few honors in the majors.|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|andyv:  4N seems like a shot in the dark... i'd have liked to know about the K of @d on this hand|pg||
nt|cicus: now he makes exactly 3|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Board 1 was flat (as I perdicted :))|pg||
nt|cicus: a healty 6 IMP for Angelini|pg||
nt|cuttysark: North may as well go for the ruff - if decalrer had a second diamond loser he would discard it|pg||
nt|cicus: even if he misses that, S also knows to give N a ruff|pg||
nt|jtr: Spec points out that the @c play could be risky|pg||
mc|7|nt|bridge_one: i would take by North first trick|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, depending on their agreements, he might also have been interested in knowing if his partner had a diamond fragment to show|pg||
nt|bobh1: now perhaps shift attention to the other major|pg||
nt|jcmax: The opponents are both ducking. Usually a very good idea when ther is no obvious line of defence. Let declarer play something and at the same tim disrupt his communication a bit.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think the case for taking the first trick in dummy is strong. he wants E to be on lead next, noit W|pg||
nt|bridge_one: for this reason was more easy for declarer to keep 2 entry in the dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: On the other hand; he is not particularly concerned about a diamond switch|pg||
nt|jtr: I am not sure though|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is the Haman rule,  IF you can play 3 nt.....|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not enough tricks in 6NT |pg||
nt|haans: it is that :)|pg||
nt|milton_se: certainly not an easy make|pg||
nt|cicus: Although I did not know from what contract you follow a hand|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Good morning all - sorry I'm late|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good morning Liz. You did not miss anything fancy|pg||

nt|Walddk2: On board 1, the operator in the open room lost the play in 6NT at some point, but eventually we had a claim for 13 tricks. So Lauria must have guessed the line|pg||
nt|daman: is it possible the scoring s not hooked up?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
nt|mariner1: @D play well as W does not have one to lead|pg||
nt|jcmax: But it also depends on your system ofc.|pg||

nt|mariner1: nice 6@C here|pg||
nt|hedyg: they are|pg||
nt|sharkey: slam here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Roland you are on|pg||
nt|hedyg: pass was certainly better than 5 @Hs, the suit is not good enough|pg||

nt|mariner1: nice 4@H NS|pg||

nt|jtr: Wash and Go this time|pg||
nt|jtr: oh not quite|pg||
nt|jtr: If West bids it is|pg||
nt|cicus: there is a small banana skin here|pg||
nt|cicus: but I think W is going to give away the show|pg||
nt|jtr: Roland, someone hasnt heard of Wash&Go|pg||
nt|cicus: I think everyone would bid some 2-suited call as west, hard to blame|pg||
nt|jtr: That should double your royalty|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: viene momentaneamente sospeso il gioco per contestare la licita di n-s del board 18|pg||
nt|cicus: ah, NS discussing bd 18 bidding?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yes|pg||
nt|peachy: or a ruling?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: It as fairly clear that they did not know what they were doing, but EW have not been damaged|pg||
nt|cicus: nly by their own bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pulga thought 2@H would be a transfer to 2@S. Rinaldi was not on the same wavelength, but as Liz said, E-W have not been damaged|pg||
nt|sybarra: we can guess,  bet it went K of @D  etc |pg||
nt|roswolf: really 13 tricks?|pg||
nt|daman: making 4 or 5 Roberta?|pg||
nt|hedyg: your pd will not bid @cs imo|pg||
nt|brolucius: It was about a 50-50 decision, whether to protect on the North cards. I suppose you are just as likely to gain IMPs by passing as by doubling. As Andy says, North should certainly ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: consider bidding.|pg||
nt|hedyg: they might go home tonight..|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, the spade ruff must have been taken, surely. |pg||
nt|milton_se: apparently played a spader as down 1|pg||
nt|brolucius: I was watching closely...|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: I am not sure I would have understood that 2@H either|pg||
nt|april7: its a mistake for sure|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think 4|pg||
nt|daman: not 7|pg||
nt|sybarra: give a sec |pg||

nt|bridge_one: 1@D 4+cards|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: PI% 4|pg||
nt|daman: made 4    thanks Roberta|pg||
nt|april7: small @S lead is best agains a @S contract|pg||
nt|daman: Giorgio     does 1@D always pronise a 4 card major?|pg||
nt|roswolf: this could be interesting |pg||
nt|bridge_one: no, 1@D only 4+@D|pg||
nt|daman: since they play weak NT|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: it't 3NT+4|pg||
nt|mariner1: interesting breaks here|pg||
nt|hedyg: dealer having fun this segment|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW can make 5@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In that case we will have no match tomorrow morning. The women's final is also all but over|pg||
nt|jcmax: Is this partnership playing the Lauria-Versace card? Anyone knows?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes they are|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: HE IS TALKING WITH FRANCHI ABOUT THE LATEST BOARD|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: We do not have a score on board 1 in this room, that's all|pg||
nt|daman: thanks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes, they are still playing board 17. 6@S|pg||
nt|hedyg: 6@s on bd 1, after 9 tricks declarer thinking since a while what to play on opps small @h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But the thing is that you can't bid this making slam|pg||
nt|daman: is Lauria on this team?|pg||
nt|daman: or another?|pg||
nt|daman: I do not have the link to find out|pg||
nt|jtr: On the contrary, E/W had the chance of a better score|pg||
nt|cicus: the death sentence of the @HQ is now signed|pg||
nt|cuttysark: These transfers in competition are wonderful - reminds you of the very beginning of transfers when everyone forgot|pg||
nt|jtr: lol|pg||
nt|andyv:  and why would N be so certain that there is no fit?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  don't care for 2@c bid here... looks like a 3|pg||
nt|hedyg: he is on this team, playing with Giubilo i think|pg||
mb|4C|nt|brolucius: The North hand is hard to express, with so many bids being weak nowadays.|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@c bid to me|pg||
nt|lestergold: N/S 4h can be made  double dummy- but not even Nunes would do it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Modern methods will reveal that you are off one ace and the queen of trump|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Hello everybody|pg||
nt|brolucius: Between Pass and 1NT on the North cards. I like the Pass, really.|pg||
nt|hedyg: is that the correct name Roland?|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Liz :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: hi liz!|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Liz|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Valerio Giubilo|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphztg: np|pg||
nt|roswolf: they may well get to 4@S|pg||

mb|4H|nt|hedyg: precision 2@c opening|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@s makes |pg||
nt|bobh1: slam not terrible|pg||
nt|cicus: agree with 4@H?|pg||
nt|hedyg: N passed the 1@s bid..and E balanced|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Looks a bit much to me - balanced quacks|pg||
nt|jtr: Seems reasonable|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: headed to 4@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe to 6@S|pg||
nt|lml: which on the lie of the cards will make a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Liz|pg||
nt|bobh1: 3rd seat favorable liberties|pg||
nt|cicus: I find the hand has too many losers and you won't shut out spades if they have them|pg||
nt|jtr: I dont want to indicate i have any defence|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C is Gazzilli|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Either natural or any 16+. Forcing|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is rather a weak point of Acol, widely played in the UK, that South cannot respond 1NT in case North has 15-16 balanced. He might then pass and a game would be missed.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The systemic response is 2@D = 8+ hcp|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: i would feel sick if my opponents bid this to 6 spades - I hate lucky slams|pg||
nt|hedyg: Giammi on BBO|pg||
nt|andyv:  and OR is in that contract|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I abstain, also regarding the 2@H overcall|pg||
pc|cA|nt|daman: whack|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this is getting exciing|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1@C forcing Roberta?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S has play EW here|pg||
nt|bobh1: if the @cs were 4-3 and the @ds 3-3 i guess|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and harts 22|pg||
nt|sybarra: dashed right into it |pg||
nt|daman: vaulted|pg||
nt|roswolf: YUP ITALIAN BOLD NESS|pg||
nt|brolucius: The bidding followed a predictable path in the Open Room. I don't like North's 2@D much.|pg||
nt|hedyg: passing 1@s seems reasonable opposite a passed hand|pg||
nt|xenya: but 3N looks playable here|pg||
nt|brolucius: If South was not a passed hand, 2@S by North seems better than 2@D. (Of course, this will provoke howls of protest from French kibitzers and many Americans too.)|pg||
nt|hedyg: he must have been hoping for 2@H by pd and would maybe bid 2@s then|pg||
nt|jcmax: I wonder whether 3@D here has Lebensohl annotations or whether Lauria just thinks: he is going to bid on in @H anyway|pg||
nt|hedyg: S too stong for a 2@s raise?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Some top Acol pair have therefore adopted an artificial rebid of 2@C. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: But N-S are not a regular partnership|pg||
nt|cicus: maybe Pulga not sure it also applies by a passed hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pulga and Rinaldi have been partners all weekend|pg||
nt|cuttysark: In Acol South responds 2@C, 1-round force - no great problem here|pg||
nt|brolucius: Is Rinaldi a late riser?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jcmax: The West hand has only 14 hcp, but it is immensely control-rich with 4 1st-round controls. It might be an idea to open a strong club instead.|pg||
nt|hedyg: N showed @hs by X but Versace decided it would be too costly to defend|pg||
nt|mariner1: I think W should open 1@C here,,,,,,, just too much for 2@C|pg||
nt|hedyg: he cannot open 1@c if they play precision|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why not?|pg||
nt|april7: N can't be shortened with @D so will make because @C behave|pg||
nt|roswolf: this should just lose the obvious tricks|pg||
nt|bridge_one: @S lead from A106 can lose a trick, so K in @C seam natural|pg||
pc|c5|nt|daman: duh|pg||
nt|andyv:  E can't dbl|pg||
nt|daman: I'm all for the red card|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I doubt it|pg||
nt|brolucius: North was worth 3@H, easily.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Seems very conservative|pg||
nt|andyv:  N seemed worth of one try|pg||
nt|hedyg: do you all as E? i like to bid with an ace a major|pg||
nt|hedyg: especially with the ace in my suit|pg||
nt|hedyg: do you all pass*|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I never pass with an ace|pg||
nt|andyv:  i never have an ace to pass with|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think vulnerable there is too great a risk of losing a lot of 100s|pg||
nt|hedyg: good, i am not alone|pg||
nt|brolucius: North's hand was better than it looks. He had minor honors in partner's suits (just where you want them) and aces outside, where you need quick tricks. Some players would have bid ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: more than 3@H on those values.|pg||
nt|mariner1: can they get to 5@D?|pg||
nt|hedyg: you mean to 4@H?|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|lestergold: its not ust a matter of taking a first round heart hook|pg||
nt|andyv:  his hand went down hill with 4@c bid|pg||
nt|daman: our side had an automatic tap|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the other room East passed in 1st seat; then South opened a Multi, and E-W reached 4@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Board 2 that is|pg||
nt|lestergold: a lot of work to o even double dummy to make this|pg||
nt|daman: really|pg||
nt|andyv:  tough lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: if he puts up qS and plays to run a low heart it would have chances|pg||
nt|hedyg: because he is not strong enough|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He could upgrade the hand which I think he should|pg||
nt|jcmax: After a 2@C opening I don't believe there is any chance one can get to 6@C. not that I necessarily believe one should be there.|pg||
nt|andyv:  but common practice is to not let pd play 1@c if you have any type of bid available|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Even 1NT is an underbid|pg||
nt|bobh1: sometimes opening like this can keep the opps out of a cold gtame|pg||
nt|andyv:  first swing board|pg||
nt|april7: the 10 of @S made E forbid leading @S|pg||
nt|mariner1: no I mean 5@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Gianluca Luca from the FIGB is pretty sure that they will carry on tomorrow morning regardless of the score|pg||
nt|hedyg: good|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Gianluca Frola, sorry|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: GIANLUCA LUCA, nice =)|pg||
nt|jcmax: A lot depends on whether Lauria's 3@D was a constructive bid or just anything|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4 @H will work as it turns out|pg||
nt|hedyg: can even make 11 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: 4@H is much closer that 5@D in my opinion|pg||
nt|mariner1: Open Room is in 5@D|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sharkey: heavy opening - some would have selected 2 NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Looks natural to me. Jump shift, 19-21, 5+ clubs, 4 spades|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yes|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - N's 3@S stronger than 4@S - they may be on their way|pg||
nt|andyv:  and an expensive one it would seem|pg||
nt|bobh1: this will even things up i thing|pg||
nt|mariner1: Open Room is in 4@S so we should have a very close match now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@s  in the sleep for me|pg||
nt|bobh1: have to fault E I think|pg||
nt|bobh1: After rdbl, red at imps, I'm bidding game|pg||
nt|haans: depend on what xx did mean|pg||
nt|ralfwil: And easier after 3@h from S|pg||
nt|andyv:  I agree|pg||
nt|bobh1: unless rdbl means something other than what i think|pg||
nt|mariner1: and no @S lead? :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: about 6% i think|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think better|pg||
nt|marlowepi: spade lead not the issue|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I am sure you would bid at the table Roland :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: 12 tricks is a lot in the other room|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe only 1 too many |pg||
nt|april7: before there were 13 tricks, also impossible|pg||
nt|hedyg: you prefer 2@s to bidding out your hand David?|pg||
nt|xenya: @C lead is tough to find?|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@D, then correcting 2@H to 2@S shows more than a minimum in the UK. You raise to 2@S on a minimum hand.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @c is killing with 3 entries on E|pg||
nt|andyv:  major suits have been eliminated... so @c or @d seem to be your only choices|pg||
nt|hedyg: spec tells me that from previous session we might assume that 1@s does not necessarily promise 4 cards|pg||
nt|andyv:  and @c lead may be slight pref. to preserve entries in partner's hand (if he has @ds)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|marlowepi: maybe better than 6% but even below roland stanmdards which says it all|pg||
nt|xenya: well maybe not -- unbid suit -- still you don't want to lead from Hx|pg||
nt|cuttysark: He had a horrible time on the equivalent session yesterday - maybe he opted out|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You see a standard Gazzilli auction in the open room|pg||
pc|c2|nt|brolucius: If it is being suggested that East should double 4@H, then I don't agree at all. His club values are worthless in defence.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: slow 4S may force South to pass|pg||
nt|sharkey: just thinking the same Victor :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is a horrible, room consuming auction. No-one knows how many keycards they are missing|pg||
nt|odysseus69: South must bid slam now|pg||
nt|andyv:  or maybe you do:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@H being 5332  16-18|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: if east doubled4h then Nunes might well make it|pg||
nt|andyv:  I agree David|pg||
nt|bobh1: at matchpoints i might tread more carefully|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes after 3@H E knows W has @H shortage so nothing wasted|pg||
nt|andyv:  even if it means something else, W's willingness to play at 3 level should have been enough for E to go to game|pg||
nt|haans: if W bid 4@H it can still be corrected|pg||
nt|hedyg: no double|pg||
nt|brolucius: A lead of the @S9, at some time, would give E/W four spade tricks. |pg||
pc|sA|nt|sharkey: forgetting female intuition Roland|pg||
nt|cicus: in real world you are never dealt ideal hands for your conventions|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this can also be killing|pg||
nt|jcmax: I can't help feeling there must have been something constructive about Lauria's sequence|pg||
nt|haans: free 3@D?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|mariner1: K&R (A865 AJ8 AJ5432 ---) = 17.60|pg||
nt|lml: 6@S went down even after the diamond lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: to me hand is easily a 1@C opener|pg||
nt|lml: in the OR|pg||
nt|lml: on the first board|pg||
nt|lml: even if you open 1@C it is not clear to me you will get to a slam|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The hand is worth 17.6 on the K&R Hand Evaluator, so it would not be unreasonable to upgrade to 16+, would it?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.jeffgoldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=Axxx+AJx+-+AJxxxx|pg||
nt|lml: you have a minimum 1@C opener and partner has a minimum positive|pg||
nt|hedyg: but what is it worth when pd has no fit?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, nothing to worry about, and the opponents are feeling sick in a minute or two|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The slam is below par|pg||
nt|odysseus69: but satisfies the RW test - it makes|pg||
nt|sharkey: slightly less than 50%....|pg||
nt|sharkey: S thinking Grand??|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Because she has no idea as to how many aces partner has|pg||
nt|ralfwil: As W my bid is 2nt showing an offensive limit with a 4-card @s support|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|daman: I would take my chances|pg||
nt|brolucius: 100 instead of 50 is not worth much. If instead your double tips declarer into the winning line, you will have a big headache for a while.|pg||
nt|andyv:  he did bid 3@s directly over 3@h|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think also you have to be aware they could be jerking you around|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Instead of RD|pg||
nt|andyv:  trust partner and you don't have to worry that much about the opps|pg||
nt|bobh1: at these colors quite likely|pg||
nt|hedyg: he could have passed 3@H with nothing|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mariner1: in that case you pass :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no chance of bidding 7 - just reflecting about life|pg||
nt|hedyg: small @c= odd nr of cards with honor or even nr without|pg||
nt|andyv:  with 3 entries, E will have time to set up the @Cs|pg||
nt|xenya: @S now looks natural -- you need those tricks anyway|pg||
nt|andyv:  is there a throw in at the end for 9th trick?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If S plays @sK from the table and E wins to play another @c, S can make with a throw in. So E must duck @sK|pg||
nt|jcmax: Oh sorry. I misread the auction all the time! thought W had doubled 2@S :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|lml: Sabine, would you upgrade that to 1@C?|pg||
nt|sharkey: we'll never know|pg||
nt|sybarra: revoke in other room? |pg||
nt|cicus: some time was at trick 1, never again|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: youdouble and no bang down of the ace of hearts thats for sure|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|daman: look  partner overcalled red   I double|pg||
nt|sybarra: can not figure this out |pg||
nt|mariner1: yes E could have passed 2@S so 3@D RED vs white shows something|pg||
mc|10|nt|daman: jitters|pg||
nt|sybarra: some suggested @D lead |pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe lost the trump ace in with the clubs?|pg||
nt|april7: why?|pg||
nt|andyv:  @h finesse now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Another spade and Fantoni is toast no matter what he does|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The heart finesse can wait|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the same position if S plays another @s to @sK and E plays @sA|pg||
nt|andyv:  can it?  I think you get locked in dummy if you wait|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What do you suggest East does after spade to the king?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer seems to be in trouble (reaching his hand after another spade is ducked), but East will have no good play when he wins the third spade. |pg||
nt|ralfwil: No @h finess yet. Will break the communications|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|brolucius: True. I was looking at the suit in isolation.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Maybe he did on a different line|pg||
nt|brolucius: How many times have I heard players say 'I had to double them after your overcall!'  An overcall shows playing strength in the suit bid, not necessarily much defence. How many ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: tricks did East hold himself?|pg||
nt|lestergold: west didnt get in to his spade  but Nunes has to lose a dim 2 hearts and a club whatever|pg||
nt|daman: Roberta   he was -2|pg||
nt|lestergold: -2 more likely than making not possible at that point|pg||

nt|eugenio123: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Eugenio Mistretta|pg||
nt|eugenio123: ty|pg||
nt|cicus: it seems it can be set by the ruff in @Ds|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I guess Pulga is going to open 2@d|pg||
nt|cicus: if s is going to play it|pg||
nt|eugenio123: most of italian players use this convention to show 18/20 balanced|pg||
nt|april7: 3@C by NS and only 2@H by EW if defended correctly|pg||
nt|bridge_one: sry, before i thoght E/W made only 2 tricks, not 3|pg||
nt|andyv:  no, i think the throw in worked....S's last 4 cards should be !Jx, @cA4....E would have !AQ and @cxxx....and has to make pitch|pg||
nt|brolucius: Rinaldi is complaining to Roberta: 'So, what help did Hedy give me there, just when I needed it?' |pg||
mb|1C|nt|bobh1: a slam ew|pg||
nt|bobh1: not a good one|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes but can they make it|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@H 14+5+@H|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Forcing|pg||
mb|1H|nt|daman: this is one of their 11-13 bids|pg||
nt|jcmax: Yes, definitely. thought I already had said that. :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or East|pg||
nt|jcmax: There seem to be a lot of 2-suiters.But we have yet to see someone bid one|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S EW has play|pg||
nt|mariner1: can also be beat best defense|pg||
nt|bridge_one: both down if play game|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|andyv:  Rinaldi should have listened to me:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: Q@H drops so 10 @H in pocket, Q@C in pocker.......|pg||
nt|jcmax: The question is: Can EW find out they have a @S-stopper if N bids @S|pg||
nt|cicus: another easy game - Villa not favoured by the dealing machine|pg||
mb|d|nt|hedyg: that is when you went flying|pg||
nt|april7: without ruffing value E should pass|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5422 is an acceptable pattern for 1NT, not 5-4 in the majors though|pg||
nt|mariner1: pocket|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We could be in for another Gazzilli auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: 1@H would show 14+ points, so Fantoni has to open at the two-level.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which system do E-W play? Livorno Diamond?|pg||
nt|mariner1: @S lead causes issues if W plays it|pg||
nt|jcmax: But it seems EW are not playing strong club, because now West opened 1@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nightmare-ish I suppose|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Michaels and inflation |pg||
nt|sharkey: NS can make 4@C here|pg||
nt|sharkey: Of course 3 NT no problem without @S lead|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2C=majors- 2D- you pick|pg||
nt|ritong: any imp counts, players like versace play to optimize every board reasonably|pg||
nt|brolucius: With four tens, even a timid bidder such as myself would have opened the North hand.|pg||
nt|daman: 11 HCP   4 10's   2 1/2 quick tricks    would anyone open the North hand/|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N will end it|pg||
nt|mariner1: have to play S for the AJx @D and that is not intuitive|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If only we had their CC, but we don't|pg||
nt|eugenio123: anyway it doesn't seem hard to reach to 4@h|pg||
nt|cicus: I'd probably give it a try myself if I did not regularly played a strong club|pg||
nt|roswolf: i dont like the double by north - perhaps trying to get the last board and set back!?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The open room has it|pg||
nt|brolucius: How delightful to see someone passing the North hand.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mariner1: 2@S here showing @H and a minor|pg||
nt|april7: needs a 4th @C and a @H less to X|pg||
nt|haans: cue twice|pg||
nt|hedyg: movie says = maybe entries by Roberta were not quite right|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lestergold: 4h for sure here|pg||
nt|daman: Roberta said she will correct it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: she has|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n makes too|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3NT also OK.|pg||
nt|daman: thanks Roberta|pg||
nt|mariner1: well there goes the 1@C arguement :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Kib informs me they bid slam OR as well previous board|pg||
nt|odysseus69: East rushes to pick hearts|pg||
nt|ritong: even if they are not super happy with the contract:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N is the spot Open Room|pg||
nt|andyv:  reality gets in the way of these slams|pg||
nt|bobh1: fantoni nunes avoided the bad slam on the first board|pg||
nt|bobh1: wonder if they will bid the one that makes|pg||
nt|haans: slam do not feel natural|pg||
nt|bridge_one: pass by West probably bec open in 3th position|pg||
nt|jcmax: In Italy I believe Ghestem is quite popular, so this may actually specifically show @S+@D|pg||
nt|bobh1: 2n maybe shows some values in the context of having passed|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I am giving it a go at the moment, but it rarley comes up :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes and a lack of aces should devalue the hand too|pg||
nt|bridge_one: dbl means 4@s - with 13hcp need|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 3-3 in @s and find the @dJ will make|pg||
nt|andyv:  W may invite with 4N|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2N asking the minor probably|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: As played by the (in)famous Lanzarotti-Buratti many years ago|pg||
nt|odysseus69: so 2 east West pairs upset by last- 2 N/s pairs jubilant|pg||
nt|daman: I would open|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I would, I am afraid|pg||
nt|jtr: I guess he completes the transer with a weak NT|pg||
nt|cicus: I expected a transfer here|pg||
nt|eugenio123: now I wonder what is 2@h ,they should play transfer |pg||
nt|andyv:  but 4-5 is for Roland:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: I UNDESTANDED|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Looks like a weak NT to me :)|pg||
nt|milton_se: he may be as old as us :)|pg||
nt|cicus: 3@H nonforcing, I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: When logic and proportion, Have fallen sloppy dead, And the White Knight is|pg||
nt|mariner1: talking backwards, And the Red Queen's "off with her head!", Remember what|pg||
nt|mariner1: the dormouse said :|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now, is this a transfer or not (look at board 18)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: shows 5-5|pg||
nt|brolucius: This rebid promises five hearts. It is another weakness of standard systems that 3@H can sometimes be a strong hand with only four hearts. Responder may then have to guess what to ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: do next.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lml: I noticed Minardo bid 1@H over 1@D|pg||
nt|haans: bid slam on this and you will never win|pg||
nt|mariner1: "Bid those Roland slams" :)|pg||
nt|bobh1: i don't think Fantunes will bid this one either|pg||
nt|andyv:  they didn't|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes Ghestem would pinpoint the suits|pg||
nt|jtr: Looks like it is lol|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pulga thinks it is|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Maybe it is a constructive, not forcing bid? Unlucky that it has wrongsided the game|pg||
nt|cicus: are you sure David  1@D showed @Hs?|pg||
nt|peachy: they may still not be on same wavelength|pg||
nt|jtr: Looks like it|pg||
nt|cuttysark: North thinks it is a transfer. He likes transfers?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|odysseus69: 200 only|pg||
nt|sharkey: beats 130|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Don't be afraid, open|pg||
nt|brolucius: No need to apologize for making a sensible bid.|pg||
nt|daman: OMG  if Roland would open?   then it has to be right :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  they invinted 10-12 NTs for timid bidders|pg||
nt|hedyg: right! we would all open|pg||
nt|andyv:  invented|pg||
nt|hedyg: primes and great spots|pg||
nt|hedyg: plus a 5 card suit|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I know some players who would reach 3NT on the East-West cards|pg||
nt|april7: but its not always good!!!|pg||
nt|jcmax: But as the cards lie 5@D would also make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Very tough to diagnose the combined spade stopper|pg||
pc|c8|nt|lml: whenever I do that I end in the 3-3 but they are headed to 3NT here|pg||
nt|daman: I am informed that 1@D promises a 4 card major  otherwise a weak NT 12-14   fixed by the system    is that true?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Meanwhile, E/W have bid the hand commendably - realising that they had no middle cards and staying low.|pg||
nt|mariner1: then 2N asking range?|pg||
nt|bobh1: bad trump break|pg||
nt|bridge_one: normally the pairs who play ghestem in Italy use the exclusion rule (so 3@C means no @C)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think they use micheal's|pg||
nt|jcmax: My own partnership has recently switched from unspecified 2-suiters to ghestem. We believe in many situation it is just so important to know the 2nd suit|pg||
nt|jtr: Some play that you complete with any minimum hand|pg||
nt|eugenio123: what's going on?|pg||
nt|cicus: S gives up|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|bobh1: if they were down more going in maybe|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the disvantage to play ghestem is to lose 3@C preemptive overcall|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@H is significantly better than 4@S was at the other table|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not a triumph for Gazzilli|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ralfwil: but 100 on EW|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: ty daman|pg||
nt|daman: what 100 are you referring to Ralf/|pg||
nt|hedyg: must be a relay bid|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N fails on a @S lead from N|pg||
nt|jcmax: if it was Ghestem, then 2N would most likely ask for the range. 3@C would be MIN. And who would disagree with that?:)|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, something is going off|pg||
nt|cicus: he does not want to play 6@H doubled|pg||
nt|jtr: Another discussion will ensue|pg||
nt|cicus: taing away Fantoni's time|pg||
nt|hedyg: should Nunes invite opposite 12-14?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: understanded =p|pg||
nt|mariner1: Open Room in 5@D here|pg||
nt|ritong: Qx facing Jxx is relatively easy|pg||
nt|ritong: for 0xx is not really possible|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ralfwil: board 3|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h down 2|pg||
nt|daman: ok|pg||
nt|sharkey: don't see that N can Dbl this - too risky|pg||
nt|cicus: *taking|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I don't know if they can respect the contract, I guess they can't|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Spectator: Are these guys experts? I understand the question, but they usually are. Everyone can have misunderstandings|pg||
nt|cicus: BTW it seems to me 1@D was some negative reply|pg||
nt|jtr: Nothing makes sense to me|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I know both of them ( Pulga Rinaldi ) and they used to play well|pg||
nt|jtr: Except that 2@h was misunderstood|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Maybe they are not a regular partnership? This does not look like a complicated position|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, when your pd plays them well|pg||

nt|tendenz: Hi all, 1@H is 3+ cards, 1@S is 3+cards, because they cannot bid 1nt. 1nt is an artificial answer, transfer for @C (weak or strong)|pg||
nt|lml: thanks ... makes sense|pg||
nt|jcmax: Oh so good to have an expert on the system, grazie!!!!|pg||

pc|c6|nt|tendenz: You wellcome, I usually play with Matteucci|pg||
nt|hedyg: ah!|pg||

nt|andyv:  qj8x....tough lead|pg||
nt|haans: and soon @HQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the other room declarer went down in 5@D when he pitched a heart on the 3rd round of spades|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ritong: i do not know if they have special treatments with three suiters, but bypassing @ss looks dangerous to me with west hand|pg||

nt|april7: here it was successful|pg||
nt|roswolf: re|pg||
nt|brolucius: Surprising mix-up in the Open Room. What is so special about these hands that you should not be able to reach 4@H?|pg||

nt|jcmax: Sry, got dc'ed. That was a fine bidding sequence by EW in my opinion.|pg||
nt|cicus: hearts never mentioned in OR bidding |pg||
pc|dK|nt|odysseus69: I agree - 4 tricks not enough and if 1 down not worth the pressure|pg||
nt|cicus: I think the main reason why they lost|pg||
nt|cicus: if you want to build a serious partnership, discussion should begin at the 3rd roungd of bidding, not end there|pg||
nt|cuttysark: One would think that 1@C-1@D would come quite early in the system file|pg||
nt|jtr: I guess they just didnt prepare for this as much as they should|pg||
pc|d5|nt|tendenz: 1@d is natural, or only 2+ wit 18-20 bal hand|pg||
mc|11|nt|hedyg: needs the @d tricks|pg||

pc|c4|nt|jain: very rarely u cld pass but here he had 2 K's nd for sure a known 5 2 fit was better than a 4 3 fit|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Excellent slam (by my standards). I would be surprised if they don't bid it|pg||
nt|daman: casual*|pg||
nt|hedyg: bd 19 OR in 4@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: nw a slam NS|pg||
nt|cicus: mentally|pg||
nt|eugenio123: it seems to be an easy hand|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not a great start for Vill Fabbriche - too early in the morning?|pg||
nt|cicus: here comes a good result for them|pg||
nt|roswolf: this hand will be a tempter for n/s|pg||
nt|sybarra: tempting for what?|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR, N on lead led a @s and declarer went after @hs rather than @ds... down 1|pg||
nt|cuttysark: More Gazzilli in the other room|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mariner1: 3N NS here as well|pg||
nt|roswolf: a disaster|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: It should be called a GIB (or Deep Finesse) slam, not a Roland slam.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: You would, of course, take the double diamond finesse Roland - maybe a small entry problem?|pg||
nt|daman: it might be possible with a strong club auction    but a 2@C auction?   do they have the room?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No entry problem|pg||
nt|andyv:  a finesse and a dbl finesse....yes... good slam, Roland:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: now|pg||
nt|daman: there are 4 sessions of bridge left    Fabbriche needs to slowly cip away at the iceberg to the tune of 20 IMPs per session    a tall order but Padova almost did it yeaterday|pg||
nt|sybarra: it just doesnt fit |pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3Nt down with K@S in West - otherwise could be make if opps don't play @H|pg||
nt|daman: chip*|pg||
nt|hedyg: if he goes after @ds and S plays Q@H he is down 2|pg||
nt|hedyg: after the @s lead|pg||
nt|haans: 4-4 in spades would ha be enough|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H has play here|pg||
nt|brolucius: A spade lead beats 5@D, setting up a spade trick before the club discard is available. |pg||
mb|1D|nt|Walddk2: 1NT 12-14 (in theory)|pg||
nt|andyv:  everyone likes 6@c.....i make bets they don't find that one|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgewithdan.com/systems/grainger_lavee_nightmare_2005.pdf    Nightmare as played by Grainger-Lavee from Canada|pg||

nt|sharkey: Battle of the part scores coming up|pg||
nt|bobh1: vulnerable to a @c ruff but not on this layout|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@C has an issue with a @D lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: this kind of misfit seems to get people overboard|pg||
nt|milton_se: maybe tough to stay out of 5D|pg||
mb|1N|an| |mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 1@D = hearts|pg||

nt|odysseus69: conservative 3D bid unless it sahows full values|pg||
nt|Walddk2: even 4@C is too high|pg||
nt|sharkey: N's making up for it by overbidding|pg||
nt|carleone22: oynuyosun su topu :)|pg||
nt|jcmax: This will not be easy to bid in my view|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Franchi Montanari are juniores|pg||
nt|jcmax: we can all see slam makes. But how should it be bid?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: many asked about that|pg||
nt|daman: South should pass|pg||
mb|3N|nt|daman: a classic Roland slam|pg||
nt|brolucius: Let's see if West can visualize a slam now...|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3NT is an alternative contract.|pg||
nt|cicus: tough. hard to evaluate @CKQ not knowing partner's shortness|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 4H not a hopeless contract to b in but would fail here maybe by even two tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  nice fitting hands and a very nebulous 4@h which might be bid if E/W were vul|pg||
nt|jcmax: do we know how strong the 1NT opening is?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1NT 12-15|pg||
nt|mariner1: they can beat 2@H however should N dbl? not to me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think he should pass|pg||
nt|mariner1: just a little different dist EW and this would make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am lost|pg||
nt|sharkey: S thinking slam...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 4H?|pg||
nt|sharkey: How many points in this deck of cards?|pg||
nt|sharkey: N not done - or...?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@D 4cards|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes kibbers are calling for 6@D|pg||
nt|jcmax: The key issue is probably the singleton @S|pg||
nt|bobh1: 6@d makes not 6@c|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H does not necessarily show hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 3@d might make|pg||
nt|sybarra: calm heads prevailed here|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2nt or 3@C would be bid by a sizeable section of players when they should just pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: will west lie|pg||
nt|hedyg: Roland said jacks should be worth 1/2 hcp|pg||
nt|andyv:  1@h=xfer to @s|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@s now is usefull for all ...|pg||
nt|bobh1: to figure that out you'd need to see the opp's hands|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3Nt 4@c i think|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now a push|pg||
nt|brolucius: You would have to offer odds of six T-shirts to one, to get any takers.|pg||
nt|andyv:  i'd have to borrow them from Roland|pg||
nt|brolucius: If South leads a low spade, this will make life easy in 3NT.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: conservatism will pay here|pg||
nt|lestergold: need t uess spade to make 9 tricks|pg||
nt|brolucius: When there was a slight pause, I thought the players were taking a smoking break. This reminded me of an item of news today that RyanAir were going to sell no-smoke cigarettes on ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: their flights (Â£6 for 6), which give you some nicotine when you suck on them. I wonder if this product will be allowed at bridge tables.|pg||
nt|mariner1: nice discilined pass|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@C shape inquiry|pg||
nt|cicus: 30 HCP balanced, but @S109 makes a big difference|pg||
nt|brolucius: You said you had 16 yesterday.|pg||
nt|andyv:  moi?  never!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now he confirms hearts|pg||
nt|haans: hearts or max|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|daman: I understand Roberta |pg||
nt|daman: do you have shares in that stock david/|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, she said (I guess) that all the scoring problems are due to using a French computer.|pg||
nt|sharkey: My assumptions about part scores is wrong|pg||
nt|daman: I put my money on 3 NT    maybe 4NT at most|pg||
nt|jcmax: So now N bid 3@S. does S know this is the A? I would say not and expect 3NT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: fix @C interst for slam|pg||
nt|bobh1: if 3@c is anything close to natural, N has a nice hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: and now 4@c|pg||
nt|bobh1: 4@c now would tend to say that 3@s was the A|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Spade  5|pg||
nt|andyv:  i was still into cokes... didn't realize everyone changed to t-shirts:)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sharkey: the battle that is|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not sure why they are not bidding the hands they are dealt, says a spectator. He may have a point|pg||
nt|odysseus69: they are playing a game with which I am not familiar- a famous quote|pg||
nt|hedyg: so he really has very little|pg||
nt|mariner1: there is a replay of the Tour @D'Italia on TV now so all I need is some pasta and|pg||
nt|mariner1: vino :)|pg||
nt|cicus: they can try 4@H which also fails|pg||
nt|cicus: 1NT was limited to 9 HCPs|pg||
nt|brolucius: On @CJ lead, it seems that 3NT makes. If North wins with the ace, declarer has nine tricks. If he ducks, declarer can develop a second heart trick.|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|lml: it was too  much to bid vulnerable without a clear fit|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I offer a beer if less than 10 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  same contract in OR so only wondering if any imp swings|pg||
nt|andyv:  martini, Ralf|pg||
nt|jcmax: Since EW no doubt will get to 4@H, maybe we can discuss the right technical play of the @H suit here|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jcmax: it depends on what double means. Optional would be good here promising at least 3@H and the majority of hcp. The Polish like to play that way.|pg||
nt|bobh1: i'm guessing 11|pg||
nt|haans: seems fair|pg||
nt|haans: 11|pg||
nt|brolucius: My lawyers will check the transcript from yesterday.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Walddk2: Fantoni refuses to cue bid with an aceless hand|pg||
nt|jtr: Checking for the @s Quee soon i guess|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hedyg: sure|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Disappointing. They can't win if they don't bid their cold slams|pg||
nt|daman: J10's are worth 3/4 of a point|pg||
nt|hedyg: puppet sequence|pg||
nt|andyv:  W has nothing to offer|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|sharkey: perhaps they're counting Vienna points?|pg||
nt|brolucius: A brave gamble, George. Do you have Scottish ancestors?|pg||
nt|daman: none|pg||
nt|hedyg: must have|pg||
nt|daman: 100% Irish|pg||
nt|bobh1: lauria is tricky but not that tricky|pg||
nt|mariner1: Open Room EW are in 4@H DBL here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now 4@S means A, otherwise another bid|pg||
nt|jcmax: don't underestimate him! )|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i dont know if they play turbo with @C trump|pg||
mc|12|nt|cuttysark: We are not mean - just careful|pg||
nt|andyv:  meanwhile on board 19, S did get to 4@hs|pg||
nt|jtr: How do we play this @s suit?  Odds must be close|pg||
nt|cicus: spades lie most favourably, even after a @D ruff you won't lose 2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How would you play the hand on say a club lead?|pg||
nt|cicus: take in hand and lead a small spade to 10|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Playing the spade suit for one loser is not the only problem|pg||
nt|haans: be right|pg||
nt|jcmax: How to play any suit among other things depends first of all on how many tricks one needs in that suit.|pg||
nt|cicus: hand is simply too hard to solve|pg||

nt|mariner1: 6@H ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: wel congrats anyhow :)|pg||

nt|cuttysark: They had better accept my notes in England!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would be surprised if benito's principle was quite as general as that. more likely:  lead your side-suit singleton when you have 2-3 trumps|pg||
nt|cicus: well at the Bermuda Bowl plaers were discouraged fom appealing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C  14+ with clubs or 15+ balanced. Forcing|pg||
nt|jtr: 5@d was quickly defeated next door|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s seem to have got a little too high for no real reason in the other room|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|brolucius: If anything interesting happens on this deal, I am a Dutchman.|pg||
nt|andyv:  get the shoes out, David|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N has play EW|pg||
nt|lml: its always nice to have a new toy|pg||
nt|jcmax: Anyway, I was saying that in my view the Poles are the best in this world at doubling cooperatively. The Italians are good when one has a takeout dbl that the other one can pass.|pg||
nt|hedyg: Fantoni did not bother to play @c when in with A@s, he switched to @H, might go down in 4 @H now|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2NT usually played as forcing to game (in spades) nowadays. Some used to play it as at least a game-try.|pg||
nt|andyv:  E defense a bit soft... should have taken @d and led back @s|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes, but there the TDs consulted|pg||
nt|cicus: true|pg||
nt|cuttysark: One wonders why 5@D rather than 5@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@S  0-11  no 4-card major|pg||
nt|jtr: East could maybe have given the option with 4NT on the bidding next door|pg||
nt|cicus: west bid a natural 1@D in OR|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@s X vs failing 4@H|pg||
nt|andyv:  N/S may get pushed to 4@s|pg||
nt|andyv:  cards certainly don't suggest they bid it freely|pg||
nt|mariner1: do not think this is biddable though...........|pg||
nt|haans: bal 18-19|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: 2@C for me now would be majors|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@C/@D down always|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1Nt weak for E/W|pg||
nt|mariner1:  a true Roland slam|pg||
nt|jcmax: In a slam ofc. There was big discussion at the time whether Roland's 2nd line was right or his 1st. The 2nd wouldn't have worked. Luckily she chose the 2nd, we won the match and ...|pg||
nt|jcmax: later the whole event. Small difference. :)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|andyv:  1S xfer to NT|pg||
nt|sharkey: Back to good ole 3 NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  which is what happened in OR... now S doesn't have 9 tricks without risking contract|pg||
nt|jcmax: I know only one thing: it is impossible to always find the winning lead.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: may be pass|pg||
nt|jtr: Lauria found a great lead I wonder why South didnt bid 4@h for the lead?|pg||
nt|cicus: 1NT does that for them, hopefully|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Have they discussed 1NT I wonder|pg||
nt|jtr: South is wondering too|pg||
nt|peachy: I was just about to wonder the same|pg||
nt|cuttysark: North seems determined to test partner's knowledge of the system|pg||
nt|peachy: it must be frustrating for all 4 players when one side is on shaky footing|pg||
nt|cicus: it is entirely plausible with the S hand that N has a strong NT|pg||
nt|cicus: but he is going to check for a major anyway :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: A great word: missklikkato!|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: How? by doubling?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Maybe 3@D is natural and he can roll out the cuebid whatever it means|pg||
nt|hedyg: but here N did not bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hard to imagine N/S getting into the bidding now, even if West were to pass 2@H (which is unlikely).|pg||
nt|hedyg: all pass 2@D with N hand?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes!|pg||
nt|jcmax: No, it wasn't Daniela, it was Andrea Rauscheid.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lestergold: eay 3N here |pg||
nt|daman: it was corrected to -1|pg||
nt|mariner1: not a lot here for anyone|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: sorry|pg||
nt|cicus: depends on agreement, now 3@D is surely something unnatural|pg||
nt|Walddk2: N-S are making it very hard on themselves I think. It's tough enough to play against these guys, so when you add self-inflicted pressure, you are in dire straits|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yesterday we had Wet, Wet, Wet. Today it is Dire Straits. Switch to the music channel|pg||
nt|andyv:  i never pass, Hedy so you know it's an unfair question|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol sry|pg||
nt|milton_se: was about to say the same :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: sorry|pg||
nt|cicus: it is a past perfect tense form of misklikkare|pg||
nt|brolucius: Past participle.|pg||
nt|cicus: that's it|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Do you think double was a transfer to spades?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: many pairs play that East must show his singleton here - but the final contract would be the same|pg||
nt|brolucius: East's 4S (on a relatively good hand) rather suggests that West had not already forced to game.|pg||
nt|ritong: caviezel estimated that his @cs were not worth a mention|pg||
nt|jcmax: N will not be unhappy to have stopped so low when he sees dummy|pg||
nt|cicus: should show 4+|pg||
mb|3H|nt|andyv:  sorry, 10 tricks|pg||
nt|bobh1: another 3n|pg||
nt|mariner1: W showing good discipline|pg||
nt|ritong: okay|pg||
nt|cicus: as in a hand before|pg||
nt|cicus: hand 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: cards friendly here|pg||
nt|andyv:  this time passing is a winner|pg||
nt|andyv:  and Villa should get a few imps here|pg||
nt|brolucius: N/S will be pleased to have been shut out of the bidding when the heart break comes to light.|pg||
nt|haans: if 3nt was 5-5 in M on you go|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3NT= 5-5 majors|pg||
nt|ritong: cuz daniela made a great match vs french teal in final|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Her surname at the time; later she became Andrea Reim, isn't that correct?|pg||
nt|ritong: team*|pg||
nt|brolucius: Some play that 1@S (by responder) shows 4 or more and that a negative double denies four spades.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|andyv:  sorry, David...Hedy corrected me:  clogs|pg||
nt|jcmax: yes, correct|pg||
nt|cuttysark: They appear to be dicing with death here|pg||
nt|cicus: 1NT probably denies 3 spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Not a difficult game, this one|pg||
nt|jtr: They reached the correct contract What a surprise:)|pg||
nt|cicus: S may have intended his pass as forcing|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm e/w got too high too|pg||
nt|april7: 1 down|pg||
nt|bridge_one: anytime to be aggressive don't work|pg||
nt|hedyg: quick switch to @s|pg||
nt|andyv:  tempting against these two to bid 4@s with N hand over 4@h... you just have to believe they make everything they bid:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@c sets @h and shows a good hand (4@h wld be min),  4@d trf|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Fortunately West has only 5 hearts, and di not lead one|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told: N/A play dbl 4/5 @s and 1@s take out without @s|pg||
nt|brolucius: N/S|pg||
nt|cicus: a stopper is as strong as it sounds|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: anybody bid 2@d in E?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this one is declarer-proof|pg||
nt|jtr: Not that it is particularly good|pg||
nt|mariner1: Open Room also in 4 in W though|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: you can have another cup of tea David|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am still waiting for something interesting to happen on the deal. Only then, will I seek some suitable forfeit.|pg||
nt|andyv:  better be quick!|pg||
nt|brolucius: They will get it right. I am sure.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lestergold: NOT leading a dim might hold this to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|lml: East might have opened|pg||
nt|andyv:  6 boards...6 pretty flat hands....Angelini lucky to be even at this point|pg||
nt|haans: @D lead|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mariner1: Q@D being off is key to total tricks here|pg||
nt|lml: I would open 1@d|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sharkey: The first IMP exchange occured on board 4 - Posillipo picking up 5 IMPs - the missed undertrick costing 2 IMPs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The club layout is so nice that you can make all four tricks|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@d may be different fron normal transfert|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|daman: we all thought the last hand was easy and look what happened|pg||
nt|brolucius: Obvious that discards were coming on the diamonds and North's @C8 will have been discouraging.|pg||
nt|andyv:  i would play A@s and @s... don't want pd to even think about @c return|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Count 8 tricks, take 8 tricks :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ralfwil: my guess is 10. S is endplayed |pg||
nt|tendenz: me too|pg||
nt|jcmax: if it's natural it seems like a good idea. would it be natural?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: indeed we werent expeting declarer to play a misere line tho|pg||
nt|tendenz: it's natural|pg||
nt|daman: pretty simple|pg||
nt|hedyg: Nunes was a tad too strong for the 2@d opening, maybe that is why he bid 4@h|pg||
pc|s5|nt|marlowepi: as opposed to the other kind|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|roswolf: now they will a spade ruff as well|pg||
nt|brolucius: Good bid in 3rd seat, even so.|pg||
nt|hedyg: nonsystemic|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h great contract|pg||
nt|andyv:  Fantoni's fault for not having the 10 of @hs|pg||
nt|hedyg: did the 2@H bid promise the 10?|pg||
nt|andyv:  only if it meant making the contract!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, but you forgot to guide them|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3rd seat 2@D opening is 6-13|pg||
nt|brolucius: Which is why North could not contemplate 2@S (weak over weak).|pg||
nt|andyv:  I agree...2@s would lead to some serious partnership discussions afterwards|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|mariner1: 18-20 2+ or natural|pg||
nt|ritong: what are we doing with cards in hand, manoli?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Surprising he did not try to slip through a club to the king. Worth a try.|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@hs made in OR|pg||
nt|cicus: but makes|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Lucky that both diamonds are onside, and dummy has enough club entries for the double finesse|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: they dont have an embankmant in italy to sleep on|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @c lead had made it more difficult for declarer to take more than 9 tricks|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D probably a Stayman|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|hedyg: open 1@D. bid 2@ds...|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|odysseus69: wont be able to repeat club finesse safely|pg||
nt|jcmax: @C lead here is excellent because it doesn't give declarer anything from the start. and he doesn't have a lot of dummy entries to play towards his hand|pg||
nt|cicus: but leaD Does not matter here|pg||
pc|cK|nt|april7: not really, will be more|pg||
nt|andyv:  in the OR, W opened 1N and N was able to get @ss in the 2nd round|pg||
nt|haans: playing safe|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mariner1: 18-20 would be balanced we saw|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|lestergold: u know that place where bridge players who dont draw trumps endup sleeping on|pg||
nt|lestergold: mayeb egt sent to then catacombs by teammates|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c9|nt|lml: but the way the hand is playing its better that they are low|pg||
nt|jcmax: I meant 2@D :)|pg||
nt|milton_se: funny to reject the H lead -- pard is not supposed to have more than one entry|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sharkey: no need to |pg||
nt|odysseus69: she has 9 without|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|brolucius: I thought they had to wander endlessly along it. Maybe the idea was that they lost their houses and had to sleep there, you are right.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jtr: eh?|pg||
nt|jtr: not right|pg||
pc|h6|nt|hedyg: 1@d opening is 10-21|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c6|pg||
nt|hedyg: so natural it can be as low as 10|pg||
pc|hK|pc|s7|nt|odysseus69: can now|pg||
nt|roswolf: another trump -3|pg||
nt|bridge_one: ok, 2@d is like i told first time - can be weak with @h or other kind of hand|pg||
pc|h4|nt|polpkeeper: femminile Catania in finale (Varese ritirata dalla semifinale). RE - Posillipo 13-1 nel tempo (RE +22 in totale)|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and E is squeezed|pg||
nt|bobh1: show up|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|nt|bridge_one: the partner answer like was weak with @h|pg||
pc|d9|nt|cuttysark: Routine :)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|andyv:  E should claim before he makes a mistake:)|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|nt|mariner1: well I suspect it can't be the none balanced 16+ in there|pg||
pc|h9|pc|d4|pg||

nt|jcmax: I can only repeat what I said 3 minutes ago :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N makes or should make NS|pg||
nt|cicus: fat scores for EW|pg||
nt|jtr: Luck, as ever, favours the team playing better|pg||
nt|jtr: And 4@s here is certainly lucky!|pg||
nt|cicus: extremely , and still on a guess !|pg||
nt|cuttysark: needs a good guess in clubs: East cashed two red aces, then underled, but Lauria got it right (doesnt he always)|pg||
nt|jtr: ah possible|pg||
nt|jtr: Spec says maybe 1NT X|pg||
nt|cicus: I wonder if Nunes upgrades|pg||
nt|jtr: Great looking 14|pg||
nt|cicus: this is an excellent 14 count|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, he might open 1@C|pg||
nt|jtr: Compared to that crap 11 of Fantoni's|pg||
nt|cicus: I noticed he does not usually upgrade though|pg||
nt|cicus: they like their 1NT opening|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the multiway transfert are used a lot in the last times|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks straightforward too|pg||
nt|hedyg: you might like to check out Dan Neill's write-up of the Fantunes system: http://bridgewithdan.com/systems/Fantoni_Nunes.txt|pg||
mb|1D|nt|Walddk2: They both do frequently, so 11-14 is more like it|pg||
nt|haans: after 2 round of @H know that|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: i mean you put yourself in Fantunes pasta machine and they make bolognese fo u quickly|pg||
nt|daman: whew|pg||
nt|mariner1: many precision pairs use a @H relay over a neg @D response to show the|pg||
nt|mariner1: different NT range by opener|pg||
nt|mariner1: another quiet 1N EW here?|pg||
nt|tendenz: 1@c is 15 or more nightmarish|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S a lucky make|pg||
nt|daman: I'm glad this is a close match (hope that doesn't curse one team)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Spare me from those who would find an excuse not to open 2@S on the South cards.|pg||
nt|ritong: right david  the way he played that hand, we can safely say that manoli is not very easy with vugraph|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S NS|pg||
nt|cicus: now it is less easy for NS|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No more transfers, please|pg||
nt|jtr: Some people are unused to defending against a weak NT|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Surely this is a double??|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@s may be 10/12|pg||
nt|haans: did not ruff a spade|pg||
nt|brolucius: East's redouble, at the other table (over North's negative double), is usually played as showing a high honour doubleton, so partner can lead the suit. With heart support, you ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: would give some sort of raise instead.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|roswolf: north may pass at the score to generate a swing|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcmax: I only would expect NS to bid to 3NT if S for some reason had chosen to open 3@C|pg||
nt|jtr: Surely this is a pass?:)|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I hope rinaldi passes|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Rinaldi checking to see if this is a transfer|pg||
nt|jtr: lolol|pg||
nt|cicus: hmm, I was sure E takes some rescue action|pg||
nt|sybarra: unfurtunately not best idea this time |pg||
nt|brolucius: When you are deciding whether to bid on a hand such as North's a good rule is: Pass with good spades only when you intend to pass a re-opening double by partner.|pg||
nt|jcmax: Will Lauria transfer to @C or pass?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|andyv:  3N|pg||
nt|cuttysark: maybe he knows you are commentating Henri :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOLOL|pg||
nt|ritong: possible|pg||
nt|ritong: although i do not pretend to be the meanest guy:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But Fantoni's pass is|pg||
nt|sybarra: *unfortunately|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i am not sure 2@s 10/12 (with 2@D weaker multi) but many pair in Italy use this system|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the cards of N/S are in perfect fit|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes|pg||
nt|april7: N might inquire about a singleton if possible, and finds the perfect fit to bid 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 1@S a relay to 1N?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@S denies a 4-card major|pg||
nt|odysseus69: well done East responding|pg||
nt|jtr: West will maybe?|pg||
nt|hedyg: prefer 1NT by N?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ralfwil: another easy 3nt|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C is Gazzilli|pg||
nt|bridge_one: also E/W play 4@D|pg||
nt|milton_se: y, but H lead is still correct if South has KJx|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Either natural or any 16+ hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pass = less than 8 hcp|pg||
nt|ritong: concurrence is severe...|pg||
nt|brolucius: I see that you have co-commentated with David Burn, then.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3Nt not so long to make - with Jxx in @c North would try, perhaps|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even the most macho N would be unlikely to overcall 1NT with the N hand:)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Maybe they play a compulsory redouble - East will pull now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: weak hand with both minors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: redouble is forced|pg||
nt|eugenio123: maybe now they play inverted dbl so rinaldi may bid dbl|pg||
nt|jtr: Not so easy to catch them now|pg||
nt|cicus: I play T/O X-s in this situation|pg||
nt|jtr: Some play X as specifically 3 cards|pg||
nt|cicus: this hand qualifies :)|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mariner1: @c lead helps the defense|pg||
nt|hedyg: he might not lead @c now|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not quite, on that hand, but I would on other hands.|pg||
nt|andyv:  and the conservative style pays off again|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Don't know why Golin did not blast 4@S before|pg||
nt|brolucius: East's double of 1NT, in the pass-out seat, was quite a clever move. It was based on his @HA-Q-J lying over the heart bid. It went unrewarded on this occasion. |pg||
mb|3N|nt|andyv:  NT 12-14?|pg||
nt|lestergold: cards vey favourable indee for e/w reverse north and south and Fantunes would be making chopped liver of them|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You don't want to invite with that hand, do you?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: thats too conservative unless forcing|pg||
nt|ritong: inter alia, yes|pg||
nt|andyv:  W returned 3rd @s in OR, now same squeeze except this time in @D and @h for 11 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  bidding was much more vigorous in the OR by both sides|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well you dont get too many free gelatos from these two|pg||
nt|daman: maybe a little spumoni|pg||
nt|ralfwil: W must watch his communications|pg||
nt|brolucius: I did not realise this was a cookery broadcast.|pg||
nt|andyv:  should go after @ds first|pg||
nt|lestergold: you dont realise a lot of things David|pg||
nt|brolucius: This is true.|pg||
nt|lestergold: you play against fantunes you get ur goose cooked|pg||
nt|daman: and all the hands are not chopped liver|pg||
nt|lestergold: some of them are schmaltz herring|pg||
nt|daman: don't be so wishy-washy Henri   take a view|pg||
nt|andyv:  you got your @d lead, Haans|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|xenya: Versace's 5@D in the OR looks an overbid to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 3@C should be no problem here|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: You could feel this coming on - he willnot be comfortable with this contract|pg||
nt|andyv:  2nd dbl not recommended for faint at heart|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: This is getting one-sided|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and may not go the distance (96 boards)|pg||
nt|cicus: only good thing for Fabbriche is that there are 4 1/2 segments left to play|pg||
nt|cuttysark: To be fair, this is not a great game|pg||
nt|bridge_one: ok, 2@S is weak , not 10/12 for N/S - so natural the pass by N|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: I think it's forcing|pg||
nt|odysseus69: yes 4s is a bit lucky but East is very minimal|pg||
nt|hedyg: W in OR felt obliged to rebid ( 3 @S) , N doubled ( is that not penalty?) and S bid 5@d|pg||
nt|andyv:  certainly needed some luck to bring it in|pg||
nt|andyv:  S actually bid 4@d and N raised to 5|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, 5@D looks to be too much. He has already shown good values with the double and he has no diamond support.|pg||
nt|xenya: no, S bid only 4, but N raised|pg||
nt|andyv:  probably out of annoyance that pd pulled his dbl:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: well with 2 aces that was the least he could do|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk2: Must be since Baroni cue bid|pg||
nt|sharkey: W may take 4@D as cue... - since no @C cue no damage|pg||
nt|jcmax: In my view N has no reason whatsoever to bid 3N on this auction. Partner is super maximum for bidding3@C now. but he just didn't have a different bid|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I don't understand 2@s, if they play t/o dbl he should've bid dbl, if they don't he should've bid pass ( in my opinion )|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Versace taking his trick|pg||
nt|haans: better leads when you see all the cards|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hedyg: Versace would love to lead trump..|pg||
nt|brolucius: Nor would 3NT be... and he had to do something. North will claim the credit for this large number. 'You liked my 3@S bid, partner?' |pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|nt|jcmax: The @C suit constitutes a suit combination where many players bang down the ace and then play another one. The correct technical play is actually to finesse twice.|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|andyv:  Q@s may show where his entry is|pg||
nt|mariner1: would have had to lead big @c anyway|pg||
nt|andyv:  looked like the safest|pg||
nt|mariner1: he has to be concerned about @H ruff and the suit in generak|pg||
nt|mariner1: general|pg||
nt|cicus: that's the problem with penalyty X-s here, you have to pass and can't show values|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|cQ|nt|jcmax: I am really sorry all. I need to go and try and solve my connection problems. I apologise and see you tomorrow hopefully :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: D ace seems -- a priori -- to be unlikely to be best for the defence|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes, pass by South should be forcing. here is no hurry to bid |pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N at least stated the value of his hand....he had to expect a 4@h bid over his 2nd dbl and that just wasn't going to be pretty|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|cicus: pass would have shown values only if XX were not obligatory|pg||
pc|hA|pc|d2|nt|hedyg: ty Sabine, gl|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks Sabine|pg||
nt|lml: bye and good luck|pg||
nt|jcmax: Bye all and have a great time|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|nt|mariner1: ducking to set up any possible squeeze / end play|pg||
nt|xenya: he knew the @SA was likely to be of little use|pg||
nt|hedyg: it would serve for a discard|pg||
nt|andyv:  i agree... i think 5@d was an overbid... pd didn't promise much except lots of @ds|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ralfwil: I think a @h from the table is better|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d3|pc|dT|pg||
nt|hedyg: 10@D might have worked better here|pg||
nt|cicus: for me this 2@C does not create a force but many play otherwise|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|odysseus69: and even after 3 rounds of clubs it will be difficult for the defence even when the hearts are less friendly- when declarerplays 6 rounds of spades|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sharkey: More than one way to play @H suit - low towards dummy - which would work if N held Hx|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Declarer needs singleton heart honour, Hx or both honours with South, and she gets lucky|pg||

nt|odysseus69: anagram (nearly) for lollipops|pg||
nt|andyv:  so far,not a part score day|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the fact that partner suppoirted the suit does not really strengthen the case for a diamond lead. first, dummy is likely short, so declarer has diamond length. secondly, you want S ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: to have WASTED DIAMOND STRENGTH --if the hand is pure you are not likely to beat the contract|pg||
nt|bridge_one: playing 2@S weak AQJ10 and Q10xx out are a very good hand - |pg||
nt|brolucius: And he had bid 4@D instead of 3NT, suggesting a hole in the diamonds.|pg||
nt|hedyg: i hate it when pd pulls my penalty double|pg||
nt|andyv:  if pd had a 4 loser hand, he certaily bid it very weakly:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: EW just need to stay low here|pg||
nt|andyv:  and 4@h seems to be the order of the day here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 10-13  5+ diamonds, unbalanced|pg||
nt|roswolf: when you are well behind in a match i have a principle to never be max for my bid but always to upgrade - this way you can generate some action without risking too much|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@S now would be invitational with 4+ cards. He may have a better option, not sure|pg||
mb|1C|nt|lestergold: Roland has been hacking into the dealing bot again|pg||
nt|lestergold: why did I say that?|pg||
nt|ritong: ugh|pg||
nt|brolucius: East will not have the worst suit ever for 1@S, since we once saw on BBO an overcall on 6-5-4-3-2. Oh, he has bid Michaels instead.|pg||
nt|mariner1: no games however someone could be shoved up|pg||
nt|cicus: no excitement here, a flat-loking 4@S|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mariner1: grand here?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 7 in 3 different way here|pg||
nt|mariner1: well that is a shove :)|pg||
nt|haans: how to know 3 defensive tricks in @D?|pg||
nt|hedyg: double looks right|pg||
nt|ritong: a kind of all in move, yes|pg||
nt|mariner1: phantom save coming?|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: You did not point out, Mike, that Nunes has doubled in the 'sandwich position'.|pg||
nt|lestergold: thats enough food - Ed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6NT can make double dummy, but I doubt that it will in real life|pg||
nt|ritong: worse|pg||
nt|daman: would we all bid 2@H?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Quite so - but this may excape the axe if West bids 2@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: 7@H 7@D or 7N|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Doesn't look like it. He does have good cards, but not oposite a singleton spade|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 4@S should be easy to be bid|pg||
nt|cicus: seems 5@H save goes for 500|pg||
nt|eugenio123: after he knows the support|pg||
nt|sybarra: and versace upgraded and our table did not  |pg||
nt|roswolf: therefore i would have opened 1@S NOT 2|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with a trick (A@S) and 6/4 good 1@s seam more correct that 2@S|pg||
nt|andyv:  sever 2/1 bidders just fainted|pg||
nt|hedyg: me included|pg||
mb|2D|nt|haans: p may even be short in spades|pg||
nt|hedyg: anybody bid 3@H as S?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@H is forcing to what?|pg||
nt|haans: far from 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: You can even take all 13|pg||
nt|odysseus69: are we flying again?|pg||
nt|andyv:  trump leads|pg||
nt|andyv:  no|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@S fit @H |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Adam Kaplan|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Hi All :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Adam :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Adam:)|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Adam|pg||
nt|brolucius: There is some play for a min-suit game but, as we see, the diamonds are badly placed. Also, entries to the South hand are limited.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The average age of commentators will be considerably lower after Adam arrived|pg||
nt|hedyg: as in S hand is limited|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: QJx@s though gives 5@c a small hope|pg||
mb|2H|nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|marlowepi: actually stopping in 7 is an underbid|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: undo|pg||
nt|lestergold: but what has roland been up to?|pg||
nt|andyv:  1N seems to do better justice to the W hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: Of course - :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, 2@H looks good. I ahd not noticed the 5-5 shape.|pg||
nt|mariner1: no slam but very close|pg||
nt|bobh1: most tricks in @hss but since they only give you credit for 13, 7n|pg||
nt|jcmax: This should theoretically not be ifficult to bid. There is a fit and W can just ask for aces and place the contract|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i thought west would bid 4@D over 2NT to give the close suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  but automatic @d lead from W should dash all that|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@D is often played as forcing, but no here (I guess).|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: although I think declarer is 1 entry short|pg||
nt|hedyg: can they stop after 2@c?|pg||
nt|brolucius: In fact a reverse facing a two-level response is usually forcing to game whatever responder does next (except pass...)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C is not GF. They do not play 2/1|pg||
nt|xenya: that's what S must be hoping for, Hedy|pg||
mb|2N|nt|Walddk2: Next set in 3 hours. Lunch break after this (board 32)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 5@C looks a better save|pg||
nt|hedyg: the only way i know to stop is if S bid "stop" 2@c|pg||
nt|brolucius: They have stopped safely, but I am surprised. North had a great hand for a club contract.|pg||
nt|mariner1: and the Shadow knows....... :)|pg||
nt|haans: Franchi did fool them|pg||
nt|cicus: Villa may gain 1 IMP by leading a heart|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: after 1@h - D i had prefered 1nt as W, not 1@s|pg||
nt|lestergold: spec has spotted it|pg||
nt|ritong: justto hear part repeat @hs  no, thanks|pg||
nt|lestergold: itsa 20/20 hand|pg||
nt|lml: 4@H is close|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes close but no cigar|pg||
nt|lml: I would be disappointed not to be in it until I discovered the break|pg||
nt|mariner1: since E is limited and so is W should the even be thinking game?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: villa Fabriche might have gained an imp by leading a diamond|pg||
nt|peachy: they might get a very short lunch break|pg||
nt|andyv:  well, i'd be off looking for a slam on this one:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Indeed.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: they must have some method of showing stronger hands... perhaps a 2NT type reverse-lebensohl?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps that is why you are commentating, rather than being 74 IMPs down in this match.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: i means that KQJ10xx x xx K10xx it is ok for 2@S, but AQJ10xx x xx Q10xx can be dangerous|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, presumably @@'s sequence id the weakest possible|pg||
nt|xenya: *S's|pg||
nt|andyv:  maybe they don't have 1N available?|pg||
nt|brolucius: As little as @CK-Q-x-x-x-x in the South hand might give you a good play for game.|pg||
nt|andyv:  or it was taken out of the bid box?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Need a @D lead to have a chance to set 6 NT|pg||
pc|c8|nt|daman: Roland is watching his minions commentate|pg||
nt|lml: well they did well to avoid the game anyway|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@d doesnt|pg||
nt|brolucius: South has followed a strong sequence. I would have bid just 3@H (=a raise to 2@H) on the first round.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The vugraph schedule web page has been updated, so you can get an impression of what's on offer in the weeks to come (broadcasts that we are aware of that is)|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, it has been rather slow|pg||
nt|cicus: raise on 3 small is dubious if 2@S can be 4 so there may be other inferences|pg||
nt|peachy: 2S can indeed be 4 cards, per sys card|pg||
nt|hedyg: did he? certainly X was penalty|pg||
nt|jcmax: I don't think dbl was penalty, but just showin some values. Parnter is free to bid on with a dsitributional hand.|pg||
nt|haans: W did not know they had real clubs|pg||
nt|jcmax: And that's exactly what Lauria did.|pg||
nt|haans: franchi bid 4@S on balanced hand|pg||
nt|brolucius: West would have opened 1@S with @SA-Q @HA @CA, so slam was very unlikely. Would need three aces and six spades to the ace. But then West would not have opened 1NT.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sharkey: 4 NT quantative here?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If declarer avoids a diamond lead and she guesses hearts, she is in fine shape. On a diamond lead she is destined to go down|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@H*|pg||
nt|andyv:  N has nothing to cue...will stop at 4@h|pg||
nt|mariner1: S trying for a slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: true|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think they play 1NT= 5 @ss|pg||
nt|hedyg: not real @cs? what else can 3@c mean?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I hate leding doubletons - glad to see it is not working well here :)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ritong: this segment takes a wild turn|pg||
nt|daman: Padova prends le devant par trois longeurs     Padova takes the leas my 3 IMPs (lengths)|pg||
nt|daman: lead*|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after the 1H response, 7 should be a foregone conclusion|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think you hav 17 tricks in @hs with reasonable breaks|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|haans: no slaminterest |pg||
nt|bobh1: ho hum|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@S maybe some sort of range?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@C here was a slam check|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that's enough tricks to make a heart grand on this board and to defeat an opposing heart game on the hext one|pg||
nt|bridge_one: may pair use the rule that after two round od cue 4Nt is cue also|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there should be an escrow account:)|pg||
nt|jcmax: I thought W would confirm @H and then ask for key cards|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: now weve got onions into it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: For full vugraph schedule, please go to http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php  and bookmark it!|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok so now, is there a squeeze on N?|pg||
nt|haans: KJTxx???|pg||
nt|mariner1: the other @c suit? :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1@S shows 14+ points in their system.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sharkey: agree|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I guess most did already|pg||
nt|eugenio123: probably it is 4th just with @d support|pg||
nt|cicus: I wonder what X would have been , maybe penalty?|pg||
nt|hedyg: but then he could bid 1@s= 0-4 @ss|pg||
pc|c5|nt|daman: would it be the upset of the year if Angelini lost?|pg||
nt|brolucius: What was the point of South's double? Getting too high is his fault, as I see it (although no doubt Angelini will apologise for it.)|pg||
nt|bobh1: hopefully 4n is some kind of KC inquiry|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe there is a tournament prize for the longest auction|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|brolucius: No idea why Nunes doubled instead of bidding 1@S.|pg||
nt|sharkey: @H set as trump here I think|pg||
nt|mariner1: N worried about making game after seeing dummy|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4Nt key cards here, not cue|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|daman: we all know you cannot spell Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: now its george he spelt onions minions|pg||
nt|hedyg: many Italians play Ghestem in which case @S/@C was known in E, so Versace could bid 3@H or unusual vs unusual with a better hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if so, that 2S bid was awfully wasteful...|pg||
pc|s5|nt|odysseus69: goooing to get trump lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  it would seem logical|pg||
nt|brolucius: What does 2@C show then, Hedy? Do you have their convention-card before you?|pg||
nt|hedyg: well we dont have their system so just guessing|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry, no|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hedyg: had to keep that 10 @H|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 5H= 2 without Q probably|pg||
nt|sharkey: @D lead|pg||
nt|jcmax: Looking at the final stage of this auction I am quite sure we don't have a clue what anything meant :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont think the squeeze works|pg||
nt|jcmax: It doesn't look to me there will be a squeeze, because declarer only can hold a singleton @S in dummy, so it doesn't help him when N discards a @S honour in the end.|pg||
nt|hedyg: in the 5 card ending there is 1@s and 4 @ds in dummy and N keeps A@s and 4 @ds, S must keep 10@d|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jcmax: If one of the @D honours was in declarer's hand the squeeze would work, because there would be an entry back to his hand|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk2: That would be strong|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Excellent Irene Baroni!|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - offensive vs small slams|pg||
nt|sharkey: Trump lead vs Grand|pg||
nt|odysseus69: good lead- the old rule about attacking against small slams still works (sometimes)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And those who claim that you must never lead away from a king against a slam will get food for thought|pg||
nt|sharkey: If S makes this West should hide her cards more carefully....|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i was doing a doing a disservice to womens bridge by suggesting a trump lead|pg||
nt|cuttysark: This 4@H bid contrasts with getting to 2@H opposite a re-opening: even if South has shown a good hand, he did not start with 2@S|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl could have been two things...1) able to punish one of their suits and 2) a limit raise in @hs with only 3|pg||
nt|april7: why that way|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|lml: hes still okay in 3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: GIB will likely tell you that there is an overtrick, but the thing is that GIB plays with all cards in view|pg||
nt|daman: I would find it difficult to criticize Alfredo|pg||
pc|h4|nt|daman: wow|pg||
nt|brolucius: Wow, South bid 4@S at the other table. I prefer a double to that.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well its interesting how these chaps no when to avoid bidding their six card spade suits|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1@S (10)         Double (5)         4@S (2)|pg||
nt|ritong: matteucci kindly warned|pg||
nt|haans: now sure :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: now he can relax|pg||
nt|bobh1: feeling better now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wd. i'd have gotten there in more antedivluvian fashion|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: Humans should go down|pg||
nt|sharkey: We'll all make an overtrick from here so not surprised that GIB agrees with us Roland|pg||
nt|odysseus69: might as well play diamond now|pg||
nt|roswolf: really this looks a strange line|pg||
nt|april7: @H now!!!|pg||
pc|h9|nt|lml: and 4 was unlikely anyway on repeated club plays|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes, but could have made 10 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  OR apparently doesn't play lebonsohl over reverses.... S simply bid 3@d over 2@s|pg||
nt|hedyg: even if he had 10@d|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: First hurdle is to guess spades. That is not obvious|pg||
nt|Walddk2: hearts rather|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, he could bid 2@S with a sound raise to 3@H and a direct 3@H with a lesser hand (which is what he held).|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: yep nunese smelt a misfit anhe read SJ Simon'sold book|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not sure about that|pg||
pc|h2|nt|marlowepi: i think i know what 7H meant|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes Sabine, may be they used any gadgets here :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: It's also possible that 1NT they use as a GF relay|pg||
pc|h6|nt|andyv:  it looks like Alfredo was hedging his bets|pg||
nt|brolucius: There are so few opportunities, we should criticise him while we can! |pg||
nt|hedyg: he could bid 2@s to show a limit raise|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry David, i was too slow|pg||
nt|andyv:  if that's what they play|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think North did too much with a minimum 5-3-3-2 opposite an invitational bid at best|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@s could also show a @s stopper|pg||
nt|andyv:  and invite values|pg||
nt|jtr: Playing this way in case @ss 4-1|pg||
nt|brolucius: Leading doubleton honours is even worse. I am sure you agree, Liz.|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|hedyg: spec suggests 2@c= i have nothing|pg||
nt|andyv:  and 2 bids may be limited... could be a treatment|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ralfwil: 4@s on S must be some kind of suicide....|pg||
nt|hedyg: well, he had that as well|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: I don't think anyone will agree with this line|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
pc|d5|nt|brolucius: More important to be able to bid two sorts of heart-support hand. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: North can exit with the jack|pg||
nt|jcmax: what are you not sure about, roland?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|haans: we were in agreement there|pg||
nt|roswolf: believing declarer there|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ritong: my idea is the adrenalina generated by the 800 on the previous board is the main culprit|pg||
nt|sybarra: bet we have a card differenct that what we saw |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ritong: they all got off wheels|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That the 109 with East would have been enough|pg||
nt|hedyg: but then 10@d would be entry and his @ss would be good|pg||
nt|jcmax: Yes, but South's @S J drops|pg||
pc|s8|nt|daman: euthenasia|pg||
nt|brolucius: You can afford a mis-fit if you start with a humble 1@S.|pg||
nt|bobh1: lol|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mtvesuvius: yes, it's possible... if we had a CC we could know for sure, but for now... :)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|odysseus69: ugh- cant imagine why there was any harry for that|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|lml: not sure he can.  they just play clubs every time they get in and I think he can't draw all the trump|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|pc|dT|nt|andyv:  did well to go down 1|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer placed South with the @HK after his double. It would have been obvious to bid 1@S without the @HK. (Some would say: obvious with it, too).|pg||

nt|brolucius: Are you tempted to place another bet with Roland?|pg||
nt|daman: I amnot|pg||
nt|brolucius: It may cost you serious T-shirts.|pg||
nt|andyv:  these boards may be putting the specs to sleep|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They are on 28 in the other room|pg||
nt|jtr: slammish here|pg||
nt|cicus: EW can make 6@D here but should not bid it|pg||

nt|Walddk2: They will make it if they are in it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: North will open|pg||
nt|jtr: With the opening bid, yes|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think perhaps only West can make 6@D :)|pg||
nt|april7: generous by Fantoni!!!|pg||
nt|roswolf: i do hope so!|pg||
nt|andyv:  meantime, a push board:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  Roland, close your eyes|pg||
nt|andyv:  S has a F.....y bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: Versace did bid 3@H and is playing 4 @hs|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Leading Ax or Kx scores the ocasional triumph. The others are for the birds (unless partner bid the suit...)|pg||
nt|cicus: time running out for VF, 8 to go, 88 to gain|pg||
nt|brolucius: A 5-4 scoreline after eight hands. Not exactly riveting fare.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: The leaders will not object|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: indeed :)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|andyv:  5@h and 5+ other (not @s)|pg||
nt|brolucius: The big hands at the start of this session represented a false dawn. Disappointing collection since then.|pg||
nt|daman: Angelini closing the gap    the rally is on|pg||
nt|hedyg: @d lead makes no difference if he plays @H immediately, no entry to the N hand for the 3rd @d|pg||
nt|sharkey: Since @C finesse was to be taken anyway and if 3-3 @D loser would go away|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@C is that is natural|pg||
nt|odysseus69: unlucky grand- would be sick to go down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I might even open 5@C at these colours|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You know that West is very strong when it goess pass pass to you|pg||
nt|hedyg: never bet with Roland, he is always right :(|pg||
nt|daman: he owes me 27 of them|pg||
nt|andyv:  vul too much for E|pg||
nt|bobh1: prob 4@h -1|pg||
nt|andyv:  agree|pg||
nt|mariner1: S can count losers,,,,,,,,, I say no slam :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: no game|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Hedy Grey believes 2S was a nebulous reverse. 2N asked & 3H confirmed a big heart raise|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N EW easy|pg||
nt|sybarra: having been an operator,  sometimes they hide the cards   |pg||
nt|sybarra: so operator has difficulty seeing all the cards sometimes |pg||
nt|april7: finally a push|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks a limit raise|pg||
nt|hedyg: a funny bid?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: indeed|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hammon likes it... so must have some value:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Fortunately North has spared us a possibly awful sight.|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: lol|pg||
nt|hedyg: how do you bid this opposite a weak NT?|pg||
nt|andyv:  slowly|pg||
nt|hedyg: smolen gets you too hugh|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: how weak is the question|pg||
nt|hedyg: check the CC Adam :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  if 2@c is start of invite sequence, then that's my choice|pg||
mb|1N|nt|cuttysark: Quit while you are ahead - that's the Scottish advice|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|milton_se: this will be a test of the brakes|pg||
mb|2C|an| |nt|lestergold: if the bidding does not die quickly then someone will come to grief here|pg||
nt|ritong: might be bloody|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2NT was borderline, especially facing a passed hand.|pg||
nt|lestergold: thats why roland keeps on dealing 20/20s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@C is too wet|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 4 or 5 depending on your temperament|pg||
nt|sharkey: Think I wud have picked 4@C|pg||
nt|daman: those autographed by Roland are worth much more on eBay|pg||
nt|mariner1: well so much for no game :)|pg||
nt|haans: tell opps nothing some chance|pg||
nt|jtr: South may try something?|pg||
nt|sybarra: fit jump |pg||
nt|april7: no limit raise, gf!|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm each to their own|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@D a splinter (in Italoy always limited at 11/12 hcp)|pg||
nt|sybarra: splinter/no splinter (fit) |pg||
nt|brolucius: One method is to play 1NT - 2@C - 2@D - 2@H as invitational. |pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: They are currently fetching a Scottish Â£5 note.|pg||
nt|andyv:  makes the defence a lot easier|pg||
nt|bobh1: ew can make 3@s so 4@h is par contract|pg||
nt|mariner1: Will E save here? Phantom?|pg||
nt|andyv:  can't get to 3@s if you don't bid it:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  he passed 1N...why in the world would he bid now?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ritong: a fantunes passed hand  they open light|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this will be interesting. What do you think about pass on S?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3h a transfer to spades no doubt|pg||
nt|daman: whack 3@S|pg||
nt|ritong: guess west likes it|pg||
nt|lestergold: what i think is for once fantunes are in serious trouble|pg||
nt|mariner1: I like 2@S with the @c fit|pg||
nt|cicus: a transfer?|pg||
nt|jtr: lolol|pg||
nt|cicus: my best score in 8 boards have been 79-0, but not against Fantunes |pg||
nt|brolucius: 1NT - first application of the brakes.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps 3@H now.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 2@S was 6 4 I think|pg||
nt|jcmax: NOw this is an auction I understand!|pg||
nt|mariner1: promised 4@H and 6@D|pg||
nt|cuttysark: one way to create swing is a bit of judicious underbidding, but single-figure swings are no use to Villa Fabbriche now|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: I'm sure they've been in trouble before|pg||
nt|lestergold: well e/w might be able to get close to 3N but in reality this is likely to cost the great executioners|pg||
nt|lestergold: cos they werent likely to bid 3N on ther combined 20|pg||
nt|brolucius: Do North or East have anything to think about?|pg||
nt|ritong: no|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4H looks like too much work|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@D would be a fair shot by West now|pg||
nt|odysseus69: wet wet wet- tell all Roland- another of your specialities|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 5D is wet too|pg||
nt|daman: at least|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right on, sister|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, may be 2@S multiway rever - it is used but may pairs in Italy|pg||
nt|peachy: have mercy on S.. :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: a splinter in any suit?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: no i think @S|pg||
nt|april7: for me game hand!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i prefere to use hight splinter with void and 3@S generic with a sgl|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@H 3@s = splinter any sgl|pg||
nt|brolucius: That means you have to transfer with 2@D with the same shape and fewer points.|pg||
nt|cicus: would be too simple|pg||
mb|d|nt|brolucius: The only real decision was whether North stuck 2NT. That was a quite possible action on his hand.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Isn't that a band, Victor, or was?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: now 5H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Wet Wet Wet  I mean|pg||
nt|odysseus69: sure- I knew you knew - I was expecting a history with some of their hits|pg||
nt|sharkey: If E bids 5@H West will bid again!|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and how|pg||
nt|sharkey: and she'll bid too much... |pg||
nt|sharkey: So either an underbid or an overbid - can't see them landing in 6 of anything|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@C is transfer to 4@H  Namyats or similar|pg||
nt|mariner1: N has no where to easily go except away|pg||
nt|brolucius: Pass - second application of the brakes.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: ouah|pg||
nt|ralfwil: ?????|pg||
nt|andyv:  I guess E did|pg||
nt|jtr: Tough situation in 4th for big balanced hands|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: playing a weak NT however it is often quite useful to use 2@h as p/c|pg||
nt|mariner1: no entry to dummy hurts|pg||
nt|cicus: W trying to create a swing|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: east not showing too much respect for his partne here|pg||
nt|andyv:  now the work begins|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Victor knows about Wet Wet Wet because the members are Scottish. The band was formed in Clydebank in the early 80's|pg||
nt|andyv:  everyone pass the W hand?|pg||
nt|andyv:  cash two @s and switch to @c|pg||
nt|bobh1: south african |pg||
nt|andyv:  agree, Adam|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: even with 4-4 hands very weak|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok i admit i am lost now|pg||
nt|andyv:  need to bail out more often |pg||
nt|brolucius: But South had a chunky 11 points, so he is entitled to give a full-blooded game try with 2NT on the second round.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|brolucius: I think so.|pg||
nt|jtr: Immediate 1NT is usually 11-14ish|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, I was cruel on him, I know how miserable he is feeling now|pg||
nt|jtr: I am surprised he didnt rebid 2NT but maybe their methods differ|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Some play 11-16 over a major in case partner responds to a double at the 2-level and you have to bid 2NT with 15|pg||
nt|milton_se: nice fertlizer by Nunes|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ritong: lol|pg||
nt|lml: going to make |pg||
nt|hedyg: i think best defense can beat it|pg||
nt|mariner1: another close dbl...... better to pass and hope the confusion causes a set|pg||
nt|lml: he has to play diamonds to make I think|pg||
nt|lml: if they play trump|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like relay to 3@c and 3@d may show this hand|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: this auction would be fun to interpret|pg||
nt|hedyg: i am trying|pg||
nt|xenya: i can see them reaching 4@H now -- not a bad contract actually|pg||
nt|mariner1: well he could overtake K@D with A@D|pg||
nt|brolucius: South now expects North to have little wasted in diamonds. Unlucky!|pg||
nt|cuttysark: He will also be disappointed to find there are 3 trump losers|pg||
pc|d3|nt|marlowepi: it is well now that sabine and daniela play a completely natural system with no fancy artificialities:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well known|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, the 2@D preempt worked wonderfully|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In my opinion 3@h is enough on S and N will raise to 4@h with a better hand|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|lestergold: I cannot see why east has puled this double|pg||
nt|ritong: go and get em fulvio|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
nt|bridge_one: normally in Italy the first rever is multiway|pg||
pc|dT|nt|brolucius: Slow as ithe bidding was, East should have thought longer before pulling partner's double. Surely Double and Double had only one meaning?|pg||
nt|lml: I would have ducked the spade though|pg||
nt|sharkey: Actually 7@H is not an overbid - just extremely unlucky it doesn't make|pg||
nt|jtr: I play 11-15 with a range enquiry|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but they could use also a polish style, where 1@H 4@d = i want play 4@h |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Another way to create swings is to make penalty doubles - perhaps South should hae tried a double here|pg||
pc|d7|nt|cuttysark: I am sure some will bid, but I am chicken|pg||
nt|hedyg: especially since i dont know why N did not pass 2NT|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am not generally impressed by those who make a lot of bids. Those who make a lot of tricks... I respect them more.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: on the @d finesse and a non-@s ruff basically... not great odds|pg||
nt|hedyg: except if they play 10-12 NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  not a ba contract that will fail|pg||
nt|andyv:  bad|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Would not be unreasonable to lead a diamond, and then ....|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I think 2NT might have been a relay to 3@c, Hedy|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: and 3@d showing 4=5 majors Inv. maybe|pg||
nt|andyv:  it looked like a relay and 3@d showed a smolanish hand|pg||
nt|brolucius: If Culbertson were alive today, he would be saying "I don't see North's two-and-a-half honor tricks. No wonder they got too high!"|pg||
nt|cicus: that was surely penalties for the, and he had to bid hearts sooner or later|pg||
nt|cicus: *them|pg||
pc|d8|nt|brolucius: And East had brilliant defence against spades himself, a singleton club and two trumps. |pg||
nt|andyv:  but I'm not sure it was GF|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is all about now whether east can restrict his iamond losers to only one|pg||
nt|ritong: a small @d is coming that s for sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: there are4 black suit tricks available in dummy but communications are very bad |pg||
nt|brolucius: East is lucky that there is any play for game their way. He could not expect West to hold three hearts when he said that he wanted to defend.|pg||
nt|ritong: unless he tries the @c hook to pitch a @s|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Perhaps a @c finess and a @s discard followed by @d10 can make anything|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: minaldo is thinking........ |pg||
nt|ritong: who would not|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a club hook followed by a spade discard sill leaves a lot of diamonds to deal with- he could then afford to lose 2 dimaonds but not three|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, that is why i suggested " a @d now"|pg||
nt|andyv:  David, is that before or after the 800?:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: If you are a chicken, Liz, what does that leave me to be?|pg||
nt|hedyg: what do you want to bid on the 4 level?|pg||
mc|6|nt|hedyg: now more @hs|pg||
nt|andyv:  and a game finally doesn't make!|pg||
nt|cuttysark: That makes you some person|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pulga has to find three discards and he won't like that|pg||
nt|jcmax: Usually it is not a good idea to let the opponents play on the 2-level in a known 8 card fit. But here maybe N got dissuaded from another action by W apparent short hesitation.|pg||

nt|lml: tough hand for declarer and defenders.|pg||
nt|mariner1: a lesson in not making close dbl's|pg||
nt|hedyg: or beat it if you do|pg||
nt|mariner1: you only gain 1 imp if beating it one anyway|pg||
nt|andyv:  since they opened 3@s:)|pg||

nt|cuttysark: If you want to bid, you need that convention|pg||

nt|jtr: Speeding thinks up thank God!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let's see if Fulvio upgrades this hand to 1@H (14+)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The alternative is 2@H  10-13|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: North actually :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  by N (as someone else also corrected me!)|pg||
nt|hedyg: not so calm|pg||
nt|mariner1: oh the 2@C on 9 is DBL in Open Room|pg||
nt|milton_se: why not? hadn't denied an opening hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: well they are down 36:0 this segment so 1 imp would be nice|pg||
nt|sharkey: Shud E have bid 7@H with 6 trumps only - after pd bid 6@H on her own?|pg||
nt|jtr: Nicely bid next door|pg||
nt|peachy: i think too good for 2H (10-13)|pg||
nt|april7: I think you can't fool opps.always, if you have the right cards, they can't take your tricks away, better to give right informations to peven if Opps know about it|pg||
nt|cicus: why did he not bid 2@D over 1@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: from an income to -500|pg||
nt|hedyg: keep 3 NT as option?|pg||
nt|hedyg: no|pg||
nt|brolucius: I booked in for this session because I thought it might be all over by the 6th session. Shows what I know.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: No, 4@D is sensible|pg||
nt|ritong: of course, the danger is part has the right hand for 3 nT to be the last winning game|pg||
nt|brolucius: Absurd to hope for 3NT, as I see it. Much more important to pre-empt.|pg||
nt|andyv:  board 8 will be a push|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Seems they never upgrade|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I dislike 2@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let's ask K&R|pg||
nt|haans: 1@Sx?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1@S interests S|pg||
nt|jcmax: South's heart is beating igher now. Oh, maybe I can double them later!|pg||
mb|1S|nt|andyv:  question was whether first Dbl asked for pd's 2nd suit and 2nd dbl was penalty or coop since it was in front of @s bidder|pg||
nt|brolucius: Thank goodness the West hand was not dealt in an American event.|pg||
nt|mariner1: at the risk of 5|pg||
nt|lml: I think if he ducks the spade he can make it after three rounds of hearts on the diamond club squeeze|pg||
nt|mariner1: ot more if the dbl gave the line|pg||
nt|mariner1: or|pg||
nt|lml: but he does have to duck the spade|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@H?|pg||
nt|ritong: but all in all, giving an exact picture of your hand asap is certainly the reasonable option|pg||
nt|haans: i think 2 3 imps is nothing|pg||
nt|cicus: I think 15.5|pg||

nt|bridge_one: true, the idea was of Garozzo, for juniores team|pg||
nt|cicus: or so|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@c 9/13 5+@c|pg||
nt|roswolf: interesting auction in the other room to a poor contract|pg||
nt|brolucius: You are moving into my special territory, Andy, getting the declarer wrong. I once got the trump suit wrong too (as 825 kibitzers pointed out).|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: lol|pg||
nt|andyv:  hee hee|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Giubilo's 3@D in the other room showed 5-5, good hand but not game-forcing|pg||
nt|haans: hard to x 2@D|pg||
mb|2C|nt|lml: the defense had its chances after that|pg||
nt|mariner1: can S pass this?|pg||
nt|lml: I couldnt|pg||
nt|lml: even if it was allowed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 10 tricks in hearts, E-W have a save in 5mi|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Anyone but me who prefers 1@H to double?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 10 tricks in hearts - 9 in minors so potential for small swing - |pg||
nt|sharkey: I'm with you Roland|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, sorry. This is 4th of 5. But could have been over by the 5th session. That's what I should have said.|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h can go for a ride|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now 4@S by West if South passes.|pg||
nt|hedyg: lightner doubles on the 4 level?|pg||
nt|bobh1: pretty good 1n|pg||
nt|mariner1: E would have a real problem pulling trumps here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: another 3nt on EW|pg||
nt|peachy: in the given sys, I would have chosen 1H, but I trust Fantoni knows better what they have to do|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 14.70|pg||
nt|cicus: but that using that count an opening bid starts from about 13 points|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 2N shows 5+spades, invitational plus|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.jeffgoldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=AJ+AJ98xx+Kxx+xx|pg||
nt|jtr: and now?|pg||
nt|jcmax: Except that some players believe in the rule: If they dbl you on the 1-lvl.....RUN!!!!!|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes!!!|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mariner1: well he has a ratty 13|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 4@S is not so cold - beaten by 4 rounds of hearts (thank you)|pg||
nt|ritong: !!|pg||
nt|hedyg: no!|pg||
nt|hedyg: well..wow|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW could get to high here maybe|pg||
nt|hedyg: same here, 2@c would show a good hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  even 2/1 bidders would have hard time staying of 3@d|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@s|pg||
nt|hedyg: you dont?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: doubling 2 NT establishes a forcing situation, imho|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|ritong: if west wants his pard to bid his second suit, he simply passes 3@s|pg||
nt|andyv:  agree, but still makes the 2nd dbl questionable|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok, i'll go with that|pg||
nt|brolucius: Look at it this way: how on earth can West take the (huge) penalty against 3@S other than by doubling at every opportunity?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Looks like that there is no doubles for penalty in modern bidding.....|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Im  with the double|pg||
nt|cuttysark: West has taken a vow of silence|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|ritong: caviezel really is pessimistic|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Who needs a diamond stopper|pg||
nt|jtr: A shrug and 3NT:)|pg||
nt|jtr: 4@s looks best actually|pg||
nt|ritong: especially when trumps are @cs|pg||
nt|jcmax: I am not telling. You might use it against me. :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's not obvious to do anything with Giubilo's cards|pg||
nt|milton_se: xx  AKs  Exxxxx xxx -- would you bid?|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@S is middle-of-the-road action, facing a vulnerable weak two-bid.|pg||
nt|cicus: yes|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mariner1: looks more like 10|pg||
nt|lml: hes vulnerable|pg||
nt|lml: East is hoping hes going to pull to spades|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@s making|pg||
nt|lml: but 3NT not making|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if only they could invent something like that for declarer play:)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now dbl by South was takeout of course|pg||
nt|andyv:  are we sure about pass?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: an advantage of using Gazilli or playing a strong club-type system is that your Jump shifts now can show a good 5-5 hand but not GF|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes, it's NF|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  if first dbl is GF, then pass would also be forcing... just depends on agreements|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is not GF. It suggests interest in penalising the opponents. (Like redouble over a double).|pg||
nt|ritong: GF might be atad exaggerated  let s make it " board is ourse, don t let em get away with it"|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|andyv:  OK...next:))|pg||
nt|andyv:  if suits are 5-5 why would you prefer @ds to @ss?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|hedyg: i think after 3@H he can guess the @ss|pg||
nt|andyv:  A@s followed by high club|pg||
nt|brolucius: A generous adjective.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@s is cold and might even get doubled|pg||
nt|jtr: Wow he heard me!|pg||
nt|haans: but who many of us have not? I would|pg||
nt|cuttysark: This was a genuine chance for Villa Fabbriche - how about 3NT?|pg||
nt|brolucius: They must take a diamond ruff now.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I wonder what the double means|pg||
nt|lml: if anything|pg||
nt|lml: I sometimes play it means dont lead a heart|pg||
nt|sharkey: 5@C good sacrifice|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt winning bridge|pg||
nt|mariner1: guess this always makes with careful play|pg||
nt|bobh1: not sure they can beat this|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: =D|pg||
nt|peachy: impressive\|pg||
nt|haans: you are never happy|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: don't lead anything except a @H :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  can't beat it |pg||
nt|bobh1: the defense has too much to do|pg||
nt|jtr: Wonders of thought transference|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT shows 5+ spades, invitational or better|pg||
nt|bridge_one: North could try a DBL again instead 3@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|hedyg: he has an honour in @D|pg||
nt|brolucius: No doubt 3@D promises five diamonds, giving North the option of passing. By passing (rather than bidding 3@S) he makes sure that the auction stays at the three-level.|pg||
nt|andyv:  if N passes with that hand, probably should have passed 1@s:)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: and as it turns out, 3@d is an excellent contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: i have to leave - enjoyed - ty all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks Carl|pg||
nt|sharkey: bye|pg||
nt|odysseus69: bye Carl|pg||
nt|cicus: hide your screen pls, Roberta|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 9 triks seam sure here|pg||
nt|april7: but 3NT ok!! very good choice by S!|pg||
pc|h3|nt|cuttysark: Couple of diamond ruffs would be handy|pg||
pc|h7|nt|hedyg: he wanted to X 4 @s maybe|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lml: and that is a good meaning on this hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard to beat 3N when declarer starts with 8 tricks|pg||
nt|bobh1: if they try to set up a @h or @c trick, that will give declarer his 9th|pg||
nt|andyv:  E will hook @h and claim|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes it has play|pg||
nt|april7: finally a swing for NS|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ralfwil: there is an old expression in sweden 3nt will always be right|pg||
pc|d5|nt|andyv:  D not too creative|pg||
nt|ritong: or very brave  accepting possible double game swing that way is temerity, imho|pg||
nt|jcmax: Yes, it is quite good with maximum point count and a decent 5-card suit. The KJ bare in @S is a minus though.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's different for Sabine anyway, because her 1@S does not promise more than four cards|pg||
nt|haans: and loooooooooooong m|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jtr: Great judgment anyway|pg||
nt|jtr: In me if he saw the comment:)|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|pg||
nt|april7: take your tricks!!|pg||
nt|roswolf: rather negating thei teammates score in the other room|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hedyg: just disc your @cs|pg||
nt|andyv:  it may be I guess I'm to inured into going back to pd's first suit if I'm 2-2|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|nt|mariner1: @D would not have been my pitch holding A@C|pg||
nt|hedyg: he better cover this|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Why not play a small @h from the table and @h9 from the hand?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer false-cards the @D5, from @D7-5-3, in a desperate attempt to stave off the ruff. |pg||
nt|cuttysark: My spies point out that another way to creat a swing is to play in a different game, perhaps slightly anti-percentage|pg||
nt|brolucius: I don't like the idea of responding 3NT at all. There is plenty of chance of a swing in 4@S, as we have just seen.|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: Well I will have to leave u as a wholeload of visitors hav turned up announced here so i leave you to the tender mercies of I mean capable hands of my great fellow commentators|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|andyv:  Bob Hammon rule too|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|haans: i think Hamman did say that 2|pg||
nt|cuttysark: you don't think he would trust you, do you?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|andyv:  ok, that was creative|pg||
nt|daman: on Board 23    EW are playing a tame 3@C|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Probably hoping 4@H would fail - as it probably would if he doubled|pg||
nt|daman: so a big swing back to Angelini|pg||
nt|mariner1: is Hammon Swedish? :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: they both have had a good board on the same hand|pg||
nt|jcmax: this is getting dangerous|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3NT could be a laughable contract.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jtr: I rather thought not|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Or a practical one, as here|pg||
nt|cuttysark: If partner has KQxxxx in spades I would like to play 3NT, thank you|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|pg||
nt|brolucius: text books point out that you should lead a trump when responder prefers the opener's second suit. That is because he may well be 5-4 in the suits and responder will therefore be ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: very short in the first-bid suit. Even so, West  has led a trump here, hoping to stop ruffs in the dummy.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk2: It's making now|pg||
nt|haans: not fair|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Franchi will only get his two trump tricks|pg||
nt|jcmax: it seems to me the defense would have been best of by leading a @H from the very beginning eventually forcing declarer|pg||
nt|haans: well its still no game :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: lead your long suit when you have long trumps|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jtr: Rather that he trusted himself:)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ritong: ciao mike|pg||
nt|hedyg: now needs to tap him in @H|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: right, declarer played for any non 5-1 split :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: and 4-2@s|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: very reasonable... especially when he cannot see all the hands :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: small @H?|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|andyv:  take care Mike|pg||
nt|Walddk2: VF have yet to get on the board in this set|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 0-50|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Odd - the first single-figure swing in this one-sided segment|pg||

nt|ritong: as usual|pg||
nt|lml: its easier when you are up by 35|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry pd, if i had known that A@H was in E........|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good morning to Thomas Gotard|pg||
nt|tomi2: hi all|pg||
nt|brolucius: West played @C6 and then @C7. If that denied a doubleton (as is normal), then East's 3rd club is hard to understand. |pg||
nt|bobh1: kit woolsey likes to say: bidding 3n is a dirty job but somebody has to do it|pg||
nt|jcmax: Always good not to go down. Especially when vulnerable. Even though +90 isn't much, it still feels good.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: @H lead would beat the contract, but impossible after the auction|pg||
nt|xenya: was safe to duck? |pg||
nt|andyv:  it was safe, I just don't think he did|pg||
nt|brolucius: Good bidding at the other table.|pg||
nt|hedyg: was safer not to duck|pg||
nt|jcmax: Yes, Hedy, that is very good advice. Except when your trump holding looks vulnerable to you getting endplayed. Then it is often a good idea to lead a short suit to try and score ...|pg||
nt|jcmax: ruffs and avoid the trump endplay|pg||
nt|hedyg: right|pg||
nt|brolucius: When you are not immediately down in the red suits, you can play for a swing (in 4@S) by finessing East for @SQ-x-x.|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mariner1: this is an interesting hand maybe|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: we all gone to same school|pg||
nt|roswolf: and this hand could have its moments too|pg||
nt|xenya: about the same i think :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  3 or 4@h by N?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 2@s :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: S did not open in OR, harder here|pg||
nt|brolucius: You should perhaps check (with a 2NT enquiry) whether partner has @SK-Q. If so, then 3NT might be possible. |pg||
mb|1S|nt|andyv:  another 4@h hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@D showing the balanced 18-19|pg||
nt|andyv:  they haven't been that creative so far, Adam:)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I think 4 though... depends on pre-empt style though|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@C is a good shot.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@H would be nice now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They will do very well to bid a slam from here|pg||
nt|andyv:  i'd prefer a higher bid with the N hand...3@c gives opps way too much space|pg||
nt|brolucius: It shows heart support and suggests a club lead if East plays some contract. (More usual on a suit headed by A-Q.)|pg||
nt|mariner1: part scores only here|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Did he not realise that there was no need to answer to doorbell?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Would anyone overcall 1@S here?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Boderline.|pg||
nt|ritong: very envisageable|pg||
nt|hedyg: i would not, bad suit and too many @ds|pg||
nt|brolucius: In other words, not quite borderline.|pg||
nt|cicus: good start to a club partial|pg||
nt|cicus: would be even better if X wer T/O now|pg||
nt|andyv:  6chp, opps have @s suit and pd has a weak hand... you aren't buying this contract|pg||
nt|hedyg: double is almost never penalty|pg||
nt|andyv:  unless 2@h can contain @ss|pg||
nt|cicus: 1@C 14+ unbal or 15+ bal|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ritong: promise my pard bids 3@s over that and i come in|pg||
nt|mariner1: running scores at http://www.federbridge.it/g2bwrama/ftpout/minirank.html|pg||
nt|hedyg: it shows hcps|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 3N EW any lead if they find it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C is Precision-ish, 10-15 with 6 clubs, or 5 clubs and a 4c major|pg||
nt|lml: or both|pg||
nt|brolucius: You certainly wouldn't overcall 1@H if your suit was hearts. 1@S does at least take away space.|pg||
nt|hedyg: remember that pd is a passed hand now!|pg||
nt|cicus: it seems it is|pg||
nt|bridge_one: East know West with less of 10 hcp if unbalanced, so can easy pass also with 4@s notvuln|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1@S = conventional?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i am not sure about 1@S|pg||
nt|brolucius: I prefer 3@H to double, even if they are on the same wavelength as to its meaning.|pg||
nt|andyv:  this bidding just makes it easier for E/W to evaluate their hands... Nunes should already know that Fantoni has a stiff @c|pg||
nt|cicus: 1@D shows herts|pg||
mb|2C|an| |nt|andyv:  2N invite with 4 ... could be better hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  this could be costly|pg||
nt|bobh1: in this case is better|pg||
nt|roswolf: or just a psyche|pg||
nt|bridge_one: could be also 4cards ....|pg||
nt|cicus: 0-11|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  and overbidders delight hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S is on as it is|pg||
nt|tomi2: both, south and west try to show a constructive raise via 2nt / the cuebid|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i presume 1@s conventional after the auction|pg||
nt|bridge_one: or 6@S weak or less of 4@s|pg||
nt|bridge_one: many use 1@H 1@s 0/4 cards|pg||
nt|brolucius: Too much, surely. |pg||
nt|hedyg: only -4|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: wow... Fantoni will have to take the plunge I think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fantoni's hand getting better every time N and S make a bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  and now, the stiff @h is shown to Fantoni|pg||
mb|3S|nt|brolucius: 3@S was a bit risky, but East was short in hearts and felt he had to act. The story may have a happy ending.|pg||
nt|bobh1: even white he should drive to game at imps|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Duplicating the auction in the other room, (apart from the transfer)|pg||
nt|hedyg: forcing pass?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: pass and pull to 5@s perhaps is what he will do now?|pg||
nt|haans: last time you said that 4@S + 5@C was bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: After elimination, E can play @d and anoter to the @dQ|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d relay|pg||
nt|lml: brb|pg||
nt|mariner1: and no way to beat this as the card lay|pg||
nt|hedyg: no, can just take 4@hs on lead|pg||
nt|april7: thats for minors probably|pg||
nt|bridge_one: and 1@h 1Nt 5@S |pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm nice auction this:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: seems N migth have pushed back here with his distribution|pg||
mb|4C|nt|odysseus69: 4 spades cold- 5H down 2 - but no need to save when they dont bid it|pg||
nt|andyv:  E is border line... but with prime cards... good 3@s bid|pg||
nt|bobh1: there is no % languishing in 3@h at imps|pg||
nt|mariner1: and N will lead which @D?|pg||
nt|andyv:  depends on the range of 2N bid|pg||
nt|haans: game still need 50% nonvul?|pg||
nt|bobh1: at this table they know the match is close|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: what else than P from E?|pg||
nt|bobh1: at the other,fantunes probably think they are still behind|pg||
nt|andyv:  true, no reason for him to suspect that they've gained any ground.|pg||
nt|bobh1: as the number of boards dwindles, this mind set could be a factor|pg||
nt|marlowepi: guessing shoes|pg||
nt|jcmax: Now where s could double for the @S lead, declarer will have to guess the @C suit|pg||
nt|april7: a lot of points are involved here, everybody is bidding|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@c after DBL is natural|pg||
nt|roswolf: well south should know what is going on|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i presume Fantoni will bid 3@S now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, as a slam try|pg||
nt|brolucius: N/S had caused plenty of problems and 4@S might well have been passed out. A shame to give them a second chance with 5@H.|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: The diamond length is an asset. I bid|pg||
nt|cicus: such is when you are too quick, Liz :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: no :) pass|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I don't like opening 2@S with a 7-card suit anyway...|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ritong: question is : whay will nunes play after the trump ace|pg||
nt|haans: but the master never seem deperate |pg||
nt|bobh1: a @c to the K is my favorite play but i don't think is percentage|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, you should certainly start with the jack|pg||
nt|april7: E suspects something, the strongest person here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Fantoni passed bec the partner passed at 2Nt telling not a good hand |pg||
nt|bridge_one: West know the partner full of high cards in @d after the sequence|pg||
nt|jcmax: not very enterprising action here|pg||
nt|cicus: neither do I|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: west could bid anything here depending on what he thinks is going on 4@S is not out of the picture|pg||
nt|roswolf: but now is|pg||
mb|6C|nt|Walddk2: He can't quite make 4 on this layout, and he might have been in game if he had overcalled. So in this case Angelini did the right thing by passing|pg||
nt|brolucius: We must remember (at the end of the session) how good Roberta has been. I hope I am not invoking commentators' curse but everything has been excellent so far.|pg||
nt|hedyg: on the Michaels hand bd 24 Fantoni bid 1 @s over 1@H with 87432|pg||
nt|haans: desperate|pg||
nt|jcmax: The percentage play looking only at the suit is running the Jack. Here, however, if N has AQx or AQxx, declarer cannot succeed anyway, because there is no entry to dummy if N ducks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@S now is a slam try, whereas a direct 5@S over 5@H would have been competitive|pg||
nt|andyv:  apparently you are right, David|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmmm surely Nunes had extras|pg||
nt|brolucius: Nor me, although many would baulk at a vulnerable 3@S on such a weak hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: what*|pg||
nt|ritong: ofc|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: cover and suit blocks|pg||
nt|andyv:  what was that all about?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there might be an entry, but not quick enough|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Silly me|pg||
nt|hedyg: why would he not accept the slamtry?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I think West needed to accept here|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: rather than considering signing off in 3@h it seems E had slam ambitions|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Can W have a strong hand on this bidding and E has 12!|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Walddk2: Angelini did what he could to bloack the suit, and he succeeded|pg||
nt|jcmax: The same however is true if if North has Axx and s singleton Q|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ritong: 2@h is ugly|pg||
nt|bobh1: this could cost the match|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This should make. 1 IMP to VF, at last?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not trivial - but if he plays for Qx diamonds in East he will triumph|pg||
nt|cicus: luckily, @Ds have to be led only once from dummy|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jtr: A mountain of work to do|pg||
nt|cuttysark: No convenient dummy entry with htis forcing game|pg||
nt|jtr: 3 finesses with one entry|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: He knows partner has @c shortness, @s length and values, oh which very few are probably wasted...|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: as is 1@S|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, but less:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  who said bridge was a pretty game?|pg||
nt|mariner1: some miscommunications here somehow|pg||
nt|haans: sort of given it away|pg||
nt|andyv:  E very inconsistant on two boards (see board 3)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: in open room played 4@S, so no, but if would play only 3@S this hand could be a double score|pg||
nt|april7: either a push or 1 imp|pg||
pc|d5|nt|odysseus69: once West decided to make the most encouraging noise - 3D might have worked better than 3H|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@H is normal, I would have thought, with such poor spades. Prefer 1@S when the suit is good.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: It is surely not a beautiful game|pg||
nt|hedyg: stopped opps from playing 4 @H, he is in 3 @s|pg||
nt|jcmax: The only 3-1 case where declarer can win is if S has singleton A|pg||
nt|cicus: maybe ruff high, 2 round of trums ending in dummy, then a @D|pg||
nt|andyv:  Apparently, Hedy only talks to Fulvio|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|andyv:  if playing wk/st michaels, probably 1@s is the value bid on that hand|pg||
nt|jtr: 2 possibly now|pg||
nt|sybarra: not much in it |pg||
pc|d3|nt|ritong: here we go|pg||
nt|ritong: some other black card|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It doesn't matter a lot with this format, but ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: but E did not know, hoping for A10 doubelton in N|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now @S by West|pg||
nt|april7: ruff with ace, its then a push|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Some don't double with the shape Lauria has, but the thing is that if you pass, the opponents will buy the contract in 2@S most of the time|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|bridge_one: better A in @c, yes !|pg||
nt|bridge_one: East can't have A in @s, so the ruff the A was obliged|pg||
pc|cK|nt|brolucius: An immediate 4@H by North would have caused problems too. East would probably bid a heavy 4@S and West would have little reason to bid again. |pg||
pc|c3|nt|cuttysark: not his day|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@H  pass  1@S  pass  ;   2@S  all pass|pg||
nt|jcmax: I am a firm believer of taking some kind of action when the opponents stop on the 2-level in a probable fit noo matter what.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|hedyg: NS play odd encouraging and Angelini had no odd card in @h..|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this works because @c are 3-3 and N cannot have more than 2 @d|pg||
nt|andyv:  good lead directer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: My experience is that Michaels does not work well with intermediate hands. Weak or very strong are better in my opinion|pg||
mc|11|nt|jcmax: If @C are 2-2 then he has to guess|pg||
nt|hedyg: making 11 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: well the spade slam doesn't look so good as the diamond slam|pg||
nt|andyv:  that was my thought originally|pg||
