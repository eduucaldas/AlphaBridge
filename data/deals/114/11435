mb|d|nt|athene: misunderstanding over 4@S?|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|jtr: Crouch kept cue-bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: about 4@s|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: east thought 4@C was just another choice-of-games cuebid|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: west thought they had agreed diamonds definitely by then|pg||
nt|athene: so one person thought 4@S was natural and one thought it was a control|pg||
nt|jtr: I prefer 3@d over 2@c Surely that must be forcing?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|jtr: Hirst agrees|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|athene: well, 3@D wld have been a jump, even, in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: so perhaps it was even more appealing there|pg||
nt|jtr: Someone suggests 3@c is a transfer  Only in Crouch's world could that be possible|pg||
nt|jtr: It is a dark and fearsome place|pg||
nt|athene: the modern tendency is indeed for 3@C bids in all auctions to be transfers, but there are still some isolated pockets of resistance|pg||
nt|vugraphzyj: ...where things are never what they seem|pg||
nt|jtr: Indeed|pg||
nt|athene: west should just pass now|pg||
nt|athene: he has shown a good hand with diamonds, and his partner said "good, let's play in 3nt"|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, where else could be better?|pg||
nt|xenya: has he shown a hand that good?|pg||
nt|jtr: Not quite that good no|pg||
nt|vugraphzyj: Nowhere. We'rein Solihull|pg||
nt|jtr: But partner needs an awful lot for slam|pg||
nt|athene: he needs a spade control, and enough in diamonds that they are running|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|jtr: If he wants a slam why not 4@c?|pg||
mb|5D|nt|athene: if he has only the @SK, not the @SA, you need somewhere for the other spade to go - maybe pd's @CK or @CQJ with a ruffing finesse|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtr: Assuming he has @d support|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps west is more concerned that 3nt might not be safe on a spade lead|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jtr: Yes, that explains 4@d rather than 4@c|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|athene: sure, east did bid 3nt knowing that south had five spades, but he might be thinking that west would have more in spades for his X of 1@C|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|dT|pg||
pc|d8|nt|jtr: Well, cant he bid 3@s to ask?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|dK|nt|athene: a spec points out that of course in 6@D, the @SK probably isn't enough, with the lead coming through it|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h4|nt|athene: so you are asking pd to have specifically the @SA|pg||
mc|11|nt|jtr: I am sure you are right that West just didnt fancy 3NT|pg||
pg||

nt|mariner1: Hi Roland, Jordan, Ant and all|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: EW are playing a strong club system|pg||
nt|jcwla: Wow, exciting board to start with.|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes east/west play strong club|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: yes dull hand probably|pg||
nt|mariner1: some how this does not look right|pg||
nt|jcwla: E passed, then the auction as presented.|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think pass by W is even more interesting:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  red vs. black hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  and E can support both:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: NS are playing 1@C=clubs or balanced|pg||
nt|jcwla: Everything is one space off.|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1N by N is interesting|pg||
nt|andyv:  now making sense|pg||
nt|mariner1: N 1N is still interesting :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: really 1nt on that tat!?|pg||
nt|jcwla: N passed, 1NT by E.|pg||
nt|roswolf: something still wrong|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lestergold: well nine top tricks in 3N not that fascinating|pg||
nt|pamela: Hi  Sharyn.. did my usual  went to wrong table   sigh|pg||
nt|sharynr: we start witha potential slam|pg||
nt|sharynr: hi Pam :)|pg||
mb|2C|mb|3C|nt|roswolf: 3nt looks normal to bid here|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s play a natural system|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S  looks the likely conract    likely to fail  with 2 trump tricks offside|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi David|pg||
nt|lestergold: Well I have to disclos some bias here altho its a confused bias|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|lestergold: N/S are my sons team mates who are playing in the open room|pg||
nt|lestergold: However I taught Cameron Small top play bridge 30 years ago - my instructiion did not include his 2Hbid with that collection|pg||
nt|pamela: it looks like a pretty nice one to with just one sp laser on a good day|pg||
nt|pamela: poser|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: who are e/w?|pg||
nt|lestergold: Here we have N/S a very accomplished senior opartnership Paul Hackett just back having won world seniors in Brazil in the seniors|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry duplication of chat|pg||
nt|lestergold: Butthese are a very regular and successful pair on antional and international level too|pg||
nt|lestergold: and of course twoo well known players hailing form The North of England i blieve|pg||
nt|roswolf: very true have played in open championships for england|pg||
mb|4C|nt|lestergold: mind you Heather does have a losing play option available|pg||
nt|sharynr: looks like only the @S slam will make though|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: this could go down if Heather decided on the club finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: if she judges east to have short club for his bid she might considr finessing the first club to cater for J or more to 4 with West|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmmmm i cash out the clubs - whats the problem|pg||
mb|4S|mb|d|nt|lestergold: Im not suere about the N/S agreements here but im sure that that Erichsen would like his S bid here not have been forcing|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: I'm up to date now - sorry about that|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: tray was not all the way through, so I missed the first pass|pg||
nt|andyv:  np.. you made it exciting, Ant:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  W has run out of options, unless pass asks for @s control|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: checked it three times now, so pretty confident it's right :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: OK:)|pg||
mb|6D|nt|roswolf: indeed e/w are solid players|pg||
nt|lestergold: SAo Small's cheeky intervention has helped push Irens overboard here|pg||
nt|ady: unlcuky hand for n/s|pg||
nt|jcwla: As the late Jerry Kuklin said on such an auction, "If she cuebids _one more time_, she's playing it there."|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: if she does i will sympathise|pg||
nt|lestergold: and Mr. Osborne has given his opinion of that contract one which I share|pg||
nt|roswolf: west is imaginative|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 4D looks a little over reached here|pg||
nt|sharynr: the play should be fairly straightforward|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lestergold: but she hasnt|pg||
nt|andyv:  S is on lead so I don't see how 6@d has any value|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|nt|ady: no   playing from the top|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|roswolf: whats the problem!?:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: not too many entries to dummy and heather doesnt want to use the only one for  a play of borderline validity|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: with both heart honours wrong contract is doomed|pg||
nt|lestergold: well do you want to be i9n game opposite a weak no trump with no disclosed spade support with south's hand David?|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|pamela: Sharyn do we know  if they play  a canape style  bid the 4 card frst.. a kib asked why they did not bid 2D first beeing the longer suit|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|mariner1: Crouch maybe too aggressive trying to catchup|pg||
pc|h9|nt|roswolf: i believe e/w again play a natural system|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|ady: the game is a good one    but Norths hand is suitable in trhat it is limited but has 3 aces|pg||
pc|dA|nt|andyv:  W must have thought 4@s showed some type of control in @s?|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|dT|pg||
nt|roswolf: i agree mike bill hirst a little too aggressive|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed i think west thought 4@S PROMISED A CONTROL - MAYBE IT SHOULD|pg||
mc|11|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2N!|an|GF !H and !c|nt|dburn: not quite sure when West intends to bid those spades, if ever|pg||
nt|athene: he is biding his time :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|athene: he probably hopes opps will get to 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt probably a transfer to clubs|pg||
nt|dburn: perhaps he is hoping to end up on lead against 3NT|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|athene: now if 3@S is shortage, that will make south happy, surely|pg||
nt|dburn: Liggins still looking for a slam - maybe South will have three aces and @cK|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s7|pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: to be fair to west, it's often best to pass rather than bid with 5332 shape over opps' 1nt|pg||
nt|athene: but once they start showing hearts, i think you might want to tell the world you have five spades|pg||
nt|jtr: Oh i agree but over 2@h?|pg||
nt|athene: as Crouch did in the other room|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|pc|d3|nt|athene: hidden tiger, crouching spade bid, or something|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|jtr: lol|pg||

nt|yo_yo: hi there|pg||
nt|sharynr: and yet another potential slam here!|pg||
nt|jcwla: Oh, I don't think it should without prior discussion.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|andyv:  another fun hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: going down in 1nt was unexpected on this layout|pg||
nt|lestergold: good one witout the weak jump on his right not that good could easily have ben 2 club losers on other days instead of 2 spade losers|pg||
nt|lestergold: it was thin for a nonm vul game in my opinion|pg||
nt|sharynr: albeit worse|pg||
nt|andyv:  pass is too conservative with W hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: twice bitten etc|pg||
nt|andyv:  means you bare the other arm:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would bid 2@S at this vul|pg||
mb|2D|nt|sharynr: so is this a weak NT or a promoted strong NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: the key situation here is whether derek can pick two tricks form hearts|pg||
nt|roswolf: south has an unattractive choice|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1nt maybe?|pg||
nt|lestergold: South has very little and not in one of North's suits|pg||
nt|lestergold: and they are vulnerable|pg||
nt|lestergold: scope for getting into trouble here|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS have 4@H however EW have 4@S save|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lestergold: Mike Gold here popping in to see what the chip off the old block is up to|pg||
nt|mmmakela: Hi all and welcome!|pg||
mb|2S|nt|lestergold: and Waterlow simply bidding the lower ranking of his two three carders|pg||
nt|roswolf: the axe falls|pg||
nt|lestergold: what else can he do?|pg||
nt|lestergold: pity Waterlow was not able to bid 1N he doesnt know about North'sspade holding |pg||
nt|lestergold: Hacket has no real reason here to bid over tyhis double|pg||
nt|lestergold: well most say that he is the old block himself now was 30 the other day|pg||
nt|jcwla: Oy.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lestergold: three tricks available in clubs in theory if the entries were available|pg||
nt|ady: n/s have found the only game that can make|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a min no trump and a min raise but helpful lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: this may well make|pg||
mb|4S|nt|roswolf: true but he knows his fate!?|pg||
nt|lestergold: another Tank Waterlow knows they are in serious trouble|pg||
nt|roswolf: south must take his medicine|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's the nightmare of bidding 1NT with a 5 card major, dummy goes down with 4 |pg||
nt|yo_yo: but on this occasion  4@S no good|pg||
nt|lestergold: Jd nicely placed for declarer i dont think defence can get at more that2 dims and 2 club tricks here|pg||
nt|ady: might be a swing for n/s  here   4 spades has no chance|pg||
nt|pamela: worse with cards in right places cannot argue with succes if they bid it|pg||
nt|roswolf: west plays a different game from all of us anyway|pg||
nt|jcwla: I liked the pass.  If I were going to bid, however, I would have done so before allowing N/S to communicate.|pg||
nt|roswolf: may well push n/s to 5|pg||
nt|andyv:  I would have just bid 4@d with N hand... N really has no slam interests (which this sequence shows)|pg||
mb|5H|nt|roswolf: and does|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: and it will be a large does if Hirst kicks off with trumps|pg||
nt|lestergold: dose|pg||

nt|roswolf: yes not the best lead i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Andy is on the Howard team, sitting out in this set|pg||
nt|sharynr: maybe Andy knows their style and system?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Totally agree, Andy.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|roswolf: looks -2|pg||
nt|dburn: odd, that - no real reason for Jones to raise to game|pg||

nt|Walddk5: Read above :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: good point David|pg||
pc|s6|nt|roswolf: well -1 now i think on normal play - but why spurn the club finesse?|pg||
nt|lestergold: when the 9H appears Derek will have sonmething to think about onm the second round of that suit|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|roswolf: a trick to lose in each side suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: SMALL leads IRENS by 17 IMPs|pg||

pc|dA|nt|dburn: and might have tried 3NT if he was going to bid game in any case|pg||
nt|lestergold: a lo of davids around here|pg||
nt|mariner1: Not sure I like 5@H here,,,,,, afterall he does not know how much N was|pg||
nt|mariner1: gambling|pg||
nt|jcwla: Again kings deceptive in terms of playing at the 5 level.|pg||
nt|andyv:  N showed some interest in slam |pg||
pc|dT|nt|lestergold: two playing and one commentating|pg||
nt|pamela: Andy might have a bit more of a definition than " stone age acol" |pg||
nt|gnasher: hackett waterlow play 14-16, 4-card majors, occasional canape|pg||

pc|d9|nt|yo_yo: home now|pg||
nt|gnasher: 2/1 FG except 1M-2C is two way|pg||

nt|andyv:  interesting play of 9@d|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H immediate with no cue does not say slam interest to me..... maybe I am old|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: adn good bye 4S|pg||
nt|lestergold: David Gold at unfavourable vulnerability not shy to make life awkward for his oppos|pg||
nt|mmmakela: the good thing for EW is that 3 @S was already too high|pg||
nt|dburn: well, 4@s had not really been in the room long enough to receive a welcome - no one will notice its departure|pg||
nt|lestergold: not to mention aggressive actrion by the other David|pg||
nt|lestergold: well it wont depart unkless Bakhsgi plays a diamond now|pg||
nt|dburn: or a club, perhaps|pg||
nt|lestergold: or i suppose a club will do for two off|pg||
nt|lestergold: thats what hes tanking abiout i dont think hes likelyto take the risk but he has seen david gold's suit pref|pg||
nt|dburn: anything else would be vaguely quixotic, but he has to think - does partner have a stiff club, or @dA?|pg||
nt|lestergold: adn as he has both he cant really go wrong|pg||
nt|dburn: as it happens, partner has both, but|pg||
nt|mariner1: fashioned :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  I would have played 3@d asking for @c|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sharynr: so Andy does bd 1 qualify for a their canape response?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: OK, modified stone age Acol then :)|pg||
nt|pamela: we wondered about that canaape  bit|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: seems just 6 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: specs are quesioning Hackett's original ouble- Hacket has a good 14 count with the other tqo suits and he has a couple of aces- no i would not think his bid was unreasonable just ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: very unlucky here|pg||
nt|lestergold: they have managed to avoid their 9 card spade fit obviously selway is a student of Kantar's who's dictum is do not stayman with 4333 distribution|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i might record this hand to use in my defence for future occasions|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|lestergold: well played |pg||
pc|cT|nt|roswolf: well now this is close but should now be -1|pg||
nt|lestergold: always easily to criticies players for stricking out thei necks at unfavourable vulnerability but if you do not bid you also can come a cropper|pg||
nt|roswolf: certainly north's style is to bid as often as possible|pg||
nt|lestergold: itsa damn good example|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: Hackett cannot be certain that E/W are not stealing the hand- many times whenyou hear this bidding and your side is cold for 4H|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lestergold: lack of entries to manufacture more than 2 club tricks|pg||
mc|10|nt|lestergold: of course playing the jH from =dummy was unfortunate on this layout|pg||

nt|athene: very bad to misremember what redouble means, for example|pg||

nt|yo_yo: tell us more Mike, I dont know him|pg||
mb|3S|nt|yo_yo: support x   shows 3@H maybe?|pg||
nt|lestergold: N/S can easily go minus here|pg||
nt|roswolf: support double - probably not|pg||
nt|lestergold: 12 on top|pg||
nt|lestergold: he used to write articles headed the convict club in which he used to lampoon london's leading rubbe bridge players - they were brilliant |pg||
nt|sharynr: what does the panel think East should bid if North transfers 2@H|pg||
nt|gnasher: That's a double of 1NT, we think|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|ady: did well to keep low in OR    2@H  on 4-3 fit plays ok|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2H does not look like automatic make here|pg||
nt|roswolf: so far identical auctions|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so they dont play support x  obviously,  x shows strong hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup kath|pg||
nt|lestergold: Heather will not eant to encourage anything here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i am an advocate of the support X   but not all my partners share my enthusiasm|pg||
nt|roswolf: for a vul overcall the west hand is yuk |pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N happens to be frigid too|pg||
nt|lestergold: he is himself a great rubber player and one of the best partners you could ever wish to cut|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i know Erichsen of course, very familiar at tournaments|pg||
nt|gnasher: Good hand for it|pg||
nt|roswolf: this will end in game e/w|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: east probably thinking|pg||
nt|sharynr: so it does not mean "lead hearts?:|pg||
nt|gnasher: Without that agreement, I'd bid a slightly scary 3D|pg||
nt|sharynr: and now showing diamonds as a second suit?|pg||
nt|gnasher: No, just 15+,|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: Espen Erichsen a very fine player and geat cashp too|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and he recently won the Norwegian premier league |pg||
nt|sharynr: and perkins dbl??|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|roswolf: SILLY DOUBLE BY EAST |pg||
nt|lestergold: Hackett must know he has a slam going hand because of the identified short spade in south's hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s will diagnose the 30 point pack|pg||
nt|lestergold: on the other hand Waterlow has not exatly bid the full value of his hand here|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think 3h could have been bid with a much weaker hand unless they are playing lebensohl|pg||
nt|lestergold: I of course know Small i taight him bridge and physics he only practices one of these i believe|pg||
nt|lestergold: I do not know Osborne|pg||
nt|gnasher: No idea |pg||
nt|sharynr: brave :)|pg||
nt|pamela: he heard|pg||
nt|jcwla: That's too fine for me.  With no slam interest I want to make a bid at the 2 level and invite them to come in?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mmmakela: and will make most likely 12 tricks|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: 3@H?|pg||
nt|lestergold: yep Richard has understandably mad a try here sadly at least one level too high now|pg||
nt|mmmakela: or not.....|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Fleet now shows his support at the 3 level, that's the price he pays|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 4@S looks better here but difficult to bid |pg||
nt|lestergold: problem with this contract isthe severe shortage of entries to dummy|pg||
nt|ady: club position very good for Osborne    but will do well to make this|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it looks a nightmare to play|pg||
nt|lestergold: he has to use the spade to play club to the ten Selway will duck and that is the end of dummy|pg||
nt|ady: if he enterst dummy with A@S and plays a club to the 10  north should duck to prevent a 2nd entry to the east hand for a heart finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe an end play will produce a ninth trick but then diamonds are vulnerable to attack|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Osborne must have thought 2@S was a stronger hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: i said that david|pg||
nt|lestergold: Selway is much too good a defender to allow any additional; access to dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: however Osborn is rightly in the tank he may need the spade finesse here he doesnt know whats working and what isnt|pg||
nt|lestergold: he has a serioustank|pg||
nt|mariner1: if you have slam interest you migth want them to come it :) and gambling|pg||
nt|mariner1: jumps are very powerful tools|pg||
pc|d9|nt|roswolf: TOO AGGRESSIVE IMO|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hackett is not messing around|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Osbourne is going through all the options   |pg||
pc|dK|nt|sharynr: Take out for everything but diamonds ;)|pg||
nt|gnasher: Some potential to mess this defence up|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d6|pg||
nt|sharynr: If @HA drops K, then south will have to give north 2 ruffs (keeping spade K for entry)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: E/W having done their best to keep Hacket informed about the spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: not so lever really|pg||
nt|roswolf: educated punt|pg||
nt|lestergold: clever really|pg||
nt|lestergold: not against a player with Hackett's judgement|pg||
nt|yo_yo: looking for miracels|pg||
nt|andyv:  meanwhile, good lead in this auction by S|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: having doubled on the previous round 3H was very risky only having 3 card support and not really necessary|pg||
nt|pamela: yes tricky  on the face of it  2H 1D and 2S to take.. oops|pg||
pc|s6|nt|roswolf: why 3@H if dbl=good hand?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: lets face it, he has a very good hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: The layout here makes even 2H likely to have needed helop from teh defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: O(f course Waterlow a stady expert player but very much the anchor man in this partnership leaves the flair stuff to Hackett|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|dburn: fourth highest of longest and strongest - never fails|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lestergold: so we have here avery likely swing in the pipeline|pg||
nt|roswolf: flair - hm|pg||
nt|roswolf: sometimes daylight robbery!|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: well his first effcommentator's curse|pg||
nt|gnasher: Still OK - get two ruffs instead|pg||
nt|pamela: oh well maybe 2D instead|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d4|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: I know Gold would sooner lead away from an unsupported ace than an unsupported K|pg||
nt|mmmakela: would earn a lot of matchpoints that lead|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: ok he is a bit ofa Dick Turpin of bridge but he has done it for decades with many different partners|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ady: surprised     North took A@C|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's one|pg||
nt|lestergold: well two errors in the spade of one second by Selway after i have praised him to the hilt|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lestergold: Heathe rhoping for the ed suits to both break but saly neither do|pg||
nt|lestergold: Derek will no doubt tap heather with clubs|pg||
nt|gnasher: What they couldn;t do was play SAK, HA|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think this would have made against best defence|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well osbourne gave them the opportunity to make errors so all credit to him|pg||
nt|lestergold: however im not saying that best defence was automatic to find|pg||
nt|jcwla: Generally, higher of touching honors when decl plays toward closed hand, lower when plays toward open hand.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sharynr: right|pg||
nt|andyv:  good unblock|pg||
pc|h9|nt|pamela: the (sp warned off that though did it not|pg||
nt|pamela: 9S|pg||
pc|hA|nt|dburn: to be hones, I was expecting a club lead and 11 tricks, but this is better|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|lestergold: he deserves more respect than many players give him|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: im not sure whether this spade play was necessary at this point|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well done to Small|pg||
pc|sT|pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||

nt|roswolf: a routine game now for e/w|pg||
nt|lestergold: part scores only here|pg||
nt|sharynr: and might even have been interpreted as suit pref along the way :)|pg||
nt|gnasher: Another possible slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: hmm a chance for Dhondy|pg||
nt|lestergold: Selway should have recognised that with a stiff spade marked by declining the finesse that Osborne was in trouble and that is where you do not rush in with aces|pg||
nt|sharynr: and yet a 3rd potential slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: if north opens this some sction may be generated|pg||
nt|andyv:  good hand for polish 2 bids|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|an|15-17|nt|lestergold: well partner made a free heart bid and all Hackett has done basically is to play his partner for the qH and either a spade void or the lub Ace|pg||
nt|lestergold: hard for N/S to compete and stay low here|pg||
nt|ady: part score in clubs for e/w   possible they may get too high|pg||
nt|ady: 2@C  inverted minor raise   |pg||
nt|yo_yo: that @D bid  marks the end of 3NT for EW|pg||
nt|ady: westlikely 2@H   and East 2@S  showing stoppers|pg||
nt|pamela: juicy cards|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: another opportunity for a swing this time in favour of Dhondy|pg||
nt|ady: 5@C     makes      4@S   good contract   but bad trump split|pg||
nt|lestergold: and maybe a little help in diamonds or som more clubs as was thec case here|pg||
nt|lestergold: Bakshi will try 3s  no doubt|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - this is not a good start for North-South|pg||
nt|dburn: no, he won't|pg||
nt|lestergold: no hesc passed buck backwards|pg||
nt|dburn: double did not show spades, just a decent weak no trump|pg||
nt|lestergold: Gold may well float this with 3 bullets and no clear game bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: west passing cos hes rock bottom|pg||
nt|sharynr: how many "miltons" is this hand Andy :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: will north move now|pg||
nt|andyv:  not now|pg||
nt|andyv:  @s suit too dangerous|pg||
nt|jcwla: Time for a DONT type bid.|pg||
mb|2C|an|!C + major|nt|lestergold: east can bid again|pg||
mb|d|an|t/o|nt|lestergold: he also knows that WEaterlow is a cautious bidder|pg||
nt|lestergold: very solid player Mr. Waterlow|pg||
nt|dburn: North should probably pass, but that's easier said than done|pg||
nt|lestergold: welll that is judgement on a pin head phew anyone wouldthink this was mps!|pg||
nt|dburn: but now, it is easier done than said|pg||
nt|yo_yo: pass probably shows a weak NT|pg||
nt|ady: west kept quiet with minimum after intervention|pg||
nt|roswolf: if north could show clubs naturally?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lestergold: Gold is a courageous player knows that passing has more upside than struggling on with such a g=heavily defensive hand but opoor offensive holding|pg||
nt|andyv:  yuck with don't|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 5@C is the spot|pg||
nt|lestergold: no can their natural bidding teer them into the making 5C|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: probably under instructions from Hackett to bid conservatively|pg||
nt|gnasher: That's natural game-forcing or invitational 3-card raise, I think|pg||
nt|pamela: he is not going to get excited |pg||
nt|andyv:  p/c|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: i think this will end the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well Heather casnnot now bid 3N|pg||
nt|lestergold: and look at this trump lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: W does a good job of staying out|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: east got the message and settled for a sensible part score|pg||
nt|sharynr: with no cue from North, south should assume super spades|pg||
nt|roswolf: well that was sharp|pg||
nt|mariner1: the distribution has to favor NS|pg||
nt|andyv:  and N lucky to come out alive on this one|pg||
nt|jcwla: DONT has the wonderful quality of getting this hand in at the level of 2@C.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphzsg: crouch asks how many spades Heather could have|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm 4S is better spot than 3N but the 5/1 beak|pg||
nt|roswolf: Waterlow is his own man but i agree he is a solid conservative citizen as far as bridge is concerned|pg||
nt|lestergold: in danger of going for 500|pg||
nt|dburn: I am looking at it, but I cannot see what effect it will have|pg||
nt|pamela: but lets see  calls for a wee try surely  oh |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|lestergold: helpfuol lead and a diamond loser has dissappeared|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|lestergold: well Rosen can set up club to get rid of dim loser as  alternative to ruffing in hand but the defence has put him under a bit of pressure|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes sometimes it has a good result|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|nt|lestergold: and tapped immediately|pg||
nt|ady: routine contract on reasonable spade split    |pg||
nt|lestergold: its gonna be very hard no to suc cumb to two further tricks in the trump suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: Ive known him for 40 years and i have a lot of respect for his game|pg||
nt|lestergold: and indeed for him|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lestergold: in fact two have|pg||
nt|jcwla: 10 cards in two decent suits -- are you really surprised N bid, Andy?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@C DONT shows @c and a higher suit though|pg||
nt|andyv:  accidents do happen|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|lestergold: beterr to play dim and then trump trump and has to play a spade and another diamond gets played before club established|pg||
pc|c9|nt|roswolf: me too!|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/DONT.html|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, I am... I would have bid at first chance...not come in when @s suit is wide open...last thing I want is opps to "fall" into a @s game|pg||
pc|c5|nt|yo_yo: for those wondering about comparisons,  the other room start on board 17|pg||
pc|c7|nt|lestergold: is that wrong David?|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ady: can discard on 3rd hearft|pg||
pc|h2|nt|yo_yo: this is bad luck for NS|pg||
nt|lestergold: so no great wing here |pg||
nt|yo_yo: I bet 3NT by South would have made|pg||
nt|lestergold: playing in the 4/3 fit should have rewarded them after all contract is figid on a 4/2 spade break|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup but surely unbiddable|pg||
pc|s3|pc|hA|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, we'll have to agree to disagree on this one.  Passing and having partner lead a pointed card against 1NT is not why I came.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|s7|pg||
nt|dburn: no, that is correct - a diamond would have been better than a spade at trick three|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: ei8ther my fingers or my keyboardare a sandwich short of a picnic today|pg||
nt|yo_yo: just close your eyes and bid 3NT after 3@C?|pg||
nt|roswolf: :0|pg||
nt|lestergold: and as for Hackett maybe the Arthur Daley of bridge but a damn good player and nice liekable chap|pg||
pc|s9|nt|roswolf: looks -2 for 3 imps to crouch|pg||
nt|lestergold: why should they punt 3N when they can explore for the best contract accurately|pg||
nt|roswolf: agree mike|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ok 3@D - 3@S - 3NT?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Now up to Crouch to lead A@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: biding omp will rewars them for playing in eiher 4s or 5c and penalise them for the lazy 3n punt|pg||
nt|lestergold: so the trump lead made it possible to get two off but Bakhshi didntfolow it up|pg||
pc|s8|nt|roswolf: agreed|pg||
nt|lestergold: a real character|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ady: but now will lose 2 spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: however he will lose 2 spades instead of one so profit on lead was only one trick|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i bid 2@D partner for the lead!!|pg||
mc|9|nt|yo_yo: anyway they reached a very good contract, 4@S would make on most days of the week|pg||
nt|roswolf: -3 now?|pg||
nt|lestergold: so far both sides have bid and played soundly except for a doubtful but not ludicrous bid of 3H by Richard earlier on|pg||
nt|lestergold: the hands have been excrutiatingly dull|pg||
nt|lestergold: and prdocued the greattwins of course|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think you are very right Kath|pg||
nt|andyv:  true enough, Jordan:)|pg||

nt|jtr: which he does have but...|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps south expected his partner to open 2@S with the hand he actually has|pg||
nt|athene: if you play two-tier weak-2 bids, i think you should, surely|pg||

pc|c8|nt|roswolf: right!?|pg||

nt|lestergold: Seloway is not that old but he didnt play competitiv bridge for many years and has maybe not caught up with modern light openings|pg||
nt|lestergold: the old school of money players who like to be robust at unfavourable vulnerability|pg||

pc|c7|pg||
nt|ady: e/w  may get another swing |pg||
nt|lestergold: 12 opp 10 with a goodm fit in diamonds ok not quite game values|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but not a lot|pg||
nt|lestergold: well not  alot we see butr of course very supportive|pg||
nt|roswolf: normally abroad!|pg||
nt|lestergold: as i said not oo many part scores aound here|pg||
nt|lestergold: non vulnerable i would say that this was a bit of a 'junior' game|pg||
nt|roswolf: a lot of work to do|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hirst has at most a doubtful invite in my view|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: but  every session i see well known players openinmg flat 11 counts at unfavourable these days|pg||
pc|cT|nt|dburn: and maybe doubling 2NT didn't show clubs either|pg||
nt|lestergold: he has bid with a  count vulnerable and now he fails to lead the strong hand's suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3 count|pg||
pc|d9|nt|andyv:  i think we've lost the thread|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Heather will be getting fed up with going down|pg||

pc|c6|nt|roswolf: i am told dd it is a make!|pg||
nt|lestergold: no not doubtful but certaibnly no more than an invite|pg||
nt|lestergold: and 9 triks looks like Arnhem|pg||
nt|lestergold: gthe battle of Arnhem i mean|pg||
nt|lestergold: double showed a good hand|pg||

nt|roswolf: i can only see 8 tricks at most|pg||

nt|yo_yo: South liked his 5/5 shape  though|pg||

pc|s5|nt|yo_yo: Frances Hinden in the OR, only one of 3 women in division 1 , well done to her|pg||

nt|jcwla: Back.  Looks like 3NT here.|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N NS here|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 4@S for e/w?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a botdferline 4S could be on here for E./W with every finesse in sight on Hirst can wheel out his overbidding boots with impunity|pg||
nt|lestergold: we have a lot of strong women players and I think more of you could do more in the open game|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: indeed which was a very good question|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: SW even!|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm swing possibilities here|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: ah I was just pondering that Ant :)|pg||
nt|dburn: given the methods in use, a heart lead was more or less normal|pg||
mb|1N|an|14-16|mb|p|nt|dburn: now, I say nothing about the methods in use - very fine methods they are, no doubt|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm maybe|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: he will try and Hassett will acceopt|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: If Richard keps his bidding boots on - this time he can amke game|pg||
nt|roswolf: if he invites east will accept|pg||
nt|lestergold: Im not convinced he knows that cklubs were natural that gold has shown a suit oriented hand and is strong why not lead his suit|pg||
nt|dburn: but the game was perhaps a little easier when if you had clubs, you could show them by bidding clubs|pg||
nt|andyv:  S will bid 3N|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|jcwla: Andy, who's going to win the Super Bowl?  I want to get my bets down early.|pg||
nt|roswolf: not victor - he is conservative|pg||
nt|mariner1: commentator's curse|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jcwla: On the other 29 teams.|pg||
nt|andyv:  the Clippers|pg||
nt|mariner1: N's 16 looks like 18 to me|pg||
nt|andyv:  S isn't conservative...he's down right pessimistic.|pg||
nt|roswolf: i agree but north didnt count the same way:)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: 3H the limit for N/S|pg||
nt|ady: 9 tricks available in hearts for n/s|pg||
nt|yo_yo: club pips interesting|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: and he will noww|pg||
nt|roswolf: well the moment of truth|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|lestergold: but Gold has denied a no trumpish hand here|pg||
nt|lestergold: but e/.w cannot compete against hearts|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|ady: heart game can be made     |pg||
nt|lestergold: hm how ironic this time his pard makes two take out doubles and having had his fingers burned Richard goes chicken .... att he wrong time....|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sharynr: seems 3NT would have been better than 3@S?|pg||
nt|gnasher: Competently bid|pg||
nt|pamela: I was thinking that W would bid 3NT|pg||
nt|sharynr: with no raise in @S by north, he could gamble  it|pg||
nt|gnasher: He doesn't  know that the diamonds are running|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|roswolf: since south could have a yarborough surely he has the values for game!?|pg||
nt|lestergold: so his club isnt likely to be prepared|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, 2NT was also close to unspeakable - if Jones had bid 4@s like a normal person, no one could have shown clubs at all|pg||
nt|lestergold: he could have 18/19 balanced i suppose thats notout of the quesion but then what are e./w bidding on vulnerable?|pg||
nt|ady: this should be 1 too high|pg||
nt|sharynr: no he doesn't, but his partner DID jump in the suit missing the ace|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.rpbridge.net/cgi-bin/xhe1.pl  says it evaluates to 17|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: sorry they werent vilnerable|pg||
nt|lestergold: but still what were they bidding game on?|pg||
nt|lestergold: but there was room for doubt about the lead i conce3de|pg||
pc|c6|nt|roswolf: i think a clear error|pg||
nt|lestergold: he is boringly flat and his q spade is worthless|pg||
nt|roswolf: in both rooms|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Neither North nor South know how strong the other one is  - very difficult|pg||
nt|lestergold: but he still has an 8 count opposite an announced strong hand|pg||
nt|ady: game is against the odds  K@H more likely to be wrong |pg||
nt|yo_yo: I have been there a million times myself|pg||
nt|roswolf: precisely mike 2 of his points are useless and they still make game|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sharynr: so he will score up 12 tricks|pg||
nt|sharynr: on that lead|pg||
nt|pamela: with the 3D bid surely it would show at least  top  honours though in this case he has the quantity if not quality|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|lestergold: heathe rof course is just about minimum for the second takeout|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: three rounds of diamonds will prouce 2 dims and a tump trick by force but thereafter Hasset cant  really go wrong|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that 9@C may come into play here|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lestergold: on another occasion i think Richard would have bid 4H but hes been so unlucky with his bidding in this session that he has decided to go onservative|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|pg||
nt|lestergold: im not convinced by Selway's 4h bid here a takeout double followed by a further heart bid shows his values|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 8@C rather|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho the duplication here unfortunate the heart finesse being wrong expected on the opening bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: all in all i feel too pushy for a non vul game|pg||
nt|andyv:  trouble with 14-16 NT is like the N hand... do you really want to bid 2N over pd's response to 1 of a minor?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: if he is shortned in hand he will not be able to afford the ruffing fibnesse in clubs|pg||
nt|dburn: odd, that - would have expected Jones to compete further|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|roswolf: not an acceptable reason imo|pg||
pc|d8|nt|roswolf: you must be consistent|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|sharynr: I think  you were outnumbered by the "girls" on that one Andy :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  S should, at least, invite... passing is just too unilateral|pg||
nt|mariner1: S hand evaluates to 10  so both pessimistic here|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe S expects N to have only a bad 14 or do in 4th seat?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, not to mention that "threading the needle" is a very hard way to win.  Have to be right a lot of times to compensate for those missed 300 and 500 point bonuses they insist on ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: paying.|pg||
nt|mariner1: or so|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|nt|ady: I wonder if they play sort of leb  where 3@H shows some values   2NT would show weak hand  - but even then Heather my consider her hand minimum after previous action|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|lestergold: well ER/e go plus thats the important thing on these part score eals|pg||
nt|lestergold: E/W|pg||
nt|dburn: I mean, double was only lead-directing and all that, but 2@s was not necessarily frivolous, and East-West could easily have a game|pg||
nt|andyv:  even so, what would be wrong with inviting...are you trying to thread the needle by playing for the one hand that won't make more than 1N?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk7: Commentators are kindly requested to use surnames. All specs do not know Heather, Derek, Richard and Peter|pg||
nt|lestergold: I do not think we canbe harsh here Richard had a tossup decision lets face it|pg||
nt|lestergold: hes not that well placed now|pg||
nt|lestergold: danger now is losing to the qs and losing a heart ruff too|pg||
nt|roswolf: playinf the trump works i think|pg||
nt|lestergold: double dummy he certainly can make with double heart finesse however sine dummy he has problems|pg||
nt|lestergold: single dummy i meant to type|pg||
nt|roswolf: the slam was not bid in the other room|pg||
nt|lestergold: but he can get at the seven tricks he needs of course|pg||
nt|roswolf: i cant see any other reasonable line|pg||
nt|lestergold: a spade 2 clubs 3h and a diamond|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Walddk7: also Mike Gold|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
mc|9|nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||

nt|roswolf: might easily be a swing to hassett|pg||
nt|gnasher: I'm too scared to argue|pg||
nt|sharynr: lol|pg||
nt|roswolf: If you aint raising 1N on that South hand my advice is dont play a 14-16 NT:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Crouch asks Dixon what his count was (!)|pg||
nt|andyv:  Board 1 has produced 10 imps for Hassett|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: Yes David, that's a good point|pg||
nt|lestergold: first slam hand of the session|pg||
nt|roswolf: now a hand of possibility|pg||
nt|gnasher: Another makeable slam|pg||
nt|gnasher: Though it's lucky to make on a heart lead|pg||
nt|jcwla: For stopping in 5@D whereas Crouch bid slam down one.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: and an infrangible one at that|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lestergold: well n?S could get too high here|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ady: nice double fit  with good clubs on the side    6@D  best as in OR|pg||
nt|lestergold: easy 4H here|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: slam certainly off in spades and looks awkward in hearts but possible as cards lie|pg||
nt|dburn: and that 4@h opening is... well, it might miss a slam opposite some very routine passes|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5D if allowed to play only two off but unreacheable vul after the preempt likely to be flat this board|pg||
nt|lestergold: quite heavy for a 4H opener isnt it- more like a texas stule 4 bid|pg||
nt|dburn: still, I guess you'd rather deal with 4@h - 4@s - pass - pass (when you have a clear double) than with 1@h - 4@s - pass - pass, when you have a headache|pg||
nt|lestergold: i meanhad east held Kc instead of q slam would have been a goodm prop|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes expected swing|pg||
nt|andyv:  would anyone bid 1N with S hand?|pg||
nt|mariner1: N needs to pass here..... can he do it?|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|lestergold: not completely automatic to bid its a 30 point pack with the lack of duplication in hearts|pg||
nt|roswolf: the heart save is cheap for n/s|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if Crouch doubles then they find the @D fit  but @S OK  if not better|pg||
nt|lestergold: this time not too lucky for Small|pg||
nt|lestergold: burn's law kicks in with a vengeance here|pg||
nt|roswolf: no heroics from north but will east extend his neck?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: and no way would it have been reached|pg||
nt|yo_yo: are you going to explain that law Mike?|pg||
nt|pamela: glad you got that in before we did Andy|pg||
nt|sharynr: 3@H - 3@S - 4@C can they stop?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lestergold: now will Peter go|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hackett will certsinly try|pg||
nt|lestergold: in hearts he can opt to dicard a spade and ruff the k out to make|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes he should be safe at the 5 level|pg||
nt|roswolf: axe|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@D is reasonable as well|pg||
nt|andyv:  pass 2@h like a shot|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Crouch asks Silverstone how many diamonds he has shown before bidding 2@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@H is committing hari-kiri|pg||
nt|mariner1: that hari as in dreadlocks too :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: or a brilliant way to get to 3C x lol|pg||
nt|andyv:  I wonder if E didn't have anything in their bidding box to show a 2 suiter on that position.|pg||
nt|andyv:  what is N thinking about?|pg||
nt|roswolf: i suspect east is in the tank|pg||
nt|mariner1: E is thinking I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: screens are in use; the tray is with NS|pg||
nt|jcwla: This is not a double you make up 38 IMHO.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: NE evem|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: no he is worried about diamonds|pg||
nt|yo_yo: wowee|pg||
nt|ady: Kay doubled after 1@H in OR|pg||
nt|gnasher: They've both made non-forcing bids, so probably|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: a major swing back to dhondy|pg||
nt|lestergold: but surely he had a trie he has a monster hand dim finesse at worst  probably|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is the first big error of the session|pg||
nt|roswolf: a cautious view|pg||
nt|lestergold: no they are leading and do not need to bid any dodgy slams|pg||
mb|2N|nt|lestergold: im still a bit surprised  Hackett has a monster of a hansd|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: sorry plus another ace|pg||
nt|lestergold: Selway is delighted with this contract doesnt want them playing elsewhere like for example ion diamodns|pg||
nt|roswolf: both bids must be made before shown - screen reg|pg||
nt|andyv:  S must have a 22 count|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ady: this wont be a great success    double would have worked out better|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: for those unfamiliar with david burn's law of total trumps: http://www.blakjak.demon.co.uk/burn_law.htm|pg||
nt|yo_yo: read and enjoy :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: i do not like bidding at two level with bad 5 card suirs either|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: a firendly lead!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|pamela: though  looking at it again  you are right  the poor N has to ruff with Ace Diam and H goes away|pg||
nt|pamela: lucky|pg||
nt|gnasher: Yes, but it needs either that layout or clubs breaking|pg||
nt|pamela: definitely not the greatest of slams to be in.. |pg||
nt|gnasher: so about 40%|pg||
nt|sharynr: Andy, what does the winner of this event achieve, besides glory :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes its the new 17+ :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: he has bid it as if he has but double indicated|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: im getting tired but unlikely to be reached if east held the key cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Dixon is frantically explaining something to patterson|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|yo_yo: East had  2 of the 3 key cards Crouch was worried about|pg||
nt|ady: the take out-double rather than the michaels seemed to work better on this hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: not a frightener|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|jcwla: The 1NT is better with the S hand than on a balanced 18 because the @D suit likely to bring in tricks.  However, as noted, there's been some rebidding of the same values.  ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: Meanwhile, E/W need some 2-suited calls in their arsenal and West could act directly rather than allowing N/S any additional communication.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Ends with "but we haven't had the auction before"|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: well he had to do something with his 15     maybe top heavy for 1NT in pass out position|pg||
nt|yo_yo: has South enplayed himself here?|pg||
nt|lestergold: i double and if pard biods only two clubs i pass only tajke action if that is doubled|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no, his partner has|pg||
nt|lestergold: i am very strict about suit lngth and quality at the 2 level|pg||
nt|lestergold: most money p0layers learn to be|pg||
nt|lestergold: as i hav often said a high proportion of the top card players have been nurtured on money bridge|pg||
nt|lestergold: my son wa a money bridge host in london at age 19|pg||
nt|lestergold: and his partner too Townsend|pg||
nt|yo_yo: many towns in england have no rubber bridge clubs|pg||

nt|roswolf: well predicted|pg||
pc|d8|nt|yo_yo: Did Crouch show his massive hand here?|pg||
nt|lestergold: thats true Kath and why do you tyhink so many top players ome from London- I could reel off a lot of  names|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and you need a bit of cash to play in the big money games in London|pg||
nt|lestergold: some of the Manchter players too have their highish stake game|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they depend on poor players with lots of money |pg||
nt|lestergold: its all true but it does sharpen your card player when you go home on bread and water |pg||
nt|lestergold: the embankment is cold in the winter|pg||
nt|rodal f: Same for u Kadir:)|pg||

nt|jcwla: 12 are in to Crouch on Board 2, they played 4@H w/o interference while Silverston went down one in 5.|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|gnasher: The winners are guaranteed a place in the Camrose, an event played between England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and Ireland|pg||
nt|gnasher: And they're more likely to get into the squad whihc is used to select players for European and World events|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|andyv:  the defense is taking off from where the bidding stopped|pg||
pc|d7|pc|c5|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a very big downside at imps vulnerable when you lose12 imps for not bidding ur vul slams|pg||
nt|dburn: but it seems to me a little paranoid to suppose that when RHO has passed, the opponents will be in 4@s before you have a chance to bid again|pg||
nt|lestergold: it desnt matter too much what preempt style u use but u must be consistent and keep to agreed ranges and principles when you do these things in fron of unpassed partner|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dT|nt|lestergold: But look at the top playuers brought up on money bridge: Zia, Robson, Hallberg, Price , Simpson Fawcett, Selway erichsen, Sandquist to name a few|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||

nt|ritong: might have to look further:)|pg||
nt|dburn: he has the elements of a double squeeze - hearts against West, clubs against East, spades against both|pg||
nt|dburn: but he just doesn't have enough tricks|pg||
nt|jtr: Probably play for @sK10 onside|pg||

nt|lestergold: that was poor I have to say very disaapointing|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Crouch: "I didn't know what you might have"|pg||
nt|lestergold: and very expensive|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think in practice slam would have failed|pg||
nt|lestergold: would have taken same line basically|pg||
nt|lestergold: i tink ive been commenatting since 1045 without hardly a break|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i guess they dont make money from each other,  they make money from the rich punters|pg||
nt|gnasher: Probably, but it depends what happens|pg||
nt|roswolf: but comedy outakes -good material|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N by NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: I play that a cue bid by the michaels bidder shows a strong hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes it did - most pairs dont practice constructive bidding after michaels and therefore fail to have accurate agreements|pg||
nt|roswolf: now a tempter for e/w|pg||
nt|lestergold: and usually with only one other commentator so hard work!!|pg||
nt|lestergold: I dont think its about making money- money concentartes the mind more than master points|pg||
nt|sharynr: so far we have only 2 comparisons!|pg||
nt|roswolf: this will have a few bids|pg||
mb|p!|an|no alert|nt|mariner1:  NS have a play for 3N here though might not be there|pg||
mb|1D!|an|might be none (strong club)|nt|pamela: did they start later? or just slow|pg||
nt|gnasher: Hackett 'ss|pg||
nt|andyv:  E opened?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yuk what an opening|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: that is a 10 that looks like 8 :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lestergold: what we are4 seeing tho is players who are getting pessimistic because they keep going off in conracts|pg||
nt|lestergold: when you review ur errors and work out that they just cost you 250 quid you learn more easily from those errors|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lestergold: this has been a lot of scores above the line|pg||
nt|ady: 25 hcp   but 4@H  hopeless     3NT has play|pg||
nt|roswolf: east may just bid 5@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5C looks ok|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 3NT e/w     if west plays  J@C lead would beat it    somewhat unlikely|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah I see Cameron has switched to transfer bids over 1@c opener|pg||
nt|gnasher: Hacket's takeout double is very modern for a man of his age|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pamela: lol |pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: yes e/w favorite to go down in something|pg||
nt|lestergold: whatever one says almost all bridge players are influenced by the precious session history which in theory they shouldnt be|pg||
nt|ady: likely to reach 4@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: previous hands i meant to type|pg||
nt|pamela: bet he is glad to see the opps bid the cl|pg||
nt|sharynr: I was just about to say N-S avoiding the spade fit :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: west has good trumps and tweo bullets but otherwise minimum|pg||
nt|roswolf: HMM not my choice 3@H splinter was possible|pg||
nt|roswolf: by east of course|pg||
nt|lestergold: west dutifully cues the diamond east should cue hearts now|pg||
nt|roswolf: now east will be worried about missing slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: but then west should sign off and east should passhaving bid his full values|pg||
nt|lestergold: but as they are behind they may push that boat out into the deep blue sea|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think reaching slam on this auction is quite likely|pg||
nt|lestergold: you are not wrong but it woulod be indisciplined|pg||
nt|lestergold: making tries and cues os not mean that you have to bid a slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: you are allowed to put the brakes on|pg||
nt|sharynr: I think I would play South for a good 3 card @S holding on this auction|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3rd in hand at white - pairs specialists might open|pg||
nt|jcwla: Burn's Rule violation coming up?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pamela: he wants to x I feel it in my water  but 3D will end it then.. if he does|pg||
nt|gnasher: Unfortunately the other table started with boards seventeen onwards|pg||
nt|sharynr: I think 3@C might be a bit much, is he not happy defending a @S contract?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ady: now 3NT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i cant see North leading @C on this auction|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm is 3n going to be wrong sided?|pg||
nt|ady: likely to make 10 tricks on a spade lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: North may ask a few quesions before leading|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Patterson: "sorry"|pg||
nt|roswolf: blood will flow but whose!?|pg||
nt|andyv:  might be ok|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lestergold: and here is another likely game to be bid which has litle hope against the 4/1 trump brwk|pg||
nt|lestergold: but this time pessimism has paid off!|pg||
nt|lestergold: but a spade looks like the marked lead rue|pg||
nt|lestergold: true unlesss... erichsen doubleas for a club lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: auction not over|pg||
nt|gnasher: Perhaps he'd like to defend 3S|pg||
nt|sharynr: wouldn't we all :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@H is OK if off 1 and great if he makes|pg||
pc|sA|nt|andyv:  i think off 1|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|lestergold: actually Hasset has judged well not to cue his hearts beause he has no aces|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed but the adrenaline rush sometimes makes you do it|pg||
nt|lestergold: slam actually makes as cards lie it makes by an unusual means|pg||
nt|roswolf: but neverthess well done to e/w to reach a sensible contract|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: Peter has devalued his spade holding because of hearther's somewhat dubious noise here|pg||
nt|ady:  how doestheir relay system allows them to stop so low with 25 hcp and major suit fit?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes the strong no- trumpers might bid it 1NT - 3NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: its amazing how players always feel when not vul that thye have to get their pesky 5 card spade suits in however useless teh suigt and however useless the hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: rudd high he will|pg||
nt|dburn: ah well - someone at least led a club in case his partner had them despite having bid them|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes commentator's curse spared me for once|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: and the dimaond finesee will see Gold home|pg||
nt|lestergold: the discard on the club q had no value inj any case|pg||
nt|lestergold: i like the way you put that david|pg||
nt|yo_yo: does this ask for @C?  I expect so|pg||
nt|ady: dbl interesting|pg||
nt|lestergold: first suit b id b y dummy traditionally|pg||
nt|lestergold: definitely says do not make ur normallead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but will Selway lead J?   |pg||
nt|lestergold: however has to be J|pg||
nt|ady: I think selway will find the J@C lead|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|roswolf: these are 60 bd matches (3 x20) and the VP scale applicable means that it is very hard to score big wins to get a max 25vps you need + 80 imps|pg||
nt|lestergold: Gold will cash diamond ace in case before leading up to the q|pg||
nt|lestergold: or may play a no cost small diamond away from hand sometimes catching east napping with a doubleton K|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps -2|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lestergold: well i think so but last tim i expected selway to make a good play he didnt|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh well its all academic small has chickened|pg||
nt|andyv:  but making will be a bit of a stretch|pg||
pc|sT|pc|h5|nt|lestergold: the JT spades mans spades can be set up for onlyu one ruff and that produces 4 discards for the  daimonds!|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind you doe sthat work there are not necessarily enuf trumops to deal iwth the heart losers it could be too much work to do |pg||
nt|lestergold: at any rate who want s to play in slam here|pg||
nt|lestergold: not even Roland|pg||
nt|roswolf: i do if it makes!|pg||
nt|lestergold: and can go off undoubled in 4dimaonds instead|pg||
nt|ady: still needs to find J@C lead to beat 4@D|pg||
nt|lestergold: no reason not to any more than against 3N|pg||
nt|pamela: big sigh of relief from NS  on this one|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|lestergold: well done Norman back to the old Norman Im used to|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well done to Selway|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lestergold: here it had a dampening effect on Crouch|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|nt|dburn: in case West is 1-1-5-6? yes, I guess he might|pg||
nt|lestergold: all is forgiven|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|lestergold: we all do but we dont have the benefit of hindsight in tis game |pg||
nt|lestergold: he wont just take a mindless first ound dim finesse i lay money|pg||
nt|lestergold: hell do something at any rate David|pg||
nt|mariner1: 9@S asking for the @D back|pg||
nt|andyv:  @h back|pg||
nt|roswolf: trump is good now|pg||
nt|jcwla: 8 in to Crouch on board 3 to pull within 18.  Defeating 2@DX by 2 tricks in the OR not enough compensation to Hassett as against 4@S making five in here.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: the cat that it makes no odds here of course makes it aademic|pg||
pc|h2|pc|dT|pc|d9|pg||
nt|roswolf: true:(|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course ducking the ace of spades would finish off any slam i fear in any case|pg||
nt|dburn: that is a relief, for if he does not, the slow play fines might vitiate his lead in the match|pg||
nt|andyv:  now down 1|pg||
nt|roswolf: on 3 crouch got another 8 imps when their teammates took a save in 2@DX -2!!!!|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|nt|roswolf: IF HE GET IT RIGHT|pg||
nt|andyv:  W trying to go down 2|pg||
nt|jcwla: As Mare Winningham asked in "Miracle Mile," "What's the hurry, Harry?"|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|lestergold: slow play is not a characterisic|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he knew what the X was |pg||
nt|roswolf: good guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: We're having our rubbish bins emptied by a large truck right now at West-Midlands Bridge Club... very loud|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: he would chave surely tried another bid as Patterson's 2D bid showed a good heart raise|pg||
nt|ady: credit to Erichsen  for the double of 3NT    |pg||
nt|yo_yo: mind you 1@C- 1@D - 1NT - 3NT  might be a better sequence|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h3|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|andyv:  is this one of the hands going into that bin?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: giving up one spade trick to kill the spade suit|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|pc|cT|pg||
nt|andyv:  @h now?????|pg||
nt|roswolf: trump for -2|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lestergold: normally of Junior Gold|pg||
nt|lestergold: well one of my predictions has come true|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ady: in the OR   the opening was 1NT    West although very balanced used stayman   and then raised to 4@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: ping pong|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lestergold: yep 11 tricks looks the limit|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3 trumps and a diamond to come whats th problem|pg||
nt|roswolf: may have miscounted his tricks?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Director called by Hackett|pg||
nt|lestergold: well what can he do ruff spade cash dimaond and claim|pg||
nt|roswolf: what for a revoke!?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: I think 4@d was explained as keycard to him|pg||
nt|lestergold: who is directing Mike Amos?|pg||
nt|roswolf: so what !?|pg||
nt|roswolf: probably|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok, S wasn't going to lead a @h if it was the last card he held in his hand|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|lestergold: the miable Mike will say the same thing - so what!|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sharynr: now a @H for 2 more trump tricks|pg||
pc|h6|nt|yo_yo: Dont you play in this league usually Geoffrey?|pg||
nt|lestergold: adn who ould blame them David a normal contract to bid under normal circumstances|pg||
nt|lestergold: David has probably maximisd his chances in the dim suit this way|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry Gold|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: of course this now efectively serves as the England trials|pg||
nt|ady: some prefer to raise no-trumps with 3-4-3-3    you win some  you lose some|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Kantar advised never to stayman with 4333|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|h9|nt|pamela: yip  |pg||
mc|7|nt|sharynr: Have to give Perkins credit on this one...he was right|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: north in relieved mode|pg||
mb|3C|an|pass/correct|nt|yo_yo: anyone bidding 6@D here is a genius|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well south has taken a conservative view|pg||
nt|lestergold: well even these two are surely going to settle for a part score|pg||
nt|roswolf: difficult for him to come in i think|pg||
nt|gnasher: It looks like on e of EW should have bid|pg||
mb|3D|nt|lestergold: Kantar may have been very great but I disagree because you are blanaced it doesnt guarntee that patner is - i think point count texture of hand and the way the points are ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: distributed ae lall factors to be taen into account|pg||
nt|lestergold: but its this care to tyhe nth degree over the technical possibilities in card play which distinguih=shes the top experts from the ordinary mortals|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe 2@s shows a good weak two bid and 2@d (or some such) a bad one|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: not seemingly|pg||
nt|sharynr: I admire East's pass at this vulnerability and that spot"less" suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: where is thios acution going?|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt!?|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm |pg||
nt|lestergold: east minimum 11 count andwest a horrible aeless wondr of 11|pg||
nt|lestergold: For players like Gold,a finesse is his last option|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: i dont like to mny NEVERS in bridge|pg||
nt|ady: assume 2@D   shows hearts|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I think Kantar has won more things than most of us  |pg||
nt|dburn: well, when partner opens 1NT, there may be some indication that he has a balanced hand|pg||
nt|ady: all major suits splitting badly|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh we have an interloper hi David!!|pg||
nt|lestergold: aceless wonder|pg||
nt|dburn: otherwise, it isn't easy to see why South moved over 2@s|pg||
pc|sT|nt|dburn: not guaranteed nowadays, of course, but...|pg||
nt|lestergold: half his points in quacks|pg||
nt|roswolf: well normally you cant pass a conventional bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: well even Roland wouldnt because 6D is too good fro him|pg||
nt|sharynr: I mean West|pg||
nt|pamela:  not attractive suit for E to bid  but he would have been in with a noise from W for sure|pg||
nt|gnasher: West might have doubled in the passout seat, but they probably play that as a spade stack|pg||
nt|sharynr: logical|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm undercooked this one|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW playing Woolsey over NT?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: not sure, we'll have to find out on a bid-by-bid basis!|pg||

pc|sA|nt|roswolf: hi david|pg||

pc|s6|pg||
nt|yo_yo: David been dropped ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might not play too well|pg||
nt|sharynr: but how high do you really want to get with the E-W cards, surely not higher than 2@H|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lestergold: sadlythe bold bidding this time not rewqarded by any kind card holdings with the defence|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah well e/w are seniors and were never juniors!|pg||
nt|gnasher: Well, perhaps thbis hand shows why it's better to play it as balancedish hand, around opening strength|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: aheavy 2S at fav vul with two aces im a little surprised|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 2S equally unofrtunate so not likely tio produce any swings|pg||
nt|ady: nice return from Fleet|pg||
nt|lestergold: the absolutely killing lead has killed the contract dead at birth|pg||
nt|ady: Osborne can make 11 tricks   but will probably safety play the diamonds and make only 10|pg||
nt|pamela: true|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|dburn: was expecting Richard to lead that heart a trick earlier than he did|pg||
nt|andyv:  because W hand looks more like a dbl|pg||
pc|c2|nt|roswolf: yes 7 tricks look the limit|pg||
nt|lestergold: it must be agreed style |pg||

nt|lestergold: two finesses better than 12.85%|pg||
nt|lestergold: good point David|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i wonder why he doesnt claim|pg||
nt|ady: might get a spade |pg||
nt|ady: Selway has to gues which black suit to play|pg||
nt|lestergold: he can just ask if spade finesse is right claiming 1 or ten accordingly|pg||
nt|lestergold: 11 or ten accordingly|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but yes david, he might lead @S|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: that is true|pg||
nt|sharynr: but you can always play that 2@C "Takeout" bid with that balanced hand|pg||
nt|pamela: this hand is sort of coming together for N|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ady: now the bad news|pg||
nt|lestergold: well no question that Gold would acept any hint o an invite|pg||
pc|d6|pc|hJ|pg||

pc|c4|nt|lestergold: were any of these players ever alive below the age of 40?|pg||
nt|roswolf: hearts are not so kind either|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hirst is a serious overbidder if i am tojudge by what ive seen this afternoon|pg||
nt|lestergold: probably played against too much weak opposition|pg||
pc|s9|nt|roswolf: but he gets away with it  a lot of the time|pg||
nt|dburn: er... there wasn't any hint of an invite|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: how do u interpret the auctionDavid?|pg||

nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pc|d7|pg||
nt|yo_yo: there was some fun in the OR where liggings opened 2@D|pg||

nt|jcwla: On Board 5.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk7: For golf fans. Gale forces winds across the north and east of Scotland have forced the abandonment of Saturdays planned third round in the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship|pg||
nt|ady: again an unfortunate contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: it is windy in Solihull too, but not *that* windy!|pg||
nt|lestergold: i see this ll the time- you should have seen waht Malinowski and Sandquist did to ed Scerrii who is an aggressive bidder|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lestergold: technically of course its not an invite but it is effectively a try which has been encouraged thats whati meant|pg||
pc|d8|nt|roswolf: this could be -4|pg||

mb|2C!|an|12+ no 4card major|nt|dburn: unprecedented calm in that case - usually, the trees are being uprooted in Manchester|pg||

nt|ady: 3NT     4@H   or 4@S by east all make    |pg||

nt|roswolf: this should be axed by someone|pg||
nt|lestergold: good enuf for the governor of course|pg||
nt|yo_yo: will our rubber bridge play bid 2@H?|pg||
nt|sharynr: another slam!|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup and if crouch systemic relays will be reached|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Just looked at EW system, they do play Woolsey|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 4s great if undoubled as 3N on for N/S|pg||
mb|3C|nt|yo_yo: oh yes, by East OK|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 4S can make heredepending on wehether north gets a diamond thru befor clubs are used for discards|pg||
nt|ady: still needs a diamond lead to beat 4@S  by west|pg||
nt|lestergold: and 3N icy if they decide to playthere|pg||
nt|roswolf: i expect e/w to play in a making contract|pg||
nt|dburn: crikey - this is either the Crouch Natural System or the Crouch Strong Club System at work|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind you there is a hazard in 3N|pg||
nt|sharynr: but only in clubs|pg||
nt|pamela: this one should be exciting|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: so a chance for crouch to put on some more to their lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: the latter david|pg||
nt|lestergold: strong cl|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure which, but both equally incomprehensible|pg||

nt|lestergold: i think 50 available now for e./w no reaaly enough|pg||
nt|lestergold: 500|pg||
nt|lestergold: dont think Small will float it with 4 hearts to the 9|pg||
nt|ady: east might bid 3@H|pg||
nt|ady: still wondering whether they will play 3NT |pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n no play of course|pg||
nt|ady: high level club contract not that obvious|pg||
nt|sharynr: Reissman will surely like his hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|lestergold: 4H ?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: you need a super duper memory we have decided|pg||
nt|dburn: at any rate, West is now declarer if they play in hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 8 easy visible tricks here|pg||
nt|lestergold: its the 9th which needs some massaging one way or another|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5C may be difficult to reach in spite of the 12 tricks we can see available|pg||
mb|4S|nt|dburn: East if they play in notrump|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N cold from either side too|pg||
nt|dburn: and spades have yet to get a mention|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they have agreed @S|pg||
nt|roswolf: no @S it is|pg||
nt|lestergold: and if Patterson mentions them  now it makes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they might get too high|pg||
nt|roswolf: my thoughts too kath|pg||
nt|lestergold: it may happen on lead of course either f card suit will yeild it |pg||
nt|lestergold: four card suit|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Cameron Small had a difficult bid there |pg||
nt|sharynr: dbl?|pg||
nt|pamela: now a double from N|pg||
nt|andyv:  nice bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: depends now whether they try for 7|pg||
nt|mariner1: 7 would be another violation of Burn's Law (Rules)|pg||
nt|andyv:  6@c would be the practical bid|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.blakjak.demon.co.uk/burn_law.htm  - Burn's Laws|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Tray is still on NE side of table|pg||
nt|roswolf: in vps because of the 60 bd scale in use +21 imps converts into 17-13 although 22- 29 is 18-12|pg||
nt|andyv:  if that gives pd a choice of slams....if not,  then 5N|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: the hazar is when clubs are played and east drops the  or Jack declarer will have arestricted choice losing option|pg||
nt|lestergold: and its diamonds|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|ady: Small decided to take whatever plus in 2@HX|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i do not agree with Small's flotation sometimes these contracts even make|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no @H stop, no 4 card @S,  no support for @C|pg||
nt|lestergold: I like better trumops tio defend 2 of a major doubled into game|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: this sounds distinctly slammish|pg||
nt|lestergold: he has no guarantee that even his AK of diamonds are standing up|pg||

nt|sharynr: Very difficult to avoid|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)andy|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: agree|pg||

nt|sharynr: huh?|pg||

nt|pamela: poor S  ohoh|pg||
nt|mariner1: Can S find the @H lead?|pg||
nt|roswolf: play will be quick|pg||

nt|andyv:  what are his options?|pg||
nt|roswolf: victor leads trumps often|pg||
pc|d7|nt|dburn: for the moment, yes, but I expect Derek Patterson to pack it in now|pg||
nt|andyv:  aha... another option!|pg||
nt|jcwla: Too cute by half.|pg||

nt|ady: but what action should Small take if not leaving the double?|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: an overtrick will be made|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed but still 40+ boards to play in this match|pg||
nt|lestergold: just the two trumps to lose|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: 60 boards in total in this match, played over three weekends|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i cant think of a sensible bid David|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jcwla: I would have bid 4NT over 4@S.|pg||

pc|d4|nt|andyv:  what would 4N be?|pg||
mc|12|nt|ady: Dhondy unfortunate in OR   spades have to be 4-1   A@d wrong  and a diamond lead |pg||

nt|roswolf: a 20/20hcp hand|pg||

nt|vugraphzsg: looks like 10pt font thought!|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this slam is too good for Rland|pg||
nt|ady: Small must think there are some extra honor cards in the pack|pg||
nt|lestergold: Erichsen opening a disciplined 1H rather tyhan 4 because he has 3 first ound controls much too good to preemp|pg||

pc|sA|nt|jaapfr: a simple 4@S not much commentating here at all:)|pg||

nt|lestergold: adn hes got it|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: they can't see partner's faces; there are screens!|pg||
nt|lestergold: i mean its a 2 count qh is valueless|pg||

nt|ady: I dont think 6@H can make on a club lead|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ady: tid turned for Dhondy|pg||

pc|s6|nt|lestergold: waht is it and what willtyhe manner ofmy death be if i was able to quot it|pg||

nt|lestergold: he also has some laws about swhen its a goodm idea to choose a trump suit and when notbut i cant remember what they are|pg||
nt|sharynr: Slam missed on BD 6 as well. so far only 3 imps scored in this match!|pg||
nt|pamela: maybe wrong person on lead|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jcwla: Crouch will be surprised to gain 6 out of nowhere but will take them.|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|lestergold: might be flat but i doubt it the 2S bid pushed them in truth North will decline slam tries on this hand with his aceless wonder|pg||
nt|lestergold: the momentum generated by that call has resulted in this|pg||
nt|yo_yo: South is thinking that Cameron Small doesnt have A & K @D now, as he didnt try @D|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mariner1: so the match is getting a lot tighter|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is -1 oreven 2 possibly|pg||

nt|roswolf: needs to ditch a heart i think|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: now @D2|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: its funny here how a barrage probably pushed them to a slam they might otherwise not have reached|pg||
nt|lestergold: no he doesnt bother with my typos that roland's favourite sport|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d4|pg||
nt|ady: 6@H is very lucky to make   ace and king of diamonds with east   and no club lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Q@D   and small?   what will he do|pg||
nt|lestergold: he has no real option but to make it|pg||
nt|lestergold: the 4H bid tells him that east has a monster hand|pg||
pc|d7|nt|yo_yo: but West may have started with Hx in @D|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lestergold: we often forget the downisde of these barrage tactics|pg||
nt|yo_yo: same barrage in both rooms Mike|pg||
nt|dburn: odd, this - Richard doubtless weighing up the chances of singleton rather than doubleton @cK with West|pg||
nt|lestergold: sill leads to abit of guesswork and on this occasion it was guessed correctly herw  and incorrectly in the open room|pg||
nt|lestergold: or i should say successfully rather than correctly|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh commenttaors curse|pg||
pc|dK|nt|dburn: but you'd think he would lead a club from North and then wonder what to do, rather than thinking now|pg||

pc|hK|nt|lestergold: best not tochoose to play ur void suit as trumps something like that |pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: low heart lead will help the n/s cause here|pg||

nt|lestergold: Erichsen may try 3h now but 3n the final resting place here|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: We need him for his immense skills in other areas David|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: whats else to play but heart now|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3D transfer i assume|pg||

nt|lestergold: yes clearly|pg||
nt|ady: now less likely a low heart lead|pg||

nt|andyv:  tape delayed, Jordan|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lestergold: hm with a working 6 count(ignore KD I think that Bahkshi has pushed the boat over the horizon's edge here|pg||

nt|ady: diamond lead beat|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3 cklubs an 2 each in the other suits available|pg||

pc|s4|nt|roswolf: this is a comfortable make|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|lestergold: or 2 dims and no heart trick cant do both|pg||
nt|ady: heart back makes communications difficult|pg||
nt|lestergold: that is very true would have to give up club|pg||
nt|lestergold: but as finesse loses that wont make a difference|pg||
nt|lestergold: Small will surely play a heart now|pg||
nt|sharynr: this will be a claimer|pg||
nt|jcwla: I keep seeing these delayed actions that allow the opps extra rounds of bidding to communicate.  Most have not cost yet but I don't get it.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jaapfr: but not after @H lead no DD chance|pg||
nt|pamela: not the time to lead Ace Diam  not that it matters in the huge scheme of it|pg||
nt|gnasher: W didn't double 4H, so he was unlikely to lead one of those|pg||
nt|sharynr: I suppose maybe he thinks North could have psyched a 4@D bid :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pamela: but psychologically it hurts  till you see the hand after |pg||

pc|cJ|pc|d4|nt|lestergold: i think only the ace of clubs left for the defence|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Dhondy deep in thought, head in her hands|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe he is worried that south's hearts are better and that a heart switch may set them up for Erichsen|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: his pard has bid twice he has a K and a queen to contribute to defence  and very little to contribute to the 11 tricks needed in offence|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: Selway has changed his opening bid policy|pg||
mb|2N!|an|good raise, usually with minor singleton|nt|gnasher: This is game-forcing with clubs or a 3-card raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well no future in the blocked club suit|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lestergold: but slam is not favourite to be reached here |pg||
nt|roswolf: north and south did not explore|pg||
nt|lestergold: flat 19 opposite a an unexciting nine with an 8 card minor suit fit|pg||
nt|lestergold: not that awful a slam basically on the club finesse and no disasters elsewhere|pg||
nt|jaapfr: effective effort indeed:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: here he does have a good 5 card suit and two aces tho|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is the trouble a gadget when you dont need 1|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok, there's got to be something strange about a system that has you open 1@D with the E hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: Before he rebid 2@D to show 5@S, so now they are forced to the play a 4-3?|pg||
nt|sharynr: Should those responses not be reversed?|pg||
nt|andyv:  time for 4 card majors to make a comeback|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: unlikley to reach it tho|pg||
nt|lestergold: cards not lying too well here for N/S|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: inless he runs the J clubs |pg||
nt|ady: dont think so Mike   this hand has a resonable suit  and 5-4-2-2    he would always open that|pg||
nt|lestergold: well not in black suits better in the reds|pg||
nt|roswolf: called precision - style|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ritong: the pushy 3@d might help  bakshi will like his flat hand with every high card working|pg||
nt|lestergold: i do agree David|pg||
nt|gnasher: They'd prefer to play 2S in a 4-3 fit than 2NT|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: whioch he has|pg||
nt|pamela: so H is H then  2D =  5+ sp and 2S is 4?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|dburn: why 2@c, I wonder?|pg||
nt|sharynr: Seems that 2@D to show 4 card @S, would still allow south to bid 2@H|pg||
nt|gnasher: And I expect 1S-2C;2D-2H shows the club game-force with hearts|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|jaapfr: problem is not a real way to show @CQJ which are vital|pg||
nt|lestergold: well he deosnt like his qd so fla woking 1 cou8nt does not look that slam going|pg||
nt|lestergold: a2 count|pg||

pc|hK|nt|roswolf: playing 4 card majors( a crazy system) THIS 2@C THING IS FULL OF HOLES IF OPPS BID|pg||

pc|h9|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|nt|jcwla: A large number of @S T/J leads.  Meanwhile, Hassett did not miss the 3NT game Crouch missed (playing 3@D making 5 here), so 10 more to break it open at 35.|pg||

nt|ritong: mm|pg||
nt|dburn: so that 4@c ought to be a long-suit trial bid, not a singleton|pg||

mb|p|nt|yo_yo: difficult for either side to lead @D here|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S  sliiped through in OR      diamonds not cashed|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: oh dear well another swing to Crouch here|pg||
nt|lestergold: Yes but were they ever likely to be cahse who is leading diamonds here|pg||
nt|gnasher: But W will play it here, and a low club from N is good enough|pg||
nt|roswolf: safetyfirst|pg||
nt|andyv:  N needs to push one more time.....|pg||
nt|andyv:  drat!|pg||
nt|jcwla: 2@H, partner could have five.  Also, you have the ace.  It's not like a holding where it's worth zero playing in suit but worth a bunch playing in NT.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|yo_yo: I bet this makes in every match|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well  Ew have obviously discussed that sequence  |pg||
nt|ady: 3NT  looks like the only possible making game|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I would be afraid of East passing my 2@H bid|pg||
nt|pamela: well  not enough testesterone at this table|pg||
nt|sharynr: what a lead that would be (@CK)|pg||
nt|roswolf: should have got there now with west's bold 2@H I THINK HE MUST BE CONSISTENT AND BID GAME WHEN INVITED TO DO SO |pg||
pc|d6|nt|lestergold: oh my giddy aunt|pg||
nt|lestergold: and ot away with only fifties|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is terrifying|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lestergold: should drop J to muddy the waters|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: obviously the two davids not on the same wavelength on this hand at any rate|pg||
nt|gnasher: Declarer coild trick ducking, unblocking Q|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: Fleet having had one or two misadventures has gone fairly conservative lately and unofrtunately choosing a few wrong monets to do so|pg||
nt|lestergold: moments|pg||
nt|dburn: but no doubt he didn't because West had not doubled the artificial 3@d|pg||
nt|pamela: no problem in 3NT now|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|lestergold: a coffe break which i need badly we ve both been at it for quite  a few hours today geoffrey|pg||
nt|jaapfr: still S must be dreaming of a fantastic hand of his pd or as a safe against 4@H??|pg||
nt|lestergold: no other viable play tho for Selway but to continue clubs whatever|pg||
nt|lestergold: i wold imagine that the 2h bid was forcing Kath|pg||
nt|lestergold: presumably game forcing or why did Small sign off in H with his minimum|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: 2@h was invitational with 5 hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4H|pg||
nt|andyv:  still, you have an 8 count opposite a limited opener.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Also, you have a tenace and if they do choose a @S lead it comes into you, and you've disguised your @S holding.  As for getting to game, too rich for my blood.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lestergold: he obviously thinks its a double fit and that theefore Gold has short sdpaes etc|pg||
nt|lestergold: well then 4H was an ptimistic bid|pg||

pc|d8|nt|lestergold: Fleet will know he has undercooked this goose|pg||

mb|3N!|nt|sharynr: staying low was good for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: well, North opened 1@s because he had spades|pg||

pc|c7|nt|lestergold: hah what a layout on this lead  all 1 are available|pg||

pc|d4|nt|lestergold: so I tyhink thi swas another lost opporunity to take eithjer the vul game or a 500 penalty|pg||

mb|3H|nt|lestergold: the debacle with the double fo 3n mush to their credit|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: Bahkshi gonna take the phantom here?|pg||
nt|lestergold: yep|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: or "at most two hearts", since Crouch is perfectly capabale of having a singleton for 1NT|pg||
nt|ady: there is play for 3NT   making 5 diamonds 3 hearts  and a blck trick     nice lay with 10X@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: if south enters with a double life might have been easier for n/s|pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: o0f course horrible duplication in diamodns 3 of the combined 30 points straight into the skip|pg||
nt|roswolf: artificial relays show their potential|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's a brave pass by selway|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: play resumes in55 mins at the top of the hour|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm this time Crough's upgrade and Patterson's reasonable optimism has pushed them overboard|pg||
nt|dburn: haven't yet known him to have a void, but only because he has not yet tailored the system so that he can show one|pg||
nt|ady: this could be a nice swing to Ierens     nothing much on for n/s    and a penalty here|pg||
nt|lestergold: and the cards are spitting at Small this will cost|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@Sthe likely contract|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lestergold: its sort of insurance a disaster if 4s was making|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|lestergold: 4H the only reasonable spot here|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps east should have doubled 2@D?|pg||

nt|lestergold: all fantasy land stuff|pg||

nt|lestergold: on as steep dive into   the......|pg||
nt|lestergold: which mire?|pg||
nt|lestergold: they had better stop ion 5H|pg||
nt|roswolf: well 5@H can be made|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes and it can also fail|pg||
nt|lestergold: ultimately it will need as good view in spades|pg||
nt|ady: Irens|pg||
nt|lestergold: the children had beet rbe sent out of the room|pg||
mb|d|nt|sharynr: quite a swing on bd that 6@H X hand...Reissman will be very hard on himself I am sure,(and so should Waterlow)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: south whatever he bids has confirmed the diamond lead|pg||

nt|pamela: oh :( sorry Andy|pg||
nt|roswolf: not good for the nerves commentating on your own team|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h7|nt|roswolf: yup the minors need to be left alone|pg||

pc|h6|nt|ady: could go wrong in hearts though if north covers the jack   but understandingly will probably not|pg||
nt|lestergold: has to make now|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|lestergold: In the old days experts used to talk about tricj taking security when vulnerable|pg||
nt|lestergold: now no one bothers about pips buty on a hand like this look at the difference betwen KJT(xx and KJ spanner spanner spanner spanner|pg||
nt|lestergold: all the minnows will be gobbled up by bigger minnows|pg||
nt|roswolf: more imps to hassett likely|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: unluck that 3 of east's points are on the scrap heap of course|pg||
nt|lestergold: he may of course be misled by Gold's jump to 3H which sounds barrage like|pg||
nt|lestergold: especially over the redouble|pg||
nt|dburn: I guess you might take the view that once you'd doubled 1@s, you should retire from the fray thereafter|pg||
nt|lestergold: and he made a take out o=double on shape and fave vulnerablity not on high cards|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y it felt that way but what can N bid else|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he could have bid 2@s|pg||
nt|lestergold: but one off for insurance is not a disaster its not a full blown phantom disaster|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont bl;ame anyone here but its not a disaster at imps|pg||
nt|lestergold: its just on this hand the wrong side of the fence but you cant balance every angel on a pin head on very hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: every hand|pg||
nt|jaapfr: specs suggest N to bid 2@S on XX but imo too strong bid or desperation:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: lets face it had Souht held Jd the bidding would have been the same and 5H would have been frigid|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h9|nt|dburn: North won't cover the jack - that would be absurd|pg||
nt|lestergold: and unlucky that Dhondy was awake too|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so now it's home |pg||
nt|jaapfr: oh sorry did not see Davids 2@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: yum|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lestergold: maybe Bahkshi sjhould have been influended by the defensive upside of his stiff club|pg||
nt|lestergold: that to me is the strongest reason for him considering defending|pg||
nt|lestergold: vulnerable opps often bid unsound games in order to terrorise non vul opps into phantoms|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|lestergold: 500 against aip|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|lestergold: zip|pg||
nt|ady: looks like -500|pg||
nt|lestergold: to borrow a transatlantic word|pg||
nt|roswolf: diamond up?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|lestergold: providing Waterlow plays on spades not hearts now|pg||
nt|lestergold: but the lead looks like from three small|pg||
nt|roswolf: nothing would suprise now|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: i dont think Watrlow will make the wrong choice here|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Thanks everyone|pg||
nt|dburn: North doesn't know that declarer has five solid diamonds, nor that he does not have @hJ10 doubleton|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|roswolf: bye all for now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|andyv:  the lack of a 4th @s in E hand very telling here.|pg||
nt|jcwla: East bid the hand one time too many.  Meanwhile, W's free bid certainly not a thing of beauty.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: oh|pg||
pc|d5|nt|roswolf: ouch |pg||
nt|lestergold: is commentator's curse going to get me to|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d3|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes probably|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|nt|lestergold: kill poin now leave those hearts alone Topny|pg||
nt|lestergold: Tony|pg||
nt|lestergold: can you hear me|pg||
nt|roswolf: definitely|pg||
nt|lestergold: you are risking a re-commentator curse as it were|pg||
nt|roswolf: when he studies the replay|pg||
nt|lestergold: he may switrch back to spades|pg||
nt|roswolf: MAY/|pg||
nt|lestergold: and you get the egg on face|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is a coin flip|pg||
nt|lestergold: odds with the spades 6 missing compared to 5 hearts |pg||
nt|lestergold: and club break heavily suggests the short hearts with west|pg||
nt|jcwla: Crouch dying of a thousand paper cuts on the partscore battles on 11 and 12 -- up to 40.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c2|pg||
nt|lestergold: not that S was even essentially unsound its only off because of the club ruffs|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
nt|andyv:  and not too much to look forward to on last 5 boards|pg||

nt|lestergold: and hi Kath|pg||
nt|ady: will south open some sort of multi|pg||
nt|roswolf: do we know the systems?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: We are playing with screens, so I will be entering the bids in pairs|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: EW strong club, NS 4cM weak NT|pg||
nt|ady: good morning Mike   Kath|pg||
nt|lestergold: more of a stink bomb egg|pg||
nt|roswolf: incroyable|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes its makes my croy too|pg||
nt|lestergold: me croy|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: now this is a coffee hand|pg||
nt|pamela: when you see all four hands  hard to see how it would go down.. |pg||
nt|gnasher: Oh no, not another slam|pg||
nt|mariner1: makeable NS slam,,,,,, tough to bid and really a Roland special|pg||
mb|1C|an|could be 2|mb|1S|nt|lestergold: I think Waterlow played that on tilt personally|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this i predict should be flat|pg||
mb|2D|nt|pamela: yessss|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed and may be difficult to bid now|pg||
nt|sharynr: hard to bid this one on limited high cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: so we have a pretty british commentating team for a very british event playing a uniquely british version of acol N/S weak nt and 4 card majors|pg||
nt|lestergold: he is given greek gift and sends it back|pg||
nt|roswolf: nothing greek about it a semi -washington coup|pg||
nt|lestergold: acoffe break hand coming up now|pg||
nt|roswolf: even roland would be proud to bid this one|pg||
nt|mariner1: well with N opening this "might" be bid|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|Walddk7: wots acol?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: many's the time I have trundled down the M6 to solihull!|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Morning everyone|pg||
nt|lestergold: and actually weve been at it for over 2 hours and i could do with one|pg||
nt|sharynr: magically east having nothing in diamonds|pg||
nt|gnasher: West wil splinter|pg||
nt|roswolf: will they diagnose the perfect fit|pg||
nt|gnasher: And East will like his prime values outside diamonds|pg||
nt|mariner1: and the @S bid might help also|pg||
nt|jcwla: Who would ever pass the N hand?|pg||
nt|roswolf: true but n/s will be boring THEY know they are well ahead|pg||
nt|mariner1: true, S in Open Room just blasted 3N|pg||
nt|roswolf: rkcb might help here|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
nt|andyv:  and seems to be called for too!|pg||
mb|4D!|an|keycard|nt|roswolf: hi roland|pg||
nt|lestergold: liking driving on the left we have to be different most of out non native specs will be bemused by this quaint british bidding style|pg||
nt|lestergold: an dHi Roland|pg||
nt|yo_yo: tut tut are they allowed another major  ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: South looking at lead styles of EW|pg||
nt|lestergold: infrangible |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well only two apparent losers in 5D but maybe too much work to do|pg||
nt|lestergold: brb|pg||
nt|gnasher: I expect them to bid this one|pg||
nt|gnasher: Surely there's no stopping East now|pg||
nt|sharynr: me too, (now)|pg||
nt|roswolf: might bid the grand as well?|pg||
nt|gnasher: That would be nice|pg||
nt|andyv:  that should be it|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think it has|pg||
nt|jcwla: 4@D for KC 4NT for natural and invitational?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup i think so|pg||
mb|4H|an|0/3|mb|p|nt|lestergold: in 3rd position Richard is happy to open a weak 2 even possesing 4 in the other major|pg||
nt|lestergold: i am given to understand that th e late denis spooner used to write waterlow articles in btween the avengers series|pg||
nt|dburn: hard to play this in diamonds at all|pg||
nt|lestergold: will Bahkshi reverse into diamonds now?|pg||
nt|lestergold: show his shape and extra strength?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it does seem a long 2 hours|pg||
nt|ady: this should cause no problem   even on a heart lead as east has no entry |pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|nt|lestergold: yes i agree|pg||
nt|lestergold: Gol dwill know that his heart holding is largely binnable|pg||
nt|jaapfr: re|pg||
nt|lestergold: re Jaap|pg||
nt|jaapfr: due to my Spanish wifi (not wife:)|pg||
nt|dburn: if he knew that 2@d was natural, he might already have passed it|pg||
nt|dburn: but I guess he has to consider how strong South could be - maybe 3NT will make|pg||
nt|jaapfr: then 3@D i suppose|pg||
nt|sharynr: XX|pg||
nt|roswolf: well now they know about the diamond position|pg||
nt|pamela: nice help from opps|pg||
nt|andyv:  now 6N seems easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: diaries of a palooka wasnt it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: had to get club right to have a chance|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n not out of question on tis reverse|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@h mysterious|pg||
nt|lestergold: why 2h here by Gold|pg||
nt|lestergold: snap David|pg||
nt|lestergold: bery odd|pg||
nt|jaapfr: what wrong with 3@D?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 9 tricks but awkward to take|pg||
nt|roswolf: reasonable punt - in fact i quite like the sequence|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: ah yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed silly double by north imo|pg||
nt|sharynr: 5@C- 6@C?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: Peter Crouch perhaps siesly keeping quiet|pg||
nt|lestergold: wisely|pg||
nt|jaapfr: by N|pg||
nt|dburn: well, you can understand it as a kind of game try, but...|pg||
nt|lestergold: well wavelengthhere has not been too good|pg||
nt|pamela: Howard team could do with this swing.. if they get there|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@C WOULD BE 1 WAY OF PROCEEDING|pg||
nt|andyv:  so, will have to rely on @c hook|pg||
pc|sA|nt|roswolf: effectively on the club finesse|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes I suppose in 3rd position anything is allowed|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Silverstone puts his quitted trick as if he won it|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@s lead might have been more deceptive|pg||
pc|sT|nt|roswolf: yes it is good to see Richard back playing high level bridge again|pg||
nt|roswolf: nice |pg||
pc|sK|nt|lestergold: better 'sign off' in 3D and hope that its passed out|pg||
nt|lestergold: but he has counted his 8 points and is reluctant to abandon game possibilities|pg||
nt|jaapfr: anyway 2NT unbeatable|pg||
nt|lestergold: Bakhshi knows that his freverse on a misfiitng 16 has not gone too well|pg||
nt|jaapfr: assuming after X he finds @CJ:)|pg||
nt|dburn: what "reverse"?|pg||
nt|pamela: I hear you!|pg||
nt|sharynr: surely a try for 7|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: but 2N is in fact infrangible|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i wouldnt call Waterlow a palooka more of an honest expert as opposed to awily one|pg||
nt|lestergold: diamonds behave very well|pg||
nt|gnasher: W needed Kxx AKxx xxx Kxx|pg||
pc|d7|nt|roswolf: yup an unlucky expert perhaps!?|pg||
nt|roswolf: gsf try east should accept|pg||
nt|gnasher: But even then grand isn't certain|pg||
nt|sharynr: might have tried the intra-finesse in clubs and gone down in 7|pg||
nt|gnasher: East hasn't been invited to bid a grand|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lestergold: well 2D not technically a reverse I know but it would tend to imply reversing values in this sequence|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|lestergold: its actuially 2 and a half hours Kath thats maybe why!!|pg||
nt|ady: how many more hands?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jcwla: No choice of black hooks so will rise here.  Even if @S on, only 11.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|lestergold: Richard a very distinguiehes senior figure in British bridge selectoe non playing captain u name it and a fine player in his own right|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 3 more|pg||
nt|ady: ok     thx|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sharynr: i think east made a grand slam try already with 6@C, didnt he?|pg||
nt|gnasher: Yes,  But He wasn't in control - that was just bid on the way to 6H|pg||
nt|roswolf: no because @H were agreed - i am used to a stayman where 2@H shows spades!|pg||
nt|gnasher: W knew that his man couldn't have Kxx AKxx xxx KQx, because1NT was 12-14|pg||
pc|d2|nt|yo_yo: Heather dhondy one of our best English lady players, maybe the best ?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sharynr: but he could have Kx in @C|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@D 3@C 1@H or 5 losers indeed always made|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|nt|roswolf: more imps to hassett|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|lestergold: i know Erichsen is often an extremely slow player competing perhaps with Robson for the title|pg||
nt|lestergold: 20 hands in 3 hours is not exaly the 100 yds sprint|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|nt|jcwla: 7 went back to Crouch on 14 when they did bid that thin 4@H game on xxxx opposite kj9xx|pg||
mc|12|nt|lestergold: absolutely against the wall|pg||

mb|p|nt|jtr: Enjoy|pg||
mb|3S!|mb|p|nt|athene: 3@S clearly some sort of cunning heart raise|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: see you roland, thx|pg||
nt|dburn: shows any slam try in hearts with no splinter|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|dburn: or possibly with short spades - not sure how they would handle that|pg||
nt|jtr: South has no aces but quite  a few Kings to compensate|pg||
nt|athene: pretty good 6nt here|pg||
nt|athene: or 6@H of course|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S can just keycard here|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S might be keycard|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|jtr: Maybe 3@s could be short @ss otherwise South would have shown interest|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he has no aces and HCP minimum BUT he has 5 LTC & decent trumps & N has bid very strongly|pg||
nt|jtr: This may be 14-16|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5D|nt|marlowepi: i dont think 4S is KC. |pg||
nt|marlowepi: it wouldnt make sense|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N didnt learn anything positive about S hand over 3S|pg||
nt|vugraphzyj: lots of alerts, but no explanations at the table|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so if he thought he was good enough to KC,  N would have done it over 2H|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: do we know the range of 1N here?|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|jtr: Wishing he was in 6NT so as to get a clue about bad @hs|pg||

nt|jtr: Or a squeeze even if they take the @dA|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 6NT is better |pg||
nt|athene: you can delay the heart guess|pg||

nt|roswolf: agree kath|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe he was a palokka in the old days of the harrow bridge club where we all used to play when we wore short trousers|pg||
nt|sharynr: mow we have comparisons|pg||
nt|sharynr: 3NT seems to be a bit of an overbid?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|an|14-16|nt|lestergold: E/Walso a strong player with a good record of high level success|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: strong pair|pg||

nt|yo_yo: other room have 3 to go too|pg||
nt|lestergold: well Small opens 1H no doubnt to deflect his pard from leading a club|pg||
nt|pamela: not going to be the same contract at this table|pg||
nt|roswolf: souths double in the other room was imaginative|pg||
nt|sharynr: north will DBL? unless conventional|pg||
nt|roswolf: this should be ab easy slam to bid|pg||
nt|jcwla: This one only of interest at BAM.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Sorry, they stopped in 3 -- but had made 2@S the other way -- so +110 +170 |pg||
nt|roswolf: stayman and then 6@H/|pg||
nt|andyv:  so far, 15 compared scores... one push:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: or6nt direct?|pg||
nt|andyv:  nothing direct about this hand:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe an quantitive raise ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  with 17 opp. possible 14, looking for major suit fit may be necessary|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|roswolf: wriggle manoeuvre|pg||
nt|pamela: as long as W leaves it till he has to bid those awful H of his|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ady: looks destined for 3NT  e/w|pg||
nt|sharynr: surely south and west have nothing to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: now we will see a few relays from e/w. Peter Crouch is one for all theory gadgets|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Heather's bio on:  http://www.ebu.co.uk/general/biographies/players/heatherdhondy.htm|pg||
nt|andyv:  N possibly reviewing agreements in his mind:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  several play 4@s now as rkc|pg||
mb|6H|nt|lestergold: well we ae back in the infrangible 3n department|pg||
nt|dburn: "frequent upgrading", as Meckwell's convention card says|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: this is a coffee break hand|pg||
nt|sharynr: a 2-way double ? :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: south will move|pg||
nt|sharynr: with 3@C|pg||
nt|andyv:  others just bid 6:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well defence has the points and the tempo so i dont see any honey here for  Bahkshi needs to hold it to one off to avoid a loss|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: no alert for 2@H?|pg||
nt|lestergold: Heather has a good reputation not only in the ladies game but also in the Open Game|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: yes 2@H alert|pg||
nt|ady: ok|pg||
nt|roswolf: everything is likely alertable until the final bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: incroyable|pg||
nt|pamela: well only 180 on a bad day|pg||
nt|pamela: or a good day|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah direct punt - like it|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|roswolf: 180 more like 380|pg||
nt|sharynr: maybe a @H start will be good, tapping declarer and promoting a trump for North perhaps|pg||
nt|jcwla: Until these last couple, it had been uncanny how closely the rooms stayed together timewise.  Almost like synchronized bridge.  Many play 4@D over 2@H = big balanced invite with 4 ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: @H's.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Dixon: "sorry my mind was going there, a bit blank"|pg||
pc|sA|nt|yo_yo: Peter Crouch a great theorist |pg||
nt|roswolf: ok perhaps only making|pg||
pc|s6|nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|roswolf: finis|pg||
nt|lestergold: well today we will see some theory put into practice|pg||
nt|yo_yo: you have to have a super duper brain to keep up with his bidding techniques|pg||
nt|roswolf: a good memory is essential too!|pg||
nt|lestergold: a push if CT led|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm the 4@S -1 hand was made in the other room - a @D was led!|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i see 7 tricks................................................. for defense:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: they win race|pg||
nt|lestergold: er i think Mr. Bahkshi will have some explaining to do about the double he found in the open oom against 4S|pg||
nt|yo_yo: crikey yes|pg||
nt|ady: Irens on a loser here    1190  in OR|pg||
nt|lestergold: his opartner opened the bidding and he had one apparently viable trick in the ace of diamonds which of course happens to be as non viable asthe Qs he tipped the opps off about|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lestergold: only ten tricks here so one pesky imp to Hassett|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lestergold: we cant all share one of those with you Kath|pg||
pc|hK|nt|yo_yo: :)  i wish!|pg||
nt|lestergold: my brain is dooper but im not sure about the super|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|roswolf: lol|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's a good one :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: does this qualify for a roland slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes if it makes!|pg||
nt|lestergold: only just it needs a 3/2 club break and 2 finesse which is above 12.85%|pg||
nt|lestergold: Roland is very scientific about these matters Geoof|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|yo_yo: I can never understand why Crouch hasnt made it into the international field more |pg||
nt|lestergold: the more i look at the open room auction the more bewildered i am -Gold made one opening bid at favourable vul and N/S powerd to game and the double was made with that nearly ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: useless collection sitting under the spade suit|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: seems an easy 11 tricks with clubs 3-2  and K@D  on side   can force 2 entries in the clubs for heart and diamond finesses|pg||
nt|yo_yo: some have a rule that when partner opens, opps bid game , I have an ace, then X|pg||
pc|h9|nt|vugraphzsg: Q asks for att|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade plays by Rosen hacve made it easy in that department|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|h2|nt|roswolf: claim|pg||
pc|s4|pc|hA|nt|lestergold: now a heart swirch is needed to ensure defeat|pg||

pc|hJ|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|pc|dT|nt|lestergold: not one that I follow|pg||
nt|jcwla: On 15, where Dixon overcalled 2NT and S transferred to 3NT, their counterparts in the OR settled for defending 3@D and beating it 3 for 150.  So 10 more to Hassett there.|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|nt|jaapfr: if rosen can not show that:)..........................|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: Maybe has not had a long enough run with the right partner - |pg||
nt|roswolf: 20 board sets will need stamina|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: especially for me!|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|andyv:  over trick time|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lestergold: well that qwasnt too difficult Rosen discarded the suit he didnt want played|pg||
pc|c4|nt|yo_yo: yes Ant  it's a lot of concentration  |pg||
nt|lestergold: British birdge is beset with very talenmted payers who are extremely unlucky in buiding and sustaining effective partnerships|pg||
mc|12|nt|pamela: nothing  to be done now |pg||
nt|andyv:  nope|pg||
nt|andyv:  and our 2nd push|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|jtr: 4@s can be beaten....|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|athene: yes, diamond ruff|pg||
nt|athene: unlikely to be found in practice, however|pg||
nt|jtr: Again NT is better|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry, my friends, an minor emergency has arisen and i have to go. :(|pg||
mb|3S|nt|jtr: Bye Marshall hope it is sorted out|pg||
nt|vugraphzyj: 2@c was GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: well what is W to lead against 4@S? |pg||
nt|athene: north has 4333 with lots of points, so if he wants to play game, 3nt is the place|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: 2@C might be Garozzo-style - basically natural in principle, but might be a balanced hand like this|pg||
nt|xenya: a @C seems to be out|pg||
nt|jtr: and 2@d?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyj: Always lead curse against a Scot|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtr: :)|pg||
nt|athene: well 2@D would be any minimum without four hearts, for Garozzo, but it could mean anything here|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|s5|pc|s6|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|c2|pc|s4|pc|s8|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jtr: May still have a @h guess|pg||
nt|jtr: Should even|pg||
pc|h2|pc|sA|pc|s9|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|nt|xenya: still some hope to defeat it|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: west can underlead the heart before declarer gets a pitch on the fourth diamond|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes in these positions you rise king because it's a Grosvenor|pg||
nt|athene: but that's only if you had to play the suit yourself eventually|pg||
nt|jtr: well no pitch but he must be given the @h 'guess'|pg||
nt|athene: here, south is threatening to discard a heart, so west will lead a small heart from the @HA or @HQ|pg||
nt|athene: ah, sorry, he doesn't quite have the spot cards does he|pg||
nt|jtr: If he led them again from hand West might rise but he cant do that now|pg||
nt|athene: so that makes it easier, in fact|pg||
nt|athene: for any specs wondering about the implications - the idea is this|pg||
nt|athene: if west had something like @HQ10x, and he could see you had to play hearts yourself, he just wouldn't open them up|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: so if he DOES lead a little one, you play him for the ace|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|pc|cA|pg||
nt|jtr: So West must not let him know the @ds arent breaking|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|athene: but if you are threatening to get a discard of a heart, west is forced to attack the suit from any holding|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|pg||
nt|xenya: but S doesn't know  W knows that @Ds don't run |pg||
nt|athene: right|pg||
nt|athene: west has to win the @DA early and lead the heart|pg||
nt|athene: now diamonds could be 3-3|pg||
pc|h6|nt|xenya: so it's a guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzyj: EW normal count, explains Hirst|pg||
nt|athene: well, west had to capture the @D10 there anyway, of course|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h5|pg||
nt|jtr: Well done all round|pg||
nt|athene: i think you should still play the @HK here|pg||
nt|athene: because|pg||
mc|10|nt|athene: even if diamonds are coming in it's still 50-50|pg||
pg||

nt|roswolf: we have a strange attitude to sponsors generally|pg||
nt|lestergold: and as we can se the double in open oom simply helped the overtricks|pg||
nt|gnasher: That takes the difference back to IMPs overall|pg||
nt|gnasher: to 4 IMPs |pg||
nt|mariner1: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php - BBO Vugraph Schedule|pg||
nt|mariner1: (set up to show times for your area)|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: we need some movie star  looks maybe|pg||
nt|lestergold: we have astrange atitude to ninternational competition in brideg and indeed many other sports altogether|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S   makes for n/s     not clear whether they will reach game|pg||
nt|roswolf: well there was excitement in the other room|pg||
nt|lestergold: well could be duplicated hee|pg||
nt|dburn: odd, that - why would you raise 3@h to 4@h in the auction at the other table?|pg||
nt|ady: 6@H   on spade guess|pg||
nt|sharynr: 5@H undoubled, turned out to be a good save against 5@S|pg||
mb|1S!|an|8+ bal or !Ds|nt|roswolf: an acol opening from south - 1NT for the rest of us |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: unlikely to identify this perfecto fit|pg||

mb|1N|nt|lestergold: hm Irense powered their way to 4h quite difficult to stayout of 4h hereon an uniterrupted auction|pg||
nt|ady: 4NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: no way can richard move opposit Heather's epected ore emptive raise|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes 3@S will be pre-emptive|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is this premier league part of the trials this year?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|jaapfr: this logic 2@D bid does help opps|pg||
nt|lestergold: well at this vulnerbaility Gold will always bid with this type of hand|pg||
nt|jaapfr: me too|pg||
nt|lestergold: the downside of not ensuring a dim lead against 3N is too compelling|pg||
nt|sharynr: North passed 1@S opening in OR|pg||
nt|sharynr: so East had a chance to balance|pg||
nt|jcwla: These are some long matches for VPs.|pg||
nt|mariner1: score is like the Moody Blues song|pg||
mb|3N|an| |nt|lestergold: of course the game does require diamonds to behave as well as no nasty breaks so its below 50% which is not good odds for a non vulnerable game|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Fleet looking at convention card|pg||
nt|roswolf: but with a few less guarantees - especially for the europeans|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: now EW's system file|pg||
nt|lestergold: no i think Hacjkett's decsion here a lot soundr than north's in the open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: norths hand very suitable   both queens pulling weight|pg||
nt|lestergold: sadly dimaonds dont behave and it costs 500 so not taht great a save but its still a profit|pg||
nt|lestergold: has to play it carefully|pg||
nt|lestergold: not to lose 800|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry im blind its only 300 of course not vul im gettinmg tired even better praise for Hackett|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: open oom decision very poor|pg||
nt|pamela: ah that explains it|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: but we know the downisdes of these bids an steering ops out of an unmakebale gam is a freqjuent one|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5dx not particulalrly good business at unfavourable unless they bid and make 6H in the other room|pg||
nt|mariner1: Blasting, billowing, bursting forth, With the power of ten billion butterfly|pg||
nt|mariner1: sneezes, Man with his flaming pyre, Has conquered the wayward breezes,|pg||
nt|mariner1: Climbing to tranquility, Far above the cloud, Conceiving the heavens, Clear of|pg||

nt|andyv:  :))|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: north should realise that e/w ae bound to have a stack of clubs to run|pg||
nt|lestergold: well hackett realised it|pg||
pc|s5|nt|pamela: nothing to the play |pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|sharynr: good lead, only one to hold it to 4, i think|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|roswolf: heather understandably did think her hand was a GOOD raise|pg||
nt|lestergold: i prefer playing a heart to the ten here|pg||
nt|lestergold: as it happens here it has only cost a measly imp|pg||
nt|ady: might get out for down 1|pg||
nt|lestergold: that is also possible|pg||
nt|ady: if defense plays 2 rounds of spades   can get an elimination and ace and another club|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like 2 club losers to me unless defnce does something silly|pg||
nt|yo_yo: erichsen stuck for a continuation|pg||
nt|lestergold: after spade spade there is still an exit available|pg||
nt|ady: is wondering which ace Selway has for the double|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|roswolf: so do i|pg||
nt|lestergold: im surprised here Hackett cannot afford to end up with a club loser|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 2@D does cost here 6 imps|pg||
pc|d2|nt|gnasher: Waterlow made a game try, then bid S when his partner signed off.  Does that mean he was making a slam try?|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh well one off and a  profit for small|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: EW S-peter if they want a switch|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: of course eaqst cannot take advantage of what seems to have been a frare card play error by Hackett|pg||
nt|roswolf: only -2|pg||
nt|lestergold: it was always going to be only -2|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Hackett is dummy |pg||
nt|dburn: why?|pg||
nt|sharynr: but hackett will be increasing his lead nevertheless|pg||
nt|andyv:  starting with 8 tricks, declarer will have no problems with this contract|pg||
pc|c2|nt|yo_yo: declarer might still get the @C wrong  but after the long pause, prob  not|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's not quite a preemptive raise  nor good enough for a limit raise, one of those annoying hands|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think that 3S is a perfecly normal raise over 2H she simply cannot make an unassuming cue bid raise with taht colelction|pg||
nt|lestergold: that  was  hard one for erichsen|pg||
nt|lestergold: a toss up id say|pg||
pc|d5|nt|yo_yo: I dont know much about Patterson   does anyone else?|pg||

nt|xenya: how do you run 6 red tricks?|pg||

mb|3N|nt|lestergold: 5C the best spot of course but 3N is infrangible as cards lie|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that probably shows 3@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 6@S   |pg||
mb|4H|nt|yo_yo: splinter by East|pg||

nt|lestergold: and it needs to!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: lets see|pg||
nt|ady: yes many might get overboard here with that great spade suit     can be thatg those opening 1@S  may be better placed   might be passed out|pg||
nt|lestergold: well its not normal Davuid but its a tempter when your q of hearts is a worker its often goijng to be enif tomake a vul game|pg||
nt|lestergold: Small has enuf for anmother try|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Small wont stop|pg||
nt|lestergold: its all on whether Osborne acceps the next try|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he has a strong 2 opener and partner opens the bidding|pg||
mb|4S|nt|roswolf: south might bid this game too|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: not many pass these days with a 5 count though|pg||
nt|lestergold: obsioly those points randomly scattered and itys a pass|pg||
nt|roswolf: he did|pg||
nt|gnasher: Both NS pairs seem to have taken a rosy view of their hands|pg||
nt|sharynr: does everyone want to be in game opposite a passed hand with 5 HCP in opps suit?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: a lot of players would wheel out 4S to begin with|pg||
nt|lestergold: well stopped!!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well done EW|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah well|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5H would be my choice that should get them there qith good spades and the diamond bullet|pg||
nt|pamela: only if it makes!|pg||
nt|gnasher: 4S seems a poor bid with those club honours|pg||
nt|roswolf: no but the lure of a vul game is irrestistable|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: disappointing after a good set for the Small team|pg||

nt|jaapfr: many would bid 1@S with KJxxx x  xxxx  xxx then Jxxxx  QX  xxx  KTx is a powerhouse! |pg||
nt|lestergold: of course west having the full monty in his second suit a bit wasted and a lousy holding in his first suit|pg||
nt|dburn: well, there were some bids between 3NT and 6@h|pg||
nt|lestergold: K think 6H was an overbid myself how they reached 7 in open is beyond comprehension|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 6NT had much better chances|pg||
nt|dburn: well, 6@h is not down yet, I guess|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed Mr.jone casnt be worried about the black suits on the bidding and his trump suit is dire|pg||
