nt|andyv:  Good morning Roland and Ed|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Andy!|pg||

nt|vugraphzym: Hello, Roland|pg||
nt|othered1: kThe prevfious match featured a number of very unusual auctions.  Wonder if it will continue here.|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Hello, Ed|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzym: Hello, Roland |pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Hello, Star6i|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzym: 2@H is 13-16 points 5+ @H|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Deyan:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  2N probably an inquiry as to type of 2@s raise|pg||
mb|2C|nt|othered1: rehi, everyone!|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: rehi, Ed|pg||
nt|mamos: game for ew|pg||
nt|mamos: although North doesnt think so|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  Hi Deyan:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: hi all|pg||
mb|3H|nt|vugraphzym: that 3@D bid gives chance to EW to find the 5@D save|pg||
nt|andyv:  if NS find their game|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Roberto Mart√≠nez|pg||
nt|ybob: Hi all :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Hello, Roberto|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: although 4@S is a bit double dummy|pg||
nt|othered1: normal auction, so far, good suit in south making up for 1/2 point high card shortness|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think S hand worth more than an invite|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Welcome back to Rado Radev|pg||
nt|rado: hello:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Hello, Rado|pg||
mb|4N|nt|ybob: Hi Deyan|pg||
nt|andyv:  they may be pushed into it... although it looks like NS are out of ammo|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@s looks too expensive now|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: he can make 4@S |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzym: has to play small @C to earn an entry|pg||
nt|andyv:  2N is a mp bid|pg||
mb|5D|nt|Walddk4: Hello Ed and Andy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and Deyan, our operator|pg||
nt|othered1: west reasonably passed over 1N.  Not sure if it was judgment or a systemic lack of an appropriate call (i.e., double has a conventional meaning)|pg||
nt|othered1: HI, Roland!|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Hi, Roland|pg||
nt|andyv:  good morning everyone|pg||
nt|andyv:  but N sees losing the first 3 tricks and still not sure where rest of tricks are coming from|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: good part score for EW|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: N can make 6@S and 4@C |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  as it turns out|pg||
mb|6H|nt|ybob: nice bid 3@S :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: looks like it can make|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't agree.  depends on actual 1N range and non-vul considerations aren't all that different from matchpoints.|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Hi, Andy!|pg||

nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|Walddk4: N-S  Romania    E-W  Bulgaria|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Stara Zagora is the organiser of the event.It is in Bulgaria. And the other team is from Buchurest (Romania)|pg||
nt|lestergold: thx Roland|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N looks playable for EW|pg||
nt|star6ija: nice distribution|pg||
mb|1N!|an|14-16|nt|vugraphzym: EW are playing precision|pg||
nt|star6ija: 7@c is possible, but...|pg||
nt|mamos: grand certainly looks a possibility|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: he put 1NT and then changed it :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Dayan, do you know their NT opening ranges?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: I think it is 15-17|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzym: 2@C should be @S and another suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|rado: W has minimum neg dbl here|pg||
nt|othered1: this should go very quickly -- you have a 20-count and partner jump supports  you . . . |pg||
nt|andyv:  AQ10xx suit will almost always produce 4 tricks and 5 tricks a good portion of the time|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lestergold: 3N by West probable diamond lead and no sweat|pg||
nt|andyv:  if 2N is invite, it is a heavy one|pg||
nt|andyv:  but, matter of style, I guess... I like being aggressive with those hands.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|star6ija: as Roberto pointed out the timing is very important in such boards - as we like to say in Bulgaria "1 second careless = dead for the rest of your life" :)|pg||
nt|rado: E has a choise rebiding weak @H, 3 cards 2@S or upgrading to 2NT protekting minor Kings|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good morning to Ed Shapiro|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pg||
nt|andyv:  wow....wonderful!!!|pg||
nt|andyv:  oops:)|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@S?  |pg||
nt|othered1: Fast arrival?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: 2NT should be invitational hand yes|pg||
nt|rado: hi Ed|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone, from chilly central Pennsylvania, USA|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Hi, Ed|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|andyv:  good morning everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Good morning, Andy|pg||
nt|andyv:  E sequence usually reserved for hands that are just short of game forcing  bids|pg||
nt|lestergold: any lead except a club helps and no one is kicking off with the stiff club ace|pg||
nt|star6ija: this 2@s bid from S is not good option... in this vulnerability strong club has to be sa descriptive as quickly as possible|pg||
nt|mamos: have Ns agreed a suit?|pg||
nt|star6ija: @Ss? :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: I think 1@C is natural, star6i|pg||
nt|mamos: was 1@C strong or nat?|pg||
nt|star6ija: if so ok|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS sure have a lot of points on this hand|pg||
nt|othered1: Agree for playinig for 9 tricks.  But it's likely you'll be playing for 10 in @H with flat hand v. flat hand|pg||
nt|othered1: 7N is off the top and playing 7 elsewhere is just running risk|pg||
nt|andyv:  then bid 2@c and jump to 3N;)|pg||
nt|othered1: That's the auction you find in the post-mortem, but not at the table by either the players or commentators.|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lestergold: even a spade lead sets up a spade trick for declarer|pg||
nt|andyv:  Ed, ever have hands where you just have too many bids?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ybob: :)|pg||
nt|star6ija: theyare trying to strike back immediately|pg||
nt|othered1: very rarely, but in my partnerships (the few that remain) we define things very tightly.|pg||
nt|andyv:  the N hand would give me a headache here|pg||
nt|othered1: 5N?  2 keys, plus Q, plus void?|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like it|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sharkey: Good morning|pg||
nt|andyv:  this auction will run out of steam quickly|pg||
nt|mamos: North thinks it's Hearts :)|pg||
nt|star6ija: 7@cs depends on some precautions which should've benn made by declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: it will be interesting if 6@H are bid wheather E will double :)|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d4|nt|Walddk4: Hello Andy and Carl|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Carl and roland|pg||
nt|ybob: down 2 AK @S low @C , later ruff @S|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@s would have set trump and asked for cue bids|pg||
nt|mamos: ugh|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: 7@S* looks the minimax|pg||
nt|mamos: well it makes but this has not been a good auction imho|pg||
nt|star6ija: 12 tricks are easy|pg||
nt|othered1: I like the 1@H response, to get a natural rebid from partner.|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|andyv:  all roads lead to 9 tricks, Mike? :))|pg||
nt|othered1: second best spot, but safe here.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h6|pc|dA|nt|andyv:  they got there.... good thing this isn'|pg||
nt|andyv:  isn't a BAM event:)|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|andyv:  and Deyan:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: it didnt run out of steam that quickly :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  they decided to bring it to a boil:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - this auction not for the faint hearted...|pg||
nt|andyv:  so, the question is why E didn't simply open 4@s if that was what he was intending to bid all the time?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well ironically a club lead and declarer has to do abit of guesswork|pg||
nt|andyv:  probably no over tricks|pg||
nt|rado: lack of communications between NS will help declare for 8 tricks|pg||
nt|othered1: this will claim as soon as both follow to one trump|pg||
pc|dK|nt|andyv:  this can go down 500 easily|pg||
nt|ybob: 4/2 @S shows even and interest @C|pg||
nt|star6ija: but @d now will bring the contract home|pg||
nt|othered1: Right -- a hand worth 2@C in playing strength but with inadequate high cards for the call.|pg||
nt|othered1: maybe even 9|pg||
nt|rado: sure with @S suit favourable|pg||
pc|s6|nt|othered1: I thought that was standard, but east's action here is what I see regularly at the table.  Times changed, I guess.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h4|pg||
nt|sharkey: set before they get started|pg||
nt|andyv:  a pretty steep price to pay to protect against a partial|pg||
pc|d7|pc|cQ|pc|d6|pc|c7|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think so Ed.|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: N had played 2@D on the A of spade so he was obliged to play it|pg||
nt|lestergold: well no he doesnt of course because then there has to be a switch!!|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||

pc|h5|nt|vugraphzym: the lead was very good as well|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, well done|pg||
nt|sharkey: otherwise probably just off 1|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hT|nt|andyv:  not too bad of play:)|pg||

pc|h3|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|c5|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sharkey: may be not - declarer probably cannot afford to pull trumps before playing @S|pg||

nt|sharkey: yes - if make only lose 170 points|pg||
nt|sharkey: not the game bonus in addition|pg||
nt|andyv:  2 questionable bids (2@h and 4@s) produce an inadaquate result|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: This is the ranking after the previous round : http://bridge.bg/ranking163.html|pg||

nt|star6ija: percentage to the winning one|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  easy slam for EW and easy safe for NS|pg||

mb|2H!|an|!Ss|nt|mamos: South's Pass is interesting|pg||
nt|mamos: North's 4@D is more interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: On a good day, 6@S might even make|pg||

mb|2S!|nt|andyv:  W thrilled with pd's dbl|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS still not underbidding...|pg||

nt|ybob: cold 7 tricks|pg||
nt|rado: and again some chases for more|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  3@h a bit aggressive|pg||
nt|mamos: West has tremendous playing strength|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: the minimax here seems to be 6@H*|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: looks like down 1|pg||
nt|othered1: Not that way.|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think this is the optimum way|pg||
pc|c6|nt|othered1: though 4N, if clearly unusual, is decent, planning to convert 5@C to 5@D, thus a slam try (if partner doesn't think you have a red 2-suiter)|pg||
nt|andyv:  would you think about passing the first time and "limping in" later?|pg||
nt|star6ija: playing yes but not defensive|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: well in spite of 4/1 heart break and unfavourable position of KS E/W have  plenty of strength t make 4h here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Results and standings after 3 rounds at   http://bridge.bg/ranking163.html|pg||
nt|andyv:  @s lead will make it very tough|pg||

pc|cK|pg||
nt|othered1: This makes, doesn't it?|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes... shoud make 5|pg||
nt|andyv:  should|pg||

pc|sA|nt|vugraphzym: she just claimed|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sharkey: unless something happens in the @D suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  should be able to make 9 tricks|pg||
nt|othered1: At his vulnerability, all passing would do is give NS a chance to find an eventual save.|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lestergold: South may be thinking that the best defnce holding 4 trumps is to try and set up a force in which case diamonds was the best prospect|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: bearing in mind that the diamond bid didnt promise diamonds|pg||
nt|andyv:  don't understand the need to play @ss immediately|pg||
nt|andyv:  now @d and @d ruff, forcing E to ruff with Q may create real problems|pg||
nt|lestergold: shout a dim straight back altho better if draws a trump ot so first|pg||

pc|c8|nt|ybob: 8@C look to @S|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mamos: thats quite some three boards to start with|pg||

nt|mamos: why do you think South passed as dealer?   too good for 2@H?  too poor for 1@H?|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c4|pg||

mb|1D!|nt|othered1: Whatever EW did there, it's hard to justify and game-lam swing|pg||
nt|othered1: a game-slam swing|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  board 2 cast Leromain 9 imps as they played 1N in OR|pg||
nt|andyv:  cost|pg||
nt|lestergold: 20/20 hcp division|pg||
nt|andyv:  and plenty of action|pg||
nt|lestergold: N/S 4S?|pg||
nt|andyv:  vul will stop E from jumping too high|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: I expect N/S to reach 4S and eith diamonds bid declarer will play play spades for only one loser|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: looks like N needs to play the right @S honour in 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: I open south's hand, but our initial actions are sound and wouldn't criticize a pass if they open lightly in 1 and 2 pos.|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but it is both the natural way to play the spads and the indicate way on the overcall|pg||
nt|mamos: problem on next round|pg||
nt|andyv:  S should dbl here|pg||

nt|andyv:  who wants to be in it?|pg||
nt|andyv:  borderline hand but you do have the majors|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: in any case a small spade from hand and a cover of any spade that east plays is a safety pklay here|pg||
pc|d2|nt|andyv:  this should go down 1|pg||

pc|s3|pc|sT|nt|sharkey: yes - shudnt be hard to find @D shift when N in with @SK|pg||
nt|othered1: You want to play  trumps to avoid 3 losers there, if the rest of the hand allows that|pg||
pc|s9|nt|othered1: I consider the raise normal, though it might be heresy in some parts of the world.|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pc|sQ|nt|andyv:  very little for the defense to initiate...just have to wait for declarer|pg||
nt|mamos: on Board 2 reaching 6NT was a fantastic swing for NS as in Open Room 6@H was not a success|pg||
nt|ybob: i cant understand @C at trick 2 ...|pg||
nt|rado: 1@D ruff and 1@d on Q@h and then trumps|pg||

pc|d4|pg||

nt|lestergold: certainly this is the most challenging defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: a matter of timing here|pg||
nt|andyv:  but he will shift to @c|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: is there a trump coup? I think no|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: in this cases the best analizer is GIB :) too bad vugraphs cant use it |pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|ybob: is this a reasonable line :) ?|pg||

nt|othered1: hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|andyv:  wow... that's a bit rich for me even with this vul|pg||
nt|lestergold: well wrong reasoning only chance was attacking the trump holdings playing a dianmond what does declarer do ruffs with K then west sluffs a heart which would cut down declarer's ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: options|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzym: hello ed|pg||
nt|ybob: Hi Ed !|pg||
nt|andyv:  E must be impressed with the outside strength of his hand|pg||
mb|6C|nt|andyv:  i would bid 4 with S hand|pg||
nt|othered1: 10 cards in 2 suits, favorable vul: bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  don't understand that lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  any game try will get NS too high|pg||
nt|lestergold: well South should be content with 2H his pard hasnt made an unassuming cue bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s too high at 2H!|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6 losers 2 spades 2 dims a club and a dim ruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: admittedly north's raise with two trumps and a collection of quacks under the openiong bid wa pretty pointless|pg||
nt|andyv:  true|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: 3@C a relay?|pg||
nt|andyv:  appears to be|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: GF with @C I suppose|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: 4+ cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: wd|pg||
nt|andyv:  and S has yet to be shy in this set:0|pg||
nt|sharkey: i agree Andy|pg||
nt|andyv:  ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: you pass with north because you o not want to see pard's expression when you table that as dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: N thought for a long time and passed|pg||
nt|lestergold: and his partner could be splinering as it was it was close to a splinter|pg||
nt|ybob: 5@H = 300 |pg||
nt|rado: 5@h is cheap but 5@S easy too|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  N 1N opener hit pay dirt|pg||
nt|sharkey: "looks like 1 NT - open 1 NT"|pg||
nt|andyv:  agree... i like 1N with N cards....too awkward to describe hand if you open 1@D|pg||
nt|sharkey: Leromain picked up another 5 IMPs when W opened 1 NT in OR and played there|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: he just claimed|pg||
nt|ybob: 2@H = 5+ @H  13/16 pts |pg||
nt|ybob: WOW|pg||
nt|othered1: but it's a good one, I think|pg||
nt|andyv:  gave up a club trick so I'm no so sure how good it is|pg||
nt|othered1: gave up a trick?|pg||
nt|andyv:  it hasn't yet but it's frozen the suit so N can never lead it|pg||
nt|othered1: What other lead beats it?  South wins @D and plays another @C before east can drive last @S, no?|pg||
nt|andyv:  now E can play the hand straight up|pg||
nt|mamos: 43 imps have changed hand son Boards 1-3 so -300 may be the flattest board yet|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: you can go down in 5@S|pg||
nt|ybob: defeat 5@S|pg||
nt|andyv:  7@c great contract except for 4-1 break|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: and still you can make |pg||
nt|othered1: very careful auction by west.  an immediate 6N, just quantitative, would appeal to many|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
pc|sK|nt|othered1: Nice pass by east, for play in @D, but 3N is there for the taking.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this is 2 off at least|pg||
nt|ybob: good lead|pg||
nt|rado: yes due unvaourable trump break|pg||
pc|c2|nt|andyv:  all 7@c requires is 1 @s ruff|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sharkey: in my book N hand a clear 1 NT opener|pg||
nt|lestergold: a trump lead would have been  reasonably murderous|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|othered1: It's good to have very tight agreements when  you embark on an auction like west's.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|nt|othered1: is 4N a sign-off?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: looks like RKCB|pg||
nt|othered1: coiuld be, or west could be cue-bidding in rank order.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|othered1: what, then, is 5@S?|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|othered1: playing K may mislead south|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think anything else beats it... I just don't understand leading from Jx of a minor when pd has opened a major.  Why not lead pd's suit?|pg||
nt|othered1: inspiration counts|pg||
nt|andyv:  it would also make me open suits that I don't want the lead because I know pd will never lead my suit:)|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't hate that lead at all.  South does have enough @H length that he might decide to try to attack elsewhre|pg||
nt|andyv:  would you hate the lead if the club honors were split?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: some talking about the bidding between W and S|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cQ|pc|c9|nt|sharkey: 4@H OR as well|pg||
nt|mamos: well not many points here but the contract looks a good one|pg||
nt|rado: facing 5th fit and heraing 4@C values + fit @D lead is logical|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|othered1: Pays your money, takes your choice, it says.|pg||
nt|andyv:  end result was disappointing (to the specs and us, that is)|pg||
nt|othered1: Wow, after the double, that @SJ promotes.  Wonder if west had alternatives to 6N?|pg||
nt|othered1: alternatives that would have continued the auction|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h8|pc|h6|pc|h9|pg||
nt|andyv:  just for partnership trust, I don't think N could ever pass 3@c|pg||

nt|othered1: 2 rounds of @D and claim|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|pc|h7|nt|andyv:  now he leads a @h?|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|andyv:  game set and match|pg||
nt|lestergold: two bad bids Andy|pg||
pc|hK|nt|othered1: But maybe north should have enouraged @C at trick 1, or if they play upside down signals south should have continued|pg||
nt|andyv:  J@c turned out to be a good lead... S had to follow thru|pg||
nt|othered1: did north discourage or did south ignore it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: N could have ducked @D to hand and then it would have been down 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: W went out|pg||
nt|othered1: Little old ladies at the club would have gotten there in 2 bids and wouldn't have put pressure on the partnership's confidence in their agreements|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lestergold: by north|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|pg||

nt|andyv:  too bad vul will keep S down|pg||
nt|mamos: do we now know what the original auction was ? it's been erased|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: so a big lead for the bulgarians after 4 deals|pg||
nt|othered1: Board 2, 7@H, was pushed.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  boards 4 and 5 should be swings|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|sharkey: slam coming up?|pg||
nt|andyv:  friendly hand for 6N by N|pg||
nt|sharkey: 11-13?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzym: the auction was the same but 2NT was explained as minors to N so he was not able to pass over 6@C|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|othered1: Should be is a bit strong for board 5.  It takes very fine methods to find the best 7@C contract.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: i doubt if vul opps are going to enterb this fray|pg||
nt|lestergold: and a spade contract will turn out to be a bit frayed a tthe edges here|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|andyv:  really?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: yes :) |pg||
nt|andyv:  one thing for sure...3N probably won't give declarer any problems|pg||
nt|sharkey: 19 and 5 card suit... hmmm|pg||
nt|andyv:  you may be right Carl..11-13... that's the only way you can explain the 3N bid|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder if redouble is just power or shows specific @S length, strength to be determined later.|pg||
nt|rado: this might end in 3NT|pg||
nt|othered1: very finemethods *and judgment*, I should say|pg||
nt|andyv:  i think they will find it... but then, I thought they would find it here:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: or 10-12 perhaps - you know Deyan?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|othered1: I'm not sure support doubles make sense after an overcall, losing preemption.|pg||

nt|rado: if 2@C was artifital ( max pass or similar) S missed a chanse for lead directing DBL|pg||

nt|star6ija: this is a typical example of "Partner, only me and not you know that 3N is more expensive than 2 or 1" from both sides of the table - invitation with 8 points and accepting with 15|pg||
nt|ybob: hand  with 50 hcp to E|pg||
nt|rado: some will open even 4@S at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|Walddk5: I am one of those|pg||
mb|1N|nt|othered1: 3N best, as independent of @S suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: This NS pair like to get in at the 1-level.  Some, if playing weak jump overcalls, might have bid 2@D on morth's hand.|pg||
nt|lestergold: wahtr about ending at 2C|pg||
nt|lestergold: easty might venture in |pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: 1N seem useless and gave west the free cue-bid|pg||
nt|ybob: I think they play jump overcall 12/16|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: 1st level bid shows 8-12 points|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: 2nd level 13-16|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: sry - cant help youDeyan:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  i don't understand N's pass|pg||
nt|othered1: Ok, makes sense and why I qualified my comment :)|pg||
nt|rado: 5@D down due to @S ruff, 5@s ok|pg||
nt|rado: most probably E will dbl|pg||
nt|andyv:  no appealing lead for S but still found the suit his pd wouldn't bid:)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: 2d meaning Andy?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|othered1: I like intermediate jumps, but not at this vulnerability.|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: he explained it is a "forcing bid. Nothing about @D"|pg||
nt|lestergold: checkback?|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||
nt|mamos: this time I have more sympathy with NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: I actually like the 3NT by N :) he has terrific 15|pg||
pc|cA|nt|othered1: Thanks, I've seen hand 13, which went by before I arrived.|pg||
nt|ybob: :9|pg||
nt|ybob: :)|pg||
nt|othered1: 6@D or 6N is simply on finesse|pg||
nt|ybob: better 500 to NS|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sharkey: in my book 1 NT rebid wud show 18-19 and Dbl the actual hand|pg||
pc|c3|nt|andyv:  if they play variable NT, this might have a different meaning for them|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - obviously|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3C looks makeable|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@d has to be some type of checkback, but 2@s looks like sign off|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|c7|nt|othered1: So, slam and no slam are both reasonable|pg||
nt|andyv:  6@d not even on a finesse|pg||
nt|othered1: really?|pg||
nt|andyv:  and 6@s can't make|pg||
pc|c6|nt|andyv:  but otherwise I agree..1N shows about 18-19|pg||
nt|andyv:  this has a chance now|pg||
nt|sharkey: N willing to push to 4@H here - to much when pd didnt superaccept I think|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|othered1: how do you make 6@D without finesse?|pg||
nt|andyv:  you are right...need the @c hook to dump the @s|pg||
nt|andyv:  early morning disease...stupidity|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: cant you discard your @C on hearts|pg||
nt|andyv:  but still have a @h and @s loser if you do that|pg||
nt|othered1: yes, then lose @HA and @S|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: I see|pg||
nt|andyv:  and there we have it|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N with qxx of dims somehat foolhardy|pg||
nt|rodal f: Squize at N now:)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|lestergold: defence can only cash first 7 triks|pg||
nt|andyv:  conceivable for EW to take the first 7 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: you can find results after 3rd round here -> http://bridge.bg/ranking163.html|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: dimaond lead guaranteed|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: is the 4 the right @D to lead ? |pg||
nt|lestergold: even if for any reason declarer was allowed to win this trick its cold off|pg||
pc|h8|nt|lestergold: I think so|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: cant you block the suit ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  i think 4@d is ok here|pg||
nt|andyv:  but J@d better|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes you can but doesnt matter with east havinmg an entry and if east hasnt an entry the contract would make|pg||
nt|andyv:  suit will block up period|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: I would have led the J or even the K probably|pg||
pc|d4|nt|othered1: This can put EW right back into the match, if OR pair takes the other side of the 50-50 shot.|pg||
nt|othered1: Or could lose a couple of imps if they play 6N|pg||
nt|andyv:  I'm trying to find the part of the auction which shows the @d fit has been found|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|andyv:  ugh|pg||
nt|lestergold: stuill only 8 tricks for declarer|pg||
pc|sT|nt|othered1: 6@D, choice of slams?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: I think 5@D might suggest @D game but not sure|pg||
nt|othered1: allowing a trick 1 claim|pg||
nt|andyv:  that sounds plausible|pg||
nt|rodal f: :(|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|andyv:  ugh|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: and I dont like this 4@H bid by N because still S can have only 3@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: there is possible endplay now|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: no there isnt sry|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: now E has no idea about the suit|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|nt|othered1: 5?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|andyv:  backward squeeze:)|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|othered1: Board 4 was a swing when NS played 2@H in OR, making and holding loss to 5 imps v. the EW 2@H here -300|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|nt|sharkey: but things happen...|pg||
nt|andyv:  E needs to learn patience on defense|pg||
nt|sharkey: easy game...|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: best now W to discard the K@D :) |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|d5|pg||
pc|h9|pc|d7|nt|mamos: but here North hopes that West has all the values in @D and that the NS hands will fit   I think this is a bit unlucky|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lestergold: east has to play pard for K three dims to beat it|pg||

nt|othered1: oh, that's what they did score|pg||
nt|othered1: brb|pg||
nt|andyv:  as severl specs pointed out, there is a @C/@s squeeze so, @c finesse wasn't necessary|pg||
nt|andyv:  but only if the 3 spades are with the club K|pg||
nt|lestergold: a shortage of what?|pg||
nt|andyv:  electrical:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  his mind shorted out|pg||

nt|lestergold: Andy you are trying hard to be polite straining at the seams Id say|pg||
nt|andyv:  See Ed...board 5 was a swing board:))|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  empathy, Mike... we've all been there and done things at the table that later on we have no idea what we were thinking about.|pg||
