nt|rado: natural action and normal lead in unbid suit|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|pc|dK|pg||
nt|rado: declarer must develop @H suit for 9 tricks|pg||
nt|ogoksel: Should duck club i guess|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Do we have a link to results, Stan and Rado?|pg||
nt|ritong: this is far from cold|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ritong: but declarer has a nice possible plan|pg||

nt|andyv:  ty Deyan for an outstanding job|pg||
nt|star6ija: and again possible swing|pg||
nt|star6ija: bravo, Dido :) nice job|pg||
nt|star6ija: and thanks to Andy and to all kibitzers for joining us|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: This is the last deal of this round. Tx all for watching and special thanks to the commentators. We'll be back in 14CET.Thats in 2 hours 20 min.|pg||
nt|andyv:  and ty Momchil (and Carl too).|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|ybob: 3NT = cold from E|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|ybob: from W @D leads can defeat|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|star6ija: hope to see you in 2 hours for next round of this very interesting competition |pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|andyv:  as a spec pointed out, 4H may be optimum contract|pg||
nt|othered1: but there's no reason for EW to know best positioning|pg||
nt|ybob: hard to humans not win 1º trick with K @D|pg||
nt|othered1: 3@D (4th suit still forcing?)|pg||
nt|star6ija: very nice comeback to Rossenovo team, who was 18 IMPs behind in first 2 boards|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|vugraphzym: looks very easy to make|pg||
nt|star6ija: this will probably end plus one and 11 IMPs Cernato are just to come|pg||
mb|4H|nt|star6ija: now even to overtricks are possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: 5@C may survive for a nice pick-up, but can they get there?|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|othered1: Need good partnership to handle shortness cue-bids in partner's known long suits.|pg||
nt|ybob: disagree with 4@S|pg||
nt|othered1: that's another way to put it :)|pg||
mb|5C|nt|othered1: That should end it firmly.|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|nt|star6ija: two|pg||
nt|andyv:  guess @hs right and as one spec points out, without @s lead, can make 6|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s7|nt|othered1: West doesn't see it my way, but without detailed system and style notes, it's hard to be sure where the rot set in|pg||
nt|ybob: i prefer bid 3@S over 3@C ...|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree with 3@S.  You bid 4th suit to set up forcing bid in @S, so why not bid hand out?|pg||
nt|ybob: where are extra cards from W ?|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@C bid, in casual partnerships, might have been seen as having strong preference and good support for @C that justified 4th suit auction.|pg||
nt|othered1: I personally think west had to respect the 5@C sign-off (if that'swhat it was.)  But he may be taking a shot against an expected @CAxxx in the east hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: This is the last board. Tx for all specs and kibtzs. We'll be back in 10 min for the last round of today|pg||
pc|s9|nt|othered1: West may think they aren't in a good position in this match.|pg||
nt|ybob: AXXX needs trump 2/2 in unbal hand sure, lost A @D ...|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|pc|c5|nt|star6ija: once again :) big thanks everybody for joining us - see you in 2 PM CET (2 hours since now)|pg||
nt|othered1: Onthe other hand, a round robin is very much like a single match of great length, so shooting to win this match may not be best overall strategy|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|nt|andyv:  W might have been worried about a 4-1 @h break|pg||
nt|andyv:  or was trying to get his name in the papers by smothering the 10x of @hs;)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|star6ija: yes and this was the proper way to avoid the danger if 4 were with S|pg||
pc|d6|nt|andyv:  good night all from Los Angeles|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: thanks all see you in 2 hours 10 min . |pg||
