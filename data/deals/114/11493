nt|vugraphzym: Hello all. There is a player missing so we'll be a little late|pg||

nt|vugraphzym: Hello, Mike|pg||
nt|star6ija: hello everybody :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Hello again|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: This is 1/2 final of the event|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: the other 1/2 final is : Varna vs Rosenovo|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hello Andy and Ed|pg||
nt|andyv:  Good morning Roland and Ed|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Andy!|pg||
nt|andyv:  first hand seems a simple 4@h |pg||
mb|1C!|an|Precision Club|nt|andyv:  good morning everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hello Mike, Momchil and Deyan|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|vugraphzym: Good morning, Andy|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Hello, Andy |pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Hello, Roland|pg||
nt|othered1: kThe prevfious match featured a number of very unusual auctions.  Wonder if it will continue here.|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Hello, Ed|pg||
mb|d!|an|5-7p|nt|vugraphzym: Hello, Roland |pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Hello, Star6i|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|vugraphzym: 2@H is 13-16 points 5+ @H|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Deyan:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  2N probably an inquiry as to type of 2@s raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: rehi, everyone!|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: rehi, Ed|pg||
nt|mamos: game for ew|pg||
nt|mamos: although North doesnt think so|pg||
mb|3S!|an|ask for stopper|nt|andyv:  Hi Deyan:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzym: that 3@D bid gives chance to EW to find the 5@D save|pg||
nt|andyv:  if NS find their game|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Roberto Mart√≠nez|pg||
nt|ybob: Hi all :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Hello, Roberto|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: although 4@S is a bit double dummy|pg||
nt|othered1: normal auction, so far, good suit in south making up for 1/2 point high card shortness|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think S hand worth more than an invite|pg||
mb|5C|nt|Walddk5: Welcome back to Rado Radev|pg||
nt|rado: hello:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Hello, Rado|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: Hi Deyan|pg||
nt|andyv:  they may be pushed into it... although it looks like NS are out of ammo|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@s looks too expensive now|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: he can make 4@S |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzym: has to play small @C to earn an entry|pg||
nt|andyv:  2N is a mp bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Hello Ed and Andy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and Deyan, our operator|pg||
nt|othered1: west reasonably passed over 1N.  Not sure if it was judgment or a systemic lack of an appropriate call (i.e., double has a conventional meaning)|pg||
nt|othered1: HI, Roland!|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Hi, Roland|pg||
nt|andyv:  good morning everyone|pg||
nt|andyv:  but N sees losing the first 3 tricks and still not sure where rest of tricks are coming from|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: good part score for EW|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: N can make 6@S and 4@C |pg||
pc|sK|nt|andyv:  as it turns out|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ybob: nice bid 3@S :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: looks like it can make|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't agree.  depends on actual 1N range and non-vul considerations aren't all that different from matchpoints.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|othered1: Hi, Andy!|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ybob: maybe lead @S defeat|pg||

nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|Walddk4: N-S  Romania    E-W  Bulgaria|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Stara Zagora is the organiser of the event.It is in Bulgaria. And the other team is from Buchurest (Romania)|pg||
nt|lestergold: thx Roland|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N looks playable for EW|pg||
nt|star6ija: nice distribution|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzym: EW are playing precision|pg||
nt|star6ija: 7@c is possible, but...|pg||
nt|mamos: grand certainly looks a possibility|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: he put 1NT and then changed it :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Dayan, do you know their NT opening ranges?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: I think it is 15-17|pg||
mb|1D!|an|11-15p, 1+!D|mb|p|nt|vugraphzym: 2@C should be @S and another suit|pg||
mb|1H|nt|rado: W has minimum neg dbl here|pg||
nt|othered1: this should go very quickly -- you have a 20-count and partner jump supports  you . . . |pg||
nt|andyv:  AQ10xx suit will almost always produce 4 tricks and 5 tricks a good portion of the time|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 3N by West probable diamond lead and no sweat|pg||
nt|andyv:  if 2N is invite, it is a heavy one|pg||
nt|andyv:  but, matter of style, I guess... I like being aggressive with those hands.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|star6ija: as Roberto pointed out the timing is very important in such boards - as we like to say in Bulgaria "1 second careless = dead for the rest of your life" :)|pg||
nt|rado: E has a choise rebiding weak @H, 3 cards 2@S or upgrading to 2NT protekting minor Kings|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good morning to Ed Shapiro|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|andyv:  wow....wonderful!!!|pg||
nt|andyv:  oops:)|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@S?  |pg||
nt|othered1: Fast arrival?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: 2NT should be invitational hand yes|pg||
nt|rado: hi Ed|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone, from chilly central Pennsylvania, USA|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Hi, Ed|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  good morning everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Good morning, Andy|pg||
nt|andyv:  E sequence usually reserved for hands that are just short of game forcing  bids|pg||
nt|lestergold: any lead except a club helps and no one is kicking off with the stiff club ace|pg||
nt|star6ija: this 2@s bid from S is not good option... in this vulnerability strong club has to be sa descriptive as quickly as possible|pg||
nt|mamos: have Ns agreed a suit?|pg||
nt|star6ija: @Ss? :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: I think 1@C is natural, star6i|pg||
nt|mamos: was 1@C strong or nat?|pg||
nt|star6ija: if so ok|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS sure have a lot of points on this hand|pg||
nt|othered1: Agree for playinig for 9 tricks.  But it's likely you'll be playing for 10 in @H with flat hand v. flat hand|pg||
nt|othered1: 7N is off the top and playing 7 elsewhere is just running risk|pg||
nt|andyv:  then bid 2@c and jump to 3N;)|pg||
nt|othered1: That's the auction you find in the post-mortem, but not at the table by either the players or commentators.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lestergold: even a spade lead sets up a spade trick for declarer|pg||
nt|andyv:  Ed, ever have hands where you just have too many bids?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: :)|pg||
nt|star6ija: theyare trying to strike back immediately|pg||
nt|othered1: very rarely, but in my partnerships (the few that remain) we define things very tightly.|pg||
nt|andyv:  the N hand would give me a headache here|pg||
nt|othered1: 5N?  2 keys, plus Q, plus void?|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like it|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|sharkey: Good morning|pg||
nt|andyv:  this auction will run out of steam quickly|pg||
nt|mamos: North thinks it's Hearts :)|pg||
nt|star6ija: 7@cs depends on some precautions which should've benn made by declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: it will be interesting if 6@H are bid wheather E will double :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Hello Andy and Carl|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Carl and roland|pg||
nt|ybob: down 2 AK @S low @C , later ruff @S|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@s would have set trump and asked for cue bids|pg||
nt|mamos: ugh|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: 7@S* looks the minimax|pg||
nt|mamos: well it makes but this has not been a good auction imho|pg||
nt|star6ija: 12 tricks are easy|pg||
nt|othered1: I like the 1@H response, to get a natural rebid from partner.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|andyv:  all roads lead to 9 tricks, Mike? :))|pg||
nt|othered1: second best spot, but safe here.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|andyv:  they got there.... good thing this isn'|pg||
nt|andyv:  isn't a BAM event:)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|andyv:  and Deyan:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: it didnt run out of steam that quickly :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  they decided to bring it to a boil:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - this auction not for the faint hearted...|pg||
nt|andyv:  so, the question is why E didn't simply open 4@s if that was what he was intending to bid all the time?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well ironically a club lead and declarer has to do abit of guesswork|pg||
nt|andyv:  probably no over tricks|pg||
nt|rado: lack of communications between NS will help declare for 8 tricks|pg||
nt|othered1: this will claim as soon as both follow to one trump|pg||
pc|h2|nt|andyv:  this can go down 500 easily|pg||
nt|ybob: 4/2 @S shows even and interest @C|pg||
nt|star6ija: but @d now will bring the contract home|pg||
nt|othered1: Right -- a hand worth 2@C in playing strength but with inadequate high cards for the call.|pg||
nt|othered1: maybe even 9|pg||
nt|rado: sure with @S suit favourable|pg||
pc|h6|nt|othered1: I thought that was standard, but east's action here is what I see regularly at the table.  Times changed, I guess.|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sharkey: set before they get started|pg||
nt|andyv:  a pretty steep price to pay to protect against a partial|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|hA|pg||
pc|d5|nt|andyv:  I don't think so Ed.|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: N had played 2@D on the A of spade so he was obliged to play it|pg||
nt|lestergold: well no he doesnt of course because then there has to be a switch!!|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||

nt|star6ija: nicely done|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|vugraphzym: the lead was very good as well|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, well done|pg||
nt|sharkey: otherwise probably just off 1|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|pg||
nt|andyv:  not too bad of play:)|pg||
