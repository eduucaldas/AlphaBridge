mb|4C|mb|p|nt|mariner1: maybe 4@C is a closing relay|pg||

nt|sybarra: hello all and welcome back |pg||
nt|vugraphzyc: hi|pg||
nt|rnmalik: hi Shirley and all|pg||
nt|vugraphzyc: Hi :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi all and welcome to the Closed Room for the 8-board Segment 5 of this Semifinal of the Vinoble Cup.|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|sybarra: Hi Rashed |pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @S for e/w |pg||
nt|sybarra: most likely |pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello again! Let us hope for interesting boards. 18 IMPs are not so much|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: 4@S here N/S -- only issue avoiding slam.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hi Jordan!|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 5@D would not be bad contract for NS|pg||
nt|sybarra: and how many @D's does bid now to get there?|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: The alert of 2@S seems a little strange|pg||
nt|vugraphzyc: 2@S 7+ 11- thats why the alert|pg||
nt|sybarra: if playing 2/1,  no need to go jumping around |pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @C was already the game force |pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi, Ralf.  Great to be with you again.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: not sure I like the 2 @S bid,   for me it promises 4 @S |pg||
nt|sybarra: its style,  but I dont raise with 3 spades |pg||
nt|sybarra: Iverson had a 27-0 set on the last set |pg||
nt|rnmalik: true not me either. I would rather bid 3@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: but they may not be playing 2/1, and hopefully this is forcing?  |pg||
nt|ralfwil: Thanks, I have the same feeling|pg||
nt|jcwla: Some play that this second-round jump to game shows a "picture bid": no ace, king, singleton, void in clubs or diamonds (having bid hearts and spades).|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|cuttysark: Some difficulty in reaching dummy for the club finesse|pg||
nt|sybarra: I can bid 1 nt with N hand over 1 sp |pg||
pc|h5|nt|jcwla: Others might not use it in this auction.  When it does come up, however, it's very useful.  Allows opener with a good hand but a missing control to stop on a dime.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|cuttysark: (Thank you for the information, Thorvald)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sybarra: chased them into better spot |pg||
nt|rnmalik: with 5@D prefer 2 or 3 @Ds|pg||
nt|sybarra: my rebid of a minor suggests a 6 card suit |pg||
nt|sybarra: so doubt I would rebid that suit |pg||
nt|sybarra: but |pg||
nt|rnmalik: The declarer has to play the K@S to make the hand-DBL by W of 4@S showed shortness|pg||
nt|sybarra: wtih the 2 hts bid in the middle,  (which I was not seeing)  I rebid 3 @D |pg||
pc|h7|pc|d6|nt|rnmalik: interesting hand to play|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|cuttysark: Welcome back everybody|pg||
nt|cuttysark: looks as if EW play transfer responses to 1@C|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome back Liz and Hans|pg||
nt|Walddk5: and to Thorvald, our operator|pg||
nt|haans: ty|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with that lead N has to take 3 rounds of @h|pg||
pc|h8|nt|cuttysark: He has to cash @DA, then play @SA and another to endplay West - not sure even that is enough|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good morning everyone and welcome to headquarters of the Danish Bridge Federation for the annual VINOBLE Cup. Semi-finals, six segments of eight boards|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good morning Liz and Thorvald|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @H's cue |pg||
nt|sybarra: and we are over board |pg||
pc|dJ|pc|h6|pg||

pc|c5|nt|cuttysark: Nice to hear from you Roland - have you visited all the other rooms?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Indeed I have|pg||
nt|sybarra: a bit unlucky.....spade break bad, and off, and k of clubs off |pg||
nt|sybarra: well if it was "unserious"  would the rebid be 4 @S? |pg||
nt|vugraphzyc: 4@s = no interest in slam|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure E should be interested really....but then really just needs good spade coveer cards by pard |pg||
nt|sybarra: not so out of the question given the bidding |pg||
nt|sybarra: we have seen in previous sets, East take some time playing a hand |pg||

mb|1C|nt|mariner1: interesting spot here for EW,,,, we do not have the bidding or play though|pg||

nt|rnmalik: Good Morning every one|pg||
nt|cuttysark: And then the elimination and endplay - maybe if North has shifted to a spade earlier...|pg||
nt|haans: i see 4@H by EW?|pg||
nt|sybarra: W may regret that X |pg||
nt|rnmalik: positively|pg||
nt|sybarra: easy to see how both tables got overboard on an unlucky hand  |pg||
mb|1C|nt|jcwla: Could be a @C/@D battle.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rnmalik: 4@H or 3NT EW|pg||

nt|cuttysark: You have a crystal ball?|pg||

mb|3N|nt|sybarra: close match we have here |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: Iverson in second set came from behind  with a 27-0 set   to bring it close |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|gambit: and guess what?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|cuttysark: Combined 25 count, but does not look as if this will play very well either|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Too many losers for this contract, over board I think|pg||
nt|cuttysark: He will go after diamonds, but they do not lie well from his point of view|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Strong indicaion that East does not have a spade to lead|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Happens to the best of us, Thorwald|pg||
nt|sybarra: "we should bid these slams"   not sure that is clear |pg||
mb|1C|mb|1D|nt|cuttysark: The Open Room started with boards 7&8, so no comparisons for a while|pg||
nt|cuttysark: East-West's turn for some cards - and their game is going to make|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@H EW looks alright but can they bid it|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Bidding test for NS - can they reach 7@D?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Slam for NS but what you call it Roland slam:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes think it is for Roland |pg||
nt|daman: EW should end up in a passive 2@S or 1NT|pg||
nt|gambit: wel all, exciting hands and close match that probably just got closer (no result yet from open room) |pg||
nt|jcwla: Given how little room a 1@D overcall takes up, I think it should either be a better hand or better suit than this.  However, will catch pd with a good @D holding.|pg||
mb|d|mb|1H|nt|haans: i say that opps bidding make it easier|pg||
mb|2C|nt|sybarra: bd 9 (hand before)  e/w had many more points but bad breaks they went down |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: may try junk stayman here|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|ralfwil: After D from P i prefer to show my @s even if I have a 7-card @c suit, But perhaps next round...|pg||
nt|gambit: West won't be able to pass fast enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: ?????|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Q@H makes it possible for 3NT also|pg||
nt|haans: eureka|pg||
nt|sybarra: actually might be too good for Roland |pg||
nt|rnmalik: why not 3 @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder |pg||
nt|sybarra: 3  is better than 4 |pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: making 6 now |pg||
pc|cK|nt|jcwla: North is the only one who cannot be faulted here.  South needed to show the @S's -- 2@C should deny four @S's.  Meanwhile, East might have put the pressure on right away, but ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: better late than pregnant.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|cuttysark: good hand for Blackwood|pg||
nt|vugraphzyc: 5@S and often 4@H|pg||
pc|cA|nt|cuttysark: Yes - @SK in dummy means declarer can hold up, may well play hearts from the top since he does not care if North gets on lead|pg||

pc|c4|nt|cuttysark: Thank you John :)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|daman: what if south held K109xx  Kx  Q9   K109x   would it be a good contract?  |pg||
nt|daman: by Roland's standards it would because it might be a shade above 12%|pg||
pc|h7|nt|rnmalik: a @S and a @H|pg||
nt|daman: but the luck of the @H position and the 2-2 @C break will bring it home|pg||
pc|c2|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||

nt|jcwla: A fairly remarkable push in 3NT+4 on Board 2.  Neither N led from AQT9xxx of @D's and Bank in the OR never mentioned them.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|gambit: somehow I don't expect this result to be duplicated in the other room (that is a remarkable push) |pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|nt|daman: good try|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|jcwla: This is a good auction by all.  South's double of 1@H is based, besides general strength, on partner's takeout double of @D's.  If North were short in @H's, would not sit for the ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: penalty double.  The 1@D suit of the overcaller had better texture than the previous 1@D O/C and West reasonably tried for a better strain.|pg||

nt|rnmalik: AK@C=7@C|pg||
nt|daman: the Law should prevail here|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|granguru: EW can make 4@S depending on the @C guess|pg||
nt|sybarra: that should be a reachable slam at the other table also |pg||
mb|2D|an|one major|nt|cuttysark: Might not need it - a club goes on the 4th heart|pg||
nt|daman: I do not see NS venturing beyond 3@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|granguru: a 35% game I would guess|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: hrrrrmmmm|pg||
nt|sybarra: well.......|pg||
nt|daman: with a magical view in trumps he might bring this home|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: S needs the rabbi.....|pg||
nt|sybarra: rabbi rule:  play ace when K is singleton offside |pg||
pc|s6|nt|cuttysark: A Mixed Raise - 4 card support, scattered values - but this looks a little strong so perhaps it means something else|pg||
nt|granguru: right Liz..thanks..5 am here :)|pg||
nt|haans: 1@S must be forcing?|pg||
nt|gambit: game try if hearts is the suit |pg||
nt|ralfwil: four boards to go and 2 not counted. There still is a chance for Iversen|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: not an easy hand to bid |pg||
nt|jcwla: Not to mention another 8-board segment.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|cuttysark: Not necessarily  -  partner only passes if very weak|pg||
nt|sybarra: 7 nt also makes |pg||
nt|sybarra: with ak of @C |pg||
nt|rnmalik: the key is the play of AK@C|pg||
nt|daman: or maybe not magical after all    he might just attenpt a 2-2 split and hope the @Cs come home|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|daman: great switch|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|dK|nt|cuttysark: Or, of course, South may lead clubs... I hate leading doubletons :)|pg||
nt|daman: but may give a lue to where the @H King lies|pg||
nt|daman: clue*|pg||
nt|sybarra: was just going to ask that question |pg||
nt|sybarra: did declarer get a hint?|pg||
nt|daman: some people just have intuition   Meckstroth is one and it works very well for him|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|jcwla: A little birdie told me 7 and 8 were action boards, so don't go anywhere.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|granguru: The lead helps a lot for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 3NT by South would be in some peril on a heart lead, but West cannot lead hearts to advantage - the suit gets blocked|pg||
pc|h7|nt|rnmalik: 0 or 3, is it|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s3|pc|sT|pg||

pc|h8|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|cuttysark: However, declarer does not know that, and has a choice of lines|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|c2|nt|haans: i prefer spade to clubs|pg||
nt|cuttysark: depends who has @SA :)|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s9|pg||
nt|haans: enter in clubs to play low spade?|pg||
nt|jcwla: 8 in to Iversen on 3 -- they got to 4@S making, where E/W here stole it in 3@D-1.|pg||

nt|rnmalik: claim pl|pg||

pc|d5|pg||
pc|s7|pc|h6|pc|c6|nt|haans: feels safer :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyc: lead 3rd and 5th|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Ah - now that makes a differnece: East cannot have 5 hearts and West has discarded a couple|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Unless East has made a nasty psychic lead - or could he have 6 hearts?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: if he does West has none left, so the spades definitely have it|pg||
nt|haans: if A-6 hearts passed it twice|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Wonder what he is thinking about? cannot cross to dummy to finesse clubs any more|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and N didn´t try to win any @c tricks?|pg||

mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Board 2 provided another swing to Iversen - it was a bit of a deathtrap and Blakset went down in both rooms|pg||
nt|ralfwil: board 3a swe expected!|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|haans: not good @H stopper|pg||
nt|daman: they bid the @C slam in the OR|pg||
nt|jcwla: None of Roland's 20/20 boards yet, but plenty for those who like 21/19.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|haans: to be played by N|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and no Roland slams :)|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Very few losers in spades|pg||
nt|granguru: W is being conservative on not biding 2@D as there is a potential misfit...|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: This looks like a make also|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Better played by North, but a hold-up will see him through|pg||
nt|haans: he need trick 9|pg||
nt|daman: 1NT will be the final contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: 6@C somehow managed to be defeaated in the OR|pg||

nt|daman: 12 toppers   a real compression|pg||
nt|gambit: damn things, should spel-chek-thenselv..:)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jcwla: S's gamble paid off.  If N had some @C's instead of @D's, even the delayed 2@D could be in a world of hurt w/S's ugly ! holding.|pg||
nt|jcwla: @H holding that is.|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Defecen should manage to give declarer a spade guess, but he will get it right on the biddinh, maybe|pg||
nt|sybarra: if they play constructive raises,  then East's hand is not good enough |pg||
nt|daman: I think  5@S  or 5NT was the better bids|pg||

mb|3S|nt|cuttysark: same auction as in the Open Room so far - good push by East|pg||
nt|granguru: who is defending here?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyc: but very few tricks in the 5@C contract|pg||
nt|haans: that did kill S hearts interest i think?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Always the way when you have a promising hand in 4th seat - everybody is bidding their socks off|pg||
nt|sybarra: true Liz |pg||
nt|rnmalik: last board of this segment.|pg||
nt|sybarra: that works  |pg||
nt|sybarra: but I dont like the X |pg||

nt|sybarra: you hate to pass your pard's overcall but with no fit :(  better part of valor|pg||

nt|daman: unless he is certain @S shows a a void|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure what N can do but bid 5 @H |pg||
nt|daman: 6@H by North would be very presumptuous|pg||
mb|4H|nt|cuttysark: He should win ace and play a low diamond?|pg||

mb|5H|nt|dburn: ...it's going to be hard for the defence to work out just how good it is|pg||

pc|sK|nt|dburn: still, I guess North might shift to a diamond anyway|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Aha - distributional information! Now heart finesse, take pitch, diamond up |pg||
pc|cK|nt|haans: the sputnik double tends to tell = 20-20 between us|pg||
nt|sybarra: S likely to get stuffed in I think |pg||
nt|sybarra: might be some relief in seeing the spade void |pg||

pc|d3|pc|d5|nt|sybarra: I do not see a way to make it now |pg||
nt|rnmalik: -1|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good defence|pg||
nt|dburn: there isn't one, but East is more relcutant than we are to come to that conslusion|pg||
nt|sybarra: as spec points out, ONLY CHANCE J109@c|pg||
nt|dburn: well, or a heart-club squeeze|pg||
nt|rnmalik: we know it is not there|pg||
nt|dburn: which would work if South had @hQ and any four clubs|pg||
nt|rnmalik: the key cards in different hands. Lets convince E:)|pg||
nt|dburn: I guess East is weighing up the chance of the squeeze against the chance that North has @hQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: or we are losing connection |pg||
nt|vugraphzyc: ur not|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure, but South's lead might have been from 42 doubleton - I don't know if the North-South pair lead low from two small|pg||
nt|dburn: so declarer has a genuine problem, and it is not surprising that he is taking his time|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
nt|daman: this hand is ovah|pg||
pc|d9|nt|dburn: well, he made his decision - I confess, I would have gone the other way, and gone down just the same|pg||
