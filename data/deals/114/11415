nt|yo_yo: yes when partner opens and you have a 20 count , it's got to be a slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzyj: We are in Solihull, Warwickshire, right in the middle of England.|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|athene: ok :)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: i suppose if west held just the @H10 that would make 6@H a lot better|pg||
nt|athene: but 6nt is still far superior|pg||
nt|vugraphzyj: Playing for international selection|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's Ant getting excited :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: wow, that is one light double from east|pg||
nt|marlowepi: doubl?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not too often you see a TO X second in hand with one jack outside the suit that was opened|pg||
mb|5H|nt|athene: now west belongs to the "always bid 4@S over 4@H" school|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|pc|c4|nt|marlowepi: this just isnt possible|pg||
nt|athene: if EW have agreed to bid 4@S very aggressively in these positions, 5@S is just indefensible|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|pg||
nt|athene: well it's probably insane even without discussins|pg||
nt|athene: discussions|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 5@S does seem a bit odd looking at A & K of @H|pg||
pc|d9|nt|marlowepi: i guess he didnt like his defense against 5H|pg||
nt|athene: do you really think 5@H is making? do you really think 5@S is making?|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|athene: "no" and "no" look to be pretty clearcut to me|pg||

nt|marlowepi: or 4|pg||
nt|athene: four words :) yes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: are they affected by the last result I wonder|pg||
mc|9|nt|athene: i suppose even if you expect both 5-level contracts to be 1 down most of the time, you might have a case for bidding on at imps to guard against the big swing, but it just looks ...|pg||
nt|athene: wrong with that hand|pg||

nt|athene: -300 instead of +300|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|athene: that's a hefty premium for your "insurance"|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he maybe wishes he was back in Norway|pg||

nt|marlowepi: norway|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sA|pc|sT|nt|athene: it makes no sense for east to pass 3@D on this auction if it's non-forcing, surely|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h6|pg||

mb|1S|mb|d|mb|r|nt|roswolf: going down in 1nt was unexpected on this layout|pg||
mb|3D|mb|3S|nt|lestergold: the key situation here is whether derek can pick two tricks form hearts|pg||
nt|roswolf: south has an unattractive choice|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1nt maybe?|pg||
nt|lestergold: South has very little and not in one of North's suits|pg||
nt|lestergold: and they are vulnerable|pg||
nt|lestergold: scope for getting into trouble here|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: Mike Gold here popping in to see what the chip off the old block is up to|pg||
nt|mmmakela: Hi all and welcome!|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lestergold: and Waterlow simply bidding the lower ranking of his two three carders|pg||
nt|roswolf: the axe falls|pg||
nt|lestergold: what else can he do?|pg||
nt|lestergold: pity Waterlow was not able to bid 1N he doesnt know about North'sspade holding |pg||
nt|lestergold: Hacket has no real reason here to bid over tyhis double|pg||
nt|lestergold: well most say that he is the old block himself now was 30 the other day|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: three tricks available in clubs in theory if the entries were available|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: true but he knows his fate!?|pg||
nt|lestergold: another Tank Waterlow knows they are in serious trouble|pg||
nt|roswolf: south must take his medicine|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: and does|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: and it will be a large does if Hirst kicks off with trumps|pg||
nt|lestergold: dose|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: not clear for 7 tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes not the best lead i think|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks -2|pg||
nt|dburn: odd, that - no real reason for Jones to raise to game|pg||
nt|lestergold: Today Dabid Gold is playinmg with his occasional partner David Bakshi hisn reguilar pard Townsend is in Poland on paternity leave|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|nt|roswolf: well -1 now i think on normal play - but why spurn the club finesse?|pg||
nt|lestergold: when the 9H appears Derek will have sonmething to think about onm the second round of that suit|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h9|pg||
nt|dburn: and might have tried 3NT if he was going to bid game in any case|pg||
nt|lestergold: a lo of davids around here|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: two playing and one commentating|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|pc|c8|pg||
nt|lestergold: adn good bye 4S|pg||
nt|lestergold: David Gold at unfavourable vulnerability not shy to make life awkward for his oppos|pg||
nt|mmmakela: the good thing for EW is that 3 @S was already too high|pg||
nt|dburn: well, 4@s had not really been in the room long enough to receive a welcome - no one will notice its departure|pg||
nt|lestergold: not to mention aggressive actrion by the other David|pg||
nt|lestergold: well it wont depart unkless Bakhsgi plays a diamond now|pg||
nt|dburn: or a club, perhaps|pg||
nt|lestergold: or i suppose a club will do for two off|pg||
nt|lestergold: thats what hes tanking abiout i dont think hes likelyto take the risk but he has seen david gold's suit pref|pg||
nt|dburn: anything else would be vaguely quixotic, but he has to think - does partner have a stiff club, or @dA?|pg||
nt|lestergold: adn as he has both he cant really go wrong|pg||
nt|dburn: as it happens, partner has both, but|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|nt|ady: seems just 6 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: specs are quesioning Hackett's original ouble- Hacket has a good 14 count with the other tqo suits and he has a couple of aces- no i would not think his bid was unreasonable just ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: very unlucky here|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: well played |pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|roswolf: well now this is close but should now be -1|pg||
nt|lestergold: always easily to criticies players for stricking out thei necks at unfavourable vulnerability but if you do not bid you also can come a cropper|pg||
nt|roswolf: certainly north's style is to bid as often as possible|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: Hackett cannot be certain that E/W are not stealing the hand- many times whenyou hear this bidding and your side is cold for 4H|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lestergold: lack of entries to manufacture more than 2 club tricks|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: of course playing the jH from =dummy was unfortunate on this layout|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
mc|8|nt|lestergold: On eof Gold's strengths his carding is so accurate|pg||
nt|lestergold: and reliable|pg||
nt|dburn: the club is more sadistic - when Rosen saw it, he must have thought he was going to make|pg||
pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|athene: 2@D 2-way checkback i assume (game-force)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyj: Running scores (right up-to-date)|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|vugraphzyj: Crouch  +93  Dhondy|pg||
nt|athene: simply 4@S over 1NT looks more practical and was chosen in the other room|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|athene: surely east can't imagine he has a slam on?|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|vugraphzyj: Howard  +47 Small|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after what we have seen, i dont think we can start setneces that way|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzyj: Hassett +35  Hackett|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is there a link Ant? |pg||
nt|vugraphzyj: No - I just got it off the Bridgemates|pg||
nt|athene: a spec suggests that east was more worried about a singleton spade opposite, when 3nt might be right|pg||
pc|d2|nt|marlowepi: usually a singleton means 3N is much LESS likely to be right|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|pc|dA|pg||

pc|sT|pc|s5|pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||

pc|h3|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: but that might not be the case here|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|nt|athene: east has enough stuff you might make 3nt without the spades|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|pc|h4|pc|dT|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|c2|pc|h5|nt|marlowepi: the point is that if you cant count on the spades you may well have no game of any kind|pg||

nt|lestergold: he is very pip conscious and expects the same forom partners|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|lestergold: well here there is a more hopeful 4S ciontract on for Rosen|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: hts and clubs|pg||
mb|1S|nt|yo_yo: support x   shows 3@H maybe?|pg||
nt|lestergold: N/S can easily go minus here|pg||
nt|roswolf: support double - probably not|pg||
nt|lestergold: 12 on top|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|ady: did well to keep low in OR    2@H  on 4-3 fit plays ok|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2H does not look like automatic make here|pg||
nt|roswolf: so far identical auctions|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so they dont play support x  obviously,  x shows strong hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup kath|pg||
nt|lestergold: Heather will not eant to encourage anything here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i am an advocate of the support X   but not all my partners share my enthusiasm|pg||
nt|roswolf: for a vul overcall the west hand is yuk |pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N happens to be frigid too|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|roswolf: east probably thinking|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: SILLY DOUBLE BY EAST |pg||
nt|lestergold: Hackett must know he has a slam going hand because of the identified short spade in south's hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s will diagnose the 30 point pack|pg||
nt|lestergold: on the other hand Waterlow has not exatly bid the full value of his hand here|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think 3h could have been bid with a much weaker hand unless they are playing lebensohl|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: and will make most likely 12 tricks|pg||
pc|h2|nt|roswolf: 3@H?|pg||
nt|lestergold: yep Richard has understandably mad a try here sadly at least one level too high now|pg||
nt|mmmakela: or not.....|pg||
pc|h3|nt|yo_yo: Fleet now shows his support at the 3 level, that's the price he pays|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|roswolf: TOO AGGRESSIVE IMO|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hackett is not messing around|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h9|nt|lestergold: E/W having done their best to keep Hacket informed about the spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: not so lever really|pg||
nt|roswolf: educated punt|pg||
nt|lestergold: clever really|pg||
nt|lestergold: not against a player with Hackett's judgement|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|lestergold: having doubled on the previous round 3H was very risky only having 3 card support and not really necessary|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|roswolf: why 3@H if dbl=good hand?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: lets face it, he has a very good hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: The layout here makes even 2H likely to have needed helop from teh defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: O(f course Waterlow a stady expert player but very much the anchor man in this partnership leaves the flair stuff to Hackett|pg||
pc|h4|nt|dburn: fourth highest of longest and strongest - never fails|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lestergold: so we have here avery likely swing in the pipeline|pg||
nt|roswolf: flair - hm|pg||
nt|roswolf: sometimes daylight robbery!|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d5|pg||
nt|lestergold: I know Gold would sooner lead away from an unsupported ace than an unsupported K|pg||
nt|mmmakela: would earn a lot of matchpoints that lead|pg||

pc|sT|nt|lestergold: Heathe rhoping for the ed suits to both break but saly neither do|pg||

nt|marlowepi: here is a GOOD hand for W where he might open 1C and rebid 1NT:   T   AQ9   KJ9x   K9xxx, and game is pretty dicey|pg||
nt|athene: south had a very offensively-oriented hand for the responsive X in the other room|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|athene: i think with that shape, most people would just bid 4@H (choice of games) after 2@H X 3@H?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well i have an understanding that to rebid NT shows a doubleton|pg||
mb|3N|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: i don't want partner to pass with a defensive t/o double|pg||

nt|lestergold: part scores only here|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|roswolf: hmm a chance for Dhondy|pg||
mb|d|mb|3H|nt|lestergold: well partner made a free heart bid and all Hackett has done basically is to play his partner for the qH and either a spade void or the lub Ace|pg||
nt|lestergold: hard for N/S to compete and stay low here|pg||
mb|d!|mb|p|nt|lestergold: another opportunity for a swing this time in favour of Dhondy|pg||
nt|ady: 5@C     makes      4@S   good contract   but bad trump split|pg||
nt|lestergold: and maybe a little help in diamonds or som more clubs as was thec case here|pg||
nt|lestergold: Bakshi will try 3s  no doubt|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - this is not a good start for North-South|pg||
nt|dburn: no, he won't|pg||
nt|lestergold: no hesc passed buck backwards|pg||
nt|dburn: double did not show spades, just a decent weak no trump|pg||
nt|lestergold: Gold may well float this with 3 bullets and no clear game bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: he also knows that WEaterlow is a cautious bidder|pg||
nt|lestergold: very solid player Mr. Waterlow|pg||
nt|dburn: North should probably pass, but that's easier said than done|pg||
nt|lestergold: welll that is judgement on a pin head phew anyone wouldthink this was mps!|pg||
nt|dburn: but now, it is easier done than said|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: Gold is a courageous player knows that passing has more upside than struggling on with such a g=heavily defensive hand but opoor offensive holding|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|roswolf: 5@C is the spot|pg||
nt|lestergold: no can their natural bidding teer them into the making 5C|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: probably under instructions from Hackett to bid conservatively|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|pg||
nt|lestergold: well Heather casnnot now bid 3N|pg||
nt|lestergold: and look at this trump lead|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c5|nt|vugraphzsg: crouch asks how many spades Heather could have|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm 4S is better spot than 3N but the 5/1 beak|pg||
nt|roswolf: Waterlow is his own man but i agree he is a solid conservative citizen as far as bridge is concerned|pg||
nt|lestergold: in danger of going for 500|pg||
nt|dburn: I am looking at it, but I cannot see what effect it will have|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: well Rosen can set up club to get rid of dim loser as  alternative to ruffing in hand but the defence has put him under a bit of pressure|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|lestergold: and tapped immediately|pg||
nt|ady: routine contract on reasonable spade split    |pg||
nt|lestergold: its gonna be very hard no to suc cumb to two further tricks in the trump suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: Ive known him for 40 years and i have a lot of respect for his game|pg||
nt|lestergold: and indeed for him|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||

pc|s8|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ady: can discard on 3rd hearft|pg||

nt|lestergold: so no great wing here |pg||
nt|yo_yo: I bet 3NT by South would have made|pg||
nt|lestergold: playing in the 4/3 fit should have rewarded them after all contract is figid on a 4/2 spade break|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup but surely unbiddable|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|pc|d2|pc|c6|pg||

nt|yo_yo: just close your eyes and bid 3NT after 3@C?|pg||

nt|lestergold: and as for Hackett maybe the Arthur Daley of bridge but a damn good player and nice liekable chap|pg||
mc|8|nt|roswolf: looks -2 for 3 imps to crouch|pg||
nt|lestergold: why should they punt 3N when they can explore for the best contract accurately|pg||
nt|roswolf: agree mike|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ok 3@D - 3@S - 3NT?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Now up to Crouch to lead A@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: biding omp will rewars them for playing in eiher 4s or 5c and penalise them for the lazy 3n punt|pg||
nt|lestergold: so the trump lead made it possible to get two off but Bakhshi didntfolow it up|pg||

nt|lestergold: hm swing possibilities here|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: ah I was just pondering that Ant :)|pg||
nt|dburn: given the methods in use, a heart lead was more or less normal|pg||
mb|2D|mb|d|nt|dburn: now, I say nothing about the methods in use - very fine methods they are, no doubt|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lestergold: he will try and Hassett will acceopt|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: If Richard keps his bidding boots on - this time he can amke game|pg||
nt|roswolf: if he invites east will accept|pg||
nt|lestergold: Im not convinced he knows that cklubs were natural that gold has shown a suit oriented hand and is strong why not lead his suit|pg||
nt|dburn: but the game was perhaps a little easier when if you had clubs, you could show them by bidding clubs|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|lestergold: and he will noww|pg||
nt|roswolf: well the moment of truth|pg||
mb|3D|nt|lestergold: but Gold has denied a no trumpish hand here|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|ady: heart game can be made     |pg||
nt|lestergold: hm how ironic this time his pard makes two take out doubles and having had his fingers burned Richard goes chicken .... att he wrong time....|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: since south could have a yarborough surely he has the values for game!?|pg||
nt|lestergold: so his club isnt likely to be prepared|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, 2NT was also close to unspeakable - if Jones had bid 4@s like a normal person, no one could have shown clubs at all|pg||
nt|lestergold: he could have 18/19 balanced i suppose thats notout of the quesion but then what are e./w bidding on vulnerable?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lestergold: sorry they werent vilnerable|pg||
nt|lestergold: but still what were they bidding game on?|pg||
nt|lestergold: but there was room for doubt about the lead i conce3de|pg||
pc|h6|nt|roswolf: i think a clear error|pg||
nt|lestergold: he is boringly flat and his q spade is worthless|pg||
nt|roswolf: in both rooms|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Neither North nor South know how strong the other one is  - very difficult|pg||
nt|lestergold: but he still has an 8 count opposite an announced strong hand|pg||
nt|ady: game is against the odds  K@H more likely to be wrong |pg||
nt|yo_yo: I have been there a million times myself|pg||
nt|roswolf: precisely mike 2 of his points are useless and they still make game|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|lestergold: heathe rof course is just about minimum for the second takeout|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lestergold: three rounds of diamonds will prouce 2 dims and a tump trick by force but thereafter Hasset cant  really go wrong|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: on another occasion i think Richard would have bid 4H but hes been so unlucky with his bidding in this session that he has decided to go onservative|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: if he is shortned in hand he will not be able to afford the ruffing fibnesse in clubs|pg||

pc|s2|nt|roswolf: you must be consistent|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s4|nt|ady: I wonder if they play sort of leb  where 3@H shows some values   2NT would show weak hand  - but even then Heather my consider her hand minimum after previous action|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|lestergold: well ER/e go plus thats the important thing on these part score eals|pg||
nt|lestergold: E/W|pg||

mc|7|nt|Walddk7: Commentators are kindly requested to use surnames. All specs do not know Heather, Derek, Richard and Peter|pg||

nt|lestergold: danger now is losing to the qs and losing a heart ruff too|pg||
nt|roswolf: playinf the trump works i think|pg||
nt|lestergold: double dummy he certainly can make with double heart finesse however sine dummy he has problems|pg||
nt|lestergold: single dummy i meant to type|pg||
nt|roswolf: the slam was not bid in the other room|pg||
nt|lestergold: but he can get at the seven tricks he needs of course|pg||

pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|h8|pc|h6|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: as well as catering for stiff @HK or something opposite|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: well n?S could get too high here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: nice double fit  with good clubs on the side    6@D  best as in OR|pg||
nt|lestergold: easy 4H here|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|lestergold: slam certainly off in spades and looks awkward in hearts but possible as cards lie|pg||
nt|dburn: and that 4@h opening is... well, it might miss a slam opposite some very routine passes|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5D if allowed to play only two off but unreacheable vul after the preempt likely to be flat this board|pg||
nt|lestergold: quite heavy for a 4H opener isnt it- more like a texas stule 4 bid|pg||
nt|dburn: still, I guess you'd rather deal with 4@h - 4@s - pass - pass (when you have a clear double) than with 1@h - 4@s - pass - pass, when you have a headache|pg||
nt|lestergold: i meanhad east held Kc instead of q slam would have been a goodm prop|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|lestergold: not completely automatic to bid its a 30 point pack with the lack of duplication in hearts|pg||

pc|cK|pc|cT|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|nt|lestergold: and here is another likely game to be bid which has litle hope against the 4/1 trump brwk|pg||
nt|lestergold: but this time pessimism has paid off!|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|lestergold: actually Hasset has judged well not to cue his hearts beause he has no aces|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed but the adrenaline rush sometimes makes you do it|pg||
nt|lestergold: slam actually makes as cards lie it makes by an unusual means|pg||
nt|roswolf: but neverthess well done to e/w to reach a sensible contract|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: Peter has devalued his spade holding because of hearther's somewhat dubious noise here|pg||
nt|ady:  how doestheir relay system allows them to stop so low with 25 hcp and major suit fit?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes the strong no- trumpers might bid it 1NT - 3NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: its amazing how players always feel when not vul that thye have to get their pesky 5 card spade suits in however useless teh suigt and however useless the hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: rudd high he will|pg||
nt|dburn: ah well - someone at least led a club in case his partner had them despite having bid them|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: and the dimaond finesee will see Gold home|pg||
nt|lestergold: the discard on the club q had no value inj any case|pg||
nt|lestergold: i like the way you put that david|pg||
pc|h6|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|roswolf: these are 60 bd matches (3 x20) and the VP scale applicable means that it is very hard to score big wins to get a max 25vps you need + 80 imps|pg||
nt|lestergold: Gold will cash diamond ace in case before leading up to the q|pg||
nt|lestergold: or may play a no cost small diamond away from hand sometimes catching east napping with a doubleton K|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|lestergold: the JT spades mans spades can be set up for onlyu one ruff and that produces 4 discards for the  daimonds!|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind you doe sthat work there are not necessarily enuf trumops to deal iwth the heart losers it could be too much work to do |pg||
nt|lestergold: at any rate who want s to play in slam here|pg||
nt|lestergold: not even Roland|pg||
nt|roswolf: i do if it makes!|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: here it had a dampening effect on Crouch|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s6|nt|dburn: in case West is 1-1-5-6? yes, I guess he might|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|lestergold: we all do but we dont have the benefit of hindsight in tis game |pg||
nt|lestergold: he wont just take a mindless first ound dim finesse i lay money|pg||
nt|lestergold: hell do something at any rate David|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lestergold: the cat that it makes no odds here of course makes it aademic|pg||
pc|c8|pc|sT|pc|s8|pg||
nt|roswolf: true:(|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course ducking the ace of spades would finish off any slam i fear in any case|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||
nt|lestergold: slow play is not a characterisic|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||

nt|roswolf: what for a revoke!?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: I think 4@d was explained as keycard to him|pg||
nt|lestergold: who is directing Mike Amos?|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: Kantar may have been very great but I disagree because you are blanaced it doesnt guarntee that patner is - i think point count texture of hand and the way the points are ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: distributed ae lall factors to be taen into account|pg||
nt|lestergold: but its this care to tyhe nth degree over the technical possibilities in card play which distinguih=shes the top experts from the ordinary mortals|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe 2@s shows a good weak two bid and 2@d (or some such) a bad one|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: not seemingly|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: where is thios acution going?|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|yo_yo: David been dropped ?|pg||

pc|c2|nt|lestergold: sadlythe bold bidding this time not rewqarded by any kind card holdings with the defence|pg||

pc|c7|pc|cA|pg||
nt|lestergold: aheavy 2S at fav vul with two aces im a little surprised|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lestergold: well 2S equally unofrtunate so not likely tio produce any swings|pg||
nt|ady: nice return from Fleet|pg||

pc|d7|nt|Walddk7: For golf fans. Gale forces winds across the north and east of Scotland have forced the abandonment of Saturdays planned third round in the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship|pg||

nt|athene: unless south decides he is going to play his partner for the @SK, and throws a spade|pg||
nt|athene: south's agony now sugggests strongly he has the @SJ - but not strongly enough to hook for it|pg||
nt|athene: south is trying to work out if it can ever be right to throw a spade - for example if partner has @CJx and the @SK|pg||
nt|athene: it's always an interesting question just how far you push the philosophy "always try to beat the contract" at imps|pg||
nt|athene: say you are 99.9% sure you can't beat, and playing to beat gives an overtrick or two|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I suppose Mike Bell isnt feeling happy about his lead|pg||
nt|athene: that's 1 or 2 imps against a very small chance of +13 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzyj: players have plenty of time - but EW getting restless|pg||
nt|athene: the books all just say "ignore the overtricks" and that might be a decent practical approximation, but it does mean you lose quite a few imps here and there pursuing lost causes|pg||

nt|ady: 3NT     4@H   or 4@S by east all make    |pg||
nt|yo_yo: very difficult not to play in the 4-4 major fit, we are all conditioned|pg||
nt|roswolf: this should be axed by someone|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 4s great if undoubled as 3N on for N/S|pg||
mb|2D|nt|yo_yo: oh yes, by East OK|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 4S can make heredepending on wehether north gets a diamond thru befor clubs are used for discards|pg||
nt|ady: still needs a diamond lead to beat 4@S  by west|pg||
nt|lestergold: and 3N icy if they decide to playthere|pg||
nt|roswolf: i expect e/w to play in a making contract|pg||
nt|dburn: crikey - this is either the Crouch Natural System or the Crouch Strong Club System at work|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind you there is a hazard in 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: so a chance for crouch to put on some more to their lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: the latter david|pg||
nt|lestergold: strong cl|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure which, but both equally incomprehensible|pg||
nt|lestergold: super science today|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: 4H ?|pg||

nt|dburn: at any rate, West is now declarer if they play in hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 8 easy visible tricks here|pg||
nt|lestergold: its the 9th which needs some massaging one way or another|pg||
pc|dA|nt|dburn: East if they play in notrump|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N cold from either side too|pg||
nt|dburn: and spades have yet to get a mention|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they have agreed @S|pg||
nt|roswolf: no @S it is|pg||
nt|lestergold: and if Patterson mentions them  now it makes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they might get too high|pg||
nt|roswolf: my thoughts too kath|pg||
nt|lestergold: it may happen on lead of course either f card suit will yeild it |pg||
nt|lestergold: four card suit|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: the hazar is when clubs are played and east drops the  or Jack declarer will have arestricted choice losing option|pg||
nt|lestergold: and its diamonds|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lestergold: this sounds distinctly slammish|pg||
pc|d3|nt|roswolf: agree|pg||

pc|d6|nt|dburn: for the moment, yes, but I expect Derek Patterson to pack it in now|pg||

mb|3C|nt|athene: do we know what the double meant here?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not sure I like Selway's double, with me it shows both majors|pg||

nt|athene: but this under-uses the bid, i think|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what's wrong with 1@H?|pg||
nt|athene: better to play it either as hearts (with 1@H spades) or as EITHER 4-card major, so 1major can promise five|pg||

nt|lestergold: definitely in  burn's law contradiction at present|pg||
nt|dburn: I mean, East-West have not bid clubs|pg||
nt|ritong: mm|pg||
nt|dburn: so that 4@c ought to be a long-suit trial bid, not a singleton|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d9|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s7|nt|roswolf: roland provides virtual cokes mike:)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|pg||
nt|lestergold: Roland dosnt get paid either|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: Fleet has made a jump raise at unfavourable vulnerability albiet after an initial pass|pg||
pc|s4|nt|yo_yo: "6-5 come alive"|pg||
nt|dburn: and an initial failure to double 1NT, noch zu|pg||
nt|lestergold: and Dhondy knows that any finessesa re working |pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Crouch asks about discards: reverse count|pg||
nt|dburn: but the bidding would have been the same if South had not had the jack of diamonds|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: so I tyhink thi swas another lost opporunity to take eithjer the vul game or a 500 penalty|pg||
nt|jaapfr: iit is a minor detail but better technically in this 1nt to play @S9 in dummy tr 1|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|dburn: and then nobody would be criticising anyone for anything|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lestergold: but he gives virtual kroners and virtual danishj pastries and real tellings off!|pg||
nt|lestergold: and feree slam bidding advice|pg||
nt|roswolf: a spec says he would pay most commentators in Creosote.... they sit on so many fences .... hee hee :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: I dont tho|pg||

pc|c8|pc|c2|nt|athene: the problem in the other room was that south felt obliged to show his extra shape (he was 55 where he could be 44)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|cQ|pg||

nt|roswolf: to our specs whose contributions keep us on our toes!|pg||

nt|ady: thx all|pg||

nt|lestergold: 4s failing on club ruff ot ruffs|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|lestergold: thx all and thx fllow excellent commenttaors twas a good show|pg||
nt|roswolf: another stretch|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: but 4h n/s looks makeable|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jaapfr: even 5 theoretical losers|pg||
nt|jaapfr: in 4@S|pg||
mb|d|mb|r!|an|3 spades|nt|dburn: well, East-West will be in game here|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@c = 4+ hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: well slams by south have a few more chances than ones by north|pg||
mb|3H|mb|4S|nt|dburn: 2@d = two hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: however hearts are ruled out|pg||
nt|lestergold: for amkeable slam purposes that is|pg||
mb|5H|mb|d|nt|lestergold: Bahkshi gonna take the phantom here?|pg||
nt|lestergold: yep|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: or "at most two hearts", since Crouch is perfectly capabale of having a singleton for 1NT|pg||
nt|ady: there is play for 3NT   making 5 diamonds 3 hearts  and a blck trick     nice lay with 10X@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: o0f course horrible duplication in diamodns 3 of the combined 30 points straight into the skip|pg||
nt|roswolf: artificial relays show their potential|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: play resumes in55 mins at the top of the hour|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm this time Crough's upgrade and Patterson's reasonable optimism has pushed them overboard|pg||
nt|dburn: haven't yet known him to have a void, but only because he has not yet tailored the system so that he can show one|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: its sort of insurance a disaster if 4s was making|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|lestergold: 4H the only reasonable spot here|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps east should have doubled 2@D?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6N on the non diamond lead and backwards spade guess|pg||
nt|lestergold: all fantasy land stuff|pg||
nt|roswolf:  spec suggests 5D by waterlow now |pg||
nt|lestergold: well they asre on a bidding roller coaster|pg||
nt|lestergold: on as steep dive into   the......|pg||
nt|lestergold: which mire?|pg||
nt|lestergold: they had better stop ion 5H|pg||
nt|roswolf: well 5@H can be made|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes and it can also fail|pg||
nt|lestergold: ultimately it will need as good view in spades|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|roswolf: south whatever he bids has confirmed the diamond lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: well yes the clubs do set up for a discard|pg||
nt|lestergold: but what about this contract???|pg||
nt|roswolf: off|pg||
pc|s9|nt|roswolf: oh well what do i know|pg||
nt|lestergold: a friednly lead |pg||
nt|lestergold: can make now|pg||
nt|lestergold: commentator's curse is out to get us|pg||
nt|lestergold: but here it was a lost opportunity but not too shabby a decsiison in the circumstances|pg||
pc|s3|nt|yo_yo: he might well get the @H wrong here|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|ady: could go wrong in hearts though if north covers the jack   but understandingly will probably not|pg||
nt|lestergold: has to make now|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|lestergold: unluck that 3 of east's points are on the scrap heap of course|pg||
nt|lestergold: he may of course be misled by Gold's jump to 3H which sounds barrage like|pg||
nt|lestergold: especially over the redouble|pg||
nt|dburn: I guess you might take the view that once you'd doubled 1@s, you should retire from the fray thereafter|pg||
nt|lestergold: and he made a take out o=double on shape and fave vulnerablity not on high cards|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y it felt that way but what can N bid else|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he could have bid 2@s|pg||
nt|lestergold: but one off for insurance is not a disaster its not a full blown phantom disaster|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont bl;ame anyone here but its not a disaster at imps|pg||
nt|lestergold: its just on this hand the wrong side of the fence but you cant balance every angel on a pin head on very hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: every hand|pg||
nt|jaapfr: specs suggest N to bid 2@S on XX but imo too strong bid or desperation:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: lets face it had Souht held Jd the bidding would have been the same and 5H would have been frigid|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|nt|dburn: North won't cover the jack - that would be absurd|pg||
nt|lestergold: and unlucky that Dhondy was awake too|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so now it's home |pg||
nt|jaapfr: oh sorry did not see Davids 2@S|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe Bahkshi sjhould have been influended by the defensive upside of his stiff club|pg||
nt|lestergold: that to me is the strongest reason for him considering defending|pg||
nt|lestergold: vulnerable opps often bid unsound games in order to terrorise non vul opps into phantoms|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|pc|h9|pc|h7|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: providing Waterlow plays on spades not hearts now|pg||
nt|lestergold: but the lead looks like from three small|pg||
nt|roswolf: nothing would suprise now|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lestergold: i dont think Watrlow will make the wrong choice here|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vugraphzsg: Thanks everyone|pg||
nt|dburn: North doesn't know that declarer has five solid diamonds, nor that he does not have @hJ10 doubleton|pg||

nt|roswolf: definitely|pg||
nt|lestergold: you are risking a re-commentator curse as it were|pg||
nt|roswolf: when he studies the replay|pg||
nt|lestergold: he may switrch back to spades|pg||
nt|roswolf: MAY/|pg||
nt|lestergold: and you get the egg on face|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is a coin flip|pg||
nt|lestergold: odds with the spades 6 missing compared to 5 hearts |pg||
nt|lestergold: and club break heavily suggests the short hearts with west|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d4|nt|lestergold: not that S was even essentially unsound its only off because of the club ruffs|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: I think Waterlow played that on tilt personally|pg||

nt|vugraphzsg: South looking at lead styles of EW|pg||
nt|lestergold: infrangible |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well only two apparent losers in 5D but maybe too much work to do|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|lestergold: in 3rd position Richard is happy to open a weak 2 even possesing 4 in the other major|pg||
nt|lestergold: i am given to understand that th e late denis spooner used to write waterlow articles in btween the avengers series|pg||
nt|dburn: hard to play this in diamonds at all|pg||
nt|lestergold: will Bahkshi reverse into diamonds now?|pg||

nt|jaapfr: due to my Spanish wifi (not wife:)|pg||
nt|dburn: if he knew that 2@d was natural, he might already have passed it|pg||
nt|dburn: but I guess he has to consider how strong South could be - maybe 3NT will make|pg||
nt|jaapfr: then 3@D i suppose|pg||
mb|2H|nt|roswolf: diaries of a palooka wasnt it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: had to get club right to have a chance|pg||

nt|lestergold: well wavelengthhere has not been too good|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: yes I suppose in 3rd position anything is allowed|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: yes it is good to see Richard back playing high level bridge again|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: better 'sign off' in 3D and hope that its passed out|pg||
nt|lestergold: but he has counted his 8 points and is reluctant to abandon game possibilities|pg||
nt|jaapfr: anyway 2NT unbeatable|pg||
nt|lestergold: Bakhshi knows that his freverse on a misfiitng 16 has not gone too well|pg||
nt|jaapfr: assuming after X he finds @CJ:)|pg||
nt|dburn: what "reverse"?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lestergold: but 2N is in fact infrangible|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: well i wouldnt call Waterlow a palooka more of an honest expert as opposed to awily one|pg||
pc|d9|nt|roswolf: yup an unlucky expert perhaps!?|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||

nt|lestergold: does this qualify for a roland slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes if it makes!|pg||
nt|lestergold: only just it needs a 3/2 club break and 2 finesse which is above 12.85%|pg||
nt|lestergold: Roland is very scientific about these matters Geoof|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|yo_yo: I can never understand why Crouch hasnt made it into the international field more |pg||
pc|sK|pg||

nt|lestergold: the downside of not ensuring a dim lead against 3N is too compelling|pg||
mb|3D|nt|lestergold: of course the game does require diamonds to behave as well as no nasty breaks so its below 50% which is not good odds for a non vulnerable game|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Fleet looking at convention card|pg||
nt|roswolf: but with a few less guarantees - especially for the europeans|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: now EW's system file|pg||
nt|lestergold: no i think Hacjkett's decsion here a lot soundr than north's in the open room|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ady: norths hand very suitable   both queens pulling weight|pg||
nt|lestergold: sadly dimaonds dont behave and it costs 500 so not taht great a save but its still a profit|pg||
nt|lestergold: has to play it carefully|pg||
nt|lestergold: not to lose 800|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry im blind its only 300 of course not vul im gettinmg tired even better praise for Hackett|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: open oom decision very poor|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: but we know the downisdes of these bids an steering ops out of an unmakebale gam is a freqjuent one|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: Richard Fleet bio: http://www.bcmchess.co.uk/bp/authors.htm Richard Fleet|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: north should realise that e/w ae bound to have a stack of clubs to run|pg||
nt|lestergold: well hackett realised it|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|roswolf: heather understandably did think her hand was a GOOD raise|pg||
nt|lestergold: i prefer playing a heart to the ten here|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|roswolf: so do i|pg||
nt|lestergold: im surprised here Hackett cannot afford to end up with a club loser|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 2@D does cost here 6 imps|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: of course eaqst cannot take advantage of what seems to have been a frare card play error by Hackett|pg||
nt|roswolf: only -2|pg||
nt|lestergold: it was always going to be only -2|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Hackett is dummy |pg||
nt|dburn: why?|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|nt|yo_yo: it's not quite a preemptive raise  nor good enough for a limit raise, one of those annoying hands|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think that 3S is a perfecly normal raise over 2H she simply cannot make an unassuming cue bid raise with taht colelction|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I dont know much about Patterson   does anyone else?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|nt|lestergold: oh i really am asleep the card play rrors are a little ore frequent by Waterlow|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pg||
pc|sT|pc|hT|nt|lestergold: thats unfortunate but this is why these trials involv playing enuf boards to uiron out the luck lement|pg||
nt|jaapfr: see other room bidding which looks strictly normal to me|pg||
mc|9|nt|jaapfr: although i bid 2@D too|pg||
pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|athene: east can never set hearts in a forcing way|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: prefer 3D to 3N. there will be time for NT later if it is right, and i want to let E tell more about what the 4THSF was based on|pg||
nt|athene: so has to indulge in some contortions|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5D|nt|athene: a spec suggests that east might have started with 2@C - that might allow him to bid a forcing 3@H (or 2@H) at his next turn|pg||
mb|p|mb|5N|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: i dont think 1S was an inspired choice either. i would respond 2C so that i can support hearts while forcing|pg||
nt|athene: hmmmm|pg||
nt|athene: no room to ask for the @HQ, after 5@D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry didnt see that, was writing. agree wholly with spec|pg||
mb|7C|mb|p|mb|7H|nt|athene: well, if you are going to play a grand, 7@C is better than 7@H|pg||
nt|athene: just looking at the EW cards :)|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Welcome to Kath Nelson|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello everyone|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the 2 Michaels, N/S, will be pleased with this turn of events|pg||
nt|yo_yo: West has shown an opening bid and East bids a grand?|pg||
nt|athene: hi :)|pg||
nt|athene: it did all seem to get a bit carried away|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now what do i tell my beginners,  you need 37 points for a grand :)|pg||
nt|athene: not quite sure where exactly west promised the @HKQ|pg||
nt|athene: south knows they won't be in THIS in the other room!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Surely Mike Bell isnt thinking|pg||
nt|Walddk6: No, Erichsen is|pg||
nt|Walddk6: South and West are on the same side on the screen, and our operator will not enter anything until they both bid, as he should not|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Mike Bell, once described as the nicest player in England , is South|pg||
nt|Walddk6: *of|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: E was KCing for hearts but of course W thought it was for clubs. W saw E hearts losers disappearing on diamonds and knew dummy could ruff spades|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he's just a youngster too, very talented |pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|athene: certainly this hand is a good example of why it's important to set the trump suit early in slam auctions|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s9|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|yo_yo: as of course is his partner Michael Bryne who runs the juniors in England|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W will be delighted to see that heart position sets 6H also|pg||
mc|11|nt|athene: yes, but missing @HKQ you don't expect people to be in six in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: 6nt will make with a good view in clubs, of course|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you might not, but when i see the E hand and W opens, i expect a slam to be bid|pg||
pg||

nt|roswolf: for ensuring that this fine event is brought to BBO vugraph. Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentator Mike for his wit and perceptive comments and to our specs whose ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: contributions keep us on our toes!|pg||
nt|lestergold: most of us  would l take that action at favourable with the north hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: its routine Jaap|pg||
mb|1H|nt|dburn: ah, I see. If you think East's raise to 4@h is "normal", all I can say is that you and I have differing views of the game.|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: yes won the Gold Cup and regular high finisher in national events - based in Kent|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ady: part score hand    2@S  for e/w  abouth the limit|pg||
nt|roswolf: nice auction by n/s in the other room|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but not all of us go to 7@H here:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: it will be hard here for Peter to not bid too many spades at some point|pg||
mb|2D|nt|lestergold: one wasted K and duplication in the heart suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 5C the best spot of course but 3N is infrangible as cards lie|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|lestergold: mind you thats the advanatge of a strong club system|pg||
nt|lestergold: it can stop here|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps peter's system is quite good at staying low but.....|pg||
nt|lestergold: and it needs to!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: lets see|pg||
nt|ady: yes many might get overboard here with that great spade suit     can be thatg those opening 1@S  may be better placed   might be passed out|pg||
nt|lestergold: well its not normal Davuid but its a tempter when your q of hearts is a worker its often goijng to be enif tomake a vul game|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|nt|yo_yo: not many pass these days with a 5 count though|pg||
nt|lestergold: obsioly those points randomly scattered and itys a pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: a lot of players would wheel out 4S to begin with|pg||
nt|lestergold: well stopped!!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well done EW|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: and unlucky that the 3H jump is about minimum for the bid|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c7|pg||
nt|lestergold: forced spade finesse 9 tricks|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lestergold: no chance here that the defence would fail to cash their 5 tops|pg||
nt|lestergold: well fortunatley for Irons teame/w has also gone overboard here notin to quite as deepwaters|pg||
nt|jaapfr: many would bid 1@S with KJxxx x  xxxx  xxx then Jxxxx  QX  xxx  KTx is a powerhouse! |pg||
nt|lestergold: of course west having the full monty in his second suit a bit wasted and a lousy holding in his first suit|pg||
nt|dburn: well, there were some bids between 3NT and 6@h|pg||
nt|lestergold: K think 6H was an overbid myself how they reached 7 in open is beyond comprehension|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 6NT had much better chances|pg||
nt|dburn: well, 6@h is not down yet, I guess|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed Mr.jone casnt be worried about the black suits on the bidding and his trump suit is dire|pg||
nt|lestergold: well south would be misere to jump in here|pg||
nt|jaapfr: not if @C return:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: thats true |pg||
nt|lestergold: well if he jumps i  he will so i think we can say this is going down|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jaapfr: i bet he wins this..................... 3imps|pg||
