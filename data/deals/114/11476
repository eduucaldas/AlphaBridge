nt|Walddk4: N-S  Romania    E-W  Bulgaria|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Stara Zagora is the organiser of the event.It is in Bulgaria. And the other team is from Buchurest (Romania)|pg||
nt|lestergold: thx Roland|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N looks playable for EW|pg||
nt|star6ija: nice distribution|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzym: EW are playing precision|pg||
nt|star6ija: 7@c is possible, but...|pg||
nt|mamos: grand certainly looks a possibility|pg||
mb|1C|mb|2C|nt|vugraphzym: 2@C should be @S and another suit|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|lestergold: 3N by West probable diamond lead and no sweat|pg||
nt|andyv:  if 2N is invite, it is a heavy one|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|star6ija: as Roberto pointed out the timing is very important in such boards - as we like to say in Bulgaria "1 second careless = dead for the rest of your life" :)|pg||
mb|4D|mb|4S!|nt|andyv:  wow....wonderful!!!|pg||
nt|andyv:  oops:)|pg||

nt|vugraphzym: 2NT should be invitational hand yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  good morning everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Good morning, Andy|pg||
nt|andyv:  E sequence usually reserved for hands that are just short of game forcing  bids|pg||
nt|lestergold: any lead except a club helps and no one is kicking off with the stiff club ace|pg||
nt|star6ija: this 2@s bid from S is not good option... in this vulnerability strong club has to be sa descriptive as quickly as possible|pg||
nt|mamos: have Ns agreed a suit?|pg||
nt|star6ija: @Ss? :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: I think 1@C is natural, star6i|pg||
nt|mamos: was 1@C strong or nat?|pg||
nt|star6ija: if so ok|pg||
mb|4N|nt|lestergold: even a spade lead sets up a spade trick for declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: :)|pg||

mb|5S|mb|p|nt|sharkey: Good morning|pg||
nt|andyv:  this auction will run out of steam quickly|pg||
nt|mamos: North thinks it's Hearts :)|pg||
nt|star6ija: 7@cs depends on some precautions which should've benn made by declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: it will be interesting if 6@H are bid wheather E will double :)|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Hello Andy and Carl|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Carl and roland|pg||
nt|ybob: down 2 AK @S low @C , later ruff @S|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@s would have set trump and asked for cue bids|pg||
nt|mamos: ugh|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: 7@S* looks the minimax|pg||
nt|mamos: well it makes but this has not been a good auction imho|pg||
nt|star6ija: 12 tricks are easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  all roads lead to 9 tricks, Mike? :))|pg||
mb|p|pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|andyv:  and Deyan:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: it didnt run out of steam that quickly :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  they decided to bring it to a boil:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - this auction not for the faint hearted...|pg||
nt|andyv:  so, the question is why E didn't simply open 4@s if that was what he was intending to bid all the time?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well ironically a club lead and declarer has to do abit of guesswork|pg||
nt|andyv:  probably no over tricks|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|andyv:  this can go down 500 easily|pg||
nt|ybob: 4/2 @S shows even and interest @C|pg||
nt|star6ija: but @d now will bring the contract home|pg||
nt|othered1: Right -- a hand worth 2@C in playing strength but with inadequate high cards for the call.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|othered1: I thought that was standard, but east's action here is what I see regularly at the table.  Times changed, I guess.|pg||

nt|sharkey: yes - if make only lose 170 points|pg||
nt|sharkey: not the game bonus in addition|pg||
nt|andyv:  2 questionable bids (2@h and 4@s) produce an inadaquate result|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: This is the ranking after the previous round : http://bridge.bg/ranking163.html|pg||
nt|star6ija: I think that Romanians made it well, as far as agressive Bulgarian pair at the other table might have reached grand and clubs and to chose losing option which is equal as ...|pg||
nt|star6ija: percentage to the winning one|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  easy slam for EW and easy safe for NS|pg||
nt|andyv:  save|pg||

mb|2C!|nt|andyv:  right|pg||
nt|ybob: 4@H EW|pg||
nt|othered1: 6@D is cold, but 6@S is a fine save.|pg||
mb|4D|nt|andyv:  yes, 6@s almost makes|pg||
mb|d|nt|mamos: South's Pass is interesting|pg||
nt|mamos: North's 4@D is more interesting|pg||

nt|andyv:  6@d now|pg||
mb|4S|nt|andyv:  W thrilled with pd's dbl|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS still not underbidding...|pg||
nt|sharkey: especially S|pg||
nt|andyv:  how would you have bid the W hand, Ed?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  3@h a bit aggressive|pg||
nt|mamos: West has tremendous playing strength|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: the minimax here seems to be 6@H*|pg||
mb|5D|nt|sharkey: looks like down 1|pg||
nt|othered1: Not that way.|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think this is the optimum way|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: though 4N, if clearly unusual, is decent, planning to convert 5@C to 5@D, thus a slam try (if partner doesn't think you have a red 2-suiter)|pg||
nt|andyv:  would you think about passing the first time and "limping in" later?|pg||
nt|star6ija: playing yes but not defensive|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well in spite of 4/1 heart break and unfavourable position of KS E/W have  plenty of strength t make 4h here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Results and standings after 3 rounds at   http://bridge.bg/ranking163.html|pg||
nt|andyv:  @s lead will make it very tough|pg||
nt|lestergold: lose a dim and 2 spades must just take care with the timing|pg||
mb|5S|nt|lestergold: this makes it very untough tho|pg||
nt|andyv:  it would seem so|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: This makes, doesn't it?|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes... shoud make 5|pg||
nt|andyv:  should|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: surely East will bid 5@s|pg||
mb|p|pc|h4|nt|sharkey: unless something happens in the @D suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  should be able to make 9 tricks|pg||
nt|othered1: At his vulnerability, all passing would do is give NS a chance to find an eventual save.|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|lestergold: South may be thinking that the best defnce holding 4 trumps is to try and set up a force in which case diamonds was the best prospect|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|lestergold: bearing in mind that the diamond bid didnt promise diamonds|pg||
nt|andyv:  don't understand the need to play @ss immediately|pg||
nt|andyv:  now @d and @d ruff, forcing E to ruff with Q may create real problems|pg||
nt|lestergold: shout a dim straight back altho better if draws a trump ot so first|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s8|pg||
nt|mamos: thats quite some three boards to start with|pg||
nt|star6ija: 17 IMPs back to Romanians|pg||
nt|mamos: why do you think South passed as dealer?   too good for 2@H?  too poor for 1@H?|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|nt|vugraphzym: he should not play K of @H to make 9 I think|pg||

mb|p|nt|othered1: I open south's hand, but our initial actions are sound and wouldn't criticize a pass if they open lightly in 1 and 2 pos.|pg||

nt|andyv:  very little for the defense to initiate...just have to wait for declarer|pg||

nt|andyv:  wow... that's a bit rich for me even with this vul|pg||

mb|3N|nt|andyv:  i would bid 4 with S hand|pg||
nt|othered1: 10 cards in 2 suits, favorable vul: bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  don't understand that lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  any game try will get NS too high|pg||
nt|lestergold: well South should be content with 2H his pard hasnt made an unassuming cue bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s too high at 2H!|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6 losers 2 spades 2 dims a club and a dim ruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: admittedly north's raise with two trumps and a collection of quacks under the openiong bid wa pretty pointless|pg||
nt|andyv:  true|pg||

nt|andyv:  and S has yet to be shy in this set:0|pg||
nt|sharkey: i agree Andy|pg||
nt|andyv:  ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: you pass with north because you o not want to see pard's expression when you table that as dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: N thought for a long time and passed|pg||
nt|lestergold: and his partner could be splinering as it was it was close to a splinter|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  N 1N opener hit pay dirt|pg||
nt|sharkey: "looks like 1 NT - open 1 NT"|pg||
nt|andyv:  agree... i like 1N with N cards....too awkward to describe hand if you open 1@D|pg||
nt|sharkey: Leromain picked up another 5 IMPs when W opened 1 NT in OR and played there|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: he just claimed|pg||
nt|ybob: 2@H = 5+ @H  13/16 pts |pg||
nt|ybob: WOW|pg||
nt|othered1: but it's a good one, I think|pg||
nt|andyv:  gave up a club trick so I'm no so sure how good it is|pg||
nt|othered1: gave up a trick?|pg||
nt|andyv:  it hasn't yet but it's frozen the suit so N can never lead it|pg||
nt|othered1: What other lead beats it?  South wins @D and plays another @C before east can drive last @S, no?|pg||
nt|andyv:  now E can play the hand straight up|pg||
nt|mamos: 43 imps have changed hand son Boards 1-3 so -300 may be the flattest board yet|pg||
pc|h3|nt|othered1: Nice pass by east, for play in @D, but 3N is there for the taking.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this is 2 off at least|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|nt|sharkey: in my book N hand a clear 1 NT opener|pg||
nt|lestergold: a trump lead would have been  reasonably murderous|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|othered1: playing K may mislead south|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think anything else beats it... I just don't understand leading from Jx of a minor when pd has opened a major.  Why not lead pd's suit?|pg||
nt|othered1: inspiration counts|pg||
nt|andyv:  it would also make me open suits that I don't want the lead because I know pd will never lead my suit:)|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't hate that lead at all.  South does have enough @H length that he might decide to try to attack elsewhre|pg||
nt|andyv:  would you hate the lead if the club honors were split?|pg||

nt|lestergold: two bad bids Andy|pg||
pc|c4|nt|othered1: But maybe north should have enouraged @C at trick 1, or if they play upside down signals south should have continued|pg||
nt|andyv:  J@c turned out to be a good lead... S had to follow thru|pg||
nt|othered1: did north discourage or did south ignore it?|pg||

nt|andyv:  you may be right Carl..11-13... that's the only way you can explain the 3N bid|pg||

nt|sharkey: yes - obviously|pg||

nt|andyv:  2@d has to be some type of checkback, but 2@s looks like sign off|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|h4|nt|othered1: So, slam and no slam are both reasonable|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  empathy, Mike... we've all been there and done things at the table that later on we have no idea what we were thinking about.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzym: I think S's hand was pretty good and there was a finesse on and still down 1|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  wonder if EW are playing non forcing free bids...that would explain double instead of 1@S bid|pg||

nt|andyv:  5@d very playable|pg||
nt|lestergold: but if west is going to bid it should be 4s|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5D needs a lot of good guessing|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2c a dim  heart and a spade to be lost on a bad day|pg||
nt|andyv:  only @d hook... but if N covers 10@S immediately, 5@d will go down|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  i play it as forcing|pg||

mb|p|nt|star6ija: this is a nice event... actually it started in the year of 2005 as Balkan Championship|pg||
pc|c5|nt|vugraphzym: W alerted 3@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4d may have a more realistic chance of a plus score|pg||

nt|andyv:  looking for @c slam?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sharkey: has it chances... but will probably fail|pg||
nt|star6ija: Mr Toni Rousev from Stara Zagora, supported by some local enthusiasts helped the idea to come true|pg||

nt|othered1: Hi!|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer needs to duck this club |pg||

nt|othered1: ty|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: it can be 5@C and 4@D|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|othered1: I'm more comfortable making an immediate strong bid on the south hand, like 2@H, if available.  Prevents decisions like this one, since partner would know of possible slam interest ...|pg||

nt|lestergold: and now an avalanche of tricks for the defence|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|andyv:  one more shot at it|pg||
nt|andyv:  if N had AK of @h rather than AQ, then slam investigation would have been proper|pg||
pc|d4|nt|othered1: "Precision" isn't a definitive description of system any more, as almost everyone has their own preferences.|pg||
nt|star6ija: if it wasn't passed hand, could be the same, or additional strength (principle of fast arrival)|pg||
nt|lestergold: doesnt east want to ruff any clubs for more off|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||
nt|othered1: declarer can even afford to misguess trumps|pg||

nt|vugraphzym: declarerd doent know about the falling 10|pg||

nt|andyv:  ty Deyan for an outstanding job|pg||
nt|star6ija: and again possible swing|pg||
nt|star6ija: bravo, Dido :) nice job|pg||
nt|star6ija: and thanks to Andy and to all kibitzers for joining us|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: This is the last deal of this round. Tx all for watching and special thanks to the commentators. We'll be back in 14CET.Thats in 2 hours 20 min.|pg||
nt|andyv:  and ty Momchil (and Carl too).|pg||
nt|andyv:  coming up to our final board of this set|pg||
nt|andyv:  and our final board of this match.|pg||
nt|lestergold: and a tricky 4S which can and indeed was defeated in theopen|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Mike, Deyan and all the specs who have joined us.|pg||
nt|lestergold: it can also be let thru|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Last board of the round. Tx Mike and Andy. We'll be back at 13CET with the last round of the round robin.|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ybob: 3NT = cold from E|pg||
mb|2D|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|ybob: from W @D leads can defeat|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: 6@D is really excellent|pg||
nt|andyv:  thank you Deyan for an excellent job.|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|star6ija: hope to see you in 2 hours for next round of this very interesting competition |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: in any thx excellent operator and very much enjoyed our double act Andy look forward to working with u again sometime|pg||
nt|lestergold: I'm gong back to bed for a nice kip|pg||
nt|andyv:  same here Mike...it was fun and some pretty zany boards kept us awake:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  as a spec pointed out, 4H may be optimum contract|pg||
nt|othered1: but there's no reason for EW to know best positioning|pg||
nt|ybob: hard to humans not win 1¬∫ trick with K @D|pg||
nt|othered1: 3@D (4th suit still forcing?)|pg||
nt|star6ija: very nice comeback to Rossenovo team, who was 18 IMPs behind in first 2 boards|pg||
nt|star6ija: this 1@d bid could be very expensive|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: This is the last board for today. Thank you all. Tomorrow we start at 9CET.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: looks very easy to make|pg||
nt|star6ija: this will probably end plus one and 11 IMPs Cernato are just to come|pg||
nt|star6ija: and it was|pg||
nt|andyv:  thank you Ed and Momchil and all the specs who make these events fun and entertaining.|pg||
nt|othered1: wow, that was ineffective|pg||
nt|lestergold: youth bridge usually has some fun for specs and commenttaors but thre has been somje good signs of talent here|pg||
nt|andyv:  this should make|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|star6ija: now even to overtricks are possible|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 602 126 889|pg||
pc|sT|nt|othered1: 5@C may survive for a nice pick-up, but can they get there?|pg||
nt|othered1: with only the @HQ possibly duplicated, east has so many tricks it feels timid not to make another move.  Of course, I don't know what west has shown exactly|pg||
nt|lestergold: isnt this leada bit damaging|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|pg||
nt|othered1: Need good partnership to handle shortness cue-bids in partner's known long suits.|pg||
nt|ybob: disagree with 4@S|pg||
nt|othered1: that's another way to put it :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|othered1: That should end it firmly.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|pc|s8|pg||
nt|star6ija: two|pg||
nt|andyv:  guess @hs right and as one spec points out, without @s lead, can make 6|pg||
nt|andyv:  at least the play won't take long|pg||
nt|lestergold: only 8 tricks on top here|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h2|pc|s3|nt|othered1: West doesn't see it my way, but without detailed system and style notes, it's hard to be sure where the rot set in|pg||
nt|ybob: i prefer bid 3@S over 3@C ...|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree with 3@S.  You bid 4th suit to set up forcing bid in @S, so why not bid hand out?|pg||
nt|ybob: where are extra cards from W ?|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@C bid, in casual partnerships, might have been seen as having strong preference and good support for @C that justified 4th suit auction.|pg||
nt|othered1: I personally think west had to respect the 5@C sign-off (if that'swhat it was.)  But he may be taking a shot against an expected @CAxxx in the east hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: This is the last board. Tx for all specs and kibtzs. We'll be back in 10 min for the last round of today|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|othered1: West may think they aren't in a good position in this match.|pg||
nt|ybob: AXXX needs trump 2/2 in unbal hand sure, lost A @D ...|pg||
pc|s7|pc|h7|pc|sK|pc|h4|pg||
pc|dK|nt|star6ija: once again :) big thanks everybody for joining us - see you in 2 PM CET (2 hours since now)|pg||
nt|othered1: Onthe other hand, a round robin is very much like a single match of great length, so shooting to win this match may not be best overall strategy|pg||
nt|andyv:  probably 5-7 hand with @d support and stiff @h|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|d9|pg||
nt|andyv:  W might have been worried about a 4-1 @h break|pg||
nt|andyv:  or was trying to get his name in the papers by smothering the 10x of @hs;)|pg||
nt|star6ija: 13th trick will save 1 IMP eventually|pg||
nt|star6ija: yup|pg||
pc|d3|nt|andyv:  looks like a push board |pg||
nt|lestergold: no play that i can see Andy|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|star6ija: yes and this was the proper way to avoid the danger if 4 were with S|pg||
mc|10|nt|andyv:  good night all from Los Angeles|pg||

nt|vugraphzym: good night andy :)|pg||
