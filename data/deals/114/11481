nt|vugraphzyq: funny, the only pair that found 4@H - went down, on @HJ lead|pg||
nt|ahri: they can earn an imp if they do MP defence|pg||
nt|geot: A chance for Poznan. Good flop, yes, but 5@D is depending on the !A onside...and it is there|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if South raises this, he's got more bottle that I have|pg||
nt|vugraphzyq: a not so fast 4@D|pg||

nt|ahri: good enough Mike? :)|pg||
nt|andreakis: if @HA is not well placed then 4@S is cold for EW probably|pg||
nt|lestergold: could easily be held to 9 tricks depending on how diamonds are tackled|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: adn i get no rewards for that prediction|pg||

pc|s7|nt|harie2:  lucky EW|pg||
nt|theonlyjc: but also might end up playing in a 3-3 or poor 4-3 heart fit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: aggressive 4H bid by E. perhaps more routine way to reaxch game would be for E to make a counter-try, eg 3D|pg||
