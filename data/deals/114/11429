mb|1N|an|11-13|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: even if south had just invited, north would surely go, with AAA for a weak NT|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jtr: Good enough contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzyj: monster! says Gold|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  No double here - looks like 2 spades, a diamond and a club to lose, so a 2 imp pick up likely for Hinden|pg||
nt|athene: a modest victory for the weak-NT; EW don't get into the action so no double|pg||
nt|athene: having said that, i am not sure Gold would have found 2@H over 1@D :)|pg||
nt|jtr: The 2@h overcall was hardly classic|pg||
nt|vugraphzyj: confusion - someone from the next table called for a low D, and Gold followed|pg||
nt|jtr: Neither really was West's double automatic|pg||
nt|vugraphzyj: ...but our declarer is still thinking|pg||
nt|jtr: There is a safety play in @ss by cashing the Ace but there are other considerations|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d4|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|pc|sA|pc|s9|pg||
nt|jtr: You might do that if you believe the @dK lead|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: declarer wondering whether to duck the lead; that can facilitate entries but you look silly if you finesse the @DJ next and the lead was @DKx|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|d9|pg||

pc|s6|pc|h9|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  If west had the cK, he'd have to play a diamond now and later when in with the sJ to avoid being squeezed. As it is it's pretty irrelevant.|pg||

nt|lestergold: dedaling bot i meant|pg||
nt|lestergold: another no brainer here|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|lestergold: Good afternoon everyone Mike Gold here|pg||
nt|ady: good morning all|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lestergold: hi Geoffrey|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lestergold: Good morning from Mike Gold |pg||
mb|2S|nt|roswolf: hi mike|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: yes dull hand probably|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|lestergold: well nine top tricks in 3N not that fascinating|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|roswolf: 3nt looks normal to bid here|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s play a natural system|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S  looks the likely conract    likely to fail  with 2 trump tricks offside|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi David|pg||
nt|lestergold: Well I have to disclos some bias here altho its a confused bias|pg||
mb|4C|mb|d|nt|lestergold: N/S are my sons team mates who are playing in the open room|pg||
nt|lestergold: However I taught Cameron Small top play bridge 30 years ago - my instructiion did not include his 2Hbid with that collection|pg||
mb|4S|nt|roswolf: who are e/w?|pg||
nt|lestergold: Here we have N/S a very accomplished senior opartnership Paul Hackett just back having won world seniors in Brazil in the seniors|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry duplication of chat|pg||
nt|lestergold: Butthese are a very regular and successful pair on antional and international level too|pg||
nt|lestergold: and of course twoo well known players hailing form The North of England i blieve|pg||
nt|roswolf: very true have played in open championships for england|pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: mind you Heather does have a losing play option available|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: this could go down if Heather decided on the club finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: if she judges east to have short club for his bid she might considr finessing the first club to cater for J or more to 4 with West|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmmmm i cash out the clubs - whats the problem|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: Im not suere about the N/S agreements here but im sure that that Erichsen would like his S bid here not have been forcing|pg||
pc|h2|nt|roswolf: indeed e/w are solid players|pg||
nt|lestergold: SAo Small's cheeky intervention has helped push Irens overboard here|pg||
nt|ady: unlcuky hand for n/s|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|lestergold: if she does i will sympathise|pg||
nt|lestergold: and Mr. Osborne has given his opinion of that contract one which I share|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4D looks a little over reached here|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: but she hasnt|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|nt|ady: no   playing from the top|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|nt|roswolf: whats the problem!?:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: not too many entries to dummy and heather doesnt want to use the only one for  a play of borderline validity|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lestergold: with both heart honours wrong contract is doomed|pg||
nt|lestergold: well do you want to be i9n game opposite a weak no trump with no disclosed spade support with south's hand David?|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|roswolf: i believe e/w again play a natural system|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|s2|pc|h6|pc|h4|pg||

nt|jtr: Nice 3NT! as it happens anyway|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|d|nt|athene: another hand to add to the "4333 means notrumps" collection|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: that's not what most people would expect for a 3@S raise over a double|pg||

nt|yo_yo: hi there|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|roswolf: going down in 1nt was unexpected on this layout|pg||
nt|lestergold: good one witout the weak jump on his right not that good could easily have ben 2 club losers on other days instead of 2 spade losers|pg||
nt|lestergold: it was thin for a nonm vul game in my opinion|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|lestergold: the key situation here is whether derek can pick two tricks form hearts|pg||
nt|roswolf: south has an unattractive choice|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1nt maybe?|pg||
nt|lestergold: South has very little and not in one of North's suits|pg||
nt|lestergold: and they are vulnerable|pg||
nt|lestergold: scope for getting into trouble here|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: Mike Gold here popping in to see what the chip off the old block is up to|pg||
nt|mmmakela: Hi all and welcome!|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: and Waterlow simply bidding the lower ranking of his two three carders|pg||
nt|roswolf: the axe falls|pg||
nt|lestergold: what else can he do?|pg||
nt|lestergold: pity Waterlow was not able to bid 1N he doesnt know about North'sspade holding |pg||
nt|lestergold: Hacket has no real reason here to bid over tyhis double|pg||
nt|lestergold: well most say that he is the old block himself now was 30 the other day|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: three tricks available in clubs in theory if the entries were available|pg||
nt|ady: n/s have found the only game that can make|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a min no trump and a min raise but helpful lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: this may well make|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|roswolf: true but he knows his fate!?|pg||
nt|lestergold: another Tank Waterlow knows they are in serious trouble|pg||
nt|roswolf: south must take his medicine|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's the nightmare of bidding 1NT with a 5 card major, dummy goes down with 4 |pg||
nt|yo_yo: but on this occasion  4@S no good|pg||
nt|lestergold: Jd nicely placed for declarer i dont think defence can get at more that2 dims and 2 club tricks here|pg||
nt|ady: might be a swing for n/s  here   4 spades has no chance|pg||
pc|h4|nt|roswolf: and does|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|lestergold: and it will be a large does if Hirst kicks off with trumps|pg||
nt|lestergold: dose|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: not clear for 7 tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes not the best lead i think|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d9|nt|roswolf: looks -2|pg||
nt|dburn: odd, that - no real reason for Jones to raise to game|pg||
nt|lestergold: Today Dabid Gold is playinmg with his occasional partner David Bakshi hisn reguilar pard Townsend is in Poland on paternity leave|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|lestergold: good point David|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: well -1 now i think on normal play - but why spurn the club finesse?|pg||
nt|lestergold: when the 9H appears Derek will have sonmething to think about onm the second round of that suit|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|nt|dburn: and might have tried 3NT if he was going to bid game in any case|pg||
nt|lestergold: a lo of davids around here|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|lestergold: two playing and one commentating|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|yo_yo: home now|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|lestergold: adn good bye 4S|pg||
nt|lestergold: David Gold at unfavourable vulnerability not shy to make life awkward for his oppos|pg||
nt|mmmakela: the good thing for EW is that 3 @S was already too high|pg||
nt|dburn: well, 4@s had not really been in the room long enough to receive a welcome - no one will notice its departure|pg||
nt|lestergold: not to mention aggressive actrion by the other David|pg||
nt|lestergold: well it wont depart unkless Bakhsgi plays a diamond now|pg||
nt|dburn: or a club, perhaps|pg||
nt|lestergold: or i suppose a club will do for two off|pg||
nt|lestergold: thats what hes tanking abiout i dont think hes likelyto take the risk but he has seen david gold's suit pref|pg||
nt|dburn: anything else would be vaguely quixotic, but he has to think - does partner have a stiff club, or @dA?|pg||
nt|lestergold: adn as he has both he cant really go wrong|pg||
nt|dburn: as it happens, partner has both, but|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ady: seems just 6 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: specs are quesioning Hackett's original ouble- Hacket has a good 14 count with the other tqo suits and he has a couple of aces- no i would not think his bid was unreasonable just ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: very unlucky here|pg||
nt|lestergold: they have managed to avoid their 9 card spade fit obviously selway is a student of Kantar's who's dictum is do not stayman with 4333 distribution|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i might record this hand to use in my defence for future occasions|pg||
pc|c8|nt|lestergold: well played |pg||
pc|sA|nt|roswolf: well now this is close but should now be -1|pg||
nt|lestergold: always easily to criticies players for stricking out thei necks at unfavourable vulnerability but if you do not bid you also can come a cropper|pg||
nt|roswolf: certainly north's style is to bid as often as possible|pg||
nt|lestergold: itsa damn good example|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hackett cannot be certain that E/W are not stealing the hand- many times whenyou hear this bidding and your side is cold for 4H|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lestergold: lack of entries to manufacture more than 2 club tricks|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lestergold: of course playing the jH from =dummy was unfortunate on this layout|pg||
pc|s8|pc|h7|pg||
nt|lestergold: On eof Gold's strengths his carding is so accurate|pg||
nt|lestergold: and reliable|pg||
nt|dburn: the club is more sadistic - when Rosen saw it, he must have thought he was going to make|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h8|pc|c4|nt|roswolf: i would have doubled as well:):(|pg||
nt|ady: even 3NT though is somewhat fortunate|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|lestergold: and I frankly|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course 3N verylucky to make needed two finesses right|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hQ|pc|h9|pc|c3|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hackett is a world class and experienced player- he does not engage in too many lunacies|pg||
pc|h6|nt|roswolf: hmmmm he is certainly the former but the latter is not so true|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i wonder if Allerton plays a strong NT and opens it with a 5 card major? |pg||
pc|c9|pc|hA|pc|c7|pg||
nt|lestergold: well that is debatable i agree the Hackett family afre known for their aggresive bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Director called for |pg||
nt|lestergold: one off is  a damage limitation it could have been worse|pg||
nt|lestergold: why director?|pg||
nt|lestergold: tell us more pleade!|pg||
nt|lestergold: please|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmmmm misexplanation!?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: different explanatios|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: different explanations for the double|pg||
nt|lestergold: so who calle the director?|pg||
nt|lestergold: Waterlow?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Waterlow read the note as Not interested in penalty|pg||
pc|d3|nt|yo_yo: it is of course a very lucky game, just swap J@D|pg||

mb|1N|an|mini, 10-13|mb|d|nt|mugsmate:  The mini may put the cat amongst the pigeons|pg||
nt|athene: now north can continue the disruption with 3@D, perhaps?|pg||

nt|lestergold: he is very pip conscious and expects the same forom partners|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2C|nt|lestergold: well here there is a more hopeful 4S ciontract on for Rosen|pg||
nt|lestergold: Norman Selway one of the bridg world's great characters|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: hts and clubs|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make 4@S   but may settle for a part score|pg||
nt|yo_yo: tell us more Mike, I dont know him|pg||
mb|2S|nt|yo_yo: support x   shows 3@H maybe?|pg||
nt|lestergold: N/S can easily go minus here|pg||
nt|roswolf: support double - probably not|pg||
nt|lestergold: 12 on top|pg||
nt|lestergold: he used to write articles headed the convict club in which he used to lampoon london's leading rubbe bridge players - they were brilliant |pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|ady: did well to keep low in OR    2@H  on 4-3 fit plays ok|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2H does not look like automatic make here|pg||
nt|roswolf: so far identical auctions|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so they dont play support x  obviously,  x shows strong hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup kath|pg||
nt|lestergold: Heather will not eant to encourage anything here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i am an advocate of the support X   but not all my partners share my enthusiasm|pg||
nt|roswolf: for a vul overcall the west hand is yuk |pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N happens to be frigid too|pg||
nt|lestergold: he is himself a great rubber player and one of the best partners you could ever wish to cut|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i know Erichsen of course, very familiar at tournaments|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: east probably thinking|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: Espen Erichsen a very fine player and geat cashp too|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and he recently won the Norwegian premier league |pg||
pc|d7|nt|roswolf: SILLY DOUBLE BY EAST |pg||
nt|lestergold: Hackett must know he has a slam going hand because of the identified short spade in south's hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s will diagnose the 30 point pack|pg||
nt|lestergold: on the other hand Waterlow has not exatly bid the full value of his hand here|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think 3h could have been bid with a much weaker hand unless they are playing lebensohl|pg||
nt|lestergold: I of course know Small i taight him bridge and physics he only practices one of these i believe|pg||
nt|lestergold: I do not know Osborne|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mmmakela: and will make most likely 12 tricks|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|roswolf: 3@H?|pg||
nt|lestergold: yep Richard has understandably mad a try here sadly at least one level too high now|pg||
nt|mmmakela: or not.....|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Fleet now shows his support at the 3 level, that's the price he pays|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 4@S looks better here but difficult to bid |pg||
nt|lestergold: problem with this contract isthe severe shortage of entries to dummy|pg||
nt|ady: club position very good for Osborne    but will do well to make this|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it looks a nightmare to play|pg||
nt|lestergold: he has to use the spade to play club to the ten Selway will duck and that is the end of dummy|pg||
nt|ady: if he enterst dummy with A@S and plays a club to the 10  north should duck to prevent a 2nd entry to the east hand for a heart finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe an end play will produce a ninth trick but then diamonds are vulnerable to attack|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Osborne must have thought 2@S was a stronger hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: i said that david|pg||
nt|lestergold: Selway is much too good a defender to allow any additional; access to dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: however Osborn is rightly in the tank he may need the spade finesse here he doesnt know whats working and what isnt|pg||
nt|lestergold: he has a serioustank|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: TOO AGGRESSIVE IMO|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hackett is not messing around|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Osbourne is going through all the options   |pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: E/W having done their best to keep Hacket informed about the spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: not so lever really|pg||
nt|roswolf: educated punt|pg||
nt|lestergold: clever really|pg||
nt|lestergold: not against a player with Hackett's judgement|pg||
nt|yo_yo: looking for miracels|pg||
pc|c8|nt|lestergold: having doubled on the previous round 3H was very risky only having 3 card support and not really necessary|pg||
pc|cT|nt|roswolf: why 3@H if dbl=good hand?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: lets face it, he has a very good hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: The layout here makes even 2H likely to have needed helop from teh defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: O(f course Waterlow a stady expert player but very much the anchor man in this partnership leaves the flair stuff to Hackett|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|dburn: fourth highest of longest and strongest - never fails|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lestergold: so we have here avery likely swing in the pipeline|pg||

pc|d6|pc|dT|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|nt|lestergold: I know Gold would sooner lead away from an unsupported ace than an unsupported K|pg||
nt|mmmakela: would earn a lot of matchpoints that lead|pg||

pc|cQ|pg||
nt|ady: surprised     North took A@C|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's one|pg||
nt|lestergold: well two errors in the spade of one second by Selway after i have praised him to the hilt|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lestergold: Heathe rhoping for the ed suits to both break but saly neither do|pg||
nt|lestergold: Derek will no doubt tap heather with clubs|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think this would have made against best defence|pg||

nt|mugsmate:  Most players these days would overcall 1D on that north hand.|pg||
nt|jtr: 2@d probably shows a weak NT|pg||
mb|d|mb|3C|nt|athene: perhaps they play some complicated defence to a short club, so they don't have 1@D available?|pg||

nt|roswolf: a routine game now for e/w|pg||
nt|lestergold: part scores only here|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|roswolf: hmm a chance for Dhondy|pg||
nt|lestergold: Selway should have recognised that with a stiff spade marked by declining the finesse that Osborne was in trouble and that is where you do not rush in with aces|pg||
mb|1D|mb|2C|an|inverted|nt|lestergold: well partner made a free heart bid and all Hackett has done basically is to play his partner for the qH and either a spade void or the lub Ace|pg||
nt|lestergold: hard for N/S to compete and stay low here|pg||
nt|ady: part score in clubs for e/w   possible they may get too high|pg||
nt|ady: 2@C  inverted minor raise   |pg||
nt|yo_yo: that @D bid  marks the end of 3NT for EW|pg||
nt|ady: westlikely 2@H   and East 2@S  showing stoppers|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|lestergold: another opportunity for a swing this time in favour of Dhondy|pg||
nt|ady: 5@C     makes      4@S   good contract   but bad trump split|pg||
nt|lestergold: and maybe a little help in diamonds or som more clubs as was thec case here|pg||
nt|lestergold: Bakshi will try 3s  no doubt|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - this is not a good start for North-South|pg||
nt|dburn: no, he won't|pg||
nt|lestergold: no hesc passed buck backwards|pg||
nt|dburn: double did not show spades, just a decent weak no trump|pg||
nt|lestergold: Gold may well float this with 3 bullets and no clear game bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: west passing cos hes rock bottom|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: east can bid again|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lestergold: he also knows that WEaterlow is a cautious bidder|pg||
nt|lestergold: very solid player Mr. Waterlow|pg||
nt|dburn: North should probably pass, but that's easier said than done|pg||
nt|lestergold: welll that is judgement on a pin head phew anyone wouldthink this was mps!|pg||
nt|dburn: but now, it is easier done than said|pg||
nt|yo_yo: pass probably shows a weak NT|pg||
nt|ady: west kept quiet with minimum after intervention|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: Gold is a courageous player knows that passing has more upside than struggling on with such a g=heavily defensive hand but opoor offensive holding|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 5@C is the spot|pg||
nt|lestergold: no can their natural bidding teer them into the making 5C|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: probably under instructions from Hackett to bid conservatively|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: i think this will end the auction|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lestergold: well Heather casnnot now bid 3N|pg||
nt|lestergold: and look at this trump lead|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ady: east got the message and settled for a sensible part score|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|vugraphzsg: crouch asks how many spades Heather could have|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm 4S is better spot than 3N but the 5/1 beak|pg||
nt|roswolf: Waterlow is his own man but i agree he is a solid conservative citizen as far as bridge is concerned|pg||
nt|lestergold: in danger of going for 500|pg||
nt|dburn: I am looking at it, but I cannot see what effect it will have|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|lestergold: helpfuol lead and a diamond loser has dissappeared|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: well Rosen can set up club to get rid of dim loser as  alternative to ruffing in hand but the defence has put him under a bit of pressure|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|lestergold: and tapped immediately|pg||
nt|ady: routine contract on reasonable spade split    |pg||
nt|lestergold: its gonna be very hard no to suc cumb to two further tricks in the trump suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: Ive known him for 40 years and i have a lot of respect for his game|pg||
nt|lestergold: and indeed for him|pg||

nt|lestergold: in fact two have|pg||

nt|lestergold: is that wrong David?|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|nt|ady: can discard on 3rd hearft|pg||
pc|h2|nt|yo_yo: this is bad luck for NS|pg||
nt|lestergold: so no great wing here |pg||
nt|yo_yo: I bet 3NT by South would have made|pg||
nt|lestergold: playing in the 4/3 fit should have rewarded them after all contract is figid on a 4/2 spade break|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup but surely unbiddable|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|pc|cQ|pc|d6|pg||
pc|hK|nt|dburn: no, that is correct - a diamond would have been better than a spade at trick three|pg||
pc|h8|nt|lestergold: ei8ther my fingers or my keyboardare a sandwich short of a picnic today|pg||
nt|yo_yo: just close your eyes and bid 3NT after 3@C?|pg||
nt|roswolf: :0|pg||
nt|lestergold: and as for Hackett maybe the Arthur Daley of bridge but a damn good player and nice liekable chap|pg||
pc|d2|nt|roswolf: looks -2 for 3 imps to crouch|pg||
nt|lestergold: why should they punt 3N when they can explore for the best contract accurately|pg||
nt|roswolf: agree mike|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ok 3@D - 3@S - 3NT?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Now up to Crouch to lead A@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: biding omp will rewars them for playing in eiher 4s or 5c and penalise them for the lazy 3n punt|pg||
nt|lestergold: so the trump lead made it possible to get two off but Bakhshi didntfolow it up|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed|pg||
nt|lestergold: a real character|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ady: but now will lose 2 spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: however he will lose 2 spades instead of one so profit on lead was only one trick|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i bid 2@D partner for the lead!!|pg||
mc|11|nt|yo_yo: anyway they reached a very good contract, 4@S would make on most days of the week|pg||
nt|roswolf: -3 now?|pg||
nt|lestergold: so far both sides have bid and played soundly except for a doubtful but not ludicrous bid of 3H by Richard earlier on|pg||
nt|lestergold: the hands have been excrutiatingly dull|pg||
nt|lestergold: and prdocued the greattwins of course|pg||

nt|jtr: @h now|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jtr: the @c and a @h|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: one interesting issue here is just what the doubler needs for the raise - is it simply "courtesy" with 4-card support, does it promise extras, or significant extras?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: there isn't really any consensus but many pairs don't discuss it|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  For me extras - you let partner recompete when you are minimum.|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|lestergold: neither side belong to the part score religion|pg||
nt|lestergold: well e/w may well gio for 4s but the duplication in hearts will not helop as a club would be surely led|pg||
nt|lestergold: Jones should pretend that KC isnt there|pg||
nt|dburn: may or may not be - did that 1@c opening show clubs?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a pass on a 12 count, very restrained|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand  again   likely in spades e/w|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|lestergold: Bakhshi's neg double on 3 count not everyone's choice|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: 5D dependant on club and dim finesse not a very good contract|pg||
nt|ady: only part score  on    5@D  a stretch in OR|pg||
nt|lestergold: but thinking of possible sac in hearts i suppose at this vulnerability not knowing it would be a phantom|pg||
nt|lestergold: and i do not think my son would have either|pg||
nt|dburn: at this vulnerability?|pg||
mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|lestergold: 3n a better spot as it has chances when one of those finesses is wrong|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i wonder what 2NT is|pg||
nt|lestergold: actually not many chances its fair to say|pg||
nt|lestergold: well there is no reason for non vulnerable E/W to play this hand in a game|pg||
nt|lestergold: hell surely do that|pg||
nt|lestergold: Seloway is not that old but he didnt play competitiv bridge for many years and has maybe not caught up with modern light openings|pg||
nt|lestergold: the old school of money players who like to be robust at unfavourable vulnerability|pg||
nt|lestergold: do not knock that approach it has its validity|pg||

nt|lestergold: too true Kath all approaches have their downsids|pg||

nt|lestergold: oh Dear Bahkshi has gone on tilt|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe 1@c didn't show clubs after all|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|lestergold: Im asked does Mrs. Hackett playbridge|pg||

nt|roswolf: normally abroad!|pg||
nt|lestergold: as i said not oo many part scores aound here|pg||
nt|lestergold: non vulnerable i would say that this was a bit of a 'junior' game|pg||
nt|roswolf: a lot of work to do|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hirst has at most a doubtful invite in my view|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|lestergold: but  every session i see well known players openinmg flat 11 counts at unfavourable these days|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|dburn: and maybe doubling 2NT didn't show clubs either|pg||
nt|lestergold: he has bid with a  count vulnerable and now he fails to lead the strong hand's suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3 count|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|nt|yo_yo: Heather will be getting fed up with going down|pg||
nt|ady: will get tapped out of club suit|pg||

mb|1S|nt|roswolf: 4@S for e/w?|pg||

nt|lestergold: hm swing possibilities here|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|yo_yo: ah I was just pondering that Ant :)|pg||
nt|dburn: given the methods in use, a heart lead was more or less normal|pg||
mb|d|mb|2D|nt|dburn: now, I say nothing about the methods in use - very fine methods they are, no doubt|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: he will try and Hassett will acceopt|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: If Richard keps his bidding boots on - this time he can amke game|pg||
nt|roswolf: if he invites east will accept|pg||
nt|lestergold: Im not convinced he knows that cklubs were natural that gold has shown a suit oriented hand and is strong why not lead his suit|pg||
nt|dburn: but the game was perhaps a little easier when if you had clubs, you could show them by bidding clubs|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|lestergold: 3H the limit for N/S|pg||
nt|ady: 9 tricks available in hearts for n/s|pg||
nt|yo_yo: club pips interesting|pg||
mb|3H|nt|lestergold: and he will noww|pg||
nt|roswolf: well the moment of truth|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: but Gold has denied a no trumpish hand here|pg||
nt|lestergold: but e/.w cannot compete against hearts|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: since south could have a yarborough surely he has the values for game!?|pg||
nt|lestergold: so his club isnt likely to be prepared|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, 2NT was also close to unspeakable - if Jones had bid 4@s like a normal person, no one could have shown clubs at all|pg||
nt|lestergold: he could have 18/19 balanced i suppose thats notout of the quesion but then what are e./w bidding on vulnerable?|pg||

pc|dA|nt|roswolf: i think a clear error|pg||

nt|roswolf: in both rooms|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Neither North nor South know how strong the other one is  - very difficult|pg||
nt|lestergold: but he still has an 8 count opposite an announced strong hand|pg||
nt|ady: game is against the odds  K@H more likely to be wrong |pg||

pc|h2|nt|lestergold: three rounds of diamonds will prouce 2 dims and a tump trick by force but thereafter Hasset cant  really go wrong|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that 9@C may come into play here|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lestergold: on another occasion i think Richard would have bid 4H but hes been so unlucky with his bidding in this session that he has decided to go onservative|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|lestergold: im not convinced by Selway's 4h bid here a takeout double followed by a further heart bid shows his values|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 8@C rather|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho the duplication here unfortunate the heart finesse being wrong expected on the opening bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: all in all i feel too pushy for a non vul game|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lestergold: if he is shortned in hand he will not be able to afford the ruffing fibnesse in clubs|pg||
nt|dburn: odd, that - would have expected Jones to compete further|pg||

pc|d5|nt|roswolf: you must be consistent|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hT|nt|ady: I wonder if they play sort of leb  where 3@H shows some values   2NT would show weak hand  - but even then Heather my consider her hand minimum after previous action|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||
nt|lestergold: well ER/e go plus thats the important thing on these part score eals|pg||
nt|lestergold: E/W|pg||
nt|dburn: I mean, double was only lead-directing and all that, but 2@s was not necessarily frivolous, and East-West could easily have a game|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk7: Commentators are kindly requested to use surnames. All specs do not know Heather, Derek, Richard and Peter|pg||
nt|lestergold: I do not think we canbe harsh here Richard had a tossup decision lets face it|pg||
nt|lestergold: hes not that well placed now|pg||
nt|lestergold: danger now is losing to the qs and losing a heart ruff too|pg||
nt|roswolf: playinf the trump works i think|pg||
nt|lestergold: double dummy he certainly can make with double heart finesse however sine dummy he has problems|pg||
nt|lestergold: single dummy i meant to type|pg||
nt|roswolf: the slam was not bid in the other room|pg||
nt|lestergold: but he can get at the seven tricks he needs of course|pg||
nt|roswolf: i cant see any other reasonable line|pg||
nt|lestergold: a spade 2 clubs 3h and a diamond|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk7: also Mike Gold|pg||
pc|h8|pc|s7|pg||

pc|dJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: and probably as we  all do we go with the feeling as to whether we are on a roll or whether everything is spitting at us|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lestergold: well he may have tried for 4 heart tricks but very against thye odds|pg||
nt|lestergold: has to be careful now must take a first ound heart finesse cant afford theluxury of any 'safety' p0lay in hearts doe a singleton q|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair point mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: has to quickly remove that pesky trump|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: Yes David, that's a good point|pg||
nt|lestergold: first slam hand of the session|pg||
nt|roswolf: now a hand of possibility|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: and an infrangible one at that|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lestergold: well n?S could get too high here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: nice double fit  with good clubs on the side    6@D  best as in OR|pg||
nt|lestergold: easy 4H here|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: slam certainly off in spades and looks awkward in hearts but possible as cards lie|pg||
nt|dburn: and that 4@h opening is... well, it might miss a slam opposite some very routine passes|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5D if allowed to play only two off but unreacheable vul after the preempt likely to be flat this board|pg||
nt|lestergold: quite heavy for a 4H opener isnt it- more like a texas stule 4 bid|pg||
nt|dburn: still, I guess you'd rather deal with 4@h - 4@s - pass - pass (when you have a clear double) than with 1@h - 4@s - pass - pass, when you have a headache|pg||
nt|lestergold: i meanhad east held Kc instead of q slam would have been a goodm prop|pg||
mb|p|pc|d3|nt|lestergold: not completely automatic to bid its a 30 point pack with the lack of duplication in hearts|pg||
nt|roswolf: the heart save is cheap for n/s|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if Crouch doubles then they find the @D fit  but @S OK  if not better|pg||
nt|lestergold: this time not too lucky for Small|pg||
nt|lestergold: burn's law kicks in with a vengeance here|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lestergold: and no way would it have been reached|pg||
nt|yo_yo: are you going to explain that law Mike?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lestergold: now will Peter go|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hackett will certsinly try|pg||
nt|lestergold: in hearts he can opt to dicard a spade and ruff the k out to make|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes he should be safe at the 5 level|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|lestergold: no he is worried about diamonds|pg||
nt|yo_yo: wowee|pg||
nt|ady: Kay doubled after 1@H in OR|pg||
pc|c2|nt|roswolf: a major swing back to dhondy|pg||
nt|lestergold: but surely he had a trie he has a monster hand dim finesse at worst  probably|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is the first big error of the session|pg||
nt|roswolf: a cautious view|pg||
nt|lestergold: no they are leading and do not need to bid any dodgy slams|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: im still a bit surprised  Hackett has a monster of a hansd|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lestergold: sorry plus another ace|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|lestergold: im getting tired but unlikely to be reached if east held the key cards|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|nt|yo_yo: East had  2 of the 3 key cards Crouch was worried about|pg||
nt|ady: the take out-double rather than the michaels seemed to work better on this hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: not a frightener|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d7|pg||
nt|ady: well he had to do something with his 15     maybe top heavy for 1NT in pass out position|pg||
nt|yo_yo: has South enplayed himself here?|pg||
nt|lestergold: i double and if pard biods only two clubs i pass only tajke action if that is doubled|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no, his partner has|pg||
nt|lestergold: i am very strict about suit lngth and quality at the 2 level|pg||
nt|lestergold: most money p0layers learn to be|pg||
nt|lestergold: as i hav often said a high proportion of the top card players have been nurtured on money bridge|pg||
nt|lestergold: my son wa a money bridge host in london at age 19|pg||
nt|lestergold: and his partner too Townsend|pg||
nt|yo_yo: many towns in england have no rubber bridge clubs|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|s5|pc|s4|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Did Crouch show his massive hand here?|pg||
nt|lestergold: thats true Kath and why do you tyhink so many top players ome from London- I could reel off a lot of  names|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and you need a bit of cash to play in the big money games in London|pg||
nt|lestergold: some of the Manchter players too have their highish stake game|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they depend on poor players with lots of money |pg||
nt|lestergold: its all true but it does sharpen your card player when you go home on bread and water |pg||
nt|lestergold: the embankment is cold in the winter|pg||
nt|rodal f: Same for u Kadir:)|pg||

pc|dA|pc|hK|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|sT|pc|sA|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|c7|nt|lestergold: its a very big downside at imps vulnerable when you lose12 imps for not bidding ur vul slams|pg||
nt|dburn: but it seems to me a little paranoid to suppose that when RHO has passed, the opponents will be in 4@s before you have a chance to bid again|pg||
nt|lestergold: it desnt matter too much what preempt style u use but u must be consistent and keep to agreed ranges and principles when you do these things in fron of unpassed partner|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lestergold: But look at the top playuers brought up on money bridge: Zia, Robson, Hallberg, Price , Simpson Fawcett, Selway erichsen, Sandquist to name a few|pg||

nt|lestergold: I dont think its about making money- money concentartes the mind more than master points|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|lestergold: what we are4 seeing tho is players who are getting pessimistic because they keep going off in conracts|pg||

nt|roswolf: east may just bid 5@C|pg||

mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|roswolf: yes e/w favorite to go down in something|pg||
nt|lestergold: whatever one says almost all bridge players are influenced by the precious session history which in theory they shouldnt be|pg||
nt|ady: likely to reach 4@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: previous hands i meant to type|pg||
mb|3D|nt|lestergold: west has good trumps and tweo bullets but otherwise minimum|pg||
nt|roswolf: HMM not my choice 3@H splinter was possible|pg||
nt|roswolf: by east of course|pg||
nt|lestergold: west dutifully cues the diamond east should cue hearts now|pg||
nt|roswolf: now east will be worried about missing slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: but then west should sign off and east should passhaving bid his full values|pg||
nt|lestergold: but as they are behind they may push that boat out into the deep blue sea|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think reaching slam on this auction is quite likely|pg||
nt|lestergold: you are not wrong but it woulod be indisciplined|pg||
nt|lestergold: making tries and cues os not mean that you have to bid a slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: you are allowed to put the brakes on|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|ady: now 3NT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i cant see North leading @C on this auction|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm is 3n going to be wrong sided?|pg||
nt|ady: likely to make 10 tricks on a spade lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: North may ask a few quesions before leading|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lestergold: and here is another likely game to be bid which has litle hope against the 4/1 trump brwk|pg||
nt|lestergold: but this time pessimism has paid off!|pg||
nt|lestergold: but a spade looks like the marked lead rue|pg||
nt|lestergold: true unlesss... erichsen doubleas for a club lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: auction not over|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: actually Hasset has judged well not to cue his hearts beause he has no aces|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed but the adrenaline rush sometimes makes you do it|pg||
nt|lestergold: slam actually makes as cards lie it makes by an unusual means|pg||
nt|roswolf: but neverthess well done to e/w to reach a sensible contract|pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: Peter has devalued his spade holding because of hearther's somewhat dubious noise here|pg||
nt|ady:  how doestheir relay system allows them to stop so low with 25 hcp and major suit fit?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes the strong no- trumpers might bid it 1NT - 3NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: its amazing how players always feel when not vul that thye have to get their pesky 5 card spade suits in however useless teh suigt and however useless the hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: rudd high he will|pg||
nt|dburn: ah well - someone at least led a club in case his partner had them despite having bid them|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes commentator's curse spared me for once|pg||

nt|ady: I think selway will find the J@C lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|roswolf: these are 60 bd matches (3 x20) and the VP scale applicable means that it is very hard to score big wins to get a max 25vps you need + 80 imps|pg||
nt|lestergold: Gold will cash diamond ace in case before leading up to the q|pg||
nt|lestergold: or may play a no cost small diamond away from hand sometimes catching east napping with a doubleton K|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well i think so but last tim i expected selway to make a good play he didnt|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh well its all academic small has chickened|pg||

nt|roswolf: difficult for him to come in i think|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lestergold: Kantar may have been very great but I disagree because you are blanaced it doesnt guarntee that patner is - i think point count texture of hand and the way the points are ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: distributed ae lall factors to be taen into account|pg||
nt|lestergold: but its this care to tyhe nth degree over the technical possibilities in card play which distinguih=shes the top experts from the ordinary mortals|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe 2@s shows a good weak two bid and 2@d (or some such) a bad one|pg||

nt|ady: nice return from Fleet|pg||

nt|lestergold: 11 or ten accordingly|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but yes david, he might lead @S|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: that is true|pg||

nt|lestergold: and 3N icy if they decide to playthere|pg||
nt|roswolf: i expect e/w to play in a making contract|pg||
nt|dburn: crikey - this is either the Crouch Natural System or the Crouch Strong Club System at work|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind you there is a hazard in 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: so a chance for crouch to put on some more to their lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: the latter david|pg||
nt|lestergold: strong cl|pg||

nt|lestergold: i think 50 available now for e./w no reaaly enough|pg||
nt|lestergold: 500|pg||
nt|lestergold: dont think Small will float it with 4 hearts to the 9|pg||
nt|ady: east might bid 3@H|pg||
nt|ady: still wondering whether they will play 3NT |pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n no play of course|pg||
nt|ady: high level club contract not that obvious|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: 4H ?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: you need a super duper memory we have decided|pg||
nt|dburn: at any rate, West is now declarer if they play in hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 8 easy visible tricks here|pg||
nt|lestergold: its the 9th which needs some massaging one way or another|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5C may be difficult to reach in spite of the 12 tricks we can see available|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|dburn: East if they play in notrump|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N cold from either side too|pg||
nt|dburn: and spades have yet to get a mention|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they have agreed @S|pg||
nt|roswolf: no @S it is|pg||
nt|lestergold: and if Patterson mentions them  now it makes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they might get too high|pg||
nt|roswolf: my thoughts too kath|pg||
nt|lestergold: it may happen on lead of course either f card suit will yeild it |pg||
nt|lestergold: four card suit|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Cameron Small had a difficult bid there |pg||
pc|c5|nt|lestergold: the hazar is when clubs are played and east drops the  or Jack declarer will have arestricted choice losing option|pg||
nt|lestergold: and its diamonds|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|pg||
nt|ady: Small decided to take whatever plus in 2@HX|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i do not agree with Small's flotation sometimes these contracts even make|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no @H stop, no 4 card @S,  no support for @C|pg||
nt|lestergold: I like better trumops tio defend 2 of a major doubled into game|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lestergold: this sounds distinctly slammish|pg||
nt|lestergold: he has no guarantee that even his AK of diamonds are standing up|pg||
pc|cA|nt|roswolf: agree|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like 4S is the contract|pg||
pc|cK|nt|dburn: for the moment, yes, but I expect Derek Patterson to pack it in now|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Crouch is determined to get his partner to bid @S first|pg||
nt|yo_yo: undo|pg||
nt|lestergold: input error/|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: thanks all :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|roswolf: yes north doent commit hara-kiri as a rule|pg||
nt|dburn: and fortuitously, to become declarer|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|lestergold: the gap widens|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so a swing to Crouch|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no trump promotion now|pg||
nt|ady: but what action should Small take if not leaving the double?|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: an overtrick will be made|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed but still 40+ boards to play in this match|pg||
nt|lestergold: just the two trumps to lose|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: 60 boards in total in this match, played over three weekends|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i cant think of a sensible bid David|pg||
pc|d2|pc|cT|pg||
nt|lestergold: his pard has shown extras so he wants to play in gae i think 3H|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|nt|ady: Dhondy unfortunate in OR   spades have to be 4-1   A@d wrong  and a diamond lead |pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: mostly 3N will go off if played with the odds|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|lestergold: osborne has a broken club suit and only one heart stop one that he cannot hold up so he can rebid 4C and Small can raise to 5|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h8|nt|lestergold: why not unblock the club first|pg||
nt|lestergold: can play on hearts tho|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d5|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: especially if east has shown long spades in the  auction as that will reinforce the restricted choice play|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ady: no need    now hearts|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so the transfer bid worked wonders on this hand|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lestergold: I admit that its not easy but floating this double is a risky cos sometimes they make and often they are only one off which does not compensate for game|pg||
nt|lestergold: at mps it is more worthy opf consideration|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Norman claims 100 honours|pg||
nt|lestergold: rofl only to be expected|pg||
nt|lestergold: Fawcett used to always say 'remind me to tell you something at the end of the hand!'|pg||

mb|d!|an|Lightner|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|athene: any special significance in the @DJ lead?|pg||
nt|athene: when you lead from an honour sequence so partner can ruff, it can lead to interesting situations |pg||
nt|jtr: suit pref?|pg||
nt|athene: let's say you have QJ10 and you want to lead suit-preference for lower suit|pg||
nt|athene: you lead the 10 but then partner doesn't know if it's a master, if declarer doesn't cover|pg||
nt|jtr: 10 would maybe be clearer|pg||
nt|jtr: If suit pref|pg||
pc|dA|pc|c2|pc|d2|pg||

pc|hA|pc|hQ|pc|h3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|jtr: They must make 2@cs anyway though|pg||
nt|jtr: @s back say|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  The 4H bid worked much better than the 1H chosen in the other room this time.|pg||
nt|athene: exactly when you open 4major as opposed to 1 is another area of bidding without much general consensus|pg||
nt|athene: some people say you can't ever open a pre-empt with two aces|pg||
nt|athene: but in my experience, if one table opens 1major and the other table opens 4, the side that opened higher usually does better|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  I think it is a tradeoff - I can see a few missed slams opening 4H.|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  3 first round controls is an exceptional hand. As against that the heart suit is relatively weak.|pg||

nt|athene: now on a heart switch declarer has to cash the @HAK otherwise she might not get them, but that can't set up too many tricks for the defence|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  whichever red suit they play the defense only set up two winners to go with their club and the sA|pg||
nt|athene: one possible alternative was to run the @C9 rather than the @CJ|pg||
nt|athene: then if the finesse loses you have a club entry to dummy|pg||
nt|athene: but it wasn't really necessary here|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  well, it might have been if hearts broke 5-2|pg||
nt|athene: but even if hearts are 5-2, the defence can't cash more than 2 hearts after the @SA, can they?|pg||
nt|athene: they can't lead through the @H10|pg||

nt|mugsmate:  true - but still I suspect the J rather than the 9 was a little careless|pg||

nt|dburn: I mean, East-West have not bid clubs|pg||
nt|ritong: mm|pg||
nt|dburn: so that 4@c ought to be a long-suit trial bid, not a singleton|pg||
nt|ritong: most of the time, 3@h indicates a long @c suit|pg||

nt|lestergold: indeed Jaap|pg||
nt|lestergold: itys not match points|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1H|nt|dburn: flat? there was already a swing in this match, was there not?|pg||
nt|lestergold: Well Crouch played this Roland slam in a part score|pg||
nt|roswolf: on the 5@C hand slam was bid in the other room so 10 imps to hassett|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: in open room|pg||
nt|lestergold: money players tend to cash setting tricks in case de accidentos|pg||
mb|1S|nt|yo_yo: oh crikey i didnt realise they missed the game|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: it is crikey|pg||
nt|lestergold: A lot of specs are asking about the absence of Townsend who is Gold's regular partner- I am delighted to say that Townsend has become the very proud fathe rof a somewhat premature ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: lad and he is on patermity leave|pg||
nt|lestergold: looking after his opartner and his early xmas presn and baby Max is doing very wellk|pg||
mb|2N|nt|lestergold: isnt it|pg||
nt|ady: surprised at OT contract    achance for Dhondy|pg||
nt|ady: OR|pg||
nt|lestergold: trying to understand the open room auction|pg||
nt|lestergold: you are never dummy when commentating you may be a a DUMMY as sucjh but there is no let up|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|dburn: well, North opened 1@s because he had spades|pg||
nt|dburn: then East doubled because he was too strong for 1NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5D is an excellent game an unsound slam which makes because all finesses  guesseshappen to be right|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: Dhondy wont miss this game|pg||
mb|p|pc|cT|nt|dburn: or at least, that is what he might have done, but he didn't|pg||
nt|lestergold: adn all his friends are delighhted for them and wish them very well|pg||
nt|yo_yo: @H suit very nice for declarer|pg||
nt|ady: lovely lay for Osborne|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|lestergold: what !|pg||
nt|dburn: that is a nineteen count, right?|pg||
nt|lestergold: I have been struck down by commentator's curse|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ady: 2 down    and very cheap|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's the second 6/5 hand  they didnt bid up|pg||
nt|lestergold: Im not asking for personal appreciation but all specs should know that we do this for the love of the game we do not get paid a penny|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|lestergold: hah what a layout on this lead  all 1 are available|pg||
nt|lestergold: 13 on any lead in fact|pg||
nt|lestergold: but the slam isnt even ood enough for Roland not even the small slam|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: no maybe only 12 have i over counted|pg||
pc|d8|nt|yo_yo: what do they say about 6-5 hands?|pg||
nt|lestergold: a surprisingly timid hand evaluation here by Dhondy|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|roswolf: roland provides virtual cokes mike:)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: Roland dosnt get paid either|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: Fleet has made a jump raise at unfavourable vulnerability albiet after an initial pass|pg||
pc|hT|nt|yo_yo: "6-5 come alive"|pg||
nt|dburn: and an initial failure to double 1NT, noch zu|pg||
nt|lestergold: and Dhondy knows that any finessesa re working |pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Crouch asks about discards: reverse count|pg||
nt|dburn: but the bidding would have been the same if South had not had the jack of diamonds|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: so I tyhink thi swas another lost opporunity to take eithjer the vul game or a 500 penalty|pg||
nt|jaapfr: iit is a minor detail but better technically in this 1nt to play @S9 in dummy tr 1|pg||
pc|h8|nt|dburn: and then nobody would be criticising anyone for anything|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: but he gives virtual kroners and virtual danishj pastries and real tellings off!|pg||
nt|lestergold: and feree slam bidding advice|pg||
nt|roswolf: a spec says he would pay most commentators in Creosote.... they sit on so many fences .... hee hee :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: I dont tho|pg||
nt|lestergold: I got told off because I dont|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
nt|roswolf: aaaaahhhhhhhhhh:)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lestergold: of course 13|pg||
nt|lestergold: the club 8!!|pg||
mc|13|nt|lestergold: the lead provided the 13th|pg||
nt|ady: 13 with the club lead   and the great lay out    12 without club lead|pg||

mb|1D|mb|2C|mb|d|nt|jtr: Many thanks to Roger Bryant our hard working operator in Solihull|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtr: Our appreciation to the EBU and their head Max Bavin for their co-operation in allowing us to present this event|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: north's pass in the other room after the negative double sure worked out better|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps he was influenced by the fact that 2@CX isn't game|pg||
nt|jtr: And finally thanks to Bill and John for their expertise in guiding us through these hands|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|pc|c6|pg||
nt|athene: so there's a big upside (200, 500) and small downside (-180)|pg||

pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s5|pg||
nt|jtr: Good shot anyway|pg||
nt|athene: that's why you have to have a hand to bid 2minor vul against not - opps will be looking to double you|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, this is a very tight overcall facing a passed partner|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c9|nt|athene: 2@C over 1@D is certainly a lot more pre-emptive than over a major|pg||
nt|athene: a bit unlucky to get caught for 500 in the other room, i think|pg||

nt|roswolf: ensuring that this fine event is brought to BBO vugraph. Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentators David x2, Mike, Kath and Roland for their wit and perceptive comments and ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: to our specs whose contributions keep us on our toes!|pg||
nt|dburn: and I would probably have doubled 4! with the South cards - how much more defence do I need?|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|roswolf: another near slam hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s failing on club ruff ot ruffs|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: thx all and thx fllow excellent commenttaors twas a good show|pg||
nt|roswolf: another stretch|pg||
nt|ady: I suppose  could make 13   with 3 entries to dummy  by playing J@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think Osborne and Small have been getting the better of this session on the whole|pg||
nt|lestergold: hvae played pretty well|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lestergold: but 4h n/s looks makeable|pg||
mb|2C|nt|jaapfr: even 5 theoretical losers|pg||
nt|jaapfr: in 4@S|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|dburn: well, East-West will be in game here|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@c = 4+ hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: well slams by south have a few more chances than ones by north|pg||
nt|ady: Selway may take a view to pass this|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course N/S have had their moments too|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: 2@d = two hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: however hearts are ruled out|pg||
nt|lestergold: for amkeable slam purposes that is|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lestergold: the debacle with the double fo 3n mush to their credit|pg||
nt|lestergold: well Smalls may have a 6 card suit and 2 bullets outside but the pips are not exactly 100 honours partner|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lestergold: Bahkshi gonna take the phantom here?|pg||
nt|lestergold: yep|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|dburn: or "at most two hearts", since Crouch is perfectly capabale of having a singleton for 1NT|pg||
nt|ady: there is play for 3NT   making 5 diamonds 3 hearts  and a blck trick     nice lay with 10X@H|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: o0f course horrible duplication in diamodns 3 of the combined 30 points straight into the skip|pg||
nt|roswolf: artificial relays show their potential|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's a brave pass by selway|pg||
pc|h2|nt|roswolf: play resumes in55 mins at the top of the hour|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm this time Crough's upgrade and Patterson's reasonable optimism has pushed them overboard|pg||
nt|dburn: haven't yet known him to have a void, but only because he has not yet tailored the system so that he can show one|pg||
nt|ady: this could be a nice swing to Ierens     nothing much on for n/s    and a penalty here|pg||
nt|lestergold: and the cards are spitting at Small this will cost|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lestergold: its sort of insurance a disaster if 4s was making|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4H the only reasonable spot here|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps east should have doubled 2@D?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6N on the non diamond lead and backwards spade guess|pg||
nt|lestergold: all fantasy land stuff|pg||
nt|roswolf:  spec suggests 5D by waterlow now |pg||
nt|lestergold: well they asre on a bidding roller coaster|pg||
nt|lestergold: on as steep dive into   the......|pg||
nt|lestergold: which mire?|pg||
nt|lestergold: they had better stop ion 5H|pg||
nt|roswolf: well 5@H can be made|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes and it can also fail|pg||
nt|lestergold: ultimately it will need as good view in spades|pg||
nt|ady: Irens|pg||
nt|lestergold: the children had beet rbe sent out of the room|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|roswolf: south whatever he bids has confirmed the diamond lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: well yes the clubs do set up for a discard|pg||
nt|lestergold: but what about this contract???|pg||
nt|roswolf: off|pg||
pc|d2|nt|roswolf: oh well what do i know|pg||
nt|lestergold: a friednly lead |pg||
nt|lestergold: can make now|pg||
nt|lestergold: commentator's curse is out to get us|pg||
nt|lestergold: but here it was a lost opportunity but not too shabby a decsiison in the circumstances|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he might well get the @H wrong here|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c6|pc|cJ|nt|ady: could go wrong in hearts though if north covers the jack   but understandingly will probably not|pg||
nt|lestergold: has to make now|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: In the old days experts used to talk about tricj taking security when vulnerable|pg||
nt|lestergold: now no one bothers about pips buty on a hand like this look at the difference betwen KJT(xx and KJ spanner spanner spanner spanner|pg||
nt|lestergold: all the minnows will be gobbled up by bigger minnows|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lestergold: unluck that 3 of east's points are on the scrap heap of course|pg||
nt|lestergold: he may of course be misled by Gold's jump to 3H which sounds barrage like|pg||
nt|lestergold: especially over the redouble|pg||
nt|dburn: I guess you might take the view that once you'd doubled 1@s, you should retire from the fray thereafter|pg||
nt|lestergold: and he made a take out o=double on shape and fave vulnerablity not on high cards|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y it felt that way but what can N bid else|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he could have bid 2@s|pg||
nt|lestergold: but one off for insurance is not a disaster its not a full blown phantom disaster|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont bl;ame anyone here but its not a disaster at imps|pg||
nt|lestergold: its just on this hand the wrong side of the fence but you cant balance every angel on a pin head on very hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: every hand|pg||
nt|jaapfr: specs suggest N to bid 2@S on XX but imo too strong bid or desperation:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: lets face it had Souht held Jd the bidding would have been the same and 5H would have been frigid|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|nt|dburn: North won't cover the jack - that would be absurd|pg||
nt|lestergold: and unlucky that Dhondy was awake too|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so now it's home |pg||
nt|jaapfr: oh sorry did not see Davids 2@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: yum|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: maybe Bahkshi sjhould have been influended by the defensive upside of his stiff club|pg||
nt|lestergold: that to me is the strongest reason for him considering defending|pg||
nt|lestergold: vulnerable opps often bid unsound games in order to terrorise non vul opps into phantoms|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s6|nt|lestergold: 500 against aip|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|lestergold: zip|pg||
nt|ady: looks like -500|pg||
nt|lestergold: to borrow a transatlantic word|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|nt|lestergold: providing Waterlow plays on spades not hearts now|pg||
nt|lestergold: but the lead looks like from three small|pg||
nt|roswolf: nothing would suprise now|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: i dont think Watrlow will make the wrong choice here|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Thanks everyone|pg||
nt|dburn: North doesn't know that declarer has five solid diamonds, nor that he does not have @hJ10 doubleton|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtr: Didnt bother and maybe sensible with a void @h|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 4th suit forcing after partner already bid NT shows a forcing 3@C bid; 3@C over 2nt is weak|pg||
nt|jtr: We actually bid shortage over 2NT which is more descriptive|pg||
nt|jtr: Facing AKxx, Jxxx, Kx, Jxx 3Nt would not be wise|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzyj: Strong NT, 5M EW|pg||
nt|athene: if declarer runs this of course he will make in comfort|pg||
nt|athene: is there any reason he might go up with the ace?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: he might be worried about a heart through|pg||

nt|roswolf: now this is a coffee hand|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|lestergold: I think Waterlow played that on tilt personally|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|lestergold: so we have a pretty british commentating team for a very british event playing a uniquely british version of acol N/S weak nt and 4 card majors|pg||
nt|lestergold: he is given greek gift and sends it back|pg||
nt|roswolf: nothing greek about it a semi -washington coup|pg||

nt|lestergold: an dHi Roland|pg||
nt|yo_yo: tut tut are they allowed another major  ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: South looking at lead styles of EW|pg||
nt|lestergold: infrangible |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well only two apparent losers in 5D but maybe too much work to do|pg||
nt|lestergold: brb|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: in 3rd position Richard is happy to open a weak 2 even possesing 4 in the other major|pg||
nt|lestergold: i am given to understand that th e late denis spooner used to write waterlow articles in btween the avengers series|pg||
nt|dburn: hard to play this in diamonds at all|pg||
nt|lestergold: will Bahkshi reverse into diamonds now?|pg||
nt|lestergold: show his shape and extra strength?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it does seem a long 2 hours|pg||
nt|ady: this should cause no problem   even on a heart lead as east has no entry |pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|nt|lestergold: yes i agree|pg||
nt|lestergold: Gol dwill know that his heart holding is largely binnable|pg||
nt|jaapfr: re|pg||
nt|lestergold: re Jaap|pg||
nt|jaapfr: due to my Spanish wifi (not wife:)|pg||
nt|dburn: if he knew that 2@d was natural, he might already have passed it|pg||
nt|dburn: but I guess he has to consider how strong South could be - maybe 3NT will make|pg||
nt|jaapfr: then 3@D i suppose|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|roswolf: diaries of a palooka wasnt it?|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||

nt|lestergold: why 2h here by Gold|pg||
nt|lestergold: snap David|pg||
nt|lestergold: bery odd|pg||
nt|jaapfr: what wrong with 3@D?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 9 tricks but awkward to take|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: ah yes|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lestergold: Peter Crouch perhaps siesly keeping quiet|pg||
nt|lestergold: wisely|pg||
nt|jaapfr: by N|pg||
nt|dburn: well, you can understand it as a kind of game try, but...|pg||
nt|lestergold: well wavelengthhere has not been too good|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes I suppose in 3rd position anything is allowed|pg||
pc|dK|nt|roswolf: yes it is good to see Richard back playing high level bridge again|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: better 'sign off' in 3D and hope that its passed out|pg||
nt|lestergold: but he has counted his 8 points and is reluctant to abandon game possibilities|pg||
nt|jaapfr: anyway 2NT unbeatable|pg||
nt|lestergold: Bakhshi knows that his freverse on a misfiitng 16 has not gone too well|pg||
nt|jaapfr: assuming after X he finds @CJ:)|pg||
nt|dburn: what "reverse"?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lestergold: but 2N is in fact infrangible|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i wouldnt call Waterlow a palooka more of an honest expert as opposed to awily one|pg||
nt|lestergold: diamonds behave very well|pg||
pc|d3|nt|roswolf: yup an unlucky expert perhaps!?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lestergold: well 2D not technically a reverse I know but it would tend to imply reversing values in this sequence|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||

nt|ady: how many more hands?|pg||

pc|c7|pg||

nt|roswolf: a good memory is essential too!|pg||
nt|lestergold: a push if CT led|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm the 4@S -1 hand was made in the other room - a @D was led!|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i see 7 tricks................................................. for defense:)|pg||

nt|yo_yo: crikey yes|pg||
nt|ady: Irens on a loser here    1190  in OR|pg||
nt|lestergold: his opartner opened the bidding and he had one apparently viable trick in the ace of diamonds which of course happens to be as non viable asthe Qs he tipped the opps off about|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lestergold: only ten tricks here so one pesky imp to Hassett|pg||

nt|yo_yo: that's a good one :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: does this qualify for a roland slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes if it makes!|pg||
nt|lestergold: only just it needs a 3/2 club break and 2 finesse which is above 12.85%|pg||
nt|lestergold: Roland is very scientific about these matters Geoof|pg||
pc|c3|nt|yo_yo: I can never understand why Crouch hasnt made it into the international field more |pg||
nt|lestergold: the more i look at the open room auction the more bewildered i am -Gold made one opening bid at favourable vul and N/S powerd to game and the double was made with that nearly ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: useless collection sitting under the spade suit|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ady: seems an easy 11 tricks with clubs 3-2  and K@D  on side   can force 2 entries in the clubs for heart and diamond finesses|pg||
nt|yo_yo: some have a rule that when partner opens, opps bid game , I have an ace, then X|pg||

mb|1H|nt|jtr: Maybe Gold could have bid 3@c to warn him of shape|pg||
nt|athene: he didn't have any distributional surprises for declarer in trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: A monster here in South|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|vugraphzyj: other @h raises available, explains S|pg||

nt|jtr: Quite a good weak 3@h|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|athene: they might have some kit here, but i don't know what|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps 3@S asks for a singleton?|pg||
nt|jtr: will that help?|pg||
nt|athene: or 3@S is "serious" demanding cues|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|athene: this is like serious 3nt except you swap spades and notrumps so that partner can bid 3nt to show a spade cue|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jtr: Ah maybe @s cue|pg||
nt|athene: you don't want to go 1@H 3@H 3NT serious 4@S "i have a spade cue, oh dear, this went past 4@H"|pg||
nt|jtr: Good idea|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: a spec suggests 3@S is simply a 'natural' slam try with spade length - but then, 3nt must be something clever|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|h5|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder if Bakhshi didn't bid 2NT because of the vulnerability, or because he is feeling a bit quiet and reflective after the previous board?|pg||

nt|mugsmate:  hi all|pg||
nt|athene: ok, i am reliably informed, that over 3@H 3@S showed a slam try with any side-suit; 3nt asked; 4@H showed spades|pg||
nt|jtr: Nice|pg||
nt|athene: opener's higher bids (3nt 4@C 4@D) over 3@H would have been showing shortage|pg||

nt|roswolf: we have a strange attitude to sponsors generally|pg||
nt|lestergold: and as we can se the double in open oom simply helped the overtricks|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: we need some movie star  looks maybe|pg||

nt|roswolf: well there was excitement in the other room|pg||
nt|lestergold: well could be duplicated hee|pg||
nt|dburn: odd, that - why would you raise 3@h to 4@h in the auction at the other table?|pg||
nt|ady: 6@H   on spade guess|pg||
mb|2H|nt|roswolf: an acol opening from south - 1NT for the rest of us |pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: unlikely to identify this perfecto fit|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lestergold: hm Irense powered their way to 4h quite difficult to stayout of 4h hereon an uniterrupted auction|pg||
nt|ady: 4NT?|pg||
mb|5D|nt|lestergold: no way can richard move opposit Heather's epected ore emptive raise|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes 3@S will be pre-emptive|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is this premier league part of the trials this year?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|jaapfr: this logic 2@D bid does help opps|pg||
nt|lestergold: well at this vulnerbaility Gold will always bid with this type of hand|pg||
nt|jaapfr: me too|pg||
nt|lestergold: the downside of not ensuring a dim lead against 3N is too compelling|pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: of course the game does require diamonds to behave as well as no nasty breaks so its below 50% which is not good odds for a non vulnerable game|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Fleet looking at convention card|pg||
nt|roswolf: but with a few less guarantees - especially for the europeans|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: now EW's system file|pg||
nt|lestergold: no i think Hacjkett's decsion here a lot soundr than north's in the open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: norths hand very suitable   both queens pulling weight|pg||
nt|lestergold: sadly dimaonds dont behave and it costs 500 so not taht great a save but its still a profit|pg||
nt|lestergold: has to play it carefully|pg||
nt|lestergold: not to lose 800|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry im blind its only 300 of course not vul im gettinmg tired even better praise for Hackett|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: open oom decision very poor|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: but we know the downisdes of these bids an steering ops out of an unmakebale gam is a freqjuent one|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5dx not particulalrly good business at unfavourable unless they bid and make 6H in the other room|pg||
pc|h2|nt|yo_yo: Richard Fleet bio: http://www.bcmchess.co.uk/bp/authors.htm Richard Fleet|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: north should realise that e/w ae bound to have a stack of clubs to run|pg||
nt|lestergold: well hackett realised it|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hT|pg||
nt|roswolf: heather understandably did think her hand was a GOOD raise|pg||
nt|lestergold: i prefer playing a heart to the ten here|pg||
nt|lestergold: as it happens here it has only cost a measly imp|pg||
nt|ady: might get out for down 1|pg||
nt|lestergold: that is also possible|pg||
nt|ady: if defense plays 2 rounds of spades   can get an elimination and ace and another club|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like 2 club losers to me unless defnce does something silly|pg||
nt|yo_yo: erichsen stuck for a continuation|pg||
nt|lestergold: after spade spade there is still an exit available|pg||
nt|ady: is wondering which ace Selway has for the double|pg||
pc|cK|nt|roswolf: so do i|pg||
nt|lestergold: im surprised here Hackett cannot afford to end up with a club loser|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 2@D does cost here 6 imps|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh well one off and a  profit for small|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|lestergold: of course eaqst cannot take advantage of what seems to have been a frare card play error by Hackett|pg||
nt|roswolf: only -2|pg||
nt|lestergold: it was always going to be only -2|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Hackett is dummy |pg||
nt|dburn: why?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|yo_yo: declarer might still get the @C wrong  but after the long pause, prob  not|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's not quite a preemptive raise  nor good enough for a limit raise, one of those annoying hands|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think that 3S is a perfecly normal raise over 2H she simply cannot make an unassuming cue bid raise with taht colelction|pg||
nt|lestergold: that  was  hard one for erichsen|pg||
nt|lestergold: a toss up id say|pg||
pc|s2|nt|yo_yo: I dont know much about Patterson   does anyone else?|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s6|nt|lestergold: oh i really am asleep the card play rrors are a little ore frequent by Waterlow|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|s7|pc|d7|pc|s9|nt|lestergold: thats unfortunate but this is why these trials involv playing enuf boards to uiron out the luck lement|pg||
nt|jaapfr: see other room bidding which looks strictly normal to me|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|jaapfr: although i bid 2@D too|pg||
nt|lestergold: interesting about the price one pays for tanking|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d8|nt|ady: if erichsen had switch to a low spade   Selaway needs to win and play a low club to the 9 in South hand to get 2 down    a spade continuation would have resulted also in down 1|pg||

nt|athene: if gold is planning on 4nt over 4@S, why did he bother with 4@H?|pg||

nt|athene: surely 4NT was just 1430 for spades|pg||
