mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: who are e/w?|pg||
nt|lestergold: Here we have N/S a very accomplished senior opartnership Paul Hackett just back having won world seniors in Brazil in the seniors|pg||

nt|lestergold: and of course twoo well known players hailing form The North of England i blieve|pg||
nt|roswolf: very true have played in open championships for england|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lestergold: mind you Heather does have a losing play option available|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: this could go down if Heather decided on the club finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: if she judges east to have short club for his bid she might considr finessing the first club to cater for J or more to 4 with West|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmmmm i cash out the clubs - whats the problem|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|pg||

nt|marlowepi: E should have overtaken diamond|pg||
nt|cindy:  thats right|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe he should, but he did not know for sure that @cK would cash|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2H!|nt|marlowepi: it was obvious W had king when N did not cover. so he can overtake and lead back wee diamond as suit preference|pg||
nt|athene: EW are one of the few top england pairs to play a weak NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S!|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d3|nt|athene: i suppose east sort of has 12-14 balanced, for a given value of 12 and a given value of balanced|pg||
nt|dburn: the trouble is that after 1@d-1@s, you are forced into a non-descriptive rebid|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dJ|pc|d4|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|nt|marlowepi: it may not have been obvious that a second club would cash, but thing surely WAS obvious to E -- N had to have good spades|pg||
nt|athene: the main thing is, if you are going to play a weak-NT structure with any sort of conviction, you have to open that hand 1nt, rather than 1@D, because 1@D - 1@H; 2@H in weak-NT ...|pg||
nt|athene: structure promises a good hand|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|dburn: which is why this shape - 2=4=5=2 - gets opened 1NT more often than any other off-shape|pg||
nt|athene: yes true that as well|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|dburn: of course, you don't have to open the East cards at all|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|roswolf: going down in 1nt was unexpected on this layout|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|lestergold: the key situation here is whether derek can pick two tricks form hearts|pg||
nt|roswolf: south has an unattractive choice|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1nt maybe?|pg||
nt|lestergold: South has very little and not in one of North's suits|pg||
nt|lestergold: and they are vulnerable|pg||
nt|lestergold: scope for getting into trouble here|pg||
mb|2C|mb|d|an|cards, some pen interest|nt|lestergold: and Waterlow simply bidding the lower ranking of his two three carders|pg||
nt|roswolf: the axe falls|pg||
nt|lestergold: what else can he do?|pg||
nt|lestergold: pity Waterlow was not able to bid 1N he doesnt know about North'sspade holding |pg||
nt|lestergold: Hacket has no real reason here to bid over tyhis double|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: three tricks available in clubs in theory if the entries were available|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: true but he knows his fate!?|pg||
nt|lestergold: another Tank Waterlow knows they are in serious trouble|pg||
nt|roswolf: south must take his medicine|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: and does|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: and it will be a large does if Hirst kicks off with trumps|pg||
nt|lestergold: dose|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ady: not clear for 7 tricks|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks -2|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|nt|roswolf: well -1 now i think on normal play - but why spurn the club finesse?|pg||
nt|lestergold: when the 9H appears Derek will have sonmething to think about onm the second round of that suit|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cJ|nt|ady: seems just 6 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: specs are quesioning Hackett's original ouble- Hacket has a good 14 count with the other tqo suits and he has a couple of aces- no i would not think his bid was unreasonable just ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: very unlucky here|pg||
pc|d2|pc|cT|pg||
nt|roswolf: well now this is close but should now be -1|pg||
nt|lestergold: always easily to criticies players for stricking out thei necks at unfavourable vulnerability but if you do not bid you also can come a cropper|pg||
nt|roswolf: certainly north's style is to bid as often as possible|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: Hackett cannot be certain that E/W are not stealing the hand- many times whenyou hear this bidding and your side is cold for 4H|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: lack of entries to manufacture more than 2 club tricks|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lestergold: of course playing the jH from =dummy was unfortunate on this layout|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|sA|pg||

pc|s7|nt|lestergold: and I frankly|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: Hackett is a world class and experienced player- he does not engage in too many lunacies|pg||
pc|h2|nt|roswolf: hmmmm he is certainly the former but the latter is not so true|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|pg||
mc|7|nt|lestergold: well that is debatable i agree the Hackett family afre known for their aggresive bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Director called for |pg||

nt|marlowepi: 1S surely|pg||
nt|vugraphzyj: 1@S|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2S|nt|dburn: not a bad effort at all at the other table|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: double by N would get part of the message across, but 2D gets more of it|pg||
nt|athene: some would start with a negative double on the north hand (as they did in the other room) but you can't show the fifth diamond easily if you do that|pg||
nt|cindy:  delaying the @h fit discovery|pg||
nt|athene: because double then diamonds shows a weak hand with long diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn: may take a while|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|dburn: well, they found hearts, but if West had bid 3@s...|pg||
nt|athene: might north now be worried his partner doesn't actually have four hearts?|pg||
nt|athene: he might have decided a 4-3 heart fit was the best chance for game with the spade weakness?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyj: board still on the other side of the screen...|pg||
nt|dburn: he might, I guess, but more to the point is that South could have bid 3@s and not 4@h|pg||
nt|cindy:  maybe but he wouldnt bid 3@h on xxx|pg||
nt|cindy:  4@h i mean|pg||
nt|dburn: and in my view, should have done|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: also, EW only competed to 2@S, not 3@S|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|nt|athene: so if you believe they are Law fanatics, partner has a doubleton spade, not a singleton|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|pg||
nt|athene: which also argues against bidding slam too gaily|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h3|pc|s4|nt|dburn: still, this was a tough one - at the other table, I don't know why Paul Hackett could tell that there would not be two spade losers|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|nt|dburn: or any play for twelve tricks even if there were not two spade losers|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 6@H in the other room looks like a very happy bid indeed|pg||
nt|cindy:  S here is the one that should be thinking slam|pg||
mc|12|nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: if partner can bid 2@D then 3@H he has to have a good hand |pg||
nt|athene: because otherwise he is neg doubling|pg||
pg||

nt|roswolf: support double - probably not|pg||
nt|lestergold: 12 on top|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|ady: did well to keep low in OR    2@H  on 4-3 fit plays ok|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2H does not look like automatic make here|pg||
nt|roswolf: so far identical auctions|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so they dont play support x  obviously,  x shows strong hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup kath|pg||
nt|lestergold: Heather will not eant to encourage anything here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i am an advocate of the support X   but not all my partners share my enthusiasm|pg||
nt|roswolf: for a vul overcall the west hand is yuk |pg||
mb|3S|mb|d|nt|roswolf: east probably thinking|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: SILLY DOUBLE BY EAST |pg||
nt|lestergold: Hackett must know he has a slam going hand because of the identified short spade in south's hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s will diagnose the 30 point pack|pg||
nt|lestergold: on the other hand Waterlow has not exatly bid the full value of his hand here|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think 3h could have been bid with a much weaker hand unless they are playing lebensohl|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: 3@H?|pg||
nt|lestergold: yep Richard has understandably mad a try here sadly at least one level too high now|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: Fleet now shows his support at the 3 level, that's the price he pays|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: TOO AGGRESSIVE IMO|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hackett is not messing around|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|sT|pg||
nt|lestergold: E/W having done their best to keep Hacket informed about the spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: not so lever really|pg||
nt|roswolf: educated punt|pg||
nt|lestergold: clever really|pg||
nt|lestergold: not against a player with Hackett's judgement|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: having doubled on the previous round 3H was very risky only having 3 card support and not really necessary|pg||
pc|h3|nt|roswolf: why 3@H if dbl=good hand?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: lets face it, he has a very good hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: The layout here makes even 2H likely to have needed helop from teh defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: O(f course Waterlow a stady expert player but very much the anchor man in this partnership leaves the flair stuff to Hackett|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|pg||
nt|lestergold: so we have here avery likely swing in the pipeline|pg||

nt|cindy:  and S has a monster in support of @hs|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: as David said he should do something to show that but i am not sure 3@S over 3@H does the job|pg||
nt|athene: might not that just be probing for the best game?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|cindy:  maybe RKC|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|athene: i suppose 3@S then pull 3nt to 4@H does convey the message|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: I guess he could bid 4@s, but that is heavy|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: and if you bid 3@S and partner bids 4@H, you assume no wasted values and just bash the slam in yourself|pg||
pc|s9|nt|cindy:  as spec points out, what about 2N|pg||
nt|cindy:  was that alerted ?|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt is always alerted in competition|pg||

nt|cindy:  i think so :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzyj: Brunner deep in thought still|pg||

pc|hA|pc|hT|nt|dburn: still, that eight of spades is reassuring - would be harder still without it|pg||
nt|athene: this hand is a lot easier played the other way round for sure - @SK lead and there's no problem|pg||
pc|h7|pc|s4|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|dT|pc|dK|pg||
nt|cindy:  lol Bill|pg||
nt|marlowepi: bill, it sounds like you are suggesting that the weak NT can never right side a contract. i think it is mainly luck a lot of the time as to which side is the right side|pg||
nt|dburn: well, you do not know when you open 1NT that South rather than North has @sKQ|pg||
nt|athene: yes of course it was something of an arbitrary swing|pg||
nt|vugraphzyj: Now Silverstone deep in thought... head in his hands|pg||
nt|athene: but i have seen weak NT lose lots of imps and not gain so many, in the hands i have seen it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: where are his cards??|pg||
nt|dburn: perhaps that is what he is wondering|pg||
nt|vugraphzyj: staring at dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzyj: well, dummy's tabled hand that is|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S is originally from Scotland I believe|pg||
nt|dburn: you believe correctly|pg||
nt|athene: you might say S is initially from Scotland :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: good one bill|pg||
nt|vugraphzyj: Now playing with his quitted tricks, and Brunner tells him it doesn't make a difference|pg||
nt|dburn: now lives in north London, which given the state of transport nowadays is harder to get to than Scotland|pg||

mb|1D|nt|roswolf: hmm a chance for Dhondy|pg||

nt|yo_yo: ok 3@D - 3@S - 3NT?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Now up to Crouch to lead A@H|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|athene: now what signal will north give on this (assuming declarer ducks)?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a smooth duck could easily induce declarer toi misplace the cards, and NS cant be in a hurry to play hearts as S led deuce|pg||
nt|vugraphzyj: the word "squeeze" are heard from the other side of the room and everyone shusshes|pg||
nt|athene: it can't hurt to continue @DK, maybe? since if declarer is waiting with @DJx, he could always have led the @DJ to pin partner's ten anyway|pg||
nt|athene: the problem comes when partner has @DJx|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, those specs should get a room|pg||
nt|athene: even if NS know what north's card means here, i am not sure it's going to be much use because north would have to play small from @D10x, @DJx|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d5|nt|roswolf: since south could have a yarborough surely he has the values for game!?|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|dK|nt|roswolf: i think a clear error|pg||
nt|lestergold: he is boringly flat and his q spade is worthless|pg||
nt|roswolf: in both rooms|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Neither North nor South know how strong the other one is  - very difficult|pg||
nt|lestergold: but he still has an 8 count opposite an announced strong hand|pg||
nt|ady: game is against the odds  K@H more likely to be wrong |pg||
nt|yo_yo: I have been there a million times myself|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d6|nt|lestergold: heathe rof course is just about minimum for the second takeout|pg||

nt|lestergold: three rounds of diamonds will prouce 2 dims and a tump trick by force but thereafter Hasset cant  really go wrong|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lestergold: on another occasion i think Richard would have bid 4H but hes been so unlucky with his bidding in this session that he has decided to go onservative|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dQ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|lestergold: if he is shortned in hand he will not be able to afford the ruffing fibnesse in clubs|pg||

pc|s8|nt|roswolf: you must be consistent|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: I wonder if they play sort of leb  where 3@H shows some values   2NT would show weak hand  - but even then Heather my consider her hand minimum after previous action|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s7|pc|s4|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Commentators are kindly requested to use surnames. All specs do not know Heather, Derek, Richard and Peter|pg||
nt|lestergold: I do not think we canbe harsh here Richard had a tossup decision lets face it|pg||
nt|lestergold: hes not that well placed now|pg||
nt|lestergold: danger now is losing to the qs and losing a heart ruff too|pg||
nt|roswolf: playinf the trump works i think|pg||
nt|lestergold: double dummy he certainly can make with double heart finesse however sine dummy he has problems|pg||
nt|lestergold: single dummy i meant to type|pg||
nt|roswolf: the slam was not bid in the other room|pg||
nt|lestergold: but he can get at the seven tricks he needs of course|pg||
nt|roswolf: i cant see any other reasonable line|pg||
nt|lestergold: a spade 2 clubs 3h and a diamond|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk7: also Mike Gold|pg||

nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|lestergold: yes it is the only line|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: and probably as we  all do we go with the feeling as to whether we are on a roll or whether everything is spitting at us|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|lestergold: well he may have tried for 4 heart tricks but very against thye odds|pg||
nt|lestergold: has to be careful now must take a first ound heart finesse cant afford theluxury of any 'safety' p0lay in hearts doe a singleton q|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair point mike|pg||

nt|athene: 2@D 0-1 control, 2@H 2 controls - that's possible?|pg||
nt|dburn: or maybe "may have four hearts as long as he has five or more diamonds"|pg||
nt|athene: hahahahaha|pg||
nt|marlowepi: specs voting for controls|pg||
nt|athene: on that last hand, the heart spots were actually fascinating because the suit was blocked if declarer tried for the double finesse|pg||
nt|dburn: but the working of the Dixon mind has long been impenetrable to me|pg||
nt|athene: if he leads the @H7, south inserts the @H10, and he can't win, draw trumps and run the hearts|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the old "let's figure out whether a slam is likely at the two level, and if not--as is usually the case--let's see if we can identify our proper strain in the remaining room below ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N"|pg||
nt|athene: well, hey, it worked for the Blue Team with Blue Club :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: gee, bill, i wonder if it makes any difference at all, that they were starting a level lower?|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, whatever it all means, it seems to have propelled North-South to dangerous levels|pg||
nt|athene: (let no-one think i am advocating Blue Club - they probably won in spite of it, not because of it)|pg||
nt|dburn: I mean, they can make 4NT, but they are unlikely to play there|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|nt|athene: or west wondering what to bid over it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyj: because the tables have screens I am enterng the bids in pairs where possible|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzyj: South did not think over 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: well this makes, luckily|pg||
nt|dburn: odd, that - no doubt Holland believed that Brunner would have @sA for that 4@s cue bid|pg||
nt|athene: all the diamonds go away on spades if north rises @SA|pg||
nt|athene: one ruff sets up four discards|pg||
nt|vugraphzyj: Questions are being asked on the NE side of the screen|pg||
nt|vugraphzyj: Alas, I am on the SW side so I don't know what's being said|pg||
nt|athene: if north ducks the spade lead, you avoid the spade loser and you can fiddle around and do stuff|pg||
pc|hT|nt|cindy:  i can see problems if N ducks the @s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what if N ducks spade ace?|pg||
nt|dburn: do what stuff?|pg||
nt|athene: well, ducking the @SA certainly makes life harder|pg||
nt|athene: but 2-2 trumps|pg||
nt|athene: you can surely get the diamonds going|pg||
nt|athene: just lose one diamond|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe you have enough diamond spots|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W might lead D toward queen and then is unlikely to get the Ds right|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|c7|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|athene: as a matter of general bridge ranting, when declarer leads a singleton towards a suit headed by the KQ, it's usually better to duck the ace|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|cindy:  good N|pg||
nt|dburn: this is harder now - but normal|pg||
nt|cindy:  @dQ|pg||
nt|athene: even if you lose your ace, the trick often comes back with interest|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes totally normal. N knows that winning spade ace is giveup play|pg||
nt|dburn: although maybe declarer can't now do enough stuff|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||

mb|1D|nt|yo_yo: I play that a cue bid by the michaels bidder shows a strong hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes it did - most pairs dont practice constructive bidding after michaels and therefore fail to have accurate agreements|pg||
nt|roswolf: now a tempter for e/w|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|lestergold: what we are4 seeing tho is players who are getting pessimistic because they keep going off in conracts|pg||
mb|2C|nt|lestergold: this has been a lot of scores above the line|pg||
nt|ady: 25 hcp   but 4@H  hopeless     3NT has play|pg||
nt|roswolf: east may just bid 5@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5C looks ok|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|roswolf: yes e/w favorite to go down in something|pg||
nt|lestergold: whatever one says almost all bridge players are influenced by the precious session history which in theory they shouldnt be|pg||
nt|ady: likely to reach 4@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: previous hands i meant to type|pg||
mb|4D|nt|lestergold: west has good trumps and tweo bullets but otherwise minimum|pg||
nt|roswolf: HMM not my choice 3@H splinter was possible|pg||
nt|roswolf: by east of course|pg||
nt|lestergold: west dutifully cues the diamond east should cue hearts now|pg||
nt|roswolf: now east will be worried about missing slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: but then west should sign off and east should passhaving bid his full values|pg||
nt|lestergold: but as they are behind they may push that boat out into the deep blue sea|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think reaching slam on this auction is quite likely|pg||
nt|lestergold: you are not wrong but it woulod be indisciplined|pg||
nt|lestergold: making tries and cues os not mean that you have to bid a slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: you are allowed to put the brakes on|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: and here is another likely game to be bid which has litle hope against the 4/1 trump brwk|pg||
nt|lestergold: but this time pessimism has paid off!|pg||
mb|p|pc|d4|nt|lestergold: actually Hasset has judged well not to cue his hearts beause he has no aces|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed but the adrenaline rush sometimes makes you do it|pg||
nt|lestergold: slam actually makes as cards lie it makes by an unusual means|pg||
nt|roswolf: but neverthess well done to e/w to reach a sensible contract|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lestergold: Peter has devalued his spade holding because of hearther's somewhat dubious noise here|pg||
nt|ady:  how doestheir relay system allows them to stop so low with 25 hcp and major suit fit?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes the strong no- trumpers might bid it 1NT - 3NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: its amazing how players always feel when not vul that thye have to get their pesky 5 card spade suits in however useless teh suigt and however useless the hand|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|roswolf: these are 60 bd matches (3 x20) and the VP scale applicable means that it is very hard to score big wins to get a max 25vps you need + 80 imps|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|lestergold: the JT spades mans spades can be set up for onlyu one ruff and that produces 4 discards for the  daimonds!|pg||

nt|dburn: well, 2=4=5=2 is the most frequent off-shape 1NT opening|pg||
nt|dburn: for very good reasons|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C!|an|11-13|mb|p|nt|dburn: I don't know - certainly pass would be forcing for most experts, so 2@s "ought to" be a bad hand with a lot of spades|pg||

mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|athene: well, West didn't have a 4@S bid if it wasn't forcing|pg||
nt|dburn: in that particular auction (when 1NT doubled is removed to 2@c) there is some case for transfers|pg||
nt|athene: it's debatable if she did even if it was|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|cindy:  why would pass be forcing ?|pg||
nt|athene: because it's considered infra dig to let opps play in 2@C after you whacked them in 1nt|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d4|nt|athene: and making pass forcing gives you more sequences to have misunderstandings over|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s5|pc|sQ|pc|sT|pg||

nt|dburn: well, if partner doubles (or opens) 1NT and you have a zero count, the chances are you will end up in the merde anyway|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|cindy:  well   thats exactly what i hold a lot|pg||
nt|cindy:  besides   most people play 2C is still stayman over a double|pg||
nt|dburn: in that case, first do not play forcing passes, and second do not play for money|pg||
nt|cindy:  2C still stayman, system still on, and more|pg||
nt|cindy:  to play 2C as natural is too confining|pg||
nt|athene: system on over X is much more popular in america with strong notrumps but in england it tends to be clubs, because of the weak-nt thing|pg||
nt|vugraphzyj: Holland asks for the screen to be lowered|pg||
nt|dburn: I'm not sure I could live with those methods over a penalty double, but Michelle Brunner and I are the last two people left on Earth who play penalty doubles of a strong no trump ...|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|dburn: flat? there was already a swing in this match, was there not?|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|nt|dburn: well, North opened 1@s because he had spades|pg||
nt|dburn: then East doubled because he was too strong for 1NT|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: Dhondy wont miss this game|pg||

pc|s9|pc|sK|pc|s3|nt|yo_yo: what do they say about 6-5 hands?|pg||

nt|roswolf: roland provides virtual cokes mike:)|pg||

nt|yo_yo: "6-5 come alive"|pg||
nt|dburn: and an initial failure to double 1NT, noch zu|pg||
nt|lestergold: and Dhondy knows that any finessesa re working |pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Crouch asks about discards: reverse count|pg||
nt|dburn: but the bidding would have been the same if South had not had the jack of diamonds|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: so I tyhink thi swas another lost opporunity to take eithjer the vul game or a 500 penalty|pg||
pc|h8|nt|dburn: and then nobody would be criticising anyone for anything|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: but he gives virtual kroners and virtual danishj pastries and real tellings off!|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|dburn: well, East-West will be in game here|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@c = 4+ hearts|pg||

mb|2D!|an|5 hearts|mb|p|nt|dburn: 2@d = two hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: however hearts are ruled out|pg||
nt|lestergold: for amkeable slam purposes that is|pg||
mb|3C!|an|nat GF|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|dburn: or "at most two hearts", since Crouch is perfectly capabale of having a singleton for 1NT|pg||
nt|ady: there is play for 3NT   making 5 diamonds 3 hearts  and a blck trick     nice lay with 10X@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: o0f course horrible duplication in diamodns 3 of the combined 30 points straight into the skip|pg||
nt|roswolf: artificial relays show their potential|pg||
mb|4H|nt|roswolf: play resumes in55 mins at the top of the hour|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm this time Crough's upgrade and Patterson's reasonable optimism has pushed them overboard|pg||
nt|dburn: haven't yet known him to have a void, but only because he has not yet tailored the system so that he can show one|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|lestergold: 4H the only reasonable spot here|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps east should have doubled 2@D?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6N on the non diamond lead and backwards spade guess|pg||
nt|lestergold: all fantasy land stuff|pg||
nt|roswolf:  spec suggests 5D by waterlow now |pg||
nt|lestergold: well they asre on a bidding roller coaster|pg||
nt|lestergold: on as steep dive into   the......|pg||
nt|lestergold: which mire?|pg||
nt|lestergold: they had better stop ion 5H|pg||
nt|roswolf: well 5@H can be made|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes and it can also fail|pg||
nt|lestergold: ultimately it will need as good view in spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: south whatever he bids has confirmed the diamond lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: well yes the clubs do set up for a discard|pg||
nt|lestergold: but what about this contract???|pg||
nt|roswolf: off|pg||
pc|s4|nt|roswolf: oh well what do i know|pg||

nt|lestergold: has to make now|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cQ|nt|lestergold: unluck that 3 of east's points are on the scrap heap of course|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|c6|nt|dburn: North won't cover the jack - that would be absurd|pg||

nt|lestergold: and you get the egg on face|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is a coin flip|pg||
nt|lestergold: odds with the spades 6 missing compared to 5 hearts |pg||

mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|dburn: you are|pg||
mb|3N|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: redouble?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: double? with a void in clubs???|pg||
nt|dburn: well, I guess it might cause West to think about running, but...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe he is trying to get someone to run, but the tempo of the EW bids seemed normal|pg||
nt|athene: of course, you have to be careful doubling 3nt when opps might have bid it off a long suit, but here that is less likely?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why not try to get doubled in 4D instead?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: brave decision|pg||
pc|d6|nt|marlowepi: equal upside, smaller downside|pg||
pc|h3|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: michelle near certain spades will yield 2 tricks|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d8|nt|dburn: but that is a truly bewildering effort by North|pg||
pc|s3|pc|d5|pg||
nt|athene: yes double does seem strange since 3nt makes and opps don't even have six clubs to run|pg||

nt|roswolf: we have a strange attitude to sponsors generally|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: we need some movie star  looks maybe|pg||
nt|lestergold: we have astrange atitude to ninternational competition in brideg and indeed many other sports altogether|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S   makes for n/s     not clear whether they will reach game|pg||
nt|roswolf: well there was excitement in the other room|pg||
nt|lestergold: well could be duplicated hee|pg||
mb|5D|nt|roswolf: an acol opening from south - 1NT for the rest of us |pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: unlikely to identify this perfecto fit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: no way can richard move opposit Heather's epected ore emptive raise|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes 3@S will be pre-emptive|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is this premier league part of the trials this year?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: of course the game does require diamonds to behave as well as no nasty breaks so its below 50% which is not good odds for a non vulnerable game|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Fleet looking at convention card|pg||
nt|roswolf: but with a few less guarantees - especially for the europeans|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: now EW's system file|pg||
nt|lestergold: no i think Hacjkett's decsion here a lot soundr than north's in the open room|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ady: norths hand very suitable   both queens pulling weight|pg||
nt|lestergold: sadly dimaonds dont behave and it costs 500 so not taht great a save but its still a profit|pg||
nt|lestergold: has to play it carefully|pg||
nt|lestergold: not to lose 800|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry im blind its only 300 of course not vul im gettinmg tired even better praise for Hackett|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lestergold: open oom decision very poor|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Richard Fleet bio: http://www.bcmchess.co.uk/bp/authors.htm Richard Fleet|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lestergold: north should realise that e/w ae bound to have a stack of clubs to run|pg||
nt|lestergold: well hackett realised it|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|roswolf: heather understandably did think her hand was a GOOD raise|pg||
nt|lestergold: i prefer playing a heart to the ten here|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|roswolf: so do i|pg||
nt|lestergold: im surprised here Hackett cannot afford to end up with a club loser|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: of course eaqst cannot take advantage of what seems to have been a frare card play error by Hackett|pg||
nt|roswolf: only -2|pg||
nt|lestergold: it was always going to be only -2|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Hackett is dummy |pg||
pc|c2|pc|h8|nt|yo_yo: it's not quite a preemptive raise  nor good enough for a limit raise, one of those annoying hands|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think that 3S is a perfecly normal raise over 2H she simply cannot make an unassuming cue bid raise with taht colelction|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I dont know much about Patterson   does anyone else?|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h6|nt|lestergold: oh i really am asleep the card play rrors are a little ore frequent by Waterlow|pg||

nt|athene: well she wanted to be sure of nine tricks|pg||
nt|dburn: still, she did very well in the bidding - I confess, I'd have run|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|an|14-16|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: yes, as i said spade honors were pretty sure to lie well, but she chose to be 100% safe instead of 99+|pg||
nt|athene: win the lead and play a spade was possible - might well lead to an overtrick - but you might go down if @SKQ aren't onside and there is a heart shift?|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|dburn: if @sKQ aren't onside, what does North have for his double?|pg||
mb|3C|an|GF|nt|athene: sure, but you don't risk vul doubled games on the basis that opps probably aren't mad, do you?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|an|values, !C support|nt|cindy:  thats what you can say to your teammates when you go down.   sorry, he didnt have his double.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, he can spend his time as dummy on this hand trying to see if he can sell his teammates the explanation "it was obviously takeout for the majors" :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: obviously with diamond tolerance in reserve|pg||
mb|5C|nt|dburn: odd, this - why not 3@d to show values?|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt is anxious but making on a heart lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: yes, it looks as though north feels the same|pg||
nt|vugraphzyj: Brunner asks the same, Silverstone answers 3@D would be a 5 card suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: friendly hand, both games make|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|nt|dburn: this was a pretty good effort, though - 5@c by North much healthier than 3NT by South|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dont they both need the same things?|pg||
nt|athene: also you might go lots down in 3nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzyj: Brunner asks if DIxon has promised a major: answer no|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose you can run the clubs first before the spade hook|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
nt|athene: so it's not that bad|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|nt|athene: but you are lots down if the heart is wrong of course|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would rather be in 3N. since E passed originally, he is very unlikely to have all the critical big cards|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d2|pc|cK|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|dburn: he doesn't need all of them - the ace of hearts would be enough|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|pc|dA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and 3N has more chance of making when S king is off|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s3|pc|d6|pc|dK|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|pc|s5|pc|d5|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d7|pc|c9|mc|11|nt|athene: holland should have showed declarer his @SK at trick 1, to speed things up :)|pg||
nt|dburn: er... on a heart lead, 3NT has no chance of making when @sK is wrong, even if @hA is right|pg||
nt|vugraphzyj: They're just looking for board 1|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well sometimes you can endplay LHO|pg||
pg||

nt|roswolf: for ensuring that this fine event is brought to BBO vugraph. Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentator Mike for his wit and perceptive comments and to our specs whose ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: contributions keep us on our toes!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: yes won the Gold Cup and regular high finisher in national events - based in Kent|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: part score hand    2@S  for e/w  abouth the limit|pg||
nt|roswolf: nice auction by n/s in the other room|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lestergold: it will be hard here for Peter to not bid too many spades at some point|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: one wasted K and duplication in the heart suit|pg||
mb|2C|nt|lestergold: 5C the best spot of course but 3N is infrangible as cards lie|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|lestergold: mind you thats the advanatge of a strong club system|pg||
nt|lestergold: it can stop here|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps peter's system is quite good at staying low but.....|pg||
nt|lestergold: and it needs to!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: lets see|pg||
nt|ady: yes many might get overboard here with that great spade suit     can be thatg those opening 1@S  may be better placed   might be passed out|pg||
mb|2H!|an|4 sp|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: not many pass these days with a 5 count though|pg||
mb|2N|nt|lestergold: a lot of players would wheel out 4S to begin with|pg||

nt|yo_yo: well done EW|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h3|nt|lestergold: forced spade finesse 9 tricks|pg||

nt|lestergold: what is he thinking about- has east made a mistkae and still has  heart in his hand|pg||
