pc|cQ|nt|Walddk4: Hello Ed and Andy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and Deyan, our operator|pg||
nt|othered1: west reasonably passed over 1N.  Not sure if it was judgment or a systemic lack of an appropriate call (i.e., double has a conventional meaning)|pg||

nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|Walddk4: N-S  Romania    E-W  Bulgaria|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Stara Zagora is the organiser of the event.It is in Bulgaria. And the other team is from Buchurest (Romania)|pg||
nt|lestergold: thx Roland|pg||

mb|1D!|nt|vugraphzym: EW are playing precision|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|lestergold: 3N by West probable diamond lead and no sweat|pg||
nt|andyv:  if 2N is invite, it is a heavy one|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: as Roberto pointed out the timing is very important in such boards - as we like to say in Bulgaria "1 second careless = dead for the rest of your life" :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzym: 2NT should be invitational hand yes|pg||
pc|d3|nt|andyv:  good morning everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Good morning, Andy|pg||
nt|andyv:  E sequence usually reserved for hands that are just short of game forcing  bids|pg||
nt|lestergold: any lead except a club helps and no one is kicking off with the stiff club ace|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lestergold: even a spade lead sets up a spade trick for declarer|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ybob: :)|pg||
nt|star6ija: theyare trying to strike back immediately|pg||

pc|c2|nt|sharkey: Good morning|pg||

pc|c4|pc|cT|nt|Walddk4: Hello Andy and Carl|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Carl and roland|pg||
nt|ybob: down 2 AK @S low @C , later ruff @S|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@s would have set trump and asked for cue bids|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|andyv:  all roads lead to 9 tricks, Mike? :))|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d8|pg||
nt|andyv:  and Deyan:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: it didnt run out of steam that quickly :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  they decided to bring it to a boil:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - this auction not for the faint hearted...|pg||
nt|andyv:  so, the question is why E didn't simply open 4@s if that was what he was intending to bid all the time?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well ironically a club lead and declarer has to do abit of guesswork|pg||
nt|andyv:  probably no over tricks|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|andyv:  this can go down 500 easily|pg||
nt|ybob: 4/2 @S shows even and interest @C|pg||
nt|star6ija: but @d now will bring the contract home|pg||
nt|othered1: Right -- a hand worth 2@C in playing strength but with inadequate high cards for the call.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|othered1: I thought that was standard, but east's action here is what I see regularly at the table.  Times changed, I guess.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|sharkey: set before they get started|pg||
nt|andyv:  a pretty steep price to pay to protect against a partial|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|pc|cJ|pc|s5|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think so Ed.|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: N had played 2@D on the A of spade so he was obliged to play it|pg||
nt|lestergold: well no he doesnt of course because then there has to be a switch!!|pg||

pc|sT|pg||
pc|s9|pc|hJ|pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sharkey: may be not - declarer probably cannot afford to pull trumps before playing @S|pg||
nt|sharkey: assume East Dbl on suspicion here|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: he can pull trumps and play on clubs|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|hT|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: 14-16 :)|pg||

nt|ritong: ok ty|pg||
nt|edmunte1: they switched to 14-16, as i told you is a new partenership|pg||
nt|ritong: anyways, west is mini and should be able to express it|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: Rotaru passed with obvios unpleasure :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: if 3 NT meant " i ve got crap", east should slow down and avoid cues|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|edmunte1: i think 3nt shows a min|pg||
nt|ritong: i like it|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: 3@s - slam try with fit in @h , 3NT = minimum|pg||
nt|ritong: okay, so 4@c was a noise|pg||

nt|edmunte1: yes|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|cA|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|edmunte1: one overtrick possible now|pg||
nt|ritong: however, playing the other major as a slam try with no obvious source of tricks is excellent|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|nt|ritong: is mandatory after a 2 NT opening and, as we can see, can work after 1 NT as well|pg||

pc|c7|pc|h4|pc|d6|pg||
pc|h8|mc|11|nt|edmunte1: another possible treatment is to play 3 in other major as any splinter with fit, reserving 4@c and 4@d for RKCB bal, respectively mild SI|pg||

nt|sharkey: yes - if make only lose 170 points|pg||
nt|sharkey: not the game bonus in addition|pg||
nt|andyv:  2 questionable bids (2@h and 4@s) produce an inadaquate result|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  easy slam for EW and easy safe for NS|pg||
nt|andyv:  save|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h for EW|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|andyv:  right|pg||
nt|ybob: 4@H EW|pg||
nt|othered1: 6@D is cold, but 6@S is a fine save.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  yes, 6@s almost makes|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|othered1: On a good day, 6@S might even make|pg||
nt|andyv:  6@d now|pg||
mb|2H|nt|andyv:  W thrilled with pd's dbl|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS still not underbidding...|pg||
nt|sharkey: especially S|pg||
nt|andyv:  how would you have bid the W hand, Ed?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|andyv:  3@h a bit aggressive|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: looks like down 1|pg||
nt|othered1: Not that way.|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think this is the optimum way|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: though 4N, if clearly unusual, is decent, planning to convert 5@C to 5@D, thus a slam try (if partner doesn't think you have a red 2-suiter)|pg||
nt|andyv:  would you think about passing the first time and "limping in" later?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well in spite of 4/1 heart break and unfavourable position of KS E/W have  plenty of strength t make 4h here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Results and standings after 3 rounds at   http://bridge.bg/ranking163.html|pg||
nt|andyv:  @s lead will make it very tough|pg||
nt|lestergold: lose a dim and 2 spades must just take care with the timing|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lestergold: this makes it very untough tho|pg||
nt|andyv:  it would seem so|pg||
pc|dT|nt|othered1: This makes, doesn't it?|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes... shoud make 5|pg||
nt|andyv:  should|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sharkey: unless something happens in the @D suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  should be able to make 9 tricks|pg||
nt|othered1: At his vulnerability, all passing would do is give NS a chance to find an eventual save.|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: South may be thinking that the best defnce holding 4 trumps is to try and set up a force in which case diamonds was the best prospect|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|lestergold: bearing in mind that the diamond bid didnt promise diamonds|pg||
nt|andyv:  don't understand the need to play @ss immediately|pg||
nt|andyv:  now @d and @d ruff, forcing E to ruff with Q may create real problems|pg||
nt|lestergold: shout a dim straight back altho better if draws a trump ot so first|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|pc|c6|pc|cA|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|nt|vugraphzym: he should not play K of @H to make 9 I think|pg||

nt|lestergold: you pass with north because you o not want to see pard's expression when you table that as dummy|pg||

nt|ybob: WOW|pg||
nt|othered1: but it's a good one, I think|pg||
nt|andyv:  gave up a club trick so I'm no so sure how good it is|pg||
nt|othered1: gave up a trick?|pg||
nt|andyv:  it hasn't yet but it's frozen the suit so N can never lead it|pg||
nt|othered1: What other lead beats it?  South wins @D and plays another @C before east can drive last @S, no?|pg||
nt|andyv:  now E can play the hand straight up|pg||
pc|s7|nt|othered1: Nice pass by east, for play in @D, but 3N is there for the taking.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this is 2 off at least|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s6|pg||
nt|sharkey: in my book N hand a clear 1 NT opener|pg||
nt|lestergold: a trump lead would have been  reasonably murderous|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pc|s3|pc|s9|pg||
pc|dT|nt|othered1: playing K may mislead south|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think anything else beats it... I just don't understand leading from Jx of a minor when pd has opened a major.  Why not lead pd's suit?|pg||
nt|othered1: inspiration counts|pg||
nt|andyv:  it would also make me open suits that I don't want the lead because I know pd will never lead my suit:)|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't hate that lead at all.  South does have enough @H length that he might decide to try to attack elsewhre|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|andyv:  game set and match|pg||

pc|h2|nt|othered1: But maybe north should have enouraged @C at trick 1, or if they play upside down signals south should have continued|pg||
nt|andyv:  J@c turned out to be a good lead... S had to follow thru|pg||
nt|othered1: did north discourage or did south ignore it?|pg||

nt|lestergold: 3N with qxx of dims somehat foolhardy|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: defence can only cash first 7 triks|pg||
nt|andyv:  conceivable for EW to take the first 7 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: you can find results after 3rd round here -> http://bridge.bg/ranking163.html|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: dimaond lead guaranteed|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: is the 4 the right @D to lead ? |pg||
nt|lestergold: even if for any reason declarer was allowed to win this trick its cold off|pg||
pc|d7|nt|lestergold: I think so|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: cant you block the suit ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  i think 4@d is ok here|pg||
nt|andyv:  but J@d better|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes you can but doesnt matter with east havinmg an entry and if east hasnt an entry the contract would make|pg||
nt|andyv:  suit will block up period|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: I would have led the J or even the K probably|pg||
pc|d8|nt|othered1: This can put EW right back into the match, if OR pair takes the other side of the 50-50 shot.|pg||
nt|othered1: Or could lose a couple of imps if they play 6N|pg||
nt|andyv:  I'm trying to find the part of the auction which shows the @d fit has been found|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|andyv:  ugh|pg||
nt|lestergold: stuill only 8 tricks for declarer|pg||
pc|cA|nt|othered1: 6@D, choice of slams?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: I think 5@D might suggest @D game but not sure|pg||
nt|othered1: allowing a trick 1 claim|pg||
nt|andyv:  that sounds plausible|pg||

nt|lestergold: Andy you are trying hard to be polite straining at the seams Id say|pg||
mb|1H|nt|andyv:  empathy, Mike... we've all been there and done things at the table that later on we have no idea what we were thinking about.|pg||
mb|d|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|andyv:  wonder if EW are playing non forcing free bids...that would explain double instead of 1@S bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: not clear who is buying this hand 3h N/S limit already reached|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: yes - some of it not suitable for the Family Hour :)|pg||

nt|andyv:  E came here to bid:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: prtner has promised a good hand with a good 6 card suit he happens to have neither|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@d very playable|pg||
nt|lestergold: but if west is going to bid it should be 4s|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5D needs a lot of good guessing|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2c a dim  heart and a spade to be lost on a bad day|pg||
nt|andyv:  only @d hook... but if N covers 10@S immediately, 5@d will go down|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  i play it as forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: 5@D goes down with a @C switch aftrer K @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: this is a nice event... actually it started in the year of 2005 as Balkan Championship|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzym: W alerted 3@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4d may have a more realistic chance of a plus score|pg||
nt|andyv:  if they find the switch...pd doesn't always have 5 for his 3 level raise|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sharkey: agree Andy - 2@H may have been non-forcing|pg||
nt|andyv:  looking for @c slam?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sharkey: has it chances... but will probably fail|pg||
nt|star6ija: Mr Toni Rousev from Stara Zagora, supported by some local enthusiasts helped the idea to come true|pg||
nt|sharkey: how many nations participate Momchil?|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS used their rabbit's foot on this auction|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|nt|andyv:  slam asperations died a quick death|pg||

nt|vugraphzym: they are playing only 4 :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: although if W didnt have J of @C a club switch would have been vital even in 4|pg||
nt|andyv:  still, they should try to defend it properly|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|nt|star6ija: we have record concerning the number of the participants this year|pg||

nt|othered1: Hi!|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer needs to duck this club |pg||
pc|cK|pg||

pc|d7|pc|dT|nt|othered1: ty.  specifying side Ace could be very useful|pg||

nt|othered1: ty|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: it can be 5@C and 4@D|pg||
nt|ybob: playing strong @C i prefer rebids 3@C shows 5 / 5 m¬¥s max|pg||
nt|othered1: I'll be surprised if south bids again, on the misfit without knowing of extra @C length.|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|ybob: 3@D shows 5+ @D 4@C ...|pg||
pc|dK|nt|othered1: I'm more comfortable making an immediate strong bid on the south hand, like 2@H, if available.  Prevents decisions like this one, since partner would know of possible slam interest ...|pg||
nt|othered1: right away.|pg||
nt|lestergold: and now an avalanche of tricks for the defence|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|d8|nt|andyv:  in the ACBL, any NT that has a range of less than 10 cannot use any conventions with it (xfers, stayman, etc)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Bulgaria vs Romania|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Stan|pg||
mb|1D|an|precision|nt|Walddk2: Tell us about the Romanian players please, Eddy|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: very thin 4S EW here|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|edmunte1: Rotaru and Ghigheci is a new partnership, formed by 2 top romanian players|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 23 and 24 first, followed by comparisons from the closed room when we roll over to board 13|pg||
nt|edmunte1: Ghigheci is a former memeber of romanian team that reached quarterfinals in Beijing at Olympiad|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: for the results from first 3 rounds you can check at: http://bridge.bg/ranking163.html|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: certainly a part score in @S EW who never entered the auction|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: now they have :)|pg||
nt|edmunte1: Max Rotaru (Maxentius on BBO) is also a former memeber of romanian national squad|pg||
mb|3S|mb|d|nt|edmunte1: and one of my former partners|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: If Todorov passes, they had better defend well. Trump lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If not, declarer will take lots of tricks on cross-ruff|pg||
nt|edmunte1: i do not like double from North, whatever it means|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes @H lead will set up the cross ruff|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|nt|Walddk2: Just what declarer needed|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Walddk2: Now a trump switch comes too late|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|s3|pg||

nt|othered1: @S play, but may have cost a trick|pg||
nt|andyv:  only 1:40am here, Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: inaccurate typing|pg||
nt|lestergold: 1,40 a.m. id be wide awake Andy im a night bat|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|star6ija: 5@ss here is a good sacrifice againt 5@hs|pg||
nt|ybob: best defense was 2 round @C from S|pg||
nt|othered1: of course, going plus was the primary NS objective|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h by N?|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: 2N-3@d|pg||
nt|star6ija: 4@s :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  if you were investigating for slam... but are you with this hand?|pg||
nt|andyv:  despite all the inexactitudes, we have a very tight match|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|andyv:  think EW will bid that high?|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree on best defense|pg||
nt|andyv:  it's close|pg||
mb|d|nt|andyv:  support dbl|pg||
nt|ybob: easy 4@S here|pg||
nt|othered1: I'd be afraid to act as east.|pg||
nt|lestergold: I cant cope with that many syllables this time o the morning Andy|pg||
mb|1S|nt|othered1: This is a no-brainer to 650|pg||
nt|andyv:  E has had the afraid gene taken out of him|pg||
nt|othered1: now 4@D?|pg||
nt|andyv:  outstanding score by EW in the OR|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2S|nt|othered1: My partners might think I had something and overcompete|pg||
nt|lestergold: an outstandingly bad double in the open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: so far looks like Precision.  Is that what they play?|pg||
nt|ybob: yep|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: yes they play precision|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  yeap... making this auctiom more complicated than needed to be;)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|andyv:  would you pull dbl with E hand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: 3@D did stop slam and west might have had a normal looking @C lead, so I guess it was worth the risk|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  i think it's clear to pull|pg||
nt|star6ija: if 2@s is GF... pass is correct option|pg||
nt|andyv:  pd passed 1@D and you have maybe one defensive trick|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think 2@s can be GF...probably a limit raise with 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: so 2N showed @Sxxxxx|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: 2NT is 5332 I suppose|pg||
nt|star6ija: no... 2N is waiting|pg||
nt|ybob: 2@S dont ask trump suit|pg||
nt|star6ija: no it doesn't|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
nt|star6ija: as far as the hand is passed it just tries to define better game|pg||
nt|lestergold: this straight off on top|pg||
pc|s9|nt|andyv:  @d switch now|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|andyv:  one more shot at it|pg||
nt|andyv:  if N had AK of @h rather than AQ, then slam investigation would have been proper|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|othered1: "Precision" isn't a definitive description of system any more, as almost everyone has their own preferences.|pg||
nt|star6ija: if it wasn't passed hand, could be the same, or additional strength (principle of fast arrival)|pg||
nt|lestergold: doesnt east want to ruff any clubs for more off|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dJ|nt|othered1: declarer can even afford to misguess trumps|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
nt|star6ija: E has to raise with the King|pg||
nt|ybob: 1@C strong 16+ better :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|andyv:  not yet|pg||
pc|c2|nt|andyv:  he doens't know it yet|pg||
nt|andyv:  doesn't|pg||

pc|s7|pc|sA|nt|star6ija: now is late 12 IMPs leroumain|pg||
nt|andyv:  yeap|pg||
nt|othered1: true, but he'll have no choice but @H hook if he had|pg||
nt|andyv:  won't misguess now|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|andyv:  nope|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: declarerd doent know about the falling 10|pg||
nt|star6ija: oh Lord :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  declarer worried about 10|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: he wants to finnesse it|pg||
nt|andyv:  won't have to worry about it after this|pg||
nt|andyv:  but, will E duck??|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|pc|h2|pc|c9|pg||
nt|othered1: Fast arrival does have its useful spots but is an iffy style to  use all the time.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|star6ija: new expensive game is comming in the OR|pg||
pc|d8|nt|othered1: another way to make exactly r|pg||

mb|d|an|card showing|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: As Ming in the audience points out, 3@S was cold even on a trump lead. Trump, heart, trump, A clubs, ruff heart, ruff club, AK diamonds, ruff club, ruff heart... 2 top trumps, 2 ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: heart ruffs, A clubs, AK diamonds, 2 club ruffs|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|nt|star6ija: hope to see you in 2 hours for next round of this very interesting competition |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: in any thx excellent operator and very much enjoyed our double act Andy look forward to working with u again sometime|pg||
nt|lestergold: I'm gong back to bed for a nice kip|pg||
nt|andyv:  same here Mike...it was fun and some pretty zany boards kept us awake:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed|pg||
mb|2N|nt|andyv:  as a spec pointed out, 4H may be optimum contract|pg||
nt|othered1: but there's no reason for EW to know best positioning|pg||
nt|ybob: hard to humans not win 1¬∫ trick with K @D|pg||
nt|othered1: 3@D (4th suit still forcing?)|pg||
nt|star6ija: very nice comeback to Rossenovo team, who was 18 IMPs behind in first 2 boards|pg||
nt|star6ija: this 1@d bid could be very expensive|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: This is the last board for today. Thank you all. Tomorrow we start at 9CET.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzym: looks very easy to make|pg||
nt|star6ija: this will probably end plus one and 11 IMPs Cernato are just to come|pg||
nt|star6ija: and it was|pg||
nt|andyv:  thank you Ed and Momchil and all the specs who make these events fun and entertaining.|pg||
nt|othered1: wow, that was ineffective|pg||
nt|lestergold: youth bridge usually has some fun for specs and commenttaors but thre has been somje good signs of talent here|pg||
nt|andyv:  this should make|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: now even to overtricks are possible|pg||
pc|h5|nt|othered1: 5@C may survive for a nice pick-up, but can they get there?|pg||
nt|othered1: with only the @HQ possibly duplicated, east has so many tricks it feels timid not to make another move.  Of course, I don't know what west has shown exactly|pg||
nt|lestergold: isnt this leada bit damaging|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|othered1: Need good partnership to handle shortness cue-bids in partner's known long suits.|pg||
nt|ybob: disagree with 4@S|pg||
nt|othered1: that's another way to put it :)|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|othered1: That should end it firmly.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|star6ija: two|pg||
nt|andyv:  guess @hs right and as one spec points out, without @s lead, can make 6|pg||
nt|andyv:  at least the play won't take long|pg||
nt|lestergold: only 8 tricks on top here|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|nt|othered1: West doesn't see it my way, but without detailed system and style notes, it's hard to be sure where the rot set in|pg||
nt|ybob: i prefer bid 3@S over 3@C ...|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree with 3@S.  You bid 4th suit to set up forcing bid in @S, so why not bid hand out?|pg||
nt|ybob: where are extra cards from W ?|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@C bid, in casual partnerships, might have been seen as having strong preference and good support for @C that justified 4th suit auction.|pg||
nt|othered1: I personally think west had to respect the 5@C sign-off (if that'swhat it was.)  But he may be taking a shot against an expected @CAxxx in the east hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: This is the last board. Tx for all specs and kibtzs. We'll be back in 10 min for the last round of today|pg||
pc|s7|nt|othered1: West may think they aren't in a good position in this match.|pg||
nt|ybob: AXXX needs trump 2/2 in unbal hand sure, lost A @D ...|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|s3|pg||
nt|star6ija: once again :) big thanks everybody for joining us - see you in 2 PM CET (2 hours since now)|pg||
nt|othered1: Onthe other hand, a round robin is very much like a single match of great length, so shooting to win this match may not be best overall strategy|pg||
nt|andyv:  probably 5-7 hand with @d support and stiff @h|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|d5|pc|d4|nt|andyv:  W might have been worried about a 4-1 @h break|pg||
nt|andyv:  or was trying to get his name in the papers by smothering the 10x of @hs;)|pg||
nt|star6ija: 13th trick will save 1 IMP eventually|pg||
nt|star6ija: yup|pg||
