nt|ritong: ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: It would be nice if the pass said "I don't really have an opener" or "at least not a good one" but it doesn't -- it just distorts your holdings.|pg||

mb|3D|nt|andyv:  hard to comment on 4@c bid... except... where did that come from|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  and, yes, to all the specs.  I know it's a splinter... but rest of hand doesn't justify that bid|pg||
mb|3H|nt|andyv:  about an Ace short|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|panja: the bidding might have died in 1N..but with 7 HCP..E has taken a rosy view..he is likely to succeed but W will miss a few heartbeats on the way  ..|pg||

nt|sunit: hi all|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|panja: the problem with a light overcall on 1@H is that S could not show his @HQ safely..and so N did not lead a @H|pg||

mb|3D|mb|d|an|  |mb|p|mb|3S|nt|andyv:  depends on style...dbl followed by 2@s is often not forcing|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcwla: In this case it will work perfectly.|pg||
nt|andyv:  and E doesn't want to force with this hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Well, that's because W has a lousy opener.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|panja: S has chosen the dbl over 3@D...so he had to hurriedly close with 3Nt...note that it would have been better played by N|pg||
pc|h3|nt|panja: give one of N's @S to W and exchange a @D for it...3N by S would have been much more trouble than it would be here|pg||

nt|andyv:  9 tricks should be easy|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|jcwla: On many other hands the plan of doubling to bid 2@S later will either be blocked or not get you where you want to go.  As I say, though, can't argue w/success here.|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  ok, that makes sense|pg||

nt|andyv:  ty!|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: Sorry for the Wromg Update in the first trick.. It was due to a technical Failure... |pg||
nt|rvg: A Diamond shift would have beaten 2C I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: Wrong|pg||
nt|andyv:  meantime, W should have little trouble with this contract|pg||
nt|jcwla: A reopening double would work well here.  For newer players, a second double would not change the meaning of the original double -- S still has a hand that is takeout of @D's -- ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: but it shows extra strength and there's a suggestion when made over 2@C that S is probably something like this exact distribution.|pg||
