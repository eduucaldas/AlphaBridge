nt|mamos: game for ew|pg||
nt|mamos: although North doesnt think so|pg||

pc|h9|nt|ybob: Hi Deyan|pg||

nt|andyv:  4@s looks too expensive now|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: he can make 4@S |pg||
pc|h8|nt|vugraphzym: has to play small @C to earn an entry|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello Ed and Andy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and Deyan, our operator|pg||
nt|othered1: west reasonably passed over 1N.  Not sure if it was judgment or a systemic lack of an appropriate call (i.e., double has a conventional meaning)|pg||
nt|othered1: HI, Roland!|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Hi, Roland|pg||
nt|andyv:  good morning everyone|pg||
nt|andyv:  but N sees losing the first 3 tricks and still not sure where rest of tricks are coming from|pg||

nt|andyv:  looks like E may have trapped himself in his hand and was unable to get @hs started?|pg||

nt|Walddk4: N-S  Romania    E-W  Bulgaria|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Stara Zagora is the organiser of the event.It is in Bulgaria. And the other team is from Buchurest (Romania)|pg||
nt|lestergold: thx Roland|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N looks playable for EW|pg||
nt|star6ija: nice distribution|pg||
mb|1H|nt|vugraphzym: EW are playing precision|pg||
nt|star6ija: 7@c is possible, but...|pg||
nt|mamos: grand certainly looks a possibility|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: he put 1NT and then changed it :)|pg||
mb|2D|mb|d|nt|vugraphzym: 2@C should be @S and another suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|rado: W has minimum neg dbl here|pg||
mb|2N|nt|lestergold: 3N by West probable diamond lead and no sweat|pg||
nt|andyv:  if 2N is invite, it is a heavy one|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: as Roberto pointed out the timing is very important in such boards - as we like to say in Bulgaria "1 second careless = dead for the rest of your life" :)|pg||
nt|rado: E has a choise rebiding weak @H, 3 cards 2@S or upgrading to 2NT protekting minor Kings|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good morning to Ed Shapiro|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  wow....wonderful!!!|pg||
nt|andyv:  oops:)|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@S?  |pg||
nt|othered1: Fast arrival?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: 2NT should be invitational hand yes|pg||
nt|rado: hi Ed|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone, from chilly central Pennsylvania, USA|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Hi, Ed|pg||
pc|d5|nt|andyv:  good morning everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Good morning, Andy|pg||
nt|andyv:  E sequence usually reserved for hands that are just short of game forcing  bids|pg||
nt|lestergold: any lead except a club helps and no one is kicking off with the stiff club ace|pg||
nt|star6ija: this 2@s bid from S is not good option... in this vulnerability strong club has to be sa descriptive as quickly as possible|pg||
nt|mamos: have Ns agreed a suit?|pg||
nt|star6ija: @Ss? :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: I think 1@C is natural, star6i|pg||
nt|mamos: was 1@C strong or nat?|pg||
nt|star6ija: if so ok|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lestergold: even a spade lead sets up a spade trick for declarer|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ybob: :)|pg||
nt|star6ija: theyare trying to strike back immediately|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sharkey: Good morning|pg||
nt|andyv:  this auction will run out of steam quickly|pg||
nt|mamos: North thinks it's Hearts :)|pg||
nt|star6ija: 7@cs depends on some precautions which should've benn made by declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: it will be interesting if 6@H are bid wheather E will double :)|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|nt|Walddk4: Hello Andy and Carl|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Carl and roland|pg||
nt|ybob: down 2 AK @S low @C , later ruff @S|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@s would have set trump and asked for cue bids|pg||
nt|mamos: ugh|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: 7@S* looks the minimax|pg||
nt|mamos: well it makes but this has not been a good auction imho|pg||
nt|star6ija: 12 tricks are easy|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|andyv:  all roads lead to 9 tricks, Mike? :))|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|andyv:  and Deyan:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: it didnt run out of steam that quickly :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  they decided to bring it to a boil:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - this auction not for the faint hearted...|pg||
nt|andyv:  so, the question is why E didn't simply open 4@s if that was what he was intending to bid all the time?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well ironically a club lead and declarer has to do abit of guesswork|pg||
nt|andyv:  probably no over tricks|pg||
nt|rado: lack of communications between NS will help declare for 8 tricks|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|andyv:  this can go down 500 easily|pg||
nt|ybob: 4/2 @S shows even and interest @C|pg||
nt|star6ija: but @d now will bring the contract home|pg||
nt|othered1: Right -- a hand worth 2@C in playing strength but with inadequate high cards for the call.|pg||
nt|othered1: maybe even 9|pg||
nt|rado: sure with @S suit favourable|pg||
pc|h2|nt|othered1: I thought that was standard, but east's action here is what I see regularly at the table.  Times changed, I guess.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|pg||
nt|sharkey: set before they get started|pg||
nt|andyv:  a pretty steep price to pay to protect against a partial|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|pc|h3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think so Ed.|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: N had played 2@D on the A of spade so he was obliged to play it|pg||
nt|lestergold: well no he doesnt of course because then there has to be a switch!!|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c8|pc|h6|pc|d6|pg||

pc|h9|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dJ|pc|hT|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d9|nt|sharkey: may be not - declarer probably cannot afford to pull trumps before playing @S|pg||

nt|vugraphzym: he can pull trumps and play on clubs|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|pc|h7|pg||

nt|sharkey: yes - if make only lose 170 points|pg||
nt|sharkey: not the game bonus in addition|pg||
nt|andyv:  2 questionable bids (2@h and 4@s) produce an inadaquate result|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: This is the ranking after the previous round : http://bridge.bg/ranking163.html|pg||
nt|star6ija: I think that Romanians made it well, as far as agressive Bulgarian pair at the other table might have reached grand and clubs and to chose losing option which is equal as ...|pg||
nt|star6ija: percentage to the winning one|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  easy slam for EW and easy safe for NS|pg||

mb|1N|nt|andyv:  right|pg||

nt|othered1: 6@D is cold, but 6@S is a fine save.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  yes, 6@s almost makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: South's Pass is interesting|pg||
nt|mamos: North's 4@D is more interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: On a good day, 6@S might even make|pg||

nt|andyv:  how would you have bid the W hand, Ed?|pg||
nt|ybob: cold 7 tricks|pg||
nt|rado: and again some chases for more|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|andyv:  3@h a bit aggressive|pg||
nt|mamos: West has tremendous playing strength|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: the minimax here seems to be 6@H*|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|sharkey: looks like down 1|pg||
nt|othered1: Not that way.|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think this is the optimum way|pg||
pc|d2|nt|othered1: though 4N, if clearly unusual, is decent, planning to convert 5@C to 5@D, thus a slam try (if partner doesn't think you have a red 2-suiter)|pg||
nt|andyv:  would you think about passing the first time and "limping in" later?|pg||
nt|star6ija: playing yes but not defensive|pg||
pc|d7|nt|lestergold: well in spite of 4/1 heart break and unfavourable position of KS E/W have  plenty of strength t make 4h here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Results and standings after 3 rounds at   http://bridge.bg/ranking163.html|pg||
nt|andyv:  @s lead will make it very tough|pg||
nt|lestergold: lose a dim and 2 spades must just take care with the timing|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: this makes it very untough tho|pg||
nt|andyv:  it would seem so|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|othered1: This makes, doesn't it?|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes... shoud make 5|pg||
nt|andyv:  should|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mamos: surely East will bid 5@s|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d4|nt|sharkey: unless something happens in the @D suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  should be able to make 9 tricks|pg||
nt|othered1: At his vulnerability, all passing would do is give NS a chance to find an eventual save.|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lestergold: South may be thinking that the best defnce holding 4 trumps is to try and set up a force in which case diamonds was the best prospect|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: bearing in mind that the diamond bid didnt promise diamonds|pg||
nt|andyv:  don't understand the need to play @ss immediately|pg||
nt|andyv:  now @d and @d ruff, forcing E to ruff with Q may create real problems|pg||
nt|lestergold: shout a dim straight back altho better if draws a trump ot so first|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ybob: 8@C look to @S|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mamos: thats quite some three boards to start with|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||

nt|sharkey: Leromain picked up another 5 IMPs when W opened 1 NT in OR and played there|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: he just claimed|pg||
nt|ybob: 2@H = 5+ @H  13/16 pts |pg||
nt|ybob: WOW|pg||

nt|andyv:  gave up a club trick so I'm no so sure how good it is|pg||
nt|othered1: gave up a trick?|pg||
nt|andyv:  it hasn't yet but it's frozen the suit so N can never lead it|pg||
nt|othered1: What other lead beats it?  South wins @D and plays another @C before east can drive last @S, no?|pg||
nt|andyv:  now E can play the hand straight up|pg||
nt|mamos: 43 imps have changed hand son Boards 1-3 so -300 may be the flattest board yet|pg||

nt|othered1: playing K may mislead south|pg||

nt|othered1: inspiration counts|pg||
nt|andyv:  it would also make me open suits that I don't want the lead because I know pd will never lead my suit:)|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't hate that lead at all.  South does have enough @H length that he might decide to try to attack elsewhre|pg||

nt|andyv:  J@c turned out to be a good lead... S had to follow thru|pg||
nt|othered1: did north discourage or did south ignore it?|pg||

mb|p|nt|sharkey: in my book 1 NT rebid wud show 18-19 and Dbl the actual hand|pg||
pc|s7|nt|andyv:  if they play variable NT, this might have a different meaning for them|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - obviously|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3C looks makeable|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@d has to be some type of checkback, but 2@s looks like sign off|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sK|nt|othered1: So, slam and no slam are both reasonable|pg||
nt|andyv:  6@d not even on a finesse|pg||
nt|othered1: really?|pg||

nt|andyv:  but otherwise I agree..1N shows about 18-19|pg||

pc|c4|nt|othered1: how do you make 6@D without finesse?|pg||
nt|andyv:  you are right...need the @c hook to dump the @s|pg||

nt|vugraphzym: cant you discard your @C on hearts|pg||
nt|andyv:  but still have a @h and @s loser if you do that|pg||

nt|lestergold: 3N with qxx of dims somehat foolhardy|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: defence can only cash first 7 triks|pg||
nt|andyv:  conceivable for EW to take the first 7 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: you can find results after 3rd round here -> http://bridge.bg/ranking163.html|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: dimaond lead guaranteed|pg||

nt|lestergold: even if for any reason declarer was allowed to win this trick its cold off|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think so|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: cant you block the suit ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  i think 4@d is ok here|pg||
nt|andyv:  but J@d better|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes you can but doesnt matter with east havinmg an entry and if east hasnt an entry the contract would make|pg||
nt|andyv:  suit will block up period|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: I would have led the J or even the K probably|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|othered1: This can put EW right back into the match, if OR pair takes the other side of the 50-50 shot.|pg||
nt|othered1: Or could lose a couple of imps if they play 6N|pg||
nt|andyv:  I'm trying to find the part of the auction which shows the @d fit has been found|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|andyv:  ugh|pg||
nt|lestergold: stuill only 8 tricks for declarer|pg||
pc|h5|nt|othered1: 6@D, choice of slams?|pg||

nt|lestergold: Andy you are trying hard to be polite straining at the seams Id say|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  empathy, Mike... we've all been there and done things at the table that later on we have no idea what we were thinking about.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|vugraphzym: I think S's hand was pretty good and there was a finesse on and still down 1|pg||
nt|ybob: slam time|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|andyv:  wonder if EW are playing non forcing free bids...that would explain double instead of 1@S bid|pg||

mb|p|nt|sharkey: yes - some of it not suitable for the Family Hour :)|pg||

mb|3H|nt|lestergold: oh|pg||
nt|rado: but he decided to jump reverse immy|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 2@C a variation of New Minor Forcing...?|pg||

nt|ybob: i prefer play 10 from dummy to invite another @D round|pg||
nt|andyv:  E came here to bid:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: prtner has promised a good hand with a good 6 card suit he happens to have neither|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@d very playable|pg||
nt|lestergold: but if west is going to bid it should be 4s|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5D needs a lot of good guessing|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2c a dim  heart and a spade to be lost on a bad day|pg||
nt|andyv:  only @d hook... but if N covers 10@S immediately, 5@d will go down|pg||
nt|ybob: yes|pg||
nt|othered1: after west supports @H, east will push the rest of the way|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: no way they can miss the slam now|pg||
nt|rado: facing strongest sequence available E has to check key  cards only for grand:)|pg||
nt|othered1: East's black honors are key in an auction like this.|pg||
mb|4S!|nt|andyv:  i play it as forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: 5@D goes down with a @C switch aftrer K @H|pg||
nt|rado: rkcb for @H maybe|pg||
nt|othered1: Only question for east may be whether a black suit might be more solid than @H.|pg||
nt|ybob: 5@H = 2+Q @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: this is a nice event... actually it started in the year of 2005 as Balkan Championship|pg||
nt|othered1: with west having a possible pitch on the @D.|pg||
nt|rado: AQJx Qxx x AKJxx might be W's hand:)|pg||
nt|ybob: i play 6Nt with E hand|pg||
nt|othered1: That's what I was considering|pg||
nt|rado: so after KC reply some pick a slam bid would be nice|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: W is holding his head|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: he seems not to understand 4@S bid|pg||
nt|othered1: if you have a pick a slam call available after setting trumps with RKC|pg||
nt|ybob: kickback ?|pg||
nt|rado: if E had 4-4 in Majors with FG he may bid 4@S directly, so now he has more|pg||
nt|ybob: i dont like a 4º suit in a Fg sequence|pg||
mb|5H!|nt|vugraphzym: W alerted 3@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4d may have a more realistic chance of a plus score|pg||
nt|andyv:  if they find the switch...pd doesn't always have 5 for his 3 level raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: now he alerted and explained RBC|pg||
nt|rado: btw other room stoped at 4@H|pg||
nt|rado: so a swing expected|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: agree Andy - 2@H may have been non-forcing|pg||
nt|andyv:  looking for @c slam?|pg||
mb|6H|nt|sharkey: has it chances... but will probably fail|pg||
nt|star6ija: Mr Toni Rousev from Stara Zagora, supported by some local enthusiasts helped the idea to come true|pg||
nt|sharkey: how many nations participate Momchil?|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS used their rabbit's foot on this auction|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  slam asperations died a quick death|pg||
nt|sharkey: this may be trouble too...|pg||
nt|star6ija: 2 years ago Balkan Championship started to change its locality... Bucarest year ago and Novi Sad (Serbia) - November this year|pg||
nt|lestergold: partner can show count|pg||
nt|othered1: In other room, I think east didin't give enough value to the black honors|pg||
pc|h9|nt|othered1: A little lucky that 6@H is so playable,  6N didnt seem to be under consideration.  Guess ruffing out long @C suit was possible|pg||
pc|hT|nt|andyv:  if N is listening:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: or dont they have such sophisticated kit|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok, Mike, pay up:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: pay up?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: they are playing only 4 :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: although if W didnt have J of @C a club switch would have been vital even in 4|pg||

nt|ybob: now ? 3@S or 4@C ?|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|othered1: real @H support, providing an easy, natural rebid makes the difference to me|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ybob: ??|pg||
nt|othered1: do we know why 2@C was alerted?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: it shows at least 9 minor cards|pg||
nt|ybob: m´s i think 9 + cards|pg||
nt|othered1: ty|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: it can be 5@C and 4@D|pg||
nt|ybob: playing strong @C i prefer rebids 3@C shows 5 / 5 m´s max|pg||
nt|othered1: I'll be surprised if south bids again, on the misfit without knowing of extra @C length.|pg||
nt|ybob: hard to S|pg||
nt|ybob: HX  X  5/6@D  4@C ...|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ybob: 3@D shows 5+ @D 4@C ...|pg||
pc|cK|nt|othered1: I'm more comfortable making an immediate strong bid on the south hand, like 2@H, if available.  Prevents decisions like this one, since partner would know of possible slam interest ...|pg||
nt|othered1: right away.|pg||
nt|lestergold: and now an avalanche of tricks for the defence|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hi Robert and Ed|pg||
pc|s3|nt|andyv:  in the ACBL, any NT that has a range of less than 10 cannot use any conventions with it (xfers, stayman, etc)|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|nt|vugraphzym: J of spade confused the declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: he must be wondering who is lying|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|lestergold: a brave pass of the second round takeout double denying much high card strenth|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lestergold: ducking wouldnt have helped tho|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|nt|othered1: can set up a @C but there's no useful pitch|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|lestergold: but as cards lie 3S has no play|pg||
pc|cT|nt|othered1: Looks like they'll find the iffy slam.|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|c7|pc|c3|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ybob: lost grand slam :) !!|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ybob: 13 cold tricks |pg||
nt|lestergold: only fifties|pg||
pc|s7|nt|star6ija: it is bad for defense to shorten declare's trumps|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ybob: ruff @S @C to K trump|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|d7|nt|andyv:  they always play the J here|pg||
nt|star6ija: Jack is the right play|pg||

nt|othered1: Another just about exactly 50 percent game.  NV staying out isn't hopeless, but nowadays pairs bid games.|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: If north weren't a passed hand, south might have tried a responsive double, pretty aggressively|pg||
mb|1S|nt|othered1: south may have choices here, including a gambling 3N.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: well an interesting 20/20 hand here|pg||
mb|d|nt|star6ija: normally, restrictaions in regular clubs should be made in accordance with the most recent Contract Bridge Laws|pg||
nt|othered1: if you play (really) weak jump shift responses, north might h ave qualified.|pg||
nt|rado: seems E believes in reopening|pg||
mb|r|nt|lestergold: No  high level contracts making here for anyone|pg||
nt|othered1: Do you double with east's hand?  Or bid 1N?  or pass?|pg||
nt|ybob: i prefer 1NT over X|pg||
nt|ybob: X with 4333  dont like|pg||
nt|rado: if K@S was in other suits could dbl|pg||
nt|lestergold: 1N whats the problem a balace 11|pg||
nt|othered1: My choices would be pass, 1N and dbl in that order|pg||
nt|othered1: We rarely trap at these colors|pg||
nt|lestergold: pass is allowed at unfavourable but normal balance range is 11-14|pg||
mb|2D|nt|othered1: only 4?|pg||
nt|star6ija: it would be interesting how Ivanova will deal with 4@h here|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Momchil!|pg||
nt|othered1: Do you play pass of the redouble as penalty?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzym: yes he bid 4@D|pg||
nt|ybob: p p p ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2H fo N/S maybe 2/3 dims or E/W|pg||
mb|p|nt|rado: 2@H has a play|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: W alerted 2@D|pg||
nt|ybob: becuase E is passed hand i prefer 1NT , pass , never X|pg||
nt|rado: maybe transfer?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2D presumably an intended transfer to hearts|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@D looks like a misentry|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: yes but E didnt understand it?|pg||
nt|lestergold: or as u say a misentry|pg||
nt|lestergold: something is seriously remiss at any rate|pg||
nt|rado: but N is happy|pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: mind you with the 5/0 heart break 2h may well be unmaneagable|pg||
nt|lestergold: if passed it will be a misery|pg||
nt|rado: and surely will find the lead|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sharkey: im thinking ACBL which different in many respect than European standards|pg||
nt|andyv:  lots of club games in the states make up their own rules... mostly to keep the paying customers happy|pg||
nt|star6ija: hello, Andy :)|pg||
nt|othered1: south to the rescue|pg||
nt|lestergold: South is still there wantinmg to say i really do have a mountain pard|pg||
nt|othered1: But there was no reason for south to know the wheels were coming off EW|pg||
nt|lestergold: giving west a chance to er em show his er second suit!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  the bigger ones adhere to the ACBL standards|pg||
nt|othered1: Bidding 2@H is normal, despite suit disparities, planning to rebid @S, showing extras for sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: @d lead ould be helpful for declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: if east wakes up he may not give preference by bidding 3D|pg||
nt|othered1: I think the redouble opposite a passed partner showed the strength adequately, but the double did imply the shape|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: cant win 4@D or 4@H|pg||
nt|andyv:  ask and you will receive:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: north wants out of this auction badly|pg||
nt|ybob: 2@H  -1 surely|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like one offski|pg||
nt|othered1: or 2|pg||
nt|lestergold: surely a spade lead then 3 losers in each major unavoidable|pg||
pc|s9|nt|star6ija: this is fine policy|pg||
nt|sharkey: i have to leave now - ty all - enjoyed|pg||
nt|sharkey: bye|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Carl...see you soon|pg||
nt|othered1: In OR, east knew to stay out, after south opened 1@C (presumably big)|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer lucky with the minors no losers unless there is an 'accident' in dims|pg||
nt|lestergold: like ducking when north switches to a diamondafter ruffing the third spade needs presence of mind here|pg||
pc|s4|nt|othered1: I think north was timid, if south's 2@C openings aren't a joke.|pg||
nt|othered1: quite helpful -- splits here make this far from easy but that lead softens things up for declarer|pg||
nt|andyv:  now can play it off the top|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: defence should probably make 3 spades a club and 2 heart tricks|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sK|nt|star6ija: Leroumain's team is going to finish the match a little bit agressively|pg||
nt|andyv:  putting pressure on declarer|pg||
nt|othered1: declarer has to be careful, but 10 tricks look easy, even with @C tap here|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|star6ija: they made compensation to 3@ss contract which is cold on the actual laydown|pg||
nt|andyv:  should make 3@h tricks |pg||
pc|s7|nt|lestergold: maybe 2 off with dim ruff reentry with club and another diamonjd effectively promoting anothet trump|pg||
nt|othered1: should north ruff here?|pg||
nt|lestergold: now ruff the winner|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|s6|pg||
nt|ybob: -1 now|pg||
nt|lestergold: no imagination !!|pg||
nt|lestergold: absolutely but not many would see the no cost play of ruffing and playing a diamond|pg||

nt|andyv:  4@h by N?|pg||

nt|andyv:  outstanding score by EW in the OR|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: however equally well E/W cards play quite well in dpades perhaps not quite enuf for game tho|pg||
pc|s7|nt|othered1: My partners might think I had something and overcompete|pg||
nt|lestergold: an outstandingly bad double in the open room|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|othered1: so far looks like Precision.  Is that what they play?|pg||
nt|ybob: yep|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: yes they play precision|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|andyv:  yeap... making this auctiom more complicated than needed to be;)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|andyv:  would you pull dbl with E hand?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|othered1: 3@D did stop slam and west might have had a normal looking @C lead, so I guess it was worth the risk|pg||
pc|hA|nt|andyv:  i think it's clear to pull|pg||
nt|star6ija: if 2@s is GF... pass is correct option|pg||
nt|andyv:  pd passed 1@D and you have maybe one defensive trick|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think 2@s can be GF...probably a limit raise with 4|pg||

nt|lestergold: this straight off on top|pg||
pc|d3|nt|andyv:  @d switch now|pg||
nt|lestergold: North must think they are playin 1N forcing and south doesnt|pg||
nt|ybob: 7 imps|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mamos: even when they gained imps by 6NT the TD took it away in the other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: EW are playing very good |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|andyv:  one more shot at it|pg||
nt|andyv:  if N had AK of @h rather than AQ, then slam investigation would have been proper|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|othered1: "Precision" isn't a definitive description of system any more, as almost everyone has their own preferences.|pg||
nt|star6ija: if it wasn't passed hand, could be the same, or additional strength (principle of fast arrival)|pg||
nt|lestergold: doesnt east want to ruff any clubs for more off|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: well then the system is absurd|pg||
nt|lestergold: Ive never heard of this 6 point range|pg||

nt|andyv:  coming up to our final board of this set|pg||
nt|andyv:  and our final board of this match.|pg||
nt|lestergold: and a tricky 4S which can and indeed was defeated in theopen|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Mike, Deyan and all the specs who have joined us.|pg||
nt|lestergold: it can also be let thru|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Last board of the round. Tx Mike and Andy. We'll be back at 13CET with the last round of the round robin.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: some of my club members play this form of bidding style it usually means why consult partner when i can guess a bid all by myself|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: 3NT = cold from E|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: This looks like a wash, so Ankara's lead will stand up.|pg||
nt|othered1: North really likes to have his bids.|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|ybob: from W @D leads can defeat|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: 6@D is really excellent|pg||
nt|andyv:  thank you Deyan for an excellent job.|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: wrong again.|pg||
nt|lestergold: what on earth are they playing at?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: well then this is the decisive one|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 2@S should show a sound opener with six good spades in the balancing seat|pg||
nt|othered1: What did 2@S imply?  Looks intermediate to me, but north didin't see it that way.|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: it seems Beograd will make it to the final|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Just what South has, so North should bid again|pg||
nt|othered1: You wouldn't open AKQJxx, xx, xxx, xx?|pg||
nt|lestergold: i was thinking how close this was to a Roland slam|pg||
nt|ogoksel: 2@S shows 11-15 but N is not sure about that i guess|pg||
nt|ybob: 2@S in 4º shows 11/13 6º to me|pg||
pc|sT|nt|star6ija: hope to see you in 2 hours for next round of this very interesting competition |pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: in any thx excellent operator and very much enjoyed our double act Andy look forward to working with u again sometime|pg||
nt|lestergold: I'm gong back to bed for a nice kip|pg||
nt|andyv:  same here Mike...it was fun and some pretty zany boards kept us awake:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed|pg||
pc|s2|nt|andyv:  as a spec pointed out, 4H may be optimum contract|pg||
nt|othered1: but there's no reason for EW to know best positioning|pg||
nt|ybob: hard to humans not win 1º trick with K @D|pg||
nt|othered1: 3@D (4th suit still forcing?)|pg||
nt|star6ija: very nice comeback to Rossenovo team, who was 18 IMPs behind in first 2 boards|pg||
nt|star6ija: this 1@d bid could be very expensive|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: This is the last board for today. Thank you all. Tomorrow we start at 9CET.|pg||
nt|lestergold: playing tis system with a chicken uinderbidder is kamikazi|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 12-15 in my book|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pc|s4|nt|vugraphzym: looks very easy to make|pg||
nt|star6ija: this will probably end plus one and 11 IMPs Cernato are just to come|pg||
nt|star6ija: and it was|pg||
nt|andyv:  thank you Ed and Momchil and all the specs who make these events fun and entertaining.|pg||
nt|othered1: wow, that was ineffective|pg||
nt|lestergold: youth bridge usually has some fun for specs and commenttaors but thre has been somje good signs of talent here|pg||
nt|andyv:  this should make|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|star6ija: now even to overtricks are possible|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 602 126 889|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|othered1: 5@C may survive for a nice pick-up, but can they get there?|pg||
nt|othered1: with only the @HQ possibly duplicated, east has so many tricks it feels timid not to make another move.  Of course, I don't know what west has shown exactly|pg||
nt|lestergold: isnt this leada bit damaging|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|nt|othered1: Need good partnership to handle shortness cue-bids in partner's known long suits.|pg||
nt|ybob: disagree with 4@S|pg||
nt|othered1: that's another way to put it :)|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|othered1: That should end it firmly.|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|star6ija: two|pg||
nt|andyv:  guess @hs right and as one spec points out, without @s lead, can make 6|pg||
nt|andyv:  at least the play won't take long|pg||
nt|lestergold: only 8 tricks on top here|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Roland been taking ur name in vain again|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|nt|othered1: West doesn't see it my way, but without detailed system and style notes, it's hard to be sure where the rot set in|pg||
nt|ybob: i prefer bid 3@S over 3@C ...|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree with 3@S.  You bid 4th suit to set up forcing bid in @S, so why not bid hand out?|pg||
nt|ybob: where are extra cards from W ?|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@C bid, in casual partnerships, might have been seen as having strong preference and good support for @C that justified 4th suit auction.|pg||
nt|othered1: I personally think west had to respect the 5@C sign-off (if that'swhat it was.)  But he may be taking a shot against an expected @CAxxx in the east hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: This is the last board. Tx for all specs and kibtzs. We'll be back in 10 min for the last round of today|pg||
pc|d3|nt|othered1: West may think they aren't in a good position in this match.|pg||
nt|ybob: AXXX needs trump 2/2 in unbal hand sure, lost A @D ...|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|othered1: Unusual for me to have less for my bid than most, but I think 10-13 (or bad slightly better) works well.|pg||
pc|dT|pc|c2|pc|d6|pc|d7|pg||
nt|star6ija: once again :) big thanks everybody for joining us - see you in 2 PM CET (2 hours since now)|pg||
nt|othered1: Onthe other hand, a round robin is very much like a single match of great length, so shooting to win this match may not be best overall strategy|pg||
nt|andyv:  probably 5-7 hand with @d support and stiff @h|pg||
nt|ybob: i open 1@S and rebid 2@S with 14/15|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|andyv:  W might have been worried about a 4-1 @h break|pg||
nt|andyv:  or was trying to get his name in the papers by smothering the 10x of @hs;)|pg||
nt|star6ija: 13th trick will save 1 IMP eventually|pg||
nt|star6ija: yup|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like a push board |pg||
nt|lestergold: no play that i can see Andy|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|h4|nt|star6ija: yes and this was the proper way to avoid the danger if 4 were with S|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|andyv:  good night all from Los Angeles|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: thanks all see you in 2 hours 10 min . |pg||

nt|ryskiel_: are You hungry?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: We'll be back at 15CET with the 1/2 finalist|pg||
nt|lestergold: see had dims broken 3/3 it would be just the dozen tricks|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h9|pc|c6|nt|andyv:  @h throw in?|pg||
