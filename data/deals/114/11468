nt|mamos: lol|pg||
nt|ralfwil: What bid on E? 6@d?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I think you have to bid 6@D over 5@S with that West hand - partner cannot know you are so strong|pg||
nt|mamos: i think 6@D is about the most sensible thing I can think of|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and with that hand, you want to declare |pg||
mb|4N|nt|mamos: the only disadvantage is that North will know you expect to make and save -- creeping might work better|pg||

nt|sharkey: yes - if make only lose 170 points|pg||

nt|Walddk2: and then the diamond switch|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The D switch was strange since North did not want a ruff with a natural trump trick|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but no chances on best defence, but let¬¥s see|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @c switch from N will also defeat, as S can play another @c after @dA|pg||

nt|andyv:  it would also make me open suits that I don't want the lead because I know pd will never lead my suit:)|pg||

mb|1H|nt|andyv:  N also had 2 pitches on the club... their system doesn't allow them to tell pd what suit to shift to?|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: NS should get to a quick 4@H here.  EW competition won't be effective, as 4@S isn't a good save|pg||

nt|andyv:  to the illegal zone in the ACBL|pg||

nt|sharkey: N passed...|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: they missed the slam in the other room as well btw |pg||
nt|othered1: Hi!|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|star6ija: this is popular convention in Serbia... shows limited raise to 4@hs (4+ trumps) and Ace outside|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h7|nt|ybob: ??|pg||

nt|othered1: ty|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: it can be 5@C and 4@D|pg||
nt|ybob: playing strong @C i prefer rebids 3@C shows 5 / 5 m¬¥s max|pg||
nt|othered1: I'll be surprised if south bids again, on the misfit without knowing of extra @C length.|pg||
nt|ybob: hard to S|pg||

pc|hA|nt|ybob: 3@D shows 5+ @D 4@C ...|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm more comfortable making an immediate strong bid on the south hand, like 2@H, if available.  Prevents decisions like this one, since partner would know of possible slam interest ...|pg||
nt|othered1: right away.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s5|nt|andyv:  in the ACBL, any NT that has a range of less than 10 cannot use any conventions with it (xfers, stayman, etc)|pg||

pc|c8|nt|andyv:  one more shot at it|pg||

pc|c3|nt|othered1: "Precision" isn't a definitive description of system any more, as almost everyone has their own preferences.|pg||

nt|ybob: hard to humans not win 1¬∫ trick with K @D|pg||
nt|othered1: 3@D (4th suit still forcing?)|pg||
nt|star6ija: very nice comeback to Rossenovo team, who was 18 IMPs behind in first 2 boards|pg||

pc|h7|nt|othered1: 5@C may survive for a nice pick-up, but can they get there?|pg||
nt|othered1: with only the @HQ possibly duplicated, east has so many tricks it feels timid not to make another move.  Of course, I don't know what west has shown exactly|pg||

nt|othered1: Need good partnership to handle shortness cue-bids in partner's known long suits.|pg||

pc|d8|pc|c2|pc|dT|nt|othered1: West doesn't see it my way, but without detailed system and style notes, it's hard to be sure where the rot set in|pg||
nt|ybob: i prefer bid 3@S over 3@C ...|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree with 3@S.  You bid 4th suit to set up forcing bid in @S, so why not bid hand out?|pg||
nt|ybob: where are extra cards from W ?|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@C bid, in casual partnerships, might have been seen as having strong preference and good support for @C that justified 4th suit auction.|pg||
nt|othered1: I personally think west had to respect the 5@C sign-off (if that'swhat it was.)  But he may be taking a shot against an expected @CAxxx in the east hand|pg||

pc|s8|pc|sQ|pc|s2|pg||
