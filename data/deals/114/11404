nt|andyv:  @s partial here|pg||
nt|sharynr: some aggressive pairs might bid 1S-2S-4S|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think W will slow S down|pg||
nt|sharynr: what can he bid if south opens 1@S though?|pg||
nt|andyv:  1N|pg||
nt|sharynr: maybe East will preempt|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|andyv:  now you may see your sequence;)|pg||
nt|sharynr: 1nt is pushing it, especially when most of his high cards are in opps suit|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c3|nt|andyv:  if you play 15-18 NT overcalls, I don't think 1N is overboard|pg||

nt|andyv:  reasonable... but should be a spirited auction|pg||
nt|sharynr: not biddable though|pg||
nt|sharynr: North may have a tough time bidding anything now|pg||
nt|andyv:  if S bids @cs, W has a neg. dbl and that may get them to 4@h|pg||

nt|sharynr: e-w must be getting tired of defending :)|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|andyv:  not only that... their cards have made it impossible for them to even get involved in the auction.|pg||
