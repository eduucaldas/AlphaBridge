nt|nicksan: This is a lot of bidding as no side can make more than about 9 tricks...|pg||
nt|lestergold: well north has been warned about the clubs|pg||
nt|nicksan: In Goulash, the number of trumps in support is critical...I would have prefferred South to bid 3 @H...|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: north can get a good rsult passing and an excellent result doubling|pg||
mb|p|pc|cK|nt|nicksan: Eh, no double?|pg||
nt|lestergold: has saly ruffed east's phantom with a phantom of his own|pg||
nt|lestergold: and can west imagine that n/s are going to get out of trouble here|pg||
nt|nicksan: You should double when you have trump tricks...West has got trump tricks. |pg||

pc|hQ|pc|sT|pc|h2|nt|nicksan: He was hoping for more trumps in dummy after the 4 @H bid...|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|vugraphzza: http://www.nncup.org/page_08_e.htm for the results of 1st segment|pg||
nt|nicksan: Now, will West try over ruffing with the Ace and exit with the Jack?  North may duck that....|pg||
nt|lestergold: Stoichkov may well make a profit on this board|pg||

pc|hA|pg||
nt|lestergold: not like this tho|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Walddk3: It's difficult to concede 1100 in 5@H undoubled|pg||
mc|10|nt|lestergold: oh what happened|pg||
nt|nicksan: West had to give dummy the rest...|pg||

mb|p|nt|mug: hello|pg||

nt|sybarra: hi Tom |pg||
nt|mug: hi Denis|pg||
nt|sybarra: and hello Denis |pg||
nt|mug: sorry I can't be here this year but this is the next best thing|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|sybarra: the "leaping bids"  will start soon |pg||
nt|sybarra: starting out "normally" |pg||
nt|roswolf: yes not too unusual|pg||
nt|mug: problem is that South has opened quite light, North may need some restraining|pg||
nt|sybarra: put leash around his neck?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: this is Goulash from moscow, mixture of IMP and BAM scoring|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is interesting i was once told when in doubt bid game instead of slam and partscore instead of game when hands were goulashed|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: http://www.nncup.org/page_08_e.htm|pg||
nt|sybarra: how do they score it? |pg||
nt|mug: noone's going to be leaping too high here|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: we play patton|pg||
nt|mug: West will probably settle for an invitational bid|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|sybarra: no X  lets not give the  hand away |pg||
nt|mug: South will sign off, void in partner's second suit is not good |pg||
nt|mug: quite right shirley, double of 4@C would be criminal, they're all much too canny for that|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|sybarra: thought he might crash into 4 @S |pg||
nt|mug: partner is almost certain to be void in spades after 2@C|pg||
mb|6H|nt|roswolf: probably a sound start|pg||
nt|mug: to be honest I think 4@S was a wild overbid|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|mug: you should expect two trump losers with the broken spade suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: is that where "we" want to be?|pg||
nt|mug: very far away|pg||
nt|sybarra: so does E lead a @C?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or more passive @D? |pg||
pc|cK|nt|sybarra: losing 2@H and 2 @S?|pg||
nt|mug: must try to give partner a ruff somewhere|pg||
nt|sybarra: has to be @C |pg||
pc|h4|nt|roswolf: yup|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|hT|nt|roswolf: should you double in principle most contracts?|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|mug: not necessarily Geoff|pg||
nt|sybarra: thought he might  try ace and a @H?  now maybe |pg||
nt|roswolf: yup cant see too many trcks|pg||

nt|vugraphzzb: you can find the current results of the tournament using the following link: http://www.nncup.org/page_08_e.htm|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mug: double in front of partner should be a very firm message|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah a 4nt bid for north|pg||
nt|sybarra: dont think in goulash that is right  |pg||
mb|2D|mb|2S|nt|sybarra: how ever it is good for 6 @D  little does he know  |pg||
nt|mug: he hates his hand but it is quite useful for his partner|pg||
nt|roswolf: well east has some offence|pg||
mb|4D|nt|sybarra: wow!!!  look at N hand!!!!|pg||
nt|sybarra: and who need BW anyway??|pg||
nt|mug: East will bid 7@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: Nord has an ordinary hand in Goulash )|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe should have walked it up?|pg||
nt|mug: creepy crawly doesn't work in my experience|pg||
nt|sybarra: you have played there,  so you should know |pg||
nt|mug: and anyway North is far from guaranteed to make 7@C|pg||
nt|mug: he needs South to have @SA, and to avoid a spade ruff|pg||
nt|mug: this way East is put to the test|pg||
nt|sybarra: and that is a consideration  (the ruff that is) |pg||
nt|mug: BIG consideration Shirley|pg||
nt|roswolf: but even goulashes obey the laws of probability - dont they?|pg||
nt|sybarra: Easts pard did not announce a great hand! |pg||
nt|sybarra: actually geoffrey from watching,  they are very disciplined  |pg||
nt|mug: but West's bid showed a long suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: or commenting last couple of years,  (I should say) |pg||
nt|roswolf: would a prolonged pause and pass impose any ethical problems on west|pg||
nt|mug: yes you're right Shirley, the best players are very conservative and very disciplined|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: likely 6@S BY NORTH?|pg||
nt|sybarra: actually overstated that one,  6 @D does not make |pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mug: partnership trust is very important|pg||
nt|sybarra: wow!!! |pg||
nt|sybarra: restraint |pg||
nt|roswolf: HMMMM unexpected|pg||
nt|mug: I think South owed North 4@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|sybarra: S owed something |pg||
pc|h5|nt|mug: good bidding by all|pg||
nt|sybarra: we have a way to say it in US,   "this tourney is a hoot"  (hoot= entertaining, fun etc) |pg||
nt|mug: certainly is|pg||
nt|mug: we did terribly but had a really great time last year|pg||
nt|roswolf: trump lead best|pg||
nt|mug: at the 5-level North was right to shut up shop, his suit is far from solid at this game|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: perhaps for 5this tourney only you should be allowed to bid at the 8 level as in the old days|pg||
nt|roswolf: 11 tricks on a cross ruff|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: would you do it again Tom?|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|mug: was planning to come this year but circs intervened|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|nt|mug: at least they didn't double 5@D although that probably won't help their score much|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pg||
nt|mug: the rest of my crew is playing|pg||
nt|sybarra: :(|pg||
nt|sybarra: poor S doesnt have a club to lead :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: 7@c from the other table|pg||
nt|sybarra: other room almost walked it up |pg||
nt|roswolf: yes after a straightforward ordinary type auction|pg||
nt|mug: South should be DD here|pg||
nt|mug: his partner must have 12 clubs|pg||
mc|11|nt|mug: it won't matter, big winning board for his team|pg||
nt|mug: although a trick went there, poor defence|pg||
nt|roswolf: only -4|pg||

nt|lestergold: trouble is when north bids 5S will south restrain himself from bidding 6?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: There is (almost) always one suit divided 5-3-3-2|pg||
nt|Walddk3: a very slow double shows a two-suiter|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk3: That's why it's taking Semenov so long to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|nicksan: 5 @S is a bit risky. How about double and then pull 5 @H to 5 @S to indicate a two suiter?|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|5S|nt|lestergold: if he doubles same dillemma pard will bid 5h he then will bid 5S to show the two suiter |pg||
nt|lestergold: now the issue approaches|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk3: blimey, great pass|pg||
nt|lestergold: wel south with no high cards in either trumps or dims has been cautious and correctly so here|pg||
nt|nicksan: South recognizes that a plus score is not to be sniffed at in this game...|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: a PUSH |pg||
nt|lestergold: nevers een such days|pg||
nt|lestergold: never seen|pg||
nt|nicksan: there you go Liz, a flat board!|pg||
nt|cuttysark: gosh, jings|pg||
nt|lestergold: confucious he say 9 card suits tend to not produce flat boards is this the exception that proves the rule|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: sorry teen card suits too many card sfor me tocount|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|nicksan: Try counting the other three, it's easier...|pg||

nt|sybarra: oh good another great hand, I LOVE this tourney!!|pg||
nt|mug: as 16 IMP swings are pretty routine|pg||
mb|4C|nt|roswolf: are you allowed to psyche in this event or is it frowned upon|pg||
nt|sybarra: or when you thought you lost 16   you mates say  "push"  |pg||
nt|mug: you can do what you like Geoff|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w misfit n/s have spades played in say 6@C|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|mug: but I think psyching would be foolish|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mug: double tends to be a two-suiter|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: doubt you need to, pard may take you seriously |pg||
nt|mug: this double is probably not penalty|pg||
nt|sybarra: and how to get to @S here,  notice that E did not bid |pg||
nt|mug: North can clarify now with 4@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: TOO COMMITTAL|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|nt|sybarra: so if 2 suiter  does he bid 6?|pg||
nt|roswolf: finis|pg||
nt|mug: I don't think North will like his hand, @CKx looks sick|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: so pass is in order |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: hmm some interesting tactics could arise eg 4@H BY NORTH INSTEAD OF 4@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: and you see,  "WE" dont X |pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: in QF we play 2 segments. Each segment consist of 5 boards.|pg||
nt|mug: sensible bidding|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sybarra: imo,  this is such a great lesson to play goulash |pg||
nt|mug: I don't think it has much in common with bridge, the point is that it is good fun|pg||
nt|roswolf: great comment tom|pg||
nt|sybarra: my thought on that would be..........for students (I dont teach) think about what you heard in bidding,  and think about what the hands could be|pg||
nt|mug: North probably considered a trump lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: double ruffing finesse brings in a few tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: E to try for the ruff |pg||
nt|mug: higher than you'd like to be but they will get away with it this time|pg||
nt|sybarra: pard sometimes holds a trump |pg||
nt|roswolf: hmmm not today|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c2|nt|mug: always on the shortlist when you have one|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: it looks like the saldo has been lost by the SPACE MUTANTS|pg||
nt|sybarra: what is sald?|pg||
nt|sybarra: *saldo |pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: it is a patton|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|s2|nt|mug: West will hardly expect the clubs to lie so well |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|sybarra: Tom what did you do re systems,  when you played?  strong 2's?|pg||
nt|mug: the English team plays 2C thru 2NT as limited two-suiters, covering all combinations except the minors|pg||
nt|mug: 4NT is the minors|pg||
nt|mug: one bids show good hands|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok,  dont give away all secrets |pg||
nt|mug: 29 IMPs is nothing|pg||
nt|sybarra: so this is patton?   so we have imps and bam (or is it matchpoints)?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: correct|pg||
nt|mug: just try and nick an overtrick on the last two boards and the Mutants will fine|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|s5|nt|mug: 3NT we used to play as Blackwood, but this year the boys are playing it as a 10-trick major-suit hand|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mug: modified IMP scale though, right Denis?|pg||
mc|11|nt|vugraphzzb: correct )|pg||
nt|sybarra: patton is not played in the US,  I played it in Neth.   and loved it |pg||

nt|lestergold: this misfit is a right mess to analyse|pg||

pc|sA|nt|cuttysark: Well, everybody knows he has extreme distribution|pg||

nt|mug: tough when your suit breaks 3-3, how can you play for that?|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: as usual,   ....here we go again!|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|mug: 6@D is a fair result for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: pass = poor hand?|pg||
nt|mug: 7@D is cold but EW can save in 6@H|pg||
nt|sybarra: here we go "blasting" into..........|pg||
nt|mug: or 7@H obviously|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is gf presumably in this event|pg||
nt|sybarra: they might try the "reverse" to save in 6 @H  LOL|pg||
nt|roswolf: and now we get 3@D from west!?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mug: hang on, West can ruff a club and East can ruff a spade, didn't see that|pg||
nt|mug: 3@D now by South should end the auction|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|Walddk5: This is divided into to halves of 5 boards, so there will be a short break after board 5|pg||
nt|roswolf: bid what you think you can make|pg||
nt|sybarra: yeah this can go down |pg||
nt|mug: doubles like West's usually show 2-suiters|pg||
nt|mug: 3-suited hands are very rare|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: very disci[plined|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: good contract )|pg||
nt|sybarra: S is proabably sure @D's dont break |pg||
nt|mug: it doesn't make, but good contract |pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|mug: West has a difficult lead|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mug: second double is for the club lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: and slam doubles lightner !?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and X says  2 suiter,  lead a (suit preference if you have one) club |pg||
nt|mug: watch for the suit preference club lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: we can see ace and club q works |pg||
nt|sybarra: S is saying   "lovely pard, thanks"  |pg||
pc|s2|pc|c2|nt|mug: @CQ might have been clearer for West|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|mug: let's see if he gets it right|pg||
nt|roswolf: well is it clear to ruff and lead a spade?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mug: I don't know what theyv|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mug: 've agreed about these situations|pg||
nt|mug: might have been clearer to have led something like the TEN of clubs|pg||
nt|mug: now East needs to work out the heart situation|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
nt|roswolf: well done|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c6|pc|cT|nt|mug: on the same wavelength, well done by E-W|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d2|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lestergold: do u like it Liz|pg||
pc|h3|pc|sA|mc|13|nt|cuttysark: Even if West were dealer and had the mechanism to ask which 2 aces partner has, opponents would interfere|pg||
nt|lestergold: well apity space things had a chance to get a few back but didnt even try|pg||
nt|vugraphzza: It was last board. We will continue tomorrow|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Waste of a good 4Nt opener, if you ask me|pg||
nt|vugraphzza: See you. Bye!|pg||
nt|nicksan: A resounding win for Stoichkov! They were up at half time a few as well.|pg||
nt|nicksan: bye all|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Great stuff|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Bye all|pg||

nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: the last board of the first segment|pg||
nt|sybarra: well,  the partenship understand of the X |pg||
nt|sybarra: impressive |pg||
nt|sybarra: and now last  bd of this segment |pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: the last board of the QF|pg||
nt|mug: this time there is no ruff against the grand slam|pg||
nt|sybarra: Denis,   great job as always |pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: we will continue tomorrow - SF and Final of the tournament|pg||
nt|roswolf: grand is on|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|sybarra: and another fascinating hand |pg||
nt|mug: the problem is that declarer is often also void|pg||
nt|sybarra: e/w may have to really scramble here to match the OR result |pg||
nt|roswolf: why did 6@S MAKE? looks like 2 losers|pg||
nt|mug: a good partner will probably try his 8-card suit in case you can ruff, anyway|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Walddk5: Declarer played clubs for no loser. Strong player|pg||
nt|mug: whoops, egg on face for someone|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I have signed up to be here at 6 am my time |pg||
nt|mug: I think we'll see EW employ some kind of ace-asking device|pg||
nt|sybarra: just to join in |pg||
nt|mug: maybe 3@S says spades are trumps, and now East will cue-bid|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|mug: @CJ lead and @C10 continuation, not best|pg||
nt|mug: all cue-bids in this game are first-round|pg||
mb|4N|nt|roswolf: indeed i would lead ace and another trump not the J +10 OFclubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: we will continue in 10-15 minutes|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: 4NT may be some kind of specialized BW|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|mug: surprised West didn't try 6@S here, but fair play to him, he did the right thing|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: nope |pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: and Kholomeev did well with the lead, a trump was certainly in the picture, or at least I'd have thought so|pg||
nt|mug: rather disappointing, they didn't have the methods|pg||
nt|sybarra: they needed it |pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm grand missed|pg||
nt|roswolf: off to monaco bye all|pg||
nt|mug: how would the bidding go in your Goulash system, Denis?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: now all participants are going to watch the big TV|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: the football match between Germany and Russia|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: I think 1@h - 2@S should be FG|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: Kholomeev thought that 3@s was SPL|pg||
pc|dK|nt|roswolf: got a plus score|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok cu back in short time, |pg||
nt|mug: some very hot play at this table|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Denis,  cu then |pg||
nt|roswolf: see you soon|pg||
