mb|p|nt|ritong: shortened auction?|pg||
nt|ritong: like 1@s 1NT 2@d 2@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: I agree with you.  I think once you've chosen to open the E hand, you have to rebid 2@D here or you show a different hand.|pg||
nt|andyv:  this should end it|pg||
nt|ritong: ?|pg||
nt|jain: shd be a flat brd making 5|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jcwla: It would be nice if the pass said "I don't really have an opener" or "at least not a good one" but it doesn't -- it just distorts your holdings.|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  hard to comment on 4@c bid... except... where did that come from|pg||
mb|d|nt|andyv:  and, yes, to all the specs.  I know it's a splinter... but rest of hand doesn't justify that bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  about an Ace short|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sK|nt|panja: the bidding might have died in 1N..but with 7 HCP..E has taken a rosy view..he is likely to succeed but W will miss a few heartbeats on the way  ..|pg||

nt|sunit: hi all|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|panja: the problem with a light overcall on 1@H is that S could not show his @HQ safely..and so N did not lead a @H|pg||

pc|h3|pg||
nt|panja: now @CA and @DAK and exit with a @D will be declarer's plan..|pg||

nt|vugraphzwq: Please note changes in the scores of round 3.. Mistake regretted... Typographical error|pg||
nt|jain: then the defence need to find the club shift to set i nt|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jcwla: In this case it will work perfectly.|pg||
nt|andyv:  and E doesn't want to force with this hand|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jcwla: Well, that's because W has a lousy opener.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|panja: S has chosen the dbl over 3@D...so he had to hurriedly close with 3Nt...note that it would have been better played by N|pg||
pc|h9|nt|panja: give one of N's @S to W and exchange a @D for it...3N by S would have been much more trouble than it would be here|pg||

pc|hK|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|nt|jcwla: On many other hands the plan of doubling to bid 2@S later will either be blocked or not get you where you want to go.  As I say, though, can't argue w/success here.|pg||

nt|andyv:  must have not seen initial pass from N|pg||
mb|2H|nt|rvg: That was an uncharacteristic pass by Vinay in balancing position - a reopening double seemed straightforward to me|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  ok, that makes sense|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  32 board QFs?|pg||
nt|rvg: The URL for this tournament is at http://indianbridgepages.appspot.com/ Tolani_Grand_Prix/2009/index.html|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty!|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: Sorry for the Wromg Update in the first trick.. It was due to a technical Failure... |pg||
nt|rvg: A Diamond shift would have beaten 2C I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: Wrong|pg||
nt|andyv:  meantime, W should have little trouble with this contract|pg||
nt|jcwla: A reopening double would work well here.  For newer players, a second double would not change the meaning of the original double -- S still has a hand that is takeout of @D's -- ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: but it shows extra strength and there's a suggestion when made over 2@C that S is probably something like this exact distribution.|pg||
