nt|andyv:  @s partial here|pg||
nt|sharynr: some aggressive pairs might bid 1S-2S-4S|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think W will slow S down|pg||
nt|sharynr: what can he bid if south opens 1@S though?|pg||
nt|andyv:  1N|pg||
nt|sharynr: maybe East will preempt|pg||
nt|xenya: oh i'm wrong -- sorry|pg||
nt|mdgraham: first glance would seem to indicate a heart slam EW|pg||
nt|mdgraham: secind glance confirms it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there are people who might deem that South hand a weak 2@S opener  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: or a "Garbage Multi" 2@d, which is getting popular in England|pg||
nt|mdgraham: don't think so|pg||
nt|vugraphzxh: sorry, mistake|pg||
nt|xenya: lol Mike|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Pity West isn't called Darth|pg||
nt|mareczek: now are leaders|pg||
nt|mareczek: 6.400|pg||
nt|mareczek: 64.00%|pg||
nt|mareczek: Kwiecien Jagniewski second 63.90|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: I don't think that was passed out, unless EW were playing a forcing pass system and East thought his fourth-in-hand pass was forcing  |pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|nt|andyv:  now you may see your sequence;)|pg||
nt|sharynr: 1nt is pushing it, especially when most of his high cards are in opps suit|pg||
nt|xenya: no!|pg||
mb|2H|mb|d|mb|r|nt|mareczek: responsive double showing 4@s (I suppose)|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|mareczek: this can drive them to the game|pg||
nt|granguru: then not a traditional responsive|pg||
nt|granguru: I would better believe it is a transfer|pg||
nt|mareczek: it is an old fashioned responsive double|pg||
nt|granguru: old fashioned promess 4-4 in minors...|pg||
mb|3D|nt|andyv:  if you play 15-18 NT overcalls, I don't think 1N is overboard|pg||
nt|andyv:  and if you make bad leads, you need to bid as much as possible|pg||
mb|d|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|granguru: with 4 spades he just bids it|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|granguru: with no major and one minor bids the minor|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dJ|nt|mareczek: I say about really old fashioned... from 60-ties and early 70-ties|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sharynr: @H are nicely positioned for declarer, unfortunately not trumps|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|pc|dT|pg||
nt|granguru: as analyzed in Mike lawrence The Complete Book on Overcalls|pg||
nt|mareczek: 3@h undoubled can be quite sensible result|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|granguru: edited in 1979|pg||
nt|mareczek: as in spades 8 tricks are easy|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|nt|sharynr: i cant imagine my partner holding the !K if declarer has a 4@S bid|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sharynr: @Ck|pg||
pc|s8|nt|andyv:  at least a little luck in the @s suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  W might have ducked that trick|pg||
nt|sharynr: so this looks like a make|pg||
pc|s7|nt|granguru: well 80's is not so old in fact|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|andyv:  it should makenow|pg||
nt|mareczek: yes, there are people who play bridge longer :)|pg||
nt|mareczek: 3@h -1 is actually 44%|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||
nt|sharynr: aggression paid off|pg||

nt|andyv:  reasonable... but should be a spirited auction|pg||
nt|sharynr: not biddable though|pg||
nt|sharynr: North may have a tough time bidding anything now|pg||
nt|andyv:  if S bids @cs, W has a neg. dbl and that may get them to 4@h|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|sharynr: west may choose to pass 2@C as well|pg||
nt|sharynr: not a fan od DBL|pg||
nt|andyv:  strange dbl|pg||

nt|andyv:  and that should get them to 4@h|pg||

nt|sharynr: lol|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|sharynr: oh my!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mareczek: brave 4@s vulnerable!|pg||
nt|mareczek: 4@h makes|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  so much for how to make 4@h:)|pg||
nt|granguru: a @C lead permits W to make 3N|pg||
pc|d2|nt|granguru: extraordinary lead|pg||
nt|granguru: the killing one|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mdgraham: 4@H on this auction has it's usual effect of being a transfer to 4@S|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|andyv:  S REALLY liked his hand|pg||
nt|sharynr: maybe North should have passed 1@S DBL|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|mareczek: to underlead a king after 2NT of West was uneasy|pg||
nt|granguru: Just usual Martens one some are saying|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|andyv:  good play|pg||
nt|mareczek: 4@s down one when EW manage a ruff|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|s7|pg||
nt|granguru: this will bring around 80% score to NS|pg||
nt|granguru: which will probably maintain them in 1st place|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c3|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|mareczek: I assume that @sQ will be found|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|nt|mareczek: buy even after this start declarer has some comunication problems|pg||
nt|mdgraham: why cash @dA unless it is a singleton? |pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|granguru: 4@S -1, close 80% for NS (see runnin scores - http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/2009/zagr2009/Vilnius/vilpairs.html )|pg||

nt|mdgraham: you don't want to be to harsh, but West should have realised @DA was a singleton - go up with @CA and give East a ruff|pg||
nt|mdgraham: many have pointed out that there was no need to lead @cQ - and they are right |pg||
nt|mdgraham: a small club makes it easier for West. |pg||
nt|mdgraham: however, if there are two clubs to take (West having four rather than five) then Q@C be be ok.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Tough game, this|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Danny Sprung points out that East could have led the @dA at trick one - then they can use the heart suit for transportation|pg||
nt|mdgraham: small break, Sniedze?|pg||
nt|xenya: not that small...|pg||
nt|granguru: 1@S probably|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|granguru: 2@S?|pg||

nt|granguru: max tricks NS can make is 9|pg||
nt|granguru: with normal defense|pg||
nt|granguru: as EW can always cash @SAK and minor Aces|pg||

pc|d2|nt|mdgraham: don't really understand why South didn't cash @HA first|pg||
nt|dburn: interesting line, that @dA, but was expecting ace and a heart to the king after that|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d4|pg||
nt|sharynr: a claim is hopefully imminent|pg||
nt|andyv:  a lot of 2/1 players will play a relay sequence over 2@c/2@d, to show a bigger NT|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sharynr: but even if 25-27 is shown, does south necessarily have a slam force,|pg||

pc|c6|pg||
pc|s3|nt|xenya: they should now actually -- at MPs|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|nt|mdgraham: the problem, of course, is that playing 5@d will score less than a "field" 3N|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|xenya: exactly|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so there is a tendency to bid 6 and hope it makes|pg||

nt|sharynr: dummy is not reachable so a @D lead would not be necessaray|pg||

nt|xenya: but the long suits...|pg||
nt|granguru: need to guess @CJ..right play is playing from top around 55% to get that @CJ in 3 rounds|pg||
nt|xenya: not a good game of course|pg||
nt|granguru: @H 4-3 reduces it to 27%|pg||

nt|mareczek: 2NT minors of course|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@h is surely passed out |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  not only that... their cards have made it impossible for them to even get involved in the auction.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mdgraham: @c4?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  and this appears to be a pair event which would explain the change in EW and the delay after 2 boards:)|pg||

nt|sharynr: playing matchpoints, I suppose it is right to unbock @HK and play for @DJ to be dropping = 11 trcks|pg||
pc|sA|nt|xenya: looks like 2 down, on the surface -- might not be so bad against +110 for NS|pg||

nt|andyv:  was there any reason in the auction not to lead a @h?|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pc|cK|nt|mdgraham: apart from his bididng box, of course|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|s4|nt|granguru: now @C and another S|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s9|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|sharynr: i can't see any|pg||
nt|andyv:  lead of 9@d must be one that may or may not have the 10@d|pg||
nt|andyv:  so, it might have been the "sexier" lead:0|pg||

nt|xenya: but a top score for NS |pg||
nt|granguru: xx shows 10+ usually|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  that would be 9 tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|sharynr: hasnt knocked out the @D yet|pg||
nt|granguru: he has no pen double except for @H  - which he cant double either !!!|pg||
mb|d|mb|1H|an| |mb|2H|nt|granguru: so probably best bid was jumping in @H - not doubling|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|andyv:  ah, right|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharynr: is this what they call "garbage stayman"?|pg||
mb|p|pc|s4|nt|granguru: 1@h is probably a transfer showing 4+ @S|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|andyv:  it qualifies|pg||
nt|sharynr: :)|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|granguru: 10 tricks it seems|pg||

nt|mdgraham: you don't get rich at pairs defending 2@D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: most of the time, anyway|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sharynr: interesting leading the @H2|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|andyv:  W doesn't expect @hs to be 4-1|pg||
nt|sharynr: K@C?|pg||
nt|andyv:  thinking S has the J@c|pg||
nt|sharynr: a bit dangerous assuming partner has the J|pg||
nt|andyv:  fortunately for NS, on this hand it doesn't matter|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|sharynr: true|pg||
nt|andyv:  so, waiting for next pair now|pg||
nt|sharynr: i dont think North should have led @SA when W showed majors|pg||
nt|sharynr: but I guess no difference in the end|pg||
nt|andyv:  I agree...if anything, holding stiff trump, I'd look for the tapping game... mainly the club suit.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|hT|pc|d4|pg||
nt|xenya: meanwhile Martens/Jassem have dropped to 10th place|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North will suspect that West has @HK|pg||
