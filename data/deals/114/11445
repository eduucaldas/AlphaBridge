mb|1C|mb|p|nt|viren169: Looks like a p/s hand here for N/S|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|andyv:  free 2@s bid here|pg||
nt|jcwla: Do you like E's pass, Andy?|pg||
nt|andyv:  no, I'd show the @ds|pg||
nt|viren169: probably 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: shortened auction?|pg||
nt|ritong: like 1@s 1NT 2@d 2@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: I agree with you.  I think once you've chosen to open the E hand, you have to rebid 2@D here or you show a different hand.|pg||
nt|andyv:  this should end it|pg||
nt|ritong: ?|pg||
nt|jain: shd be a flat brd making 5|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jcwla: It would be nice if the pass said "I don't really have an opener" or "at least not a good one" but it doesn't -- it just distorts your holdings.|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|viren169: poor start for defence... but you have to lead something...|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|pc|cA|nt|ritong: this won t work, but the more possible 3 NT wouldn t either|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|andyv:  if E isn't going to rebid his @ds, he should simply open the hand 2@d or 3@d (if he has those bids available)|pg||

pc|dA|pg||
pc|s4|nt|panja: JM and Sandeep karmarkar are EW teammates|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|nt|jcwla: A bit unfortunate to be down 1 with North having a very good hand and South's raise totally reasonable with three trumps, a side ace and a side stiff.  But nobody ever said it was ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: fair.|pg||
pc|sT|pg||

nt|jcwla: Wow, 4@C seems a bit rich.|pg||
nt|jain: wld they reach 7h|pg||
mb|3D|nt|andyv:  hard to comment on 4@c bid... except... where did that come from|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  and, yes, to all the specs.  I know it's a splinter... but rest of hand doesn't justify that bid|pg||
nt|viren169: only if E/W get in the bidding...|pg||
mb|5D|nt|andyv:  about an Ace short|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|panja: the bidding might have died in 1N..but with 7 HCP..E has taken a rosy view..he is likely to succeed but W will miss a few heartbeats on the way  ..|pg||
nt|panja: with the @S lead though, no problems at all..|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl will get defence off to wrong lead|pg||
pc|cK|nt|andyv:  shows how much I know|pg||

nt|vugraphzwq: hI jAIN|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|pg||
nt|jcwla: If this hand were worth 4@C, which it's not, it would be worth a more descriptive 4@D showing 6-4.|pg||
nt|sunit: hi all|pg||
nt|jain: a @D lead was called for sure with such a strong holding in @C|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|panja: the problem with a light overcall on 1@H is that S could not show his @HQ safely..and so N did not lead a @H|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|andyv:  nice lead... I wouldn't have found it at the table|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|pc|cJ|nt|viren169: Yes... but trump switch will still hold it to 10 tricks!|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|panja: a@C hook next..|pg||
nt|panja: and that would be 8 tricks in the bag|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sunit: 7h is cold here|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h4|nt|panja: @D discard seems innocuous, but will lose a trick|pg||
nt|jcwla: Note there would still be handling charges on a different lead.|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|nt|jain: need to drop the club J on 4s |pg||
pc|d3|nt|panja: now @CA and @DAK and exit with a @D will be declarer's plan..|pg||
nt|panja: but that will get 9 tricks soon enough |pg||
nt|panja: he might of course try @HK...first|pg||

pc|c3|nt|panja: once N did not lead a @H, it was clear he started with @HAHxxx , not AQJxx...and South's difficult discard confirmed that view..|pg||

mb|1H|mb|d|mb|r|an|SP|mb|3C|nt|andyv:  depends on style...dbl followed by 2@s is often not forcing|pg||
nt|viren169: pushy dble by West will keep N/S out of trouble.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jain: he wld jump with the A |pg||
nt|jain: nd play on hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: Please note changes in the scores of round 3.. Mistake regretted... Typographical error|pg||
nt|jain: then the defence need to find the club shift to set i nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: In this case it will work perfectly.|pg||
nt|andyv:  and E doesn't want to force with this hand|pg||
mb|d|nt|jcwla: Well, that's because W has a lousy opener.|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: S has chosen the dbl over 3@D...so he had to hurriedly close with 3Nt...note that it would have been better played by N|pg||
nt|viren169: good 3@C bid!|pg||
mb|3D|nt|panja: give one of N's @S to W and exchange a @D for it...3N by S would have been much more trouble than it would be here|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  E doesn't have a great hand either|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  9 tricks should be easy|pg||
mb|p|pc|c3|pc|c4|nt|jcwla: On many other hands the plan of doubling to bid 2@S later will either be blocked or not get you where you want to go.  As I say, though, can't argue w/success here.|pg||
