nt|andyv:  @s partial here|pg||
nt|sharynr: some aggressive pairs might bid 1S-2S-4S|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think W will slow S down|pg||
nt|sharynr: what can he bid if south opens 1@S though?|pg||
nt|andyv:  1N|pg||
nt|sharynr: maybe East will preempt|pg||
nt|xenya: oh i'm wrong -- sorry|pg||
nt|mdgraham: first glance would seem to indicate a heart slam EW|pg||
nt|mdgraham: secind glance confirms it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there are people who might deem that South hand a weak 2@S opener  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: or a "Garbage Multi" 2@d, which is getting popular in England|pg||
nt|mdgraham: don't think so|pg||
nt|vugraphzxh: sorry, mistake|pg||
nt|xenya: lol Mike|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Pity West isn't called Darth|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: I don't think that was passed out, unless EW were playing a forcing pass system and East thought his fourth-in-hand pass was forcing  |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  now you may see your sequence;)|pg||
nt|sharynr: 1nt is pushing it, especially when most of his high cards are in opps suit|pg||
nt|xenya: no!|pg||

nt|andyv:  reasonable... but should be a spirited auction|pg||
nt|sharynr: not biddable though|pg||
nt|sharynr: North may have a tough time bidding anything now|pg||
nt|andyv:  if S bids @cs, W has a neg. dbl and that may get them to 4@h|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|sharynr: west may choose to pass 2@C as well|pg||
nt|sharynr: not a fan od DBL|pg||

nt|andyv:  W has a raise|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|sharynr: wow, South really likes his hand!|pg||
nt|andyv:  and that should get them to 4@h|pg||

nt|andyv:  S is from school that never picked up thirteen cards they didn't like|pg||
nt|sharynr: lol|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h8|nt|andyv:  so much for how to make 4@h:)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@H on this auction has it's usual effect of being a transfer to 4@S|pg||
pc|dA|nt|andyv:  S REALLY liked his hand|pg||
nt|sharynr: maybe North should have passed 1@S DBL|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|andyv:  good play|pg||

nt|mdgraham: you don't want to be to harsh, but West should have realised @DA was a singleton - go up with @CA and give East a ruff|pg||
nt|mdgraham: many have pointed out that there was no need to lead @cQ - and they are right |pg||
nt|mdgraham: a small club makes it easier for West. |pg||
nt|mdgraham: however, if there are two clubs to take (West having four rather than five) then Q@C be be ok.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Tough game, this|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Danny Sprung points out that East could have led the @dA at trick one - then they can use the heart suit for transportation|pg||
nt|mdgraham: small break, Sniedze?|pg||
nt|xenya: not that small...|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|sharynr: a dbl of multi should have some definition|pg||

nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|mdgraham: top Polish pair NS|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4N|nt|andyv:  ran out of momentum|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: i've got a feeling they'll bid it|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: might stop in 5@D if they find two key cards missing|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|xenya: they should now actually -- at MPs|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: the problem, of course, is that playing 5@d will score less than a "field" 3N|pg||
pc|sA|nt|xenya: exactly|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so there is a tendency to bid 6 and hope it makes|pg||

nt|sharynr: 4@H here..|pg||
nt|sharynr: dummy is not reachable so a @D lead would not be necessaray|pg||
nt|xenya: i hope it was not N thinking|pg||
nt|mdgraham: in my experience 50% slams fail at least 90% of the time|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: :)|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|andyv:  3N might be the only makeable game contract here|pg||

nt|mdgraham: say East takes @DA and returns a club - the entry position is just awful |pg||
nt|xenya: i can see a way to make it, but it's DD|pg||
nt|xenya: maybe there are other, more realistic ways|pg||

mb|2N|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: what can West do?|pg||
nt|mareczek: 2NT minors of course|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@h is surely passed out |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  not only that... their cards have made it impossible for them to even get involved in the auction.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: @c4?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|andyv:  and this appears to be a pair event which would explain the change in EW and the delay after 2 boards:)|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c8|pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|andyv:  declarer will have to untangle and cash out @hs before he runs the @ds|pg||
nt|sharynr: playing matchpoints, I suppose it is right to unbock @HK and play for @DJ to be dropping = 11 trcks|pg||
pc|h5|nt|xenya: looks like 2 down, on the surface -- might not be so bad against +110 for NS|pg||
pc|h6|nt|andyv:  which runs a slight risk of @ds being 4-1|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, diamonds appear to play quite well|pg||

nt|mdgraham: -50 might not be too bad fo EW|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: N should have played a @D at some point -- no promotion is needed here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|andyv:  @d partial?|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|andyv:  support dbl here|pg||
mb|2D|nt|andyv:  1N old fashioned strong NT by S|pg||
nt|sharynr: love the diamond stopper :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  so much for support dbl:)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|andyv:  this will make at least one|pg||
nt|mareczek: I think S hand is worth more than 2@d|pg||
nt|mdgraham: perhaps they play some kind of 2@C negative over a double|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|xenya: must be that, Mike|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: as otherwise, yes, 2@D does seem rather pessimistic|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 5@D has excellent play here - you might even make six|pg||
nt|xenya: but E's pass over the double is a bit surprising|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mdgraham: maybe six is going it a bit|pg||

pc|c7|pc|c8|nt|xenya: i think they can make 6 as the cards lie|pg||
