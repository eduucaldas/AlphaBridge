nt|marlowepi: diamonds. Using other methods--or perhaps just judgment--N might rebid 2S instead of 2N, and then S would become declarer|pg||

nt|roswolf: is the nt 12-14 or an upgrade 15-17|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe Gunnar wants to treat his hand as a mild slam try|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|nt|lestergold: I dont blame King for chickening out after all three hearts bdo not always stand up|pg||

pc|h6|pc|hJ|nt|rodal f: I understand that S woun't X bit risky by his long @H|pg||
pc|h9|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|jallerton: 4@h just needs to bring the @h in for one loser here|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: 3 card limit?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d4|nt|marlowepi: slightly too good for a single raise, just under threshold of 3-card limit raise. happily at IMPs you can just close your eyes and make the slight overbid|pg||
nt|roswolf: cards are favourably placed|pg||

nt|Walddk2: http://www.tgrsbridge.com/Super_League.html  for standings after 2 rounds|pg||
