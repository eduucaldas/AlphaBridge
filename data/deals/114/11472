mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|jallerton: 3NT was played by W = presumably the @s lead was avoided |pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w will do well to bid 3nt here|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|ady: 3NT in CR  fortunate to make|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: and maybe here as well|pg||
nt|jallerton: @cA is a big card, so West is persuaded to bid on over 3@c|pg||
pc|h7|nt|roswolf: defence to beat 3nt is not obvious with south on lead|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cQ|pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
nt|ady: almost impossible|pg||
pc|c4|mc|9|nt|roswolf: 1 imp to the trailing team|pg||
nt|jallerton: Might as well run the @c here (rather than claim).  defence may discard enough @s to make knocking out @dk safe|pg||

nt|athene: if you want to show partner your spades, remember he will see them when you put dummy down :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: had to restrain on the nexy=t round|pg||
nt|lestergold: I am in favour of a disciplined pass not expecting auction to end with 2D and then I will act later according to what I hear|pg||
nt|rodal f: Do u know if EW use 2NT as force here? If so the 3@C are ok and E might have only for 3@H.|pg||

nt|lestergold: quite|pg||
nt|athene: and east has the same shape here - his partner opens 1@H and he has 6@S-3@H|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|nt|athene: time to raise hearts|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|d|nt|athene: ...which i assume is what 2@D is|pg||

mb|3C|nt|lestergold: and completes his description with 3C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s5|nt|lestergold: problem in this contract is of course the lack of ntries to dummy|pg||

pc|sA|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cK|pc|s6|nt|athene: then he only has to reach dummy once to pick them up|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pg||
