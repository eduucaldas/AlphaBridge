pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||

nt|marlowepi: in fact in many situations like this you would cash both club honors and then play hearts, intending to lead a club back toward hand. but here that might set up too many tricks for ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the enemy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Back to normal, partscores|pg||
nt|athene: so you try to fiddle around first|pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: but here, there wasn't all that much fiddling which declarer could do conveniently from his own hand|pg||

nt|benjent: Good choice with 3@c - the 5440 might have encouraged him to try for more, but the breaks would have punished aggression|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fantunes?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: nice they are pretty good :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyu: Zimmermann/Multon and Bessis father and son|pg||

nt|Gerben42: Brother back in the lead 3-2|pg||
nt|benjent: they may simply have had no way to show a constructive @c raise - or maybe 3@c was in fact a constructive raise|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|nt|Gerben42: must have Ribéry on the team|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s3|pg||

nt|athene: after 1nt - pass - pass, is it standard to double with less than in direct seat?|pg||

nt|athene: south can probably see the position|pg||
