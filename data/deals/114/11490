nt|Walddk5: Hello Andy and Ed|pg||
nt|andyv:  Good morning Roland and Ed|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Andy!|pg||
nt|andyv:  first hand seems a simple 4@h |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  good morning everyone|pg||

mb|1N|nt|vugraphzym: Good morning, Andy|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Hello, Andy |pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Hello, Roland|pg||
nt|othered1: kThe prevfious match featured a number of very unusual auctions.  Wonder if it will continue here.|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzym: Hello, Roland |pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Hello, Star6i|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|vugraphzym: 2@H is 13-16 points 5+ @H|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Deyan:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  2N probably an inquiry as to type of 2@s raise|pg||
mb|2D|nt|othered1: rehi, everyone!|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: rehi, Ed|pg||
nt|mamos: game for ew|pg||
nt|mamos: although North doesnt think so|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  Hi Deyan:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: hi all|pg||
mb|3C|nt|vugraphzym: that 3@D bid gives chance to EW to find the 5@D save|pg||
nt|andyv:  if NS find their game|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Roberto Mart√≠nez|pg||
nt|ybob: Hi all :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Hello, Roberto|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: although 4@S is a bit double dummy|pg||
nt|othered1: normal auction, so far, good suit in south making up for 1/2 point high card shortness|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think S hand worth more than an invite|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Welcome back to Rado Radev|pg||
nt|rado: hello:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Hello, Rado|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ybob: Hi Deyan|pg||
nt|andyv:  they may be pushed into it... although it looks like NS are out of ammo|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@s looks too expensive now|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: he can make 4@S |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzym: has to play small @C to earn an entry|pg||
nt|andyv:  2N is a mp bid|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk4: Hello Ed and Andy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and Deyan, our operator|pg||
nt|othered1: west reasonably passed over 1N.  Not sure if it was judgment or a systemic lack of an appropriate call (i.e., double has a conventional meaning)|pg||
nt|othered1: HI, Roland!|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Hi, Roland|pg||
nt|andyv:  good morning everyone|pg||
nt|andyv:  but N sees losing the first 3 tricks and still not sure where rest of tricks are coming from|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: good part score for EW|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: N can make 6@S and 4@C |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  as it turns out|pg||
mb|6N|nt|ybob: nice bid 3@S :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: looks like it can make|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't agree.  depends on actual 1N range and non-vul considerations aren't all that different from matchpoints.|pg||
mb|d|nt|othered1: Hi, Andy!|pg||
mb|r|mb|p|nt|ybob: maybe lead @S defeat|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Momchil Aleksandrobv|pg||

nt|lestergold: im not normally awake at this hour so I may make more errors than the players!|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Andy|pg||
pc|cT|nt|andyv:  this hand going painfully slow...and I can imagine NS not happy the way things are unwrapping|pg||
nt|andyv:  i don't need that excuse Mike:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like E may have trapped himself in his hand and was unable to get @hs started?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: yes at the end he had to play A@H and a @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: but I didnt understand how that happened|pg||
nt|lestergold: My geography was not my best subject at school could you enlighten me as to which countries these respective teams belong to?|pg||

nt|Walddk4: N-S  Romania    E-W  Bulgaria|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Stara Zagora is the organiser of the event.It is in Bulgaria. And the other team is from Buchurest (Romania)|pg||
nt|lestergold: thx Roland|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N looks playable for EW|pg||
nt|star6ija: nice distribution|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzym: EW are playing precision|pg||
nt|star6ija: 7@c is possible, but...|pg||
nt|mamos: grand certainly looks a possibility|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: he put 1NT and then changed it :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Dayan, do you know their NT opening ranges?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: I think it is 15-17|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|vugraphzym: 2@C should be @S and another suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|rado: W has minimum neg dbl here|pg||
nt|othered1: this should go very quickly -- you have a 20-count and partner jump supports  you . . . |pg||
nt|andyv:  AQ10xx suit will almost always produce 4 tricks and 5 tricks a good portion of the time|pg||
mb|2S|nt|lestergold: 3N by West probable diamond lead and no sweat|pg||
nt|andyv:  if 2N is invite, it is a heavy one|pg||
nt|andyv:  but, matter of style, I guess... I like being aggressive with those hands.|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: as Roberto pointed out the timing is very important in such boards - as we like to say in Bulgaria "1 second careless = dead for the rest of your life" :)|pg||
nt|rado: E has a choise rebiding weak @H, 3 cards 2@S or upgrading to 2NT protekting minor Kings|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good morning to Ed Shapiro|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|andyv:  wow....wonderful!!!|pg||
nt|andyv:  oops:)|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@S?  |pg||
nt|othered1: Fast arrival?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: 2NT should be invitational hand yes|pg||
nt|rado: hi Ed|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone, from chilly central Pennsylvania, USA|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Hi, Ed|pg||
mb|3H|nt|andyv:  good morning everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Good morning, Andy|pg||
nt|andyv:  E sequence usually reserved for hands that are just short of game forcing  bids|pg||
nt|lestergold: any lead except a club helps and no one is kicking off with the stiff club ace|pg||
nt|star6ija: this 2@s bid from S is not good option... in this vulnerability strong club has to be sa descriptive as quickly as possible|pg||
nt|mamos: have Ns agreed a suit?|pg||
nt|star6ija: @Ss? :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: I think 1@C is natural, star6i|pg||
nt|mamos: was 1@C strong or nat?|pg||
nt|star6ija: if so ok|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS sure have a lot of points on this hand|pg||
nt|othered1: Agree for playinig for 9 tricks.  But it's likely you'll be playing for 10 in @H with flat hand v. flat hand|pg||
nt|othered1: 7N is off the top and playing 7 elsewhere is just running risk|pg||
nt|andyv:  then bid 2@c and jump to 3N;)|pg||
nt|othered1: That's the auction you find in the post-mortem, but not at the table by either the players or commentators.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: even a spade lead sets up a spade trick for declarer|pg||
nt|andyv:  Ed, ever have hands where you just have too many bids?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ybob: :)|pg||
nt|star6ija: theyare trying to strike back immediately|pg||
nt|othered1: very rarely, but in my partnerships (the few that remain) we define things very tightly.|pg||
nt|andyv:  the N hand would give me a headache here|pg||
nt|othered1: 5N?  2 keys, plus Q, plus void?|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like it|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharkey: Good morning|pg||
nt|andyv:  this auction will run out of steam quickly|pg||
nt|mamos: North thinks it's Hearts :)|pg||
nt|star6ija: 7@cs depends on some precautions which should've benn made by declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: it will be interesting if 6@H are bid wheather E will double :)|pg||
mb|p|pc|cQ|nt|Walddk4: Hello Andy and Carl|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Carl and roland|pg||
nt|ybob: down 2 AK @S low @C , later ruff @S|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@s would have set trump and asked for cue bids|pg||
nt|mamos: ugh|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: 7@S* looks the minimax|pg||
nt|mamos: well it makes but this has not been a good auction imho|pg||
nt|star6ija: 12 tricks are easy|pg||
nt|othered1: I like the 1@H response, to get a natural rebid from partner.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|andyv:  all roads lead to 9 tricks, Mike? :))|pg||
nt|othered1: second best spot, but safe here.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c7|nt|andyv:  they got there.... good thing this isn'|pg||
nt|andyv:  isn't a BAM event:)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|andyv:  and Deyan:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: it didnt run out of steam that quickly :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  they decided to bring it to a boil:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - this auction not for the faint hearted...|pg||
nt|andyv:  so, the question is why E didn't simply open 4@s if that was what he was intending to bid all the time?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well ironically a club lead and declarer has to do abit of guesswork|pg||
nt|andyv:  probably no over tricks|pg||
nt|rado: lack of communications between NS will help declare for 8 tricks|pg||
nt|othered1: this will claim as soon as both follow to one trump|pg||
pc|cK|nt|andyv:  this can go down 500 easily|pg||
nt|ybob: 4/2 @S shows even and interest @C|pg||
nt|star6ija: but @d now will bring the contract home|pg||
nt|othered1: Right -- a hand worth 2@C in playing strength but with inadequate high cards for the call.|pg||
nt|othered1: maybe even 9|pg||
nt|rado: sure with @S suit favourable|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|othered1: I thought that was standard, but east's action here is what I see regularly at the table.  Times changed, I guess.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|nt|sharkey: set before they get started|pg||
nt|andyv:  a pretty steep price to pay to protect against a partial|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|andyv:  I don't think so Ed.|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: N had played 2@D on the A of spade so he was obliged to play it|pg||

nt|sharkey: yes - if make only lose 170 points|pg||
nt|sharkey: not the game bonus in addition|pg||
nt|andyv:  2 questionable bids (2@h and 4@s) produce an inadaquate result|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: This is the ranking after the previous round : http://bridge.bg/ranking163.html|pg||

mb|5S|mb|p|nt|andyv:  3@h a bit aggressive|pg||

mb|p|nt|sharkey: looks like down 1|pg||
nt|othered1: Not that way.|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think this is the optimum way|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: though 4N, if clearly unusual, is decent, planning to convert 5@C to 5@D, thus a slam try (if partner doesn't think you have a red 2-suiter)|pg||
nt|andyv:  would you think about passing the first time and "limping in" later?|pg||
nt|star6ija: playing yes but not defensive|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: well in spite of 4/1 heart break and unfavourable position of KS E/W have  plenty of strength t make 4h here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Results and standings after 3 rounds at   http://bridge.bg/ranking163.html|pg||
nt|andyv:  @s lead will make it very tough|pg||
nt|lestergold: lose a dim and 2 spades must just take care with the timing|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|lestergold: South may be thinking that the best defnce holding 4 trumps is to try and set up a force in which case diamonds was the best prospect|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: bearing in mind that the diamond bid didnt promise diamonds|pg||
nt|andyv:  don't understand the need to play @ss immediately|pg||

nt|vugraphzym: looks like N needs to play the right @S honour in 4@S|pg||
mb|4H|nt|othered1: I open south's hand, but our initial actions are sound and wouldn't criticize a pass if they open lightly in 1 and 2 pos.|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but it is both the natural way to play the spads and the indicate way on the overcall|pg||
nt|mamos: problem on next round|pg||
nt|andyv:  S should dbl here|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: you can find results here : http://bridge.bg/ranking163.html|pg||

nt|andyv:  who wants to be in it?|pg||
nt|andyv:  borderline hand but you do have the majors|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lestergold: in any case a small spade from hand and a cover of any spade that east plays is a safety pklay here|pg||
mb|d|nt|andyv:  this should go down 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: 2@H looked like last makeable spot but you cant blame S for bidding on|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: no |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: should always only lose one sapde trick with this combined holding|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  this contract should be no problem|pg||

nt|andyv:  can easily go down 2 or 3 vul against a partial|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c7|pg||

nt|othered1: You want to play  trumps to avoid 3 losers there, if the rest of the hand allows that|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|othered1: I consider the raise normal, though it might be heresy in some parts of the world.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s6|nt|andyv:  very little for the defense to initiate...just have to wait for declarer|pg||
nt|mamos: on Board 2 reaching 6NT was a fantastic swing for NS as in Open Room 6@H was not a success|pg||
nt|ybob: i cant understand @C at trick 2 ...|pg||
nt|rado: 1@D ruff and 1@d on Q@h and then trumps|pg||

nt|rado: no:)|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h5|nt|ybob: 10@H stiff make this easy|pg||

nt|lestergold: a matter of timing here|pg||
nt|andyv:  but he will shift to @c|pg||

nt|othered1: hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|andyv:  wow... that's a bit rich for me even with this vul|pg||

mb|d|nt|vugraphzym: hello ed|pg||
nt|ybob: Hi Ed !|pg||
nt|andyv:  E must be impressed with the outside strength of his hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  i would bid 4 with S hand|pg||
nt|othered1: 10 cards in 2 suits, favorable vul: bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  don't understand that lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  any game try will get NS too high|pg||
nt|lestergold: well South should be content with 2H his pard hasnt made an unassuming cue bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s too high at 2H!|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6 losers 2 spades 2 dims a club and a dim ruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: admittedly north's raise with two trumps and a collection of quacks under the openiong bid wa pretty pointless|pg||
nt|andyv:  true|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: 3@C a relay?|pg||
nt|andyv:  appears to be|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: GF with @C I suppose|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: 4+ cards|pg||
mb|3C|nt|sharkey: wd|pg||
nt|andyv:  and S has yet to be shy in this set:0|pg||
nt|sharkey: i agree Andy|pg||
nt|andyv:  ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: you pass with north because you o not want to see pard's expression when you table that as dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: N thought for a long time and passed|pg||
nt|lestergold: and his partner could be splinering as it was it was close to a splinter|pg||
nt|ybob: 5@H = 300 |pg||
nt|rado: 5@h is cheap but 5@S easy too|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  N 1N opener hit pay dirt|pg||
nt|sharkey: "looks like 1 NT - open 1 NT"|pg||
nt|andyv:  agree... i like 1N with N cards....too awkward to describe hand if you open 1@D|pg||
nt|sharkey: Leromain picked up another 5 IMPs when W opened 1 NT in OR and played there|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: he just claimed|pg||
nt|ybob: 2@H = 5+ @H  13/16 pts |pg||
nt|ybob: WOW|pg||
nt|othered1: but it's a good one, I think|pg||
nt|andyv:  gave up a club trick so I'm no so sure how good it is|pg||
nt|othered1: gave up a trick?|pg||
nt|andyv:  it hasn't yet but it's frozen the suit so N can never lead it|pg||
nt|othered1: What other lead beats it?  South wins @D and plays another @C before east can drive last @S, no?|pg||
nt|andyv:  now E can play the hand straight up|pg||
nt|mamos: 43 imps have changed hand son Boards 1-3 so -300 may be the flattest board yet|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: you can go down in 5@S|pg||
nt|ybob: defeat 5@S|pg||
nt|andyv:  7@c great contract except for 4-1 break|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: and still you can make |pg||
nt|othered1: very careful auction by west.  an immediate 6N, just quantitative, would appeal to many|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Nice pass by east, for play in @D, but 3N is there for the taking.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this is 2 off at least|pg||
nt|ybob: good lead|pg||
nt|rado: yes due unvaourable trump break|pg||
mb|3S|nt|andyv:  all 7@c requires is 1 @s ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: in my book N hand a clear 1 NT opener|pg||
nt|lestergold: a trump lead would have been  reasonably murderous|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: It's good to have very tight agreements when  you embark on an auction like west's.|pg||
mb|p|pc|d9|nt|othered1: is 4N a sign-off?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: looks like RKCB|pg||
nt|othered1: coiuld be, or west could be cue-bidding in rank order.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|othered1: what, then, is 5@S?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|othered1: playing K may mislead south|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think anything else beats it... I just don't understand leading from Jx of a minor when pd has opened a major.  Why not lead pd's suit?|pg||
nt|othered1: inspiration counts|pg||
nt|andyv:  it would also make me open suits that I don't want the lead because I know pd will never lead my suit:)|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't hate that lead at all.  South does have enough @H length that he might decide to try to attack elsewhre|pg||
nt|andyv:  would you hate the lead if the club honors were split?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: some talking about the bidding between W and S|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|sharkey: 4@H OR as well|pg||
nt|mamos: well not many points here but the contract looks a good one|pg||
nt|rado: facing 5th fit and heraing 4@C values + fit @D lead is logical|pg||
pc|d6|nt|othered1: Pays your money, takes your choice, it says.|pg||
nt|andyv:  end result was disappointing (to the specs and us, that is)|pg||
nt|othered1: Wow, after the double, that @SJ promotes.  Wonder if west had alternatives to 6N?|pg||
nt|othered1: alternatives that would have continued the auction|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||

pc|s4|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s8|nt|andyv:  just for partnership trust, I don't think N could ever pass 3@c|pg||

pc|h7|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|nt|andyv:  now he leads a @h?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|andyv:  game set and match|pg||
nt|lestergold: two bad bids Andy|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|othered1: But maybe north should have enouraged @C at trick 1, or if they play upside down signals south should have continued|pg||
nt|andyv:  J@c turned out to be a good lead... S had to follow thru|pg||
nt|othered1: did north discourage or did south ignore it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: N could have ducked @D to hand and then it would have been down 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: W went out|pg||
nt|othered1: Little old ladies at the club would have gotten there in 2 bids and wouldn't have put pressure on the partnership's confidence in their agreements|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: by north|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|d8|nt|sharkey: cud have been interesting if E held the @DK and returned a @C at the end...|pg||

nt|andyv:  you may be right Carl..11-13... that's the only way you can explain the 3N bid|pg||
