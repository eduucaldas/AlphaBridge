nt|theonlyjc: yes, and may make it if declarer blocks the hearts (or avoid a heart lead)|pg||
nt|lestergold: easy peasy now just knock out ace of clubs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: If playing a strong NT, this 1NT should be about 18-19, so 3NT is a good bid with the East hand. |pg||

nt|vugraphzyq: laydown|pg||
nt|rodal f: And the moisent came|pg||
nt|lestergold: club lead looks more attractive from south's point of view|pg||
nt|rodal f: W with 2@S loosers and 3@H normaly should pass|pg||
nt|ahri: as some juniors would say... "a 50% slam - either they lead spade, or they don't" :)|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|harie2:  seems an normal contract but cane he make it?|pg||
nt|ady: some would have competed with the north hand  but as it happens they cant make anything more than 8 tricks in diamonds|pg||
nt|xenya: good judgement by E -- xxx in partners's second suit is a distinhctly negative feature |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: and the dim q is placed favourably|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|othered1: 25 HCP and a play for 3N, stopping at 2@S.  What happens in 2/1, when south takes a false preference on a maximum. |pg||
nt|lestergold: exacly|pg||
nt|geot: now Simonsen will analyze for a while, then just take the club finesse at some stage. 1430|pg||

nt|petergill: Good lead by South|pg||
nt|brolucius: It seems that declarer is one trick short.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Reasoning that three spades and one other trick would not be enough to beat 3NT, it was not out of the question that South might try a heart instead. He has done well. |pg||
