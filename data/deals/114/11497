nt|granguru: by North|pg||
nt|granguru: I guess|pg||
nt|othered1: Any thoughts on north's bids in CR?  Looks like north took plenty of them.|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@D in Closed Room was frisky|pg||
nt|granguru: You may know closed room bidding just by putting your mouse ever the CR contract...|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: Ace = trick and a half, King = trick, Queen = 1/2 trick... from 0 to 2.5 tricks have to be adjusted for the difference between longest and shortest suit|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW can make 2 or 3 @H so it should not be too bad at -150|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|1H|mb|2C!|mb|2H|mb|p!|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: 2@C a transfer to @D here?|pg||
nt|othered1: True, and that might justify north's 4@D bid, assuming he has the opponents bound and gagged before he makes it.  500 would not be a fair trade for the partial.|pg||
nt|granguru: so A/K ratio is 1.5 which is a better approach than 4-3-2-1 count|pg||
nt|granguru: where the A is underdevaluated|pg||
nt|granguru: is it is worth a little more than 4|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: yes with 4 or more "tricks"|pg||
pc|s7|nt|granguru: 4/3 is 1.333|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: no... this is difference divided by 2|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: Ace and 2 Queens are 1.5+0.5+0.5 = 2.5|pg||
nt|granguru: I am comparing with Milton Work hand evaluation|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: aha sorry|pg||
nt|othered1: that's a nice lead for declarer, who will come up with an overtrick|pg||
nt|granguru: I find this one better|pg||
nt|granguru: at the first view|pg||
nt|othered1: Distribution is very friendly for declarer here.|pg||
nt|granguru: the more control you have for the hand the  greater the value error you have|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: (5-2)/2 = 1.5 more... difference between longest and shortest suits|pg||
pc|s3|nt|othered1: is second high leads the standard here and does it apply to greater length as well (2 & 4, perhaps)?|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|mariner1: personally I like the 4 3 2 1 count method as it allows one to upgrade or|pg||
nt|mariner1: downgrade a hand's value...... one real problem is many tend to upgrade|pg||
nt|mariner1: average hands and "forget" to downgrade poor ones.......... added there are|pg||
nt|mariner1: actually more downgrade opportunities than upgrades by a long shot...........|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|c9|pc|c4|pg||
pc|dK|nt|granguru: f.i. if you have 4 Aces...Goren says to add 1 more point - in the understand that the real value is clearly more than 16|pg||
pc|d7|pc|c8|pc|d2|pg||

nt|andyv:  Good morning Roland and Ed|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Andy!|pg||
nt|andyv:  first hand seems a simple 4@h |pg||

nt|vugraphzym: hi all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hello silvia and specs|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzym: that 3@D bid gives chance to EW to find the 5@D save|pg||
nt|andyv:  if NS find their game|pg||
mb|4D|nt|vugraphzym: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Roberto Mart√≠nez|pg||
nt|ybob: Hi all :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Hello, Roberto|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: although 4@S is a bit double dummy|pg||
nt|othered1: normal auction, so far, good suit in south making up for 1/2 point high card shortness|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think S hand worth more than an invite|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Welcome back to Rado Radev|pg||
nt|rado: hello:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Hello, Rado|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: Hi Deyan|pg||
nt|andyv:  they may be pushed into it... although it looks like NS are out of ammo|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@s looks too expensive now|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: he can make 4@S |pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzym: has to play small @C to earn an entry|pg||
nt|andyv:  2N is a mp bid|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk4: Hello Ed and Andy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and Deyan, our operator|pg||
nt|othered1: west reasonably passed over 1N.  Not sure if it was judgment or a systemic lack of an appropriate call (i.e., double has a conventional meaning)|pg||
nt|othered1: HI, Roland!|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Hi, Roland|pg||
nt|andyv:  good morning everyone|pg||
nt|andyv:  but N sees losing the first 3 tricks and still not sure where rest of tricks are coming from|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: good part score for EW|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: N can make 6@S and 4@C |pg||
pc|h6|nt|andyv:  as it turns out|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ybob: nice bid 3@S :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: looks like it can make|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't agree.  depends on actual 1N range and non-vul considerations aren't all that different from matchpoints.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|othered1: Hi, Andy!|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|ybob: maybe lead @S defeat|pg||

nt|andyv:  Hi Ed:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4D a doubtful decision as almopst surely going minus|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rado: after friendly lead declarer has 9 top tricks and will try @D to develop more|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||

nt|vugraphzym: sth strange happened|pg||

nt|lestergold: im not normally awake at this hour so I may make more errors than the players!|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Andy|pg||
pc|c2|nt|andyv:  this hand going painfully slow...and I can imagine NS not happy the way things are unwrapping|pg||
nt|andyv:  i don't need that excuse Mike:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like E may have trapped himself in his hand and was unable to get @hs started?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: yes at the end he had to play A@H and a @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: but I didnt understand how that happened|pg||
nt|lestergold: My geography was not my best subject at school could you enlighten me as to which countries these respective teams belong to?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: they are not showing their cards :)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|andyv:  Had to get up sometime|pg||

pc|cA|pg||

nt|othered1: with a strong NT, I presume|pg||
nt|mariner1: @H lead ends any real chance here unless defense slips|pg||
nt|granguru: quite interesting point|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: no there are 9 tricks|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.jeffgoldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi   a good easy tool to evaluate|pg||
nt|mariner1: hands as a reference point|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||

nt|granguru: do you know the URL ?|pg||
nt|othered1: @C7|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
nt|mariner1: the link above is the Kaplan one|pg||
nt|granguru: aaah|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: I think as far as they use udca, now the chances are greater|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
nt|granguru: @C guessed|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: but the declarer guessed it correct|pg||
nt|granguru: now he will try to go for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|othered1: As a KS devotee, I like the evaluator, but it does reflect Edgar Kaplan's biases (flatness and unattended honors bad, honor tricks, shape good.|pg||
nt|mariner1: even it does not downgrade enough hands, such a K1098x is far better than|pg||
nt|mariner1: K7532 in a NT contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: or just to ensure the 9th if he trusts @H 2|pg||
nt|mariner1: true Ed... it is a good tool for reference purposes though|pg||

nt|Walddk4: N-S  Romania    E-W  Bulgaria|pg||

nt|lestergold: thx Roland|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N looks playable for EW|pg||
nt|star6ija: nice distribution|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: hi all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi Geoff|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|vugraphzym: EW are playing precision|pg||
nt|star6ija: 7@c is possible, but...|pg||
nt|mamos: grand certainly looks a possibility|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: he put 1NT and then changed it :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Dayan, do you know their NT opening ranges?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: I think it is 15-17|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D!|nt|vugraphzym: 2@C should be @S and another suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|rado: W has minimum neg dbl here|pg||
nt|othered1: this should go very quickly -- you have a 20-count and partner jump supports  you . . . |pg||
nt|andyv:  AQ10xx suit will almost always produce 4 tricks and 5 tricks a good portion of the time|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lestergold: 3N by West probable diamond lead and no sweat|pg||
nt|andyv:  if 2N is invite, it is a heavy one|pg||
nt|andyv:  but, matter of style, I guess... I like being aggressive with those hands.|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: as Roberto pointed out the timing is very important in such boards - as we like to say in Bulgaria "1 second careless = dead for the rest of your life" :)|pg||
nt|rado: E has a choise rebiding weak @H, 3 cards 2@S or upgrading to 2NT protekting minor Kings|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  wow....wonderful!!!|pg||
nt|andyv:  oops:)|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@S?  |pg||
nt|othered1: Fast arrival?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: 2NT should be invitational hand yes|pg||
nt|rado: hi Ed|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone, from chilly central Pennsylvania, USA|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Hi, Ed|pg||
pc|h5|nt|andyv:  good morning everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Good morning, Andy|pg||
nt|andyv:  E sequence usually reserved for hands that are just short of game forcing  bids|pg||
nt|lestergold: any lead except a club helps and no one is kicking off with the stiff club ace|pg||
nt|star6ija: this 2@s bid from S is not good option... in this vulnerability strong club has to be sa descriptive as quickly as possible|pg||
nt|mamos: have Ns agreed a suit?|pg||
nt|star6ija: @Ss? :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: I think 1@C is natural, star6i|pg||
nt|mamos: was 1@C strong or nat?|pg||
nt|star6ija: if so ok|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS sure have a lot of points on this hand|pg||
nt|othered1: Agree for playinig for 9 tricks.  But it's likely you'll be playing for 10 in @H with flat hand v. flat hand|pg||
nt|othered1: 7N is off the top and playing 7 elsewhere is just running risk|pg||
nt|andyv:  then bid 2@c and jump to 3N;)|pg||
nt|othered1: That's the auction you find in the post-mortem, but not at the table by either the players or commentators.|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Good morning to Joe Stokes|pg||
nt|jstokes: Hello all|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: even a spade lead sets up a spade trick for declarer|pg||
nt|andyv:  Ed, ever have hands where you just have too many bids?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi Joe|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ybob: :)|pg||
nt|star6ija: theyare trying to strike back immediately|pg||
nt|othered1: very rarely, but in my partnerships (the few that remain) we define things very tightly.|pg||
nt|andyv:  the N hand would give me a headache here|pg||
nt|othered1: 5N?  2 keys, plus Q, plus void?|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like it|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sharkey: Good morning|pg||
nt|andyv:  this auction will run out of steam quickly|pg||
nt|mamos: North thinks it's Hearts :)|pg||
nt|star6ija: 7@cs depends on some precautions which should've benn made by declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: it will be interesting if 6@H are bid wheather E will double :)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|nt|Walddk4: Hello Andy and Carl|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Carl and roland|pg||
nt|ybob: down 2 AK @S low @C , later ruff @S|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@s would have set trump and asked for cue bids|pg||
nt|mamos: ugh|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: 7@S* looks the minimax|pg||
nt|mamos: well it makes but this has not been a good auction imho|pg||
nt|star6ija: 12 tricks are easy|pg||
nt|othered1: I like the 1@H response, to get a natural rebid from partner.|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|andyv:  all roads lead to 9 tricks, Mike? :))|pg||
nt|othered1: second best spot, but safe here.|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|andyv:  they got there.... good thing this isn'|pg||
nt|andyv:  isn't a BAM event:)|pg||

nt|andyv:  and Deyan:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: it didnt run out of steam that quickly :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  they decided to bring it to a boil:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - this auction not for the faint hearted...|pg||
nt|andyv:  so, the question is why E didn't simply open 4@s if that was what he was intending to bid all the time?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well ironically a club lead and declarer has to do abit of guesswork|pg||
nt|andyv:  probably no over tricks|pg||
nt|rado: lack of communications between NS will help declare for 8 tricks|pg||
nt|othered1: this will claim as soon as both follow to one trump|pg||
pc|s3|nt|andyv:  this can go down 500 easily|pg||
nt|ybob: 4/2 @S shows even and interest @C|pg||
nt|star6ija: but @d now will bring the contract home|pg||
nt|othered1: Right -- a hand worth 2@C in playing strength but with inadequate high cards for the call.|pg||
nt|othered1: maybe even 9|pg||
nt|rado: sure with @S suit favourable|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|othered1: I thought that was standard, but east's action here is what I see regularly at the table.  Times changed, I guess.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|sharkey: set before they get started|pg||
nt|andyv:  a pretty steep price to pay to protect against a partial|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h9|pc|h6|pc|c4|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think so Ed.|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: N had played 2@D on the A of spade so he was obliged to play it|pg||

nt|andyv:  I don't think this is the optimum way|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|othered1: though 4N, if clearly unusual, is decent, planning to convert 5@C to 5@D, thus a slam try (if partner doesn't think you have a red 2-suiter)|pg||
nt|andyv:  would you think about passing the first time and "limping in" later?|pg||

pc|h2|nt|sharkey: unless something happens in the @D suit|pg||

nt|othered1: At his vulnerability, all passing would do is give NS a chance to find an eventual save.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s4|pg||
nt|lestergold: South may be thinking that the best defnce holding 4 trumps is to try and set up a force in which case diamonds was the best prospect|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: bearing in mind that the diamond bid didnt promise diamonds|pg||
nt|andyv:  don't understand the need to play @ss immediately|pg||

nt|othered1: You want to play  trumps to avoid 3 losers there, if the rest of the hand allows that|pg||
pc|h3|nt|othered1: I consider the raise normal, though it might be heresy in some parts of the world.|pg||

pc|h4|nt|andyv:  all 7@c requires is 1 @s ruff|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sharkey: in my book N hand a clear 1 NT opener|pg||
nt|lestergold: a trump lead would have been  reasonably murderous|pg||
pc|hK|nt|othered1: It's good to have very tight agreements when  you embark on an auction like west's.|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|othered1: is 4N a sign-off?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: looks like RKCB|pg||
nt|othered1: coiuld be, or west could be cue-bidding in rank order.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|othered1: what, then, is 5@S?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|othered1: playing K may mislead south|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think anything else beats it... I just don't understand leading from Jx of a minor when pd has opened a major.  Why not lead pd's suit?|pg||
nt|othered1: inspiration counts|pg||
nt|andyv:  it would also make me open suits that I don't want the lead because I know pd will never lead my suit:)|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't hate that lead at all.  South does have enough @H length that he might decide to try to attack elsewhre|pg||
nt|andyv:  would you hate the lead if the club honors were split?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: some talking about the bidding between W and S|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|nt|sharkey: 4@H OR as well|pg||

nt|lestergold: two bad bids Andy|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|othered1: But maybe north should have enouraged @C at trick 1, or if they play upside down signals south should have continued|pg||
nt|andyv:  J@c turned out to be a good lead... S had to follow thru|pg||
nt|othered1: did north discourage or did south ignore it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: N could have ducked @D to hand and then it would have been down 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: W went out|pg||
nt|othered1: Little old ladies at the club would have gotten there in 2 bids and wouldn't have put pressure on the partnership's confidence in their agreements|pg||

nt|star6ija: hello everybody :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: ho Momchil|pg||
nt|othered1: oh, that's what they did score|pg||
nt|othered1: brb|pg||
nt|andyv:  as severl specs pointed out, there is a @C/@s squeeze so, @c finesse wasn't necessary|pg||
nt|andyv:  but only if the 3 spades are with the club K|pg||
nt|lestergold: a shortage of what?|pg||
nt|andyv:  electrical:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  his mind shorted out|pg||
nt|lestergold: a shortage o operative brain ells on that occasion i tyhought u meant|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting 4@s hand here|pg||
nt|andyv:  same thing, Mike:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: 3@D bid doesnt mean AKQJ|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|sharkey: hi :)|pg||
nt|star6ija: hello, Andy and Carl :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Momchil|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Hi, star6i :) |pg||
nt|andyv:  N's bidding has been interesting this set..very much up and down|pg||
nt|ybob: 3NT best spot , win too 4@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: Andy you are trying hard to be polite straining at the seams Id say|pg||
nt|andyv:  See Ed...board 5 was a swing board:))|pg||
mb|d|nt|andyv:  empathy, Mike... we've all been there and done things at the table that later on we have no idea what we were thinking about.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|vugraphzym: I think S's hand was pretty good and there was a finesse on and still down 1|pg||
nt|ybob: slam time|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|andyv:  wonder if EW are playing non forcing free bids...that would explain double instead of 1@S bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: not clear who is buying this hand 3h N/S limit already reached|pg||
nt|jstokes: S wishing he had a penalty double here.....|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sharkey: yes - some of it not suitable for the Family Hour :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  12 imps picked up on Board 7 as strangely, they didn't get to that fine 4@h contract:0|pg||
nt|lestergold: c|pg||
nt|rado: 1@C-1@h-1@s-2@D*-3@S will present good picture of W's hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr for interrupting. Could not stand it. Leaving in ten min for my next set.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lestergold: 3S a brave effort vul all on his own|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: oh|pg||
nt|rado: but he decided to jump reverse immy|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 2@C a variation of New Minor Forcing...?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@D I mean|pg||
nt|ybob: i prefer play 10 from dummy to invite another @D round|pg||
nt|andyv:  E came here to bid:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: prtner has promised a good hand with a good 6 card suit he happens to have neither|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@d very playable|pg||
nt|lestergold: but if west is going to bid it should be 4s|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5D needs a lot of good guessing|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2c a dim  heart and a spade to be lost on a bad day|pg||
nt|andyv:  only @d hook... but if N covers 10@S immediately, 5@d will go down|pg||
nt|ybob: yes|pg||
nt|othered1: after west supports @H, east will push the rest of the way|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: no way they can miss the slam now|pg||
nt|rado: facing strongest sequence available E has to check key  cards only for grand:)|pg||
nt|othered1: East's black honors are key in an auction like this.|pg||
nt|andyv:  always welcome Frank|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  i play it as forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: 5@D goes down with a @C switch aftrer K @H|pg||
nt|rado: rkcb for @H maybe|pg||
nt|othered1: Only question for east may be whether a black suit might be more solid than @H.|pg||
nt|ybob: 5@H = 2+Q @H|pg||
pc|d8|nt|star6ija: this is a nice event... actually it started in the year of 2005 as Balkan Championship|pg||
nt|othered1: with west having a possible pitch on the @D.|pg||
nt|rado: AQJx Qxx x AKJxx might be W's hand:)|pg||
nt|ybob: i play 6Nt with E hand|pg||
nt|othered1: That's what I was considering|pg||
nt|rado: so after KC reply some pick a slam bid would be nice|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: W is holding his head|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: he seems not to understand 4@S bid|pg||
nt|othered1: if you have a pick a slam call available after setting trumps with RKC|pg||
nt|ybob: kickback ?|pg||
nt|rado: if E had 4-4 in Majors with FG he may bid 4@S directly, so now he has more|pg||
nt|ybob: i dont like a 4¬∫ suit in a Fg sequence|pg||
pc|d7|nt|vugraphzym: W alerted 3@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4d may have a more realistic chance of a plus score|pg||
nt|andyv:  if they find the switch...pd doesn't always have 5 for his 3 level raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: now he alerted and explained RBC|pg||
nt|rado: btw other room stoped at 4@H|pg||
nt|rado: so a swing expected|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sharkey: agree Andy - 2@H may have been non-forcing|pg||
nt|andyv:  looking for @c slam?|pg||
nt|othered1: I'll settle for a 1-imp loss of 5 when I stop short of the grand.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Thx Andy, the humorist by swings|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|sharkey: has it chances... but will probably fail|pg||
nt|star6ija: Mr Toni Rousev from Stara Zagora, supported by some local enthusiasts helped the idea to come true|pg||
nt|sharkey: how many nations participate Momchil?|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS used their rabbit's foot on this auction|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|andyv:  slam asperations died a quick death|pg||
nt|sharkey: this may be trouble too...|pg||
nt|star6ija: 2 years ago Balkan Championship started to change its locality... Bucarest year ago and Novi Sad (Serbia) - November this year|pg||
nt|lestergold: partner can show count|pg||
nt|othered1: In other room, I think east didin't give enough value to the black honors|pg||
nt|andyv:  tough to stay out of gameon this one but well done by EW|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|othered1: A little lucky that 6@H is so playable,  6N didnt seem to be under consideration.  Guess ruffing out long @C suit was possible|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: and still looks like they are going down|pg||
pc|c2|nt|andyv:  if N is listening:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: or dont they have such sophisticated kit|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok, Mike, pay up:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: pay up?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: they are playing only 4 :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: although if W didnt have J of @C a club switch would have been vital even in 4|pg||
nt|andyv:  still, they should try to defend it properly|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ybob: What if W hand was AQJX QXX Q AKJXX ?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|star6ija: we have record concerning the number of the participants this year|pg||
nt|andyv:  probably want to take @c hook thru N|pg||
nt|ybob: or AQJX QJ X AKJXXX|pg||
nt|othered1: 23 highs and misfit isn't automatic to push to game.|pg||
nt|andyv:  need @d switch|pg||
nt|othered1: won't @C back also work?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: see you after lunch break :)|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|pc|c9|nt|andyv:  what do you do on j@s then?|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: probably he decided S has long @D|pg||
nt|sharkey: @D10 shud enforce @S signal|pg||
nt|othered1: claim time|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h5|nt|star6ija: 12 teams from Bulgaria, Romania, Serbia, Greece and Sweden take a part in the competition|pg||
nt|rodal f: No. 10 then on one original trumh trick at @S with a new pitch in @D|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|andyv:  mainly not to make it easy for @s shift|pg||
nt|sharkey: not at all|pg||
pc|h3|nt|andyv:  and W just managed to go down in 4|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|star6ija: Turkey also of course :)|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sharkey: Especially after N ditched two of them|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sharkey: you let Sweden into Balkan?|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't know what signals NS are using but the messages aren't getting thru|pg||
nt|star6ija: Scandinavia is also peninsula, so we think there is no problem :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think N shud had pitched @D from th top|pg||
pc|d3|pc|sK|nt|andyv:  wd|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sJ|pc|s2|pc|h7|pg||
nt|lestergold: two off|pg||
nt|othered1: south simply taking the plus, a reasonable decision|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or. Al was right. How to enter the table|pg||
nt|rodal f: By and good luck.|pg||
nt|andyv:  bye|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|pc|d6|pc|d4|pg||
pc|c5|mc|6|nt|jstokes: and some IMPs for EW here to avoid the shutout|pg||
