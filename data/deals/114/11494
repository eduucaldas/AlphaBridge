nt|cuttysark: I guess in a Goulash you don't want to get to high|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk3: Either you love Goulash, or you hate it. There is nothing in between|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk3: Personally I love goulash .... but as a Hungarian dish|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||

mc|9|nt|lestergold: misfits on a grand guignol scale|pg||

nt|sybarra: and hello Denis |pg||
nt|mug: sorry I can't be here this year but this is the next best thing|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|sybarra: the "leaping bids"  will start soon |pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: this is Goulash from moscow, mixture of IMP and BAM scoring|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is interesting i was once told when in doubt bid game instead of slam and partscore instead of game when hands were goulashed|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: http://www.nncup.org/page_08_e.htm|pg||
nt|sybarra: how do they score it? |pg||
nt|mug: noone's going to be leaping too high here|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: we play patton|pg||
nt|mug: West will probably settle for an invitational bid|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: thought he might crash into 4 @S |pg||
nt|mug: partner is almost certain to be void in spades after 2@C|pg||
pc|h3|nt|roswolf: probably a sound start|pg||
nt|mug: to be honest I think 4@S was a wild overbid|pg||
pc|c2|pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
nt|mug: you should expect two trump losers with the broken spade suit|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|d2|pg||
nt|sybarra: losing 2@H and 2 @S?|pg||

nt|lestergold: what is this 2D bid|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Transfer, I imagine - doen's everybody over interfernece these days?|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh i forgot they are on space dust|pg||
mb|3D|nt|lestergold: hi Liz join this mad hatters tea party eh!!!|pg||
nt|vugraphzza: Its natural 2@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: lol  I like the North hand|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|lestergold: i dont its only hundred hons not 150|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|5D|nt|lestergold: please cue buid an ace partner well i have a couple bjut lets tell you about KH|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: If I wre North I think I would have puned 7@C some time ago - don't want partner bidding 7NT|pg||
mb|7C|nt|lestergold: now i better tell you about JH|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: but north says you force me to bid 7C for one off|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh but yoyu have the spade ace after l;l pard |pg||
nt|Walddk3: In some instances @SA might not even be needed|pg||
nt|lestergold: well Liz in the end he had no choice had to point 7C|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk3: Maybe an opponent wants to lead a diamond|pg||
nt|cuttysark: And he has achieved Par - does he get a prize?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Then who cares who has @SA|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|s2|pg||
nt|lestergold: is it par?|pg||
mc|13|nt|cuttysark: For NS is is|pg||

nt|roswolf: ah a 4nt bid for north|pg||
nt|sybarra: dont think in goulash that is right  |pg||
mb|1S|mb|3H|mb|7C|nt|sybarra: wow!!!  look at N hand!!!!|pg||
nt|sybarra: and who need BW anyway??|pg||
nt|mug: East will bid 7@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: Nord has an ordinary hand in Goulash )|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe should have walked it up?|pg||
nt|mug: creepy crawly doesn't work in my experience|pg||
nt|sybarra: you have played there,  so you should know |pg||
nt|mug: and anyway North is far from guaranteed to make 7@C|pg||
nt|mug: he needs South to have @SA, and to avoid a spade ruff|pg||
nt|mug: this way East is put to the test|pg||
nt|sybarra: and that is a consideration  (the ruff that is) |pg||
nt|mug: BIG consideration Shirley|pg||
nt|roswolf: but even goulashes obey the laws of probability - dont they?|pg||
nt|sybarra: Easts pard did not announce a great hand! |pg||
nt|sybarra: actually geoffrey from watching,  they are very disciplined  |pg||
nt|mug: but West's bid showed a long suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: or commenting last couple of years,  (I should say) |pg||
nt|roswolf: would a prolonged pause and pass impose any ethical problems on west|pg||
nt|mug: yes you're right Shirley, the best players are very conservative and very disciplined|pg||
mb|7H|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mug: partnership trust is very important|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mug: good bidding by all|pg||
nt|sybarra: we have a way to say it in US,   "this tourney is a hoot"  (hoot= entertaining, fun etc) |pg||
nt|mug: certainly is|pg||
nt|mug: we did terribly but had a really great time last year|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|roswolf: perhaps for 5this tourney only you should be allowed to bid at the 8 level as in the old days|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sybarra: would you do it again Tom?|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|mug: was planning to come this year but circs intervened|pg||

nt|sybarra: :(|pg||
nt|sybarra: poor S doesnt have a club to lead :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: 7@c from the other table|pg||
nt|sybarra: other room almost walked it up |pg||
nt|roswolf: yes after a straightforward ordinary type auction|pg||
nt|mug: South should be DD here|pg||
nt|mug: his partner must have 12 clubs|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mug: it won't matter, big winning board for his team|pg||
nt|mug: although a trick went there, poor defence|pg||
nt|roswolf: only -4|pg||
pc|d2|pc|cK|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|pc|c2|nt|sybarra: bah  q of clubs!|pg||

pc|c2|nt|cuttysark: Glad we have found someone with experience :)|pg||
nt|nicksan: Guess it's hard to predict what's going to happen...|pg||
nt|Walddk3: flip a coin|pg||
nt|lestergold: well e/w have got the better ofthis deal for sure|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Can they not make 5@D?|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s3|pc|c3|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|lestergold: e/whad only 8 tricksavailable in 3N so a couple off doubled here for 300 is profit|pg||
nt|lestergold: can they make it|pg||
nt|lestergold: perhaps they can|pg||

nt|sybarra: oh good another great hand, I LOVE this tourney!!|pg||
nt|mug: as 16 IMP swings are pretty routine|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: are you allowed to psyche in this event or is it frowned upon|pg||
nt|sybarra: or when you thought you lost 16   you mates say  "push"  |pg||
nt|mug: you can do what you like Geoff|pg||
mb|1D|mb|4S|nt|mug: but I think psyching would be foolish|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|sybarra: doubt you need to, pard may take you seriously |pg||
nt|mug: this double is probably not penalty|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: hmm some interesting tactics could arise eg 4@H BY NORTH INSTEAD OF 4@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: and you see,  "WE" dont X |pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: in QF we play 2 segments. Each segment consist of 5 boards.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sybarra: imo,  this is such a great lesson to play goulash |pg||
nt|mug: I don't think it has much in common with bridge, the point is that it is good fun|pg||
nt|roswolf: great comment tom|pg||
nt|sybarra: my thought on that would be..........for students (I dont teach) think about what you heard in bidding,  and think about what the hands could be|pg||
nt|mug: North probably considered a trump lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: double ruffing finesse brings in a few tricks|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|mug: always on the shortlist when you have one|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|c4|nt|mug: West will hardly expect the clubs to lie so well |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|sybarra: Tom what did you do re systems,  when you played?  strong 2's?|pg||
nt|mug: the English team plays 2C thru 2NT as limited two-suiters, covering all combinations except the minors|pg||
nt|mug: 4NT is the minors|pg||
nt|mug: one bids show good hands|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok,  dont give away all secrets |pg||
pc|s3|pc|c6|pc|d5|nt|mug: 3NT we used to play as Blackwood, but this year the boys are playing it as a 10-trick major-suit hand|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c9|pc|d2|pc|c3|pg||
nt|mug: think he's gone off, playing for North to have a short club honour|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer may run out of control here|pg||
nt|mug: some pairs in Moscow have very detailed specialist systems|pg||
nt|sybarra: for specs,  none of these systems are permitted in "normal" tourneys   |pg||
nt|mug: our system would be permitted in normal tournaments, but it would be absurd :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: lol|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh fair comment |pg||
nt|sybarra: just trying to point out,  this is very "specialized"  tourney/systems etc |pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but the fun factor should be predominant|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes  I envy Tom for playing it |pg||
nt|mug: the event is played in very good spirits|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|pc|dT|pc|d8|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sybarra: and he may mean that "literally" |pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|5C|nt|lestergold: 6d N/S but how expensive is 7c b E/w|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|6D|nt|cuttysark: Should one develop a differnet system for Goulash? Normal methods do not usually cope well with freaks|pg||
mb|p|nt|nicksan: 5 @D...|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 7C a profitbale save indeed|pg||
mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: oh no im blind 6d one off on the two ruffs|pg||
mc|13|nt|nicksan: Club ruff and spade ruff available...but not any more|pg||
nt|lestergold: lead only mae a difference of two tricks|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Hard lead to find :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: hard to lead form ones 9 card suit to the KQ?|pg||
pg||
qx|c4|st||md|2SJ6HQ952DK9852CJ3,ST98432HAK8764D3C,SAKQ75HDAQJT74CA8,SHJT3D6CKQT976542|sv|b|nt|sybarra: made for more interesting match anyway |pg||
nt|mug: tough when your suit breaks 3-3, how can you play for that?|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: as usual,   ....here we go again!|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|mug: 6@D is a fair result for NS|pg||
mb|2D|nt|roswolf: pass = poor hand?|pg||
nt|mug: 7@D is cold but EW can save in 6@H|pg||
nt|sybarra: here we go "blasting" into..........|pg||
nt|mug: or 7@H obviously|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is gf presumably in this event|pg||
nt|sybarra: they might try the "reverse" to save in 6 @H  LOL|pg||
nt|roswolf: and now we get 3@D from west!?|pg||
mb|d|nt|mug: hang on, West can ruff a club and East can ruff a spade, didn't see that|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk5: This is divided into to halves of 5 boards, so there will be a short break after board 5|pg||
nt|roswolf: bid what you think you can make|pg||
nt|sybarra: yeah this can go down |pg||
nt|mug: doubles like West's usually show 2-suiters|pg||
nt|mug: 3-suited hands are very rare|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mug: second double is for the club lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: and slam doubles lightner !?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and X says  2 suiter,  lead a (suit preference if you have one) club |pg||
nt|mug: watch for the suit preference club lead|pg||
mb|p|pc|cK|nt|mug: @CQ might have been clearer for West|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mug: let's see if he gets it right|pg||
nt|roswolf: well is it clear to ruff and lead a spade?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mug: I don't know what theyv|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|mug: 've agreed about these situations|pg||
nt|mug: might have been clearer to have led something like the TEN of clubs|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s5|nt|roswolf: well done|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s6|pg||
mc|11|nt|mug: on the same wavelength, well done by E-W|pg||
nt|sybarra: so this hand was "only" 17 imps |pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: Kholomeev said: "very good when the trumps are 1-1, isn't it?"|pg||
pg||

mb|d|nt|lestergold: well odds of 9/13|pg||
mb|3S|mb|4S|nt|lestergold: fav vul west can get his spades in|pg||
mb|5D|mb|d|nt|lestergold: and here the boss suit wins out lookslike par here is 6h N/S doubled off 1|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think bidding voids is good|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: or made on spade lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: sfatey bid by eat o 6S better than getting the lead wronbg!!|pg||
nt|nicksan: When was the last hand someone played in 1 NT?|pg||
nt|lestergold: just before then 1917 revolution|pg||
mb|6S|mb|d|nt|lestergold: East has his tank for sure|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: took the insurance|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk3: This is divided into to halves of 5 boards, so there will be a short break after this hand|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Time to recover, regroup, rewrite the system...|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|cK|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|nicksan: I know some pairs make a special Goulash system for this tournament. Something about being able to show most two-suiters very early in the auction...|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Zmud and Bal have a system for Goulash|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|pc|cQ|nt|nicksan: Eh?|pg||
nt|lestergold: what?|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Did soemone say save?|pg||
nt|lestergold: playing pard for stiffy club oh dear|pg||
mc|12|nt|cuttysark: Might as well lead the three, though|pg||
nt|lestergold: what an enormous swing likely|pg||
nt|nicksan: Considering South just showed out in trumps...that's an odd play!|pg||
nt|lestergold: er he may have forgotten|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think i forgot|pg||
nt|cuttysark: It was a red card....|pg||
nt|nicksan: He'll have the break to think about it, just to make it worse...|pg||
nt|lestergold: south signalled for a club with the 2 hearts somewhat absurdly unless they are playing reverse suit pref udca which would be insane in goulash|pg||
nt|lestergold: it seems thta defence is usually much harder onthes ehands so best policy is probably to buy most contracts|pg||
nt|nicksan: I'm going to make a brew. Anyone want some?|pg||
nt|lestergold: not that there was any difficulty here|pg||

nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: the last board of the first segment|pg||
nt|sybarra: well,  the partenship understand of the X |pg||
nt|sybarra: impressive |pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|sybarra: and another fascinating hand |pg||
nt|mug: the problem is that declarer is often also void|pg||
nt|sybarra: e/w may have to really scramble here to match the OR result |pg||
nt|roswolf: why did 6@S MAKE? looks like 2 losers|pg||
nt|mug: a good partner will probably try his 8-card suit in case you can ruff, anyway|pg||
mb|6H|nt|Walddk5: Declarer played clubs for no loser. Strong player|pg||
nt|mug: whoops, egg on face for someone|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mug: @CJ lead and @C10 continuation, not best|pg||

nt|vugraphzzb: we will continue in 10-15 minutes|pg||
