pc|d2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: exclamation points notwithstanding, if W did not bid 3N, she should change her name to Mortes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the double by N was ill-advised. 2S seems to stand out|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@S by NS is almost a good save - depends on @D ruff|pg||
nt|othered1: I prefer that (2@S) with a partner who will give me some room.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|h2|pc|dT|pc|d4|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|nt|petergill: with a fit and with shortage in opponent's suit, you should overbid in competitive situations - hence 2@S by North is better than Dbl. |pg||
mc|9|nt|marlowepi: why do you need room? after intervention 2S is not a GF, and double misrepresents your hand, and you have a fit|pg||
