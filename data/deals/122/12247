nt|vugraphzwu: player at south not in seat.....waiting|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A simple enough slam here - extra credit for playing it safely in clubs|pg||
nt|psridhar: hi all welcome to the 2nd segment of the QF|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello everyone and welcome back to Bengaluru (Bangalore)|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi everyone, |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Commentators are Raija Davis and Padmanaban Sridhar|pg||
nt|psridhar: going by the trend in 1st segment NS may well crack a grand on this|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Our operator is Ruzbeh Raja|pg||
nt|psridhar: i hv seen the bidding go 1s-4h( splinter)-4s( wasted h kqj of h pd ! )-all pass|pg||
nt|peachy: another slam in this board. not sure what is going on, |pg||
nt|peachy: but we will surely get going soon:)|pg||
nt|psridhar: EW are indian railways and NS are Mango's team|pg||
nt|peachy: can you tell me (and kibs maybe) what systems these pairs use|pg||
nt|psridhar: both pairs use natural methods |pg||
nt|psridhar: 5 card Maj, strong NT|pg||
nt|peachy: thank you|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: error with duplication of open room set|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: closed room will continue as normal|pg||
nt|psridhar: hi all -welcome to the final segment of the QF|pg||
nt|psridhar: the site for results http://indianbridgepages.appspot.com/ Winter_Nationals/2009/Results.el|pg||
nt|patricck: The Semi-Final is 36 boards in 3 segments of 12?|pg||
nt|psridhar: i am not very familiar about the NS pair- but CV RAO is a well known indian team having won several national titles|pg||
nt|Walddk6: A spectator suggests that this is the other semi-final|pg||
nt|Walddk6: CABAL vs Dhampur|pg||
nt|psridhar: something wrong -the EW pair plays for dhampur i am certain|pg||
nt|psridhar: hi all welcome to the 2nd segment of semifinals|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: Welcome back to all|pg||
nt|psridhar: hi all welcome to the 2nd edition of this needle match|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: Hi Good morning all|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2S|nt|drkvas: hi guys|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: N hand ideal for a short suit trial bid|pg||
nt|psridhar: kind of splinter game try|pg||
nt|drkvas: u think ok with 3 trumps ps?|pg||
nt|psridhar: N hand doc|pg||
nt|drkvas: ok r|pg||
nt|drkvas: but i think 2@s is misclick|pg||
nt|psridhar: yeah too strong for a simple raise|pg||
nt|patricck: welcome everyone|pg||
nt|patricck: Are NS playing inverted major raises?|pg||
nt|patricck: It appears the other table has been renamed, do we do the same here?|pg||
nt|patricck: Welcome Sunil|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: i have played against Ashok goel and kamal mukh all my life :)  they belong to dhampur|pg||
nt|Walddk6: This is more like it|pg||
nt|patricck: 4 sets of 16 boards, a 64 board Final|pg||
mb|3C|nt|patricck: that makes more sense :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|drkvas: 1INDIAN RAILWAYS - A  15212ARUN JAIN,   132|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Operator, please shut down and reconnect to the other room|pg||
nt|Walddk6: The other operator realised the error and has opened a new broadcast|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: this is the final of the Ruia trophy... the symbol of supremacy in Indian bridge|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: Hello Patrick|pg||
nt|psridhar: if he had overcalled 2c instead of 1nt Sumit might hv raised with ACE and 4 trumps-then 3nt easy|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Walddk6: Best to do it now|pg||
nt|psridhar: i think this match is Dhampur Vs cabal|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: The challenge is to stay out of the poor grand slam - even though it happens to make|pg||
nt|Walddk6: but ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: in the other match cabal leads dhampur by 10 IMP's|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: yes it is dhampur vs cabal|pg||
nt|Walddk6: The team names are now reversed :(|pg||
nt|panja: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Hi Panja|pg||
nt|psridhar: cabal is a team from Mumbai|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Rehi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk6: Welcome to Carl Mathiesen from Norway|pg||
nt|psridhar: hi Sunil|pg||
pc|cA|nt|panja: Good Morning Roland, hi all|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, Dhampur is the EW pair, they should be in mauve|pg||
nt|patricck: South will have no trouble finding the right lead if EW get overboard, but I don't anticipate that|pg||
pc|cK|nt|patricck: the defence will need to be careful here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Hi Sridhar|pg||
nt|psridhar: 7 card suit with 6 controls...i dont think 1Nt did justice to that holding|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|dA|nt|psridhar: touch and go.. d1 at most|pg||
nt|panja: it is good to see Sanjay Damle playing in semis...(South)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i dont think they will overreach as they lck the @H control|pg||
pc|d3|nt|psridhar: key point of partnership understdg here is - what is diff between direct 3s over 2s and 3s via 2nt-since 2s is 6 cards 99% of the time|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sharkey: Good afternoon|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|drkvas: yes now the ball is rolling nicely|pg||
nt|psridhar: 4H is pushy with the 'wasted' dia queen ...but i guess the stiff H makes up for it|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: error corrected|pg||
nt|patricck: 4@H would have been a splinter, enabled North to assess correctly to drive to slam|pg||
nt|psridhar: i hear other room also in 6s|pg||
pc|d8|nt|drkvas: u have sharp ears ps|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Hi Sridhar|pg||
nt|psridhar: i thk via 2nt shd suggest 3nt and 4s while direct 3s shd actively propel towards a spd contract|pg||
nt|psridhar: hi Sunil |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i think u thk right Sridhar :)|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d4|nt|psridhar: gud lead-makes life tough for declarer-other room led dia ACE|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bjacobs: No justice|pg||
nt|psridhar: i hv placed an agent there doc :)|pg||
nt|panja: he trained a lot of young people in 70's and 80's, under United Bridge Association|pg||
nt|psridhar: if declarer had played a LOW club W might hv ducked and entry to dummy to play dia|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|drkvas: 3 cabal 4SUNIL MACHHAR  5 cvrao 6 india blues 7 dsm 8sreecem 9 formidables 10 mango 11 goverdhan agg hyd|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h6|pg||
pc|sK|nt|panja: a few years ago, he was very unwell, but has now recovered...|pg||
nt|psridhar: in other words one can raise 2s to 3s even on a doubleton if he has a SUIT ORIENTED hand-say KX,XX,AXXX,KQXXX|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|nt|sharkey: Is this the last 12 boards of this match?|pg||
nt|patricck: rehi everyone, got distracted there, hope I haven't missed much|pg||

nt|panja: 4@S is on guess here....|pg||
nt|panja: on B4|pg||
nt|psridhar: only declarer had to take care not to hand any ruff to N|pg||
nt|sharkey: we'll never know...|pg||
nt|sharkey: Another slam|pg||
nt|patricck: 6@C is quite a good spot|pg||
nt|brolucius: Without a spade return, declarer had time to set up enough heart tricks for the contract.|pg||
nt|psridhar: there is really no reason for not returning pd's suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@S for e/w looks normal|pg||

nt|psridhar: Sunil did u notice the 7 control pack with Laltu? :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Raiways must have lost the lead because they got unlucky with the decent salm on bd 17|pg||
nt|psridhar: i am tempted to re-start my fav topic ...the trends in dealing m/c !|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: he shd have been plg rubber bridge :) or tried his hand at Bollywood|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: what trends do the dealing m/c throw up ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: 38 imps and 7 bds to go...|pg||
nt|drkvas: hi all|pg||
nt|psridhar: 6c is a decent prospect -odds on slam|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS has an excellent sac in @H|pg||
nt|psridhar: but getting there is the fun|pg||
nt|brolucius: No. He had three diamonds, three clubs (with two finesses) two hearts and the @SA.|pg||
nt|psridhar: what shd S bid over the 3rd seat 1D here? i vote for a take out X|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: it seems the 7 pack sold ot to the 7 carder :)|pg||
mb|1D|mb|d|nt|psridhar: hi drvas|pg||
nt|panja: on @D lead A and ruff and @HA and @D?|pg||
nt|patricck: yes par appears to be 500 to EW from 6@H doubled|pg||
nt|sharkey: EW playing Standard or strong @C?|pg||
nt|psridhar: std|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: pause in play.....players updating scorecard|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: in the other room|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes cruel indeed-to open 1C and watch oppo bid and make 2D |pg||
mb|1S|nt|patricck: can ruff with J@S|pg||
nt|patricck: oops, wrong hand|pg||
mb|2C|nt|patricck: :(|pg||
nt|panja: y, @SK stiff or !KT?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i wd bid 1@H|pg||
mb|2D|nt|panja: if E has @ST, decl must ruff with 9|pg||
nt|sharkey: I like 4@H with North's hand - jam the bidding|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: here west managed to get his @C suit in|pg||
mb|2S|nt|patricck: same mistake I made....North is short of diamonds, not South|pg||
nt|Walddk6: I like to double with the South cards and play ELC. 2@D overcall could well have lost spades|pg||
nt|panja: y|pg||
nt|psridhar: E has to read this 4d as natural and support clubs|pg||
mb|3D|nt|psridhar: Passing 1S on that N hand doesnt seem dafe to me|pg||
nt|psridhar: 1h will work when there is h fit ...but here it loses spds|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 6@S make too?|pg||
nt|psridhar: safe |pg||
nt|brolucius: Was that 'daft' or 'safe'?|pg||
nt|psridhar: sry|pg||
nt|psridhar: safe |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk6: ELC = Equal Level Conversion|pg||
nt|psridhar: even 2c may go down|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: Mango had their share of slam luck in first session when they landed a grand dropping doubleton Q of trumps in an 8 card fit|pg||
nt|psridhar: i was abt to say that Roland-2D on that moth eaten suit opp a passed hand is not my fav-the take out X is more flex and brings spd into pic|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, I like double rather than 2@D as well, but close decision, would not criticise 2@D|pg||
nt|panja: better still, why not overcall 1@S?|pg||
nt|psridhar: gud judgement at both tbls|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 2@S wud have gone down a packet|pg||
nt|psridhar: operator pl post results of bds 18 and 19|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk6: http://www.bridgeguys.com/EGlossary/EqualLevelConversion.html|pg||
nt|panja: with a structure to handle 4-card overcalls..of course|pg||
nt|sharkey: No - @D breaking bad and communications problem|pg||
nt|psridhar: i expect 6s will go down|pg||
nt|psridhar: h lead taps dummy|pg||
nt|panja: hi all|pg||
nt|panja: 6@C might have been better, I guess|pg||
nt|patricck: definitely|pg||
pc|c4|nt|patricck: 1@S is ok when you find a spde fit, but it makes some auctions very awkward later|pg||
nt|sharkey: I'm not sure I agree with 4@S - 5 points and 6 card suit.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|psridhar: 3H is probably Kushari's last game try|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i suppose Sridhar that you are treating the weak @H suit as a 4 carder and the @S suit as a 4 carder :)|pg||
nt|patricck: that is true, double is tempting, but nothing really wrong with 1@H either... because of the @H987 I go with the 1@H call but double very close 2nd choice|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sunsamvar: South will be sqeezed on the play of @D and this cud make|pg||
pc|c7|nt|psridhar: other room ahs saved in 5c --500?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: squeezed|pg||
nt|psridhar: when pd has a weak hand as here it doesnt matter...but if he has values to compete for part score the X will enable him in my opinion|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d2|pg||
nt|patricck: on this lead South might just continue spades anyway|pg||
pc|s9|nt|sharkey: With @D 3-3 and trumps 3-2 this wud make|pg||

nt|sharkey: W places pd with a GOOD 6 card suit here and jumps to 6@S - dont think W at fault here|pg||
nt|panja: y, more interesting question is, how can E show @CQ to 3, and @SK to 6?|pg||
nt|psridhar: If E had passed 4H as he should..how would the auction proceed? W to bal with 4NT?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Mind you, with declarer playing the @CQ from dummy (which was not at all a good idea), he might still have lost two club tricks.|pg||
nt|psridhar: the theory of leading long suits is based on defense gaining tempo 3 times so that u can set up your long suit; but when declarer threatens to run a long suit of his own defense ...|pg||
nt|psridhar: has to look for QUICK tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: this one is a lock :)|pg||
nt|panja: South is Sanjay Damle, N is Raju Gulavani, W is Kamal Mukherjee...|pg||
mb|1H|nt|patricck: any 5-1 @H break except singleton Ace would have beaten it|pg||
nt|psridhar: the stiff h is the ace so...|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: Nice distributional 4@S contract, makes even with a spade misguess|pg||
nt|roswolf: west needs to restrain himself|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: like here East shd lead a @S even if he had 1 less @S|pg||
mb|1S|nt|patricck: hard for EW to bid 6@C against this start|pg||
nt|psridhar: over 1h W found a fitshowing jump to 2s in other room-it was easy to reach 4s thereafter|pg||
nt|sharkey: not sure - if E passes W wud bid 5@D and E wud prefer to 6@C?|pg||
nt|psridhar: or 5d emphasising minor 2 suitor? 6-5|pg||
nt|patricck: avoiding 5@D is the thing here|pg||
nt|psridhar: so the railways lead was short lived|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: true ..a typical alok sadhu 1H has EW in totters..|pg||
mb|2C|nt|bjacobs: Looks like 6@H doesn't quite fetch|pg||
nt|panja: 9-card fit on both sides......9=19 tricks though, 1 extra|pg||
nt|rv: Hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: wait ..but his pd has taken him seriously giving EW another bite at the cherry|pg||
nt|brolucius: I was reading some 1955 US bridge magazines while on holiday. They would not have agreed with South's 'free bid' of 1@S on such limited values. Of course we know better nowadays.|pg||
nt|psridhar: 8 card suits are difficult to restrain :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: this time 6 controls...hmm... laltu is getting poorer by the deal :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: more 6 packs for Laltu Sridhar|pg||
mb|2D|nt|psridhar: a preemptive 3h instead of 2h might hv quietened E|pg||
nt|psridhar: a bid of 5D will commit to slam almost|pg||
nt|sharkey: Think I wud bid 5@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would have re-opened as south|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Unless you peek, of course|pg||
mb|2N|nt|psridhar: other room in 5H X|pg||
nt|patricck: it appears South likes his off shape 1NT hands|pg||
nt|sharkey: Think 4 NT wud show 4-6?|pg||
nt|psridhar: hi RV|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: trump lead is best|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The defence needs to be a little careful|pg||
nt|patricck: vg, 3NT is no trouble|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: how to best play the @D suit here ?|pg||
nt|patricck: best not to play @D|pg||
nt|patricck: needing 3 extra tricks, you need the clubs anyway|pg||
nt|psridhar: declarer will first test clubs and lose an entry to dummy in the process|pg||
mb|3H|nt|psridhar: it must be frustrating to be not able to bid that club suit :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|panja: fit-showing?|pg||
nt|patricck: support double showing 3 card @S....   if so then West really should have done more than just correct to 2@S|pg||
nt|panja: is S thinking of a dbl?|pg||
nt|patricck: surely not|pg||
nt|panja: I hope not...|pg||
nt|panja: any bid here will be bad for NS|pg||
nt|babugenu: l|pg||
nt|psridhar: 4nt enables a contract of 5C first of all|pg||
nt|psridhar: RV must be tired by now after all the organising work|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Dont like 1 NT here - 17 HCP and no rebid problems|pg||
nt|patricck: quite surprising that North had no red card for 4@D|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hi Venky|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: again a reasonable slam|pg||
mb|4C|nt|rv: Hi PS, Sunil and all specs, logging in from a very pleasant Bangalore (not at the venue)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: North may have a tricky problem on opening lead here|pg||
nt|sharkey: I wudnt Dbl with North's hand at IMPs|pg||
nt|psridhar: might escape for down 1|pg||
mb|4D|nt|panja: a first time 3@H by N might have solved this problem...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Must cash their side tricks now|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Well if North takes his own advice and leads a club, this will no doubt go down|pg||
nt|psridhar: and declarer has voluntarily forfeited the spd entry as well at trcik1|pg||
mb|4H|nt|bjacobs: Oh, not to worry - E/W have gone bananas.  And there is no miracle, like there was on board 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: Director intervening|pg||
nt|psridhar: one more 4-1 break in trumps rendering the h slam hopeless|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: A@D lead would be a disaster|pg||
nt|rv: is it really a good slam even with benign breaks, not very sure about that|pg||
nt|psridhar: Laltu gets all controls; EW slams go down on bad breaks..Kushari keeps getting diamonds...i dare say the dealing m/c is consistent :)|pg||
nt|rv: does Sumit's 4@c show not too much extras, some play 3n from his hand as non-serious slam try|pg||
mb|4S|nt|panja: y, this has some chances...|pg||
nt|psridhar: this NS auction sounds confused..and early in the match it will encourage opponents|pg||
nt|panja: even @CA now by E might be bad for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Presumably, N/S are concerned about a hesitation, but it's not going to matter to them in the end|pg||
nt|patricck: when partner opened 1NT and you are sitting over the dimaond bidder with Kxx?|pg||
nt|panja: not a good beginning at trick two, I guess @S would have been better|pg||
nt|Walddk2: done|pg||
nt|psridhar: 6C may make -but EW here are on to 6H|pg||
mb|5D|nt|patricck: too late|pg||
nt|brolucius: South defends well, taking N/S's heart trick before it vanishes on the @SK.|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes declarer will feel aggrieved|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: escapes for 1 down this time, but that is when partner had a signleton diamond|pg||
nt|psridhar: true|pg||
nt|sharkey: think you shud Dbl when you're reasonably sure of -2; here 1 down wud mean +50 points - making -380|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes 6@C has chances|pg||
nt|rv: in any GF auction, it is important for both sides of partnership to know if they have extras to cross 4M level with confidence|pg||
nt|psridhar: i hear 6c d3 in other room|pg||
mb|5H|nt|nezihk: saat kaç|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: -500 is surely some imps for Mango, maybe a lot if they can bid slam in the CR|pg||
nt|psridhar: only 300 Pat?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: wasn't a safety play in @C better ?|pg||
nt|psridhar: he needed 4 cl tricks sunil|pg||
nt|psridhar: 5 sry|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: he had to lead a trump to beat it 500|pg||
nt|psridhar: +100 to NS ..somehow i get the feeling it is not enuf|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: yes, that would have been bad too, would need K@D, Q@D overtaken with A@D and a ruff to beat it if east had played A@C|pg||
nt|rv: all slams are poor in my opinion and possibly Laltu should have passed 4@h if Sumit's 4@c showed only courtsey cue|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|panja: now @S ruffa....and trumps, and a Club off|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: oh that is right|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sunsamvar: however when both have primary major suits as majors it is tough to finalize a 4-4 minor fit|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: here for eg Sumit never showed his @C suit|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hJ|pc|h3|nt|bjacobs: Folks, I know the score is wrong - but the operator is not responding to me|pg||
nt|patricck: hmmm, I would be disappointed that they were only one down...that feels like doubling material|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|psridhar: safety play will give up a club and defense will clear spds-now u hv only 8 tricks?|pg||
nt|rv: can this contract be made?|pg||
nt|rv: looks like not anymore|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes 450|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: a little bird tells me that " 6c -3 in other room"|pg||
mc|10|nt|sunsamvar: so this game hung on the @C fin and break|pg||
nt|rv: he is unlikely to find double dummy play in @cs, this is destined to go 1 down and won't be a big loss for DSM|pg||

nt|psridhar: 6c in other room it is|pg||
nt|panja: Can you both take liberties in third seat and be aggressive on penalties...?|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: score updated|pg||
nt|sharkey: On the previous borad E didnt bid and NS ended in 5@H Dbl|pg||
nt|patricck: but when partner opens 1NT in 3rd seat should you be worried about him taking liberties?|pg||
nt|psridhar: now this south is all hearts ...i wonder if sumit will be tempted to open 1N|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the controls have moved to west|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: 4@S is a bit high.....it should end in partial in this room|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: It wasn't a terrible contract tho, needed a club honour onside, and perhaps a 3-2 trump break|pg||
mb|2C|nt|patricck: 14 imps then....some light at the end of the tunnel for Mango, but is there a train coming? :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes 4-4-41 hands dont play well -though they hv huge defense potential ...in general|pg||
nt|panja: there, the liberty was with distribution...|pg||
nt|psridhar: he is lucky his pd is abt to bid H |pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|an| |nt|psridhar: no Pat they hv saved 6D-result depends on lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: Would S bid 4@H if N Dbl 4@D?|pg||
nt|patricck: perhaps we should call 15-17 with anything even close to balanced the Indian No Trump?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but again the slam likely to fail|pg||
nt|rv: Kushari is in a belligerent mood against his students and partners:)|pg||
mb|5D|nt|bjacobs: West would like to give 2@D the treatment, but maybe double is not for penalties|pg||
mb|d|nt|patricck: indeed there was a liberty being taken, but should the possibility affect North's decision when it was a 1NT opener?|pg||
nt|panja: not perhaps, but if E held singleton, 4@D might make..|pg||
nt|roswolf: well the fit is found|pg||
nt|roswolf: surely north will desist from bidding on|pg||
nt|brolucius: Standard bidding is unsatisfactory here. South can force with 3@H when he is really strong but then North does not know whether his partner has 4 or 5 hearts. Some players use 2@C ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: as artificial facing the 1NT response.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk6: 2@D is probably a sound heart raise, although I don't think he has one. 2@H is enough|pg||
nt|Walddk6: 9 count  4333|pg||
nt|rv: I think Laltu's pass shows semi positive hand (GF)|pg||
nt|psridhar: rv - bhabesh sd know that |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: it pays to interfere over 2@C esp at this vul|pg||
nt|rv: this is an easy way to make a living for Rail:)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: laltu with his 6-5 has not got a bid in yet|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: but double digit swing yes|pg||
nt|patricck: agreed|pg||
nt|psridhar: over the X they play 2h as bad raise and 2d as normal raise...but i agree it can be construed as bad raise|pg||
nt|panja: five honour cards in 9 HCP....not all useful for a @H contract...but here, because @CA is with South, most cards will pull their full weight|pg||
nt|panja: @S singleton, that is|pg||
nt|rv: here Sumit's pass clearly shows preference to defend since EW are in forcing pass situation|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes but his pd has expressed an opinion|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: East certainly thinks it's not for penalties.  And I agree|pg||
nt|psridhar: 11 imp|pg||
nt|psridhar: so make that 30 imp to get in 5 bds|pg||
nt|psridhar: plus KQ doubleton falling|pg||
nt|psridhar: diamonds|pg||
nt|sharkey: No liberties taken at this board - yet...|pg||
nt|panja: 3Nt on finesse|pg||
nt|psridhar: wd laltu|pg||
nt|rv: well judged by Laltu|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|panja: y|pg||
nt|patricck: If east had a singleton spade then South would have AKxx, which would be difficult to ruff out completely|pg||
nt|panja: AKxx or AQxx..|pg||
nt|psridhar: 1H-4d-4h wd hv been easy-now 1nt opg may well propel them higher|pg||
nt|psridhar: but Sumit's sensible 2H will help|pg||
nt|patricck: Although I have no disagreement with this hand we have seen some very odd 1NT's in this competition|pg||
nt|psridhar: 1100|pg||
nt|mackulky: best done would go for 1100|pg||
nt|rv: most play double in a forcing pass situation as preference to defend, except for Meckwell and a few others who play reverse of meaning of double and pass in a forcing pass ...|pg||
nt|rv: situation|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|nt|Walddk6: I can understand Sanjay's 4@S. He is hoping for a double fit|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|Walddk6: But as they play Precision, he can get something like this|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, Kxxx of the opponents suit is a disappointment|pg||
nt|psridhar: but i guess their 1D does not promise dia Roland|pg||
nt|panja: the 1@D is amorphous, must not count it as showing @D length|pg||
nt|Walddk6: read above|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bjacobs: Amazing what chaos resulted from that little 2@D bid|pg||
nt|psridhar: this flat 3nt wont do the Magoes any good in their 30 imp pursuit|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|Walddk6: "hoping" not "counting"|pg||
nt|panja: instead of the 4@S jump, a 3@H bid would have been better....|pg||
nt|panja: y, Roland, noticed the hope word now...|pg||
nt|panja: N could well have @CK instead of @HK, or, perhaps, some other minor honours...that would be good for 4@S|pg||
nt|panja: but there often is more of totalitarian bridge, rather than egalitarian...as I like to put it|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|patricck: very true, still about 30 imps, but only 4 boards|pg||
nt|panja: or, in worst case, KQxx|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Why India Patrick... top players all over the world open 1 nt with unbalanced hands :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sunsamvar: what is the advantage of reversing it rv ?|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|pc|sA|pg||
pc|d9|nt|bjacobs: Of course the 2@D bid has worked both ways.  In fact what normally looks like a cold 4@H is somewhat less cold when North shows the diamonds|pg||
pc|c4|pc|d6|nt|psridhar: the sharp young Sumit will swing an overtrick imp or two here|pg||
nt|psridhar: Panja-are u suggesting you shd X 4d only when u see 4 tricks for sure?|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|sK|nt|psridhar: experts open 1N on unbal hands when they see a rebid problem if they open 1 of a suit Sunil- i thk Pat is referring to several 1nt opg yday when that was not the case|pg||
pc|s5|nt|psridhar: add an ace to that N hand and he wd be doubling 2D !!|pg||

nt|psridhar: bd 6 4s went down 1 operator?|pg||
nt|panja: agree on it, and play accordingly|pg||
nt|brolucius: Game was not cold, even facing South's giant hand, so you could not say that North's pass of 2@H was a mistake.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: what is the rebid for South on the previos hand ?|pg||
nt|rv: most of us play pass as neutral, they play double as neutral|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzwu: yes|pg||
nt|brolucius: But South may bid more strongly at the other table and that will close the gap.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzwu: score updated|pg||
nt|psridhar: passing 2 with 5 cards support i feel guilty Bro|pg||
nt|psridhar: 2  pref and one neutral = 3 messages to communicate and 2 bids p/x|pg||
mb|1C|nt|psridhar: bd 26 if W were to declare slam he may make it on the likely nonspd lead - let s see|pg||
nt|psridhar: we can expect further bidding from South on that starwberry field ..notwithstanding the 2nt o/c|pg||
nt|brolucius: Few adjectives would do justice to West's 2@C overcall.|pg||
nt|psridhar: prev hand 1nt opg is fine...but if he chose to open 1H he can easily rebid 2D over the forcing 1nt response|pg||
mb|3N|nt|panja: I would not open 1N with singleton @D..so I don't really know whether N was right to P or dbl|pg||
nt|sharkey: S didnt "upgrade" to 1 NT|pg||
nt|patricck: Yes, on this particular hand I would have opened 1NT too, but the question was asked did we think Sumit would open 1NT....  so far I have not seen anyone choose something other ...|pg||
nt|patricck: than 1NT when that call was even remotely possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: yes, what was the 2@H showing?|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: 2s is a H raise unbal|pg||
nt|roswolf: east will be amazed|pg||
nt|rv: incidetally Kushari, Sumit and Laltu are team-mates in DSM in most of the tournies, only Nationals is an exception|pg||
nt|psridhar: laltu back to his riches|pg||
mb|d|nt|psridhar: 2hmust be tartan|pg||
nt|roswolf: when dummy hits|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: 3h=stiff spd i guess|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1C must be forcing|pg||
nt|psridhar: no 1c is not f|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: at least EW never found their spade fit, that could have been ugly|pg||
nt|sharkey: Why does N bid then?|pg||
nt|psridhar: NS play natural mathods|pg||
nt|panja: amazing, this should have been doubled by E? for lead, of course|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: what was 2 nt ?|pg||
nt|psridhar: 4 card unabl raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: with @D to boot :)|pg||
nt|rv: @s lead only 1 to give declarer any toruble|pg||
nt|rv: trouble|pg||

pc|c5|nt|psridhar: Carl- these days, experts take liberty when NV vs VUl|pg||
nt|sharkey: E didnt bid either .....???|pg||
nt|rv: Kushari can discard 6 of rounded suit cards run of @d, so @s lead should beat it|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i think the dbl told his ptr not to lead @C|pg||
pc|cA|nt|psridhar: but decl will cope with that one|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: n thinking hard.....|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: North is choosing between the minors|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|psridhar: well thought out 3s by sumit-if his pd can cue 4c he is in slam -|pg||
nt|rv: Kushari needs to be careful here not to concede OTs|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: shd make 10 tricks now i think|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|panja: or, a 2@D bid|pg||
nt|psridhar: I think that X of 3nt shd say ' they are hping to make this on long dia( other m) and i am short there, do something intelligent" |pg||
pc|sA|nt|sunsamvar: why did he not play the @D4 asking clearly for a @C return ?|pg||

pc|dA|nt|brolucius: Now a heart or a diamond will establish a ninth trick.|pg||

pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: Well ....|pg||

pc|dQ|pg||
nt|psridhar: i frankly think sumit shd hv signed off over 4d-playing pd for 2 aces and a stiff is farfetched|pg||

nt|rv: this one is a really good slam for EW|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Are u suggesting that the dealing m/c favours certain positions like a compass Sridhar ?|pg||
nt|psridhar: no -i see trends( perhaps program logic) everytime; and in a short match, a shrewd player can exploit|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but may be tough to get there RV|pg||
nt|rv: yes 5@c is a reasonable/par contract, 6@c is asking for too much in bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: back after the break|pg||

mb|1C|nt|sharkey: 1 NT I assume |pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: Unusual over Unusual. 3@D forcing with spade support|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Looks like 3@D showed some sort of spade hand - "unusual over unusual"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@C would have shown hearts|pg||
nt|psridhar: 3nt vs 4s on bal hands is a perennial issue-here 3nt scores|pg||
nt|patricck: 3NT might have some chances here, but difficult to bid after the 4 card @H ovecall|pg||
nt|tcpant: Yes the Dealing Program is favouring East or as Sridhar informs ... It is the Program Trend which can be exploited in short game|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: At the other table North went four down vulnerable in 3NT (after a very strange auction) on the deal where we saw West goings one down in 3@D on his eight-card suit.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Walddk2: This way you can bid non-forcing 3@H and 3@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: 3C= nf in H as opposed to direct 3h which wd be F perhaps|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's anyone's guess why West passed that hand in 1st seat|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It looks like West is wondering about that as well ...|pg||
nt|psridhar: 5nt possibly is pick a slam including 6nt|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sharkey: Mr Chotan certainly not scared|pg||
nt|rv: it looks like Rail not fielding Subir and DSM not fielding Souren/Uttam in too many rounds|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: this shd go down|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: wow.. grat bid by Sumit|pg||
mb|3C|nt|panja: absolutely...|pg||
nt|patricck: 2@S has worked quite well here, but that doesn't mean I agree with it|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: great|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Wlc Pant ji|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: any reason to pull the first tump from a particular side here?|pg||
nt|sharkey: When I try 2@S on such cards it usually means +800|pg||
nt|sharkey: to opps...|pg||
mb|3D|nt|psridhar: but the Laltu conversion will lead to a flat bd|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: West might have rebid 3@D instead on the basis that diamonds would still play well if partner had club support.|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@H non forcing - very strange|pg||
nt|psridhar: Sumit is a Superb card player but even he will find it impossible here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: superb and very fast|pg||
nt|tcpant: Hi Sunil|pg||
nt|psridhar: whats that 3D ? DAB? i prefer 3H |pg||
nt|rv: Rail originally started the tourney with 2 trios (Rana, Manas and Subir) and (Sumit, Laltu and Amarnath), but they have subsequently changed|pg||
nt|tcpant: But 1st Set Rana played with Subir|pg||
nt|rv: DSM originally started the event with 3 fixed partnerships, Ashok-Kamal, Bhabesh-Uttam and Kushari-Souren|pg||
nt|psridhar: cant be 4th suit- 3d over 2h is 4th suit not now|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|panja: I would need a bulletproof jacket before I even think of 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: Carl- all the bds this segment - the bidding has one underlying assumption " they wont X for cash" - the point that Pat was making|pg||
nt|brolucius: Can it be forcing when East passed originally?|pg||
nt|rv: I presume Laltu's 3@c showed min reverse|pg||
pc|d9|nt|sharkey: Certainly got EW off to the best lead|pg||
nt|psridhar: if east has spds yes|pg||
nt|brolucius: It was a poor bid because West would have doubled if he had three hearts in addition to both minors.|pg||
nt|psridhar: see the danger of 3D... a bid of 3H wd hv definitely led to 5C - at least it helps E to assess 3nt vs 5c|pg||

pc|c7|nt|Walddk2: A defensive countermeasure against unusual No Trump overcalls. For example: after a 2 No Trump overcall of 1 Spade, one popular method is the bid of 3 Clubs to show Heart length ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and a strong hand; a bid of 3 Diamonds shows Spade support and a strong hand; a bid of 3 Hearts shows Heart length and a moderate hand; a bid of 3 Spades shows Spade support and a ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: moderate hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: well if he had a real suit with no hcp he would have given preference - would he not |pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgeguys.com/UGlossary/GlossU.html|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: if he did figure out the 4-4 fit, then he shd have respected his partners chioce of 3 nt |pg||
nt|psridhar: Kushari will discard his dia Jack on 2nd/3rd club to make life easy for his pd- dia 9 shd be 0 or 2 higher|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|rv: should Laltu have hedged with 3@h or jumped to 5@c instead of 3n|pg||
nt|tcpant: Yes now only 7|pg||
nt|psridhar: else his pd will try to enter his hand vis spd for a dia 'thru'...and...|pg||
nt|psridhar: but having seen 7-4 now it shd be easy for S|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|s3|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|nt|panja: we have lost the play, it seems|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h6|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is hardly the optimum contract|pg||
nt|brolucius: West had not shown the earth by keeping the bidding open, so East should not have carried it so high - particularly as he should have known that there could not be a heart fit.|pg||
nt|roswolf: only -2|pg||
nt|rv: agree with PS that 3@d was possibly not a great choice by Sumit, Laltu's choice of 3n also looks suspect|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: good def|pg||
nt|tcpant: That will be 11 IMPs to DSM on the board|pg||

nt|panja: 19 from Mumbai, 20 if you count Dudhane as Mumbai|pg||
nt|psridhar: Dudh is ofcourse mumbaiker|pg||
nt|panja: dudh is sushegad|pg||
nt|panja: B21, 4@S or 3Nt for EW on @H finesse and @S break|pg||
nt|brolucius: East's hand is not a classic weak-two because he only one point in his long suit.|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: break in play|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@C would be a nice spot|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: players will be back shortly|pg||
nt|psridhar: CVR has narrowed the gap..only 13 to recover in 4 bds|pg||
nt|psridhar: but bd no 32 wont help|pg||
nt|brolucius: The did reach 4@H on the hand where South was strong and North held 5 points with @HQ-J-x-x-x. Their bidding was 1@S - 2@S - 3@H - 4@H.|pg||
nt|brolucius: An excellent auction. Well bid,|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: water break for n|pg||
nt|psridhar: so it was not a decision-Sumit merely said he has spds and gf values-it is Laltu who has to decide !|pg||
nt|tcpant: Operator can you please arrange for updating the scores of both rooms|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: will attempt tp do so asap|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: 3@H seems beatable|pg||
nt|psridhar: thx Roland; we tried to extend the principle ( lower vs lower) vs any 2 suitor o/c; ran into complications -for eg u open 1nt lho overcalls 2c -landy now?|pg||
nt|psridhar: if u must open 2nt on a 19 counter make sure u hv a decent 5 card suit !|pg||
nt|psridhar: but the bidding may well die at 1s Panja|pg||
nt|rv: South may open 1n in 4th seat and NS may climb to 3n here|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|patricck: good slam in either @S or @D here|pg||
nt|patricck: I wouldn't think EW would venture to game here, despite the excellent @S suit|pg||
nt|sharkey: @C lead will set 4@S|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|psridhar: 15 imps and 4 bds exciting match|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: no 1 nt opening here Patrick :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: it certainly works well over unusual 2nt showing minors |pg||
nt|roswolf: 15 imps in 4 bds is not insurmountable|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: You could play 2@H as showing the minors, with clubs equal or greater than diamonds; 2@S shows longer diamonds (after the Landy bid)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H heart stop, no spade stop. 2@S spade stop, no heart stop. NT stops in both majors. That's one way of playing it|pg||
nt|rv: 3n would have been interesting contract, it might make on @s lead by West|pg||
pc|s7|nt|psridhar: i hear that slam on bd 27 made because when a dia was played off the tbl S played 2 cards -the ACE and 9 of dia- the 9 was visible so diro ruled it in|pg||
nt|psridhar: i thk NS hv enough grounds to contest that decision on appeal|pg||
nt|psridhar: anybody's match from here|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i favour railways because of their lead|pg||
nt|rv: what would the panel open with South hand, I might fancy 1n|pg||
nt|tcpant: Railways bid & made 3NT in closed room so 6 IMPs may go|pg||
pc|sT|nt|patricck: they won't need to|pg||
nt|psridhar: 1. Dia ace was the setting trcik|pg||
nt|panja: @D better..with the 54 fit....easier to remove trumps and take your discards...|pg||
nt|patricck: indeed, I was looking at that, but perhaps the strong intermediate cards and 5 card @D make it too good for 1NT :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: 2nt is certainly ambitious pushing for a NV game|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|psridhar: coming to Bd 19 and N's controvertial 1D response...other room got to 3nt EW-let us see if it is a success|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w on the way|pg||
nt|psridhar: w is worth a 3d here|pg||
nt|brolucius: West should not go too high now. His partner is a passed hand.|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is the same position as the CR.  They took their spade ruff, but failed to cash the diamond tricks|pg||
nt|panja: but 2 IMP difference for a @S contract|pg||
nt|psridhar: he will survive if he gets dia rt|pg||
pc|h5|nt|roswolf: at the score a strange decision by west|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes |pg||
nt|brolucius: A minor-suit game, on a 4-4 fit, needs good values. I think West's pass was correct.|pg||
nt|psridhar: it just may be the winning decn|pg||
nt|brolucius: East might have had more of his values in spades, where they would not have been productive.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|psridhar: 4s fast arrival showing poor hand but cant stop N from slam|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Yes RV but it must be right sided... best if South opened a NT|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||
nt|patricck: and indeed Sumit agrees with me on the valuation, hence the 2NT rebid|pg||
nt|psridhar: 1nt is attractive RV no doubt...but how about N bid over 1d? being a passed hand wont 2c be a picture bid? enables rt siding nt if it is rt|pg||
nt|tcpant: Yes that will mean 7|pg||
pc|cT|nt|bjacobs: They didn't get to first base in this room!|pg||
nt|psridhar: doesnt 4s make?|pg||
nt|psridhar: how do u defeat 4s?|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|nt|sharkey: Think W shud Dbl 2nd time and correct 2@H to 2@S |pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|panja: Aces ask that does not tell much here|pg||
nt|panja: once N opens, the ! for finesse goes down...but is W right to bid so conservatively? is there an option? say a dbl of 1@D?|pg||
nt|brolucius: A trump back is best now, because West has a bundle of cards to ruff in the East hand. Yes, he has found the trump return.|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: play out of turn.....will update scores on claiming|pg||
nt|rv: excellent start to defense by Sumit-Laltu, ducking @c not so great by Laltu|pg||
mc|8|nt|psridhar: defense has essentially done the same mistake here too|pg||
nt|psridhar: the diro should keep in mind that the expert defender is on play with setting trick vs a slam -bd 27|pg||

nt|bjacobs: This is one of those horrible hands where West thinks he has 9 tricks for 3NT, but ...|pg||
nt|psridhar: Bill thats a cruel thought :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: 2d=nat with 5-7 i guess|pg||
nt|psridhar: i wd suggest u play 2S as strong/intermediate Jump overcall-both oppo hv bid and no purpose in WJO|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok 2 imps only|pg||
nt|psridhar: 3 to go and 13 imp to recover|pg||
nt|psridhar: exciting|pg||
nt|roswolf: could be some fun here|pg||
nt|rv: only risk with 2@c from North hand is when has opened a light 1@d in 3rd seat especially with majors|pg||
nt|rv: I won't fault Kushari for his 1n response|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: looks like we hv lost link with other room|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|bjacobs: I bet it happens|pg||
nt|psridhar: i will be keen to know how they bid bd no 9|pg||
nt|panja: good idea, but still, some weak hands where you cannot afford a 2-level bid..|pg||
nt|sharkey: I like 2@S as weak NV - trying to jam their bidding.  |pg||
nt|psridhar: what the doc ordered for the trailing team|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: east passing would produce later fireworks|pg||
mb|1N|nt|psridhar: Laltu may but in 3d and ..regret|pg||
nt|panja: B10...@H guess would be the interesting point....for an OT only though|pg||
nt|panja: will have to be handled with 1@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: the @S suit will win the bidding battle|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2H|nt|bjacobs: It's up to East now ... he has a diamond stopper, but he's the one looking at the club void|pg||
nt|panja: nine easy tricks here on favourable @SKQ position|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: It's still very tough to expect him to pass this|pg||
nt|psridhar: i hear Dhampur didnt bid the slam on bd 9-- means we have a new leader in the match|pg||
nt|psridhar: for the 2nd time this match the Rlwys lead is short lived|pg||
nt|patricck: Ashok's 3@D was successful in the Closed Room, but do we agree with it?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and gain imps here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i would not bid 3@D pAT|pg||
nt|psridhar: 4-3-3-3 and weak suit--only thing going for that 3d is it made|pg||
nt|patricck: just imagine how ugly 3@D would have been if North was the other way around in the minors|pg||
nt|tcpant: It was more easy in the CR as South opened 1NT and pd raised to 3|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: WUD you pass the North hand in the first instance ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: well done|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think that's a fantastic pass|pg||
nt|panja: but can make 10th in @H, play AK and back|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt a crude instrument|pg||
nt|brolucius: @DQ lead and South will know he has to try hearts when he wins at Trick 1.|pg||
nt|psridhar: tricky defense though top tricks|pg||
nt|psridhar: dia queen led and ducked will do for CVRAO|pg||
nt|roswolf: ace of hearts my choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: they stop in 3@H......primarily because the secondary @D fit was not unearthed|pg||
nt|brolucius: @H10 my choice.|pg||
nt|psridhar: gud lead wd|pg||
nt|roswolf: the  10 is murky|pg||
nt|brolucius: West might have @HQ-x-x.|pg||
nt|rv: at this vul, I may not bid 3@h on 1@s as well|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bjacobs: Now it's up to Aloke to make it|pg||
nt|patricck: There needs to be a big swing to Mango on this board to make an appeal relevant.... I just can't see that happening|pg||
nt|patricck: I guess we were just assuming they would bid game|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: it seems to have worked out well|pg||
nt|rv: would go along with Kushari's view|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: w shouts for director|pg||
nt|rv: in my opinion, well judged|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: as he can make 8 tricks|pg||
nt|tcpant: Well 2@H will make and fetch DSM 5 IMPs as CR 3@H went 1 down|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|psridhar: combined with not Doubling 2D...he has done well|pg||
nt|psridhar: now surely d1 |pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||
pc|c8|nt|psridhar: once again picturising how the Std auction wd go on this bd in other room....will it go 1nt -all pass?|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|nt|psridhar: defending 2D X with a club void is a nightmare|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes i agree -Railways have sewed this one up|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: very fast play...missed tricks.....will update score|pg||
nt|panja: 2/1 or sayc?|pg||
nt|psridhar: now i guess Railways are into Finals|pg||
nt|psridhar: that jack of cl tells laltu his pd ' s club 8 is not stiff|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|psridhar: thx all gl to railways in semifinal-c u all at 1500 hrs IST|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: scores updated|pg||
nt|patricck: and you would expect to make 9 tricks with a combined 29 count, the surprise may be that there are only 9|pg||
nt|rv: actually well judged auction by everyone all round the table|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|panja: you get 2@D rebid in 2/1, and that might propel N to a stronger invite..|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||
nt|panja: but of course, it could also be just 1@H 2@H|pg||
pc|d9|nt|psridhar: Bill -pl note the auction was identical in other room-- kudos to indian bridge judgement? ;)|pg||
nt|patricck: can make a 10th in @H yes, but will probably play on @D|pg||
nt|psridhar: so far the signals in this match are just abt rt for a close finish|pg||
pc|dT|nt|bjacobs: Indeed|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Pity about the two grand slams in this set, but this board produced excellent bridge|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks all, back in 15 mins or so with segment 2|pg||

nt|bjacobs: cheers|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: round 2 coming up shortly|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes i prefer 1h to be raised to 2h on that N hand|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sunsamvar: These 2 teams have come thrugh a gruelling 5 days of league and knock out matches to get to the finals|pg||
pc|c6|nt|panja: best way to play is, @HKA at T23, and if two honours don't drop, finesse @D|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||
pc|h5|nt|panja: note that S could have opened this 1@C, 16 HCP...|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|nt|sharkey: If N had @D 10 wud be down??|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|psridhar: 1c=16+ or 17+|pg||

nt|vugraphzwu: gr8|pg||
nt|panja: the problem...is..their 1@H rebid is artificial..as in last hand|pg||
nt|panja: therefore, with 16 and @H suit, they would often prefer to open 1@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: that settles it with game making n the other room|pg||
nt|tcpant: So 6 IMPs to DSM|pg||
nt|rv: Kushari should have cashed @hA possibly|pg||
nt|psridhar: rv- if kushari had passed a 2nd time...EW wd hv landed in 2S ? or E wd hv ventured 3c?|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: scores updated|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: for this room|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|brolucius: @DQ led to the ace at the other table and South (who had apparently not noticed dummy's clubs) returned a diamond!|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: i have sent a person to check other room score updates|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: last hand, I mean, B9, where they bid a @S slam|pg||
nt|rv: 2@S looks like Tartan, @s+lower suit, 6-10|pg||
mb|3S|nt|psridhar: i do not have scores of other semifinal sorry|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: multiple conn. failure to server|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Declarer was marked with the @DK by the @DQ lead and the game was cold if he also held the @HA, so South had a 100% switch to hearts.|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: server response crawling....recovered now|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: will 4@S make here on @D lead? B23|pg||
nt|psridhar: Railways have the discipline and card play skills with their past victorious experience ; Dhampur hve the flair and winning aggression|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: club 8 likely lead ...down1|pg||
nt|psridhar: or a trump|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: i wd lead a@Dq|pg||
pc|s4|nt|brolucius: Perhaps South's wife had told him that she expected him to be back by Sunday morning at the latest.|pg||
nt|rv: Kushari presumed Sumit's minor is @c|pg||
pc|s7|nt|patricck: must be something wrong here.... I agree with every single bid made in this auction :)|pg||
nt|panja: aceless NS hands, they have already bid enough...|pg||
nt|psridhar: CVR has tried a naughty take out X and will pay for it|pg||
pc|sK|nt|psridhar: now coming to rolands ELC, this east hand has similar shape except it is clubs and not dia -so cant apply that ELC take out X|pg||
nt|patricck: correct|pg||
nt|panja: true...so the idea does not have that essential symmetry|pg||
nt|panja: will have to finesse @H and discard two Clubs|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@C 1@S and @D ruff?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: club more likely to be declarer's 2nd suit|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|nt|tcpant: Kibitzers the VUG operator is trying to update the other room scores as well ... pl. hold for a min'|pg||
nt|rv: still as PS suggested trump lead might have been better|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sharkey: Or @HAK and @S finesse?|pg||

pc|d9|nt|psridhar: and let us Panja's suggestion of 1S overcall here -will u find 3c after that Panaj? |pg||
nt|psridhar: Sumit wd hv made it easy for defense shifting to H at trick3..now defense has to be careful getting 2 h trickd|pg||

mb|p|mb|3H|nt|panja: so..don't correct from a minor suit|pg||
nt|patricck: but then if partner overcalls 4 carders that regularly that I am altering my bidding then maybe the 1@S is alertable so that the opponents are given full information as well|pg||

mb|p|nt|psridhar: wd laltu|pg||
nt|rv: well judged by Laltu, 5 level was not very safe on combined hands of EW|pg||

nt|vugraphzwu: i guess the website will be updated shortly|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: thanks for the compliments.....still learning|pg||
nt|brolucius: Dhampur Sugar is the other finalist.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|panja: E hand is dead now|pg||
nt|psridhar: E prepared to miss game then?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer has been gifted the trump position. He had no real reason to get it right on a passive return.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s8|pc|c4|pg||
nt|psridhar: wow 8 tricks around EW's nacks !|pg||
nt|psridhar: necks|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: play out of turn|pg||
nt|psridhar: oh dear|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: will claim at the end|pg||
nt|psridhar: semifinals is 2 segments of 16 bds each|pg||
nt|rv: lot of bragging rights attached in addition to the small matter of most prestigious national title|pg||
nt|psridhar: kushari might hv considered ducking the club|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzwx: No 3 of 12 boards|pg||
nt|panja: is that all?|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: yes|pg||
nt|psridhar: ok i stand corrected 3X12|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: next session coming shortly|pg||
nt|psridhar: 36+30=66 bds today ---only 5x10=50 yday..seems kind of unablanced|pg||
nt|panja: if he had !ATxx, he would possibly have....|pg||
mc|11|nt|rv: Kushari has partnered Manas and Sumit in his Rail days and plays with Laltu in DSM nowadays|pg||
pg||

nt|rv: Sumit's regular pd is Bhabesh for DSM|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|patricck: well at least we dind't miss anything, board 12 seemed an almost certain flat board|pg||
nt|psridhar: wont laltu get tired of holding those aces and kings? :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|psridhar: Two 9 card fits ...but neither side belongs at 3 level -strange violation of Law !|pg||
nt|panja: vs 3Nt, @H lead, or @CJ anyone?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|patricck: In fact the total tricks is only 15, despite that good shape I think that NS only make 1@D|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes and the Railways Discipline that i mentioned earlier wins them the part score swing|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|patricck: a useful 7 imps at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|rv: he should have had side-bets with Kushari on total points:)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|tcpant: Clearly The Dealing Machine was favouring East in this set (Laltu & Ashok must be happy players)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|rv: what would be the panel's choice of lead?|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|drkvas: @cj|pg||
nt|rv: anyone for @cj ?|pg||
nt|psridhar: in the face of pd's pass of 3c, the cJ looks like a MP lead|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rv: this lead gives Laltu a fighting chance|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|h4|nt|psridhar: and a 3rd Rwy lead this match|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hT|pc|d6|pg||
nt|rv: actually more than a fighting chance, he should make it now|pg||
nt|tcpant: In CR, contract 2NT by East making 3|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bigtrain: the law always needs adjusted for minor honor subtractions (cards that a side holds that don't contribute to the offense) - on this hand there are ALOT|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rv: Sumit clearly has 1 or both majors, but Bhabesh has all the values and entries, so tough choice I would guess|pg||
pc|d4|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|cA|pg||
pc|dT|nt|panja: @Cj isn't an attractive lead on the bidding, however, @H is contra-indicated too...|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pc|s7|pg||
nt|bigtrain: for onstance N/S hold the KQJ in spades -- they don't contribute to there total tricks while subtracting from the opponents tricks|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|rv: passive lead can be considered if he is sure opps are bidding on thin values|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|s5|pc|c8|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|pc|s6|pc|s9|pg||

nt|bigtrain: i have to disagree with that statement strenuously  :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: very valuable tool -- assuming it's applied correctly|pg||
nt|drkvas: i fell@cj best as u have most values n tenaces pt cant have much so let dec do his work|pg||
nt|panja: partner could hv @HJTx....for @H to work...not unreasonable expectation|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: now the lead down to 5 imps|pg||
mb|1H|nt|rv: pass for me with Laltu's hand|pg||
nt|psridhar: right Panja, when u hv no clear lead u hv to hope for spots with pd on the suit u lead|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2H|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: why did North not balance with 1@D ?|pg||
nt|psridhar: Did Laltu really pass out 1c? |pg||
nt|tcpant: Scores 69-58 in favour of Ind Rly|pg||
nt|drkvas: yes u have a point panja but no lead is clear cut may be@cj n @h 40 60|pg||
nt|panja: very good 3N here|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: but..it can be defeated|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hA|nt|rv: if Sumit had Xed, Bhabesh might have run out to 4@d:)|pg||
nt|panja: declarer needs entry to Dummy to cash @D..so has to play a small @C off..upon which EW can cash 3 Spades|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|psridhar: they can beat 1C ...but it is tempting to balance on that red suit holding|pg||
nt|patricck: i vote for 1@D|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d5|nt|rv: I expect Sumit and Laltu to find the defense to beat this|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: isn't duck of @D clear ?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|tcpant: CR EW played 3@H down 1|pg||
pc|c2|pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d2|nt|psridhar: i defend 1C only when i feel the hand warrants me to declare in clubs !|pg||
pc|dA|nt|psridhar: not much work for defense-just keep playing h it will go down auto|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s5|pg||

nt|tcpant: 73-58 in favour of Rly after 30 bds|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|vugraphzwu: conn. was lost but recovered at same point|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but tough to reach|pg||
nt|rv: NS should make 8 tricks in 2@h even if declarer misguesses @h by taking double finesse |pg||
mb|2H|nt|psridhar: talking of Rwys discipline that crowed abt earlier...Rana's 1s overcall is not what i had in mind...and deservedly it wasnt a success!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|tcpant: So both rooms playing in 2@H|pg||
nt|rv: 2@c is start of non forcing checkback for Inv hands|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rv: 2@c puppets to 2@d, Kushari's 2@h showed 6+@h Inv hand|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cQ|nt|rv: direct 2@h would have been non forcing and 2@d would be GF checkback playing this structure|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Rana is not known for his disciplined bidding :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: rv- i thk kushari has a hand to 'invite' to 2H not higher :)|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|rv: LOL:)|pg||
pc|hK|pg||

nt|psridhar: Rana is a shrewd operator who knows oppo dont use the RED card freq at imps|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but makes up for it in his handplay|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d3|pc|d5|pg||

nt|panja: consider the lead....W showed up with @CKQ...|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|nt|panja: note the 2@D rebid|pg||
nt|panja: 1@H could have been much weaker...so N cannot rebid 2@H..that would show a weak hand|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sunsamvar: and to our flawless operator Raja and ofcourse to BBO and Roland for coordinating this|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|patricck: This looks set to be a cracking match.. this was just the 1st 16 of a 64 board contest that could be close all the way|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sunsamvar: now @C guess avoided|pg||
nt|panja: 11 tricks now...|pg||
nt|rv: I think Bhabesh took a risk by bidding only 3@h, maybe 2@s better|pg||
nt|panja: not only guess avoided..a @S goes on a @C...|pg||

pc|c2|nt|psridhar: yes Pat -i expect the session to end on 30-25|pg||
