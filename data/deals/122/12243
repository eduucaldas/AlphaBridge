mb|p|mb|p|nt|me argent: 2@Ss might be effective in keeping EW out of slam|pg||
nt|dburn: wow - that is a heavy pre-empt|pg||
nt|kit: this one looks really flat|pg||
nt|kareno: Wow!!  That's quite a 2@s bid|pg||
mb|2N|an|22 - 23|mb|p|nt|josj: another 6@D this time for NS|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mdgraham: Good hand for Stayman/Smolen - well, it was until North bid 2@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: east worth a double here?|pg||
nt|dburn: well, what can he do?|pg||
nt|kit: I can't believe West didn't compete to 4@S|pg||
nt|dburn: true - whichever minor partner had, you'd have some cards for him|pg||
nt|me argent: it does say something about their 2 bids|pg||
nt|dburn: on the other hand, if partner was clowning around with a couple of jack-fifths, you'd go down about 800|pg||
nt|me argent: and why it was WRONG for east 2 open 2@Ss|pg||
nt|josj: I think X shows the blackies v. Strong Club|pg||
nt|xenya: on 13, the ladies in the other bid to the correct 5@C contract and NS took a save in 5@H -- -500 and 12 imps to Djarum ladies |pg||
mb|4H|nt|kit: extra spade -- but didn't matter here.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: re|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: a hand which shows, once again, that nine-card suits are meant to be trumps|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|frankaus: the SP cost the contract - loose lips !!!!!!! - N showed @S A @C KJ  did not overcall so E "knew" N does not have @D K|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|pc|s7|nt|xenya: i wonder what 2@D shows|pg||
nt|mdgraham: what on earth....?|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: re hi @H@H|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South thinks 2@D is major, methinks. A bad time to have a system forget|pg||
nt|xenya: but whatever it might be, obviously NS were not on the same wavelength|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kit: still looks clear to accept the "transfer" -- somebody bids 4@H, so you bid 4@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: director called after E's double, didn't hear the conversation.|pg||
nt|dburn: well, everyone has a good hand for their bid|pg||
nt|ritong: arare case of early claim|pg||
nt|kit: I would have opened 3@S as they did in other room, but matter of style I guess.|pg||
nt|ritong: absolutely nothing could happen|pg||
nt|josj: unlucky lead but only for an overtrick|pg||
pc|s2|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||

mb|p|mb|4D!|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|sybarra2: need ace and a @H lead, from S  and I dont think that is easy |pg||
nt|jaapfr: pass|pg||

nt|jaapfr: if @HA i give you 1 coke harry|pg||
nt|jaapfr: my bet: thinks long and passes\|pg||
nt|alunand7: with AJxx ...it is not easy find A@H lead..but i bet for it :)|pg||
nt|sybarra2: think I would ask where the mirros are with ace of @H  lead|pg||
mb|4N!|nt|vugraphzbp: Harry if not A@H u have to give coke for me, jaapfr n shirley :)|pg||

nt|alunand7: what a lead with KJxxx ??|pg||
nt|alunand7: it is not usual for me:) Expert think Different :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzbp: i think it's reasonable coz sacul x 2@C|pg||
nt|jaapfr: some specs tell me that after @C bidding Qxx is good to go higher (you all are rite but imo was not really enough to bid 4nt)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c5|pc|c6|pg||
nt|alunand7: x = A@C...why not lead small ? :)|pg||
nt|sybarra2: not sure that matters |pg||
nt|jaapfr: because if he makes the trick he knows where @HA is:):):)|pg||
nt|alunand7: yes right :) but high percentage sacul have A@C|pg||
nt|sybarra2: so maybe not wanting to show @h situation?  |pg||

nt|jaapfr: ok 10 then|pg||
nt|alunand7: hi japp :)@H|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi harry re|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kit: simply too weak for 1@S, and pass isn't part of my vocabulary with a 7-card spade suit.|pg||
nt|mrace: well...most people treat a side A as if it is a crime to open weak 2, most of the top players opens it almost always  as far as i see in BBO vugraphs|pg||
nt|kareno: Not a decent one like that.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Zia has a kibbitzer who operates the BridgeMate for him.|pg||
nt|lml: hi :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: some might open with the S hand|pg||
mb|2C|nt|josj: precision style, I assume|pg||
nt|alunand7: maybe 3NT or 5@D by N-S |pg||
nt|jaapfr: also here 6@D too thin and likely to fall so better 3nt again|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: but if you don't, it's a nice feeling when LHO opens in your longest suit |pg||
mb|4S|nt|gowdy: x = blackwood|pg||
nt|xenya: no huddle this time? :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: I should have used the substitute bd 16 as my "hospitality" break.  TMI?|pg||
nt|kit: 4NT call very risky here -- only at these colors, and only at BAM or matchpoints might it be right|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, we all know the feeling|pg||
nt|alunand7: good shot japp :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: lasut did better:)|pg||
nt|alunand7: lasut heared your said|pg||
nt|jaapfr: played against them 30 years ago in Jakarta:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: sorry, Website can't update now :) because no data  from scoring room|pg||
nt|alunand7: oww...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|josj: N has an unpleasant lead|pg||
nt|frankaus: this wont trouble the declarer|pg||
pc|dT|nt|xenya: however, had S opened, they might have reached a decent 2@S contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: they are very busy|pg||
nt|alunand7: good feeling = good result happened at this table |pg||
nt|lml: this should be no trouble for declarer|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dK|pg||
nt|kit: big swing on auction -- in other room, 1NT opening, and 2@C stayman bid was doubled -- good double!|pg||
nt|josj: he does not know a @D is best and now declarer's job is easy|pg||
nt|josj: for +1|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kit: Fate of 5@D doubled depends on how declarer handles the heart suit maybe|pg||
nt|kareno: It's nice to have good servants :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: there are a number of kibbitzers in the room.  Zia has 3 men following him, 2 women behind Hamman|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: And plenty following Meckwell|pg||
nt|kit: Nothing here -- with diamonds splitting, 12 tricks and a swing on the double of 2@C.  Many would be afraid to make it.  I think it is clear.|pg||
nt|kareno: You really can't stand any other lead.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: mungkin lebih baik kalau kami berbicara BI sebab banyak kibs mengerti itu lebih baik:)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mrace: true|pg||
pc|s3|nt|dburn: well, the defence got there first, but...|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|alunand7: are u sure japp ? :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: kurang tahu:)|pg||
nt|alunand7: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: I agree with you Jaap, Your Indonesian is good|pg||
nt|jaapfr: meanwhile dummy lost his entry|pg||
nt|lml: you can make 6@S on a good day and without a heart lead today is a good day|pg||
pc|d8|nt|josj: even +2...|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
nt|kit: sure, every now and then they will redouble and wrap it around your neck -- but the gains outweigh the losses IMO.|pg||
nt|ritong: especially when the size of the loss does not matter|pg||
nt|kit: I would double at IMP also without hesitation.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but lucky @C mite help|pg||
pc|sK|nt|dburn: ...that was not their best shot, as it happens|pg||
pc|s5|nt|dburn: wonder if Shane Blanchard is a fan of James Thurber|pg||
pc|s7|nt|alunand7: no jab...10@C was goo entry|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kit: will get heart ruff now -- but declarer can set up 9 of clubs if judges to lead club to 10|pg||
nt|josj: no time to lose here: they played 6 boards in less than half an hour|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|sT|pc|c2|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pc|s2|nt|jaapfr: susa sekali|pg||
nt|ahalim: hi all, these 4 used to be the indonesian national open team|pg||

pc|c8|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|mrace: also, if  u dont double it, @Cs will be the last one for pd to consider, if he doesnt have clear shot lead, since 2@C went pass in front of us|pg||
nt|mrace: that happened to us :) pd had @Cs and @Ds to to lead and i failed to dbl 2@C..costed us 13 imps...|pg||
nt|ritong: i won t interfere in this debate|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Next up is Kwiecien vs Kendrick|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: break just ended on the clock, but I predict 2-3 minutes for all the players to show up|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Please don't ask me for Swiss standings, they haven't been providing them.|pg||
nt|ritong: charlatan|pg||
nt|ritong: sry pv|pg||
pc|cK|pc|h5|pc|c3|pc|s6|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h2|nt|kit: South probably didn't lead spade for fear partner would try to give him another ruff|pg||
pc|h8|nt|xenya: 2@D plays quite well here -- the lead appears helpful for declarer, but it should always make i think|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kit: or maybe believed the 3 of hearts suit-preference -- but it was a forced play|pg||
nt|me argent: north might have helped his partner out with his @H return|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: sorry, I don't have any NA Swiss results.|pg||
nt|xenya: strange as it may seem, that @CA play didn't cost a trick |pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Next up is Kwiecen vs Spector|pg||
nt|kit: North might have solved the problem by returning the king of hearts -- couldn't really cost|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|mc|12|nt|lml: so this seems a decent result but it could win or lose imps|pg||
nt|lml: its in the hands of the OR|pg||

nt|frankaus: the pace of play seems to be increasing - in the bridge that i see|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: But one of those plays easier to find in the post-mortem than at the table|pg||
nt|alunand7: big swing previous board.. i am sure about it...|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: anyway 3nt was doomed with @H lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: ty Adi :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lml: wonder if they can get to the heart game|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: dull hand, this - except in the Reisinger, where an overtrick matters|pg||
nt|xenya: reasonable slam here|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mdgraham: en route to 3N here|pg||
nt|lml: I like to show a limit raise here even with only 3@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|Vugraphu2: after 6 rds in swiss Lynch 101, Dawson 93.35, Agica 92.97, Lall 91.46, cooper 86.75|pg||
nt|kit: going to be difficult for E-W to stop after the light opening bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: duck second @H and good quessing would bring it home|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mdgraham: although 6@D is reasonable - difficult to bid perhaps|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: 6@D or 6N|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: 6@D is better|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: duck 2nd @H @SK @CA @DQ x@C and so it made but not likely in other room would be played like that|pg||
nt|lml: West should go for sure now... well done|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kit: don't know if this is forcing or not in their methods -- we will soon find out|pg||
nt|josj: very light overcall by E but EW landed on their feet|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lml: East gave himself some plus points as he deserves for that chunky suit|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kit: not necessarily so dull -- East may be thinking slam|pg||
nt|kareno: West may not care :)|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|josj: what would have happened if N does not X 4@D?|pg||
nt|frankaus: this will set it |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|nt|dburn: well, he can get his hand shown and still stop in 3NT|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe they won't be able to do that so easily at the other table, it's true|pg||
nt|dburn: except that if this is the Kwiecien team, it will also play Polish Club|pg||
pc|hA|nt|gowdy: passive @C here  best |pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: On VG here is Pollack-Spector NS vs Tuszynkski-Kowalski EW|pg||
nt|me argent: carefull and lucky play should produce 11tricks|pg||
nt|kit: I think declarer will go after diamonds first, but not totally clear|pg||
nt|me argent: feels rgt kit|pg||
nt|gowdy: my guess is @H|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|h5|pc|c7|nt|gowdy: na @D  :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @CT entry for all dropping @D nicely|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|pg||
nt|josj: yes, no chance to wrong for the def.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|kit: you lose, Bruce -- it seems|pg||
nt|dburn: spies inform me that East-West at the other table are higher than 3NT already|pg||
nt|kit: now heart finesse for sure|pg||
nt|dburn: the same spies inform me that you might make six diamonds. Yes, I suppose you might.|pg||
nt|me argent: looks like the board was won when EW stopped in 3NT|pg||
nt|xenya: as on some layouts it can be made on a trump coup if S has Hxxx in @Ds|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h7|pc|h6|nt|me argent: it wont be played in 6@Ds i am willing 2 bet|pg||
nt|lml: he didnt want the spade ruffed so he tried the safer player in hearts.  A man thinking imps|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|s5|pc|d7|nt|kit: declarer taking 2 spade ruffs -- not totally clear to me that this is best approach|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s4|pg||

mb|1D|mb|2C|nt|kit: it is a win|pg||
nt|dburn: I should think so too|pg||
mb|d|nt|frankaus: how many @H will be bid ? - & how many will they make?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|kareno: Now I would overcall with that north hand.|pg||
nt|kit: I would make takeout double with Sout hand -- both majors|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, that too.|pg||
nt|xenya: but a chance for Djarum ladies to make up for the disastrous board 17|pg||
nt|alunand7: look likes play in 2@H|pg||
nt|lml: game north south is tough on this lie of the cards|pg||
mb|d|mb|3S|nt|kit: overcall on North hand marginal|pg||
nt|kareno: 1@s just loses the heart suit forever.|pg||
nt|kit: North will be back in with 2@H -- this time.|pg||
mb|d|nt|kit: South had other options -- I don't know what is best|pg||
nt|me argent: do everybody agree with norths final pass?|pg||
mb|4C|nt|gowdy: not me !|pg||
nt|Walddk4: After 6: 1. Delmonte 14.95 2. Nickell 13.05 3. Kwiecien  12.00 4. Kendrick 11.61 5. Polowan 9.88 6. Shugart 9.2 7. Becker 8. Spector 9.Greenberg  10.Diamond |pg||
nt|kit: definitely agree -- North "has his bids" -- nothing extra.  North is expected to hold 6 points when they preempt.|pg||
nt|me argent: even with adverse ruff and @HK offside NS make 10 tricks in @Hs|pg||
nt|kit: lif is like that -- South could be a LOT weaker for the 3@H call|pg||
nt|gowdy: ok I relent pass is best|pg||
nt|dburn: sure - pass of 3@H close to obvious at BAM, even close to normal at IMPs|pg||
nt|me argent: unless east quacks the opening @S lead|pg||
nt|gowdy: so my answer is i'm happy to be here and not there|pg||
nt|kit: and not even clear that 4@H will make -- there is that 4th round of clubs, you know|pg||
nt|mrace: he doesnt need to |pg||
nt|kareno: Kwiecien treating his hand like 5-4|pg||
nt|josj: good question|pg||
nt|jaapfr: -1 or -2?|pg||
nt|lml: north south are trying to get each other to pick the suit.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: there they go|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: South is bidding a LOT.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lml: if I was going to bid as south I would make that bid|pg||
nt|lml: I doubled spades so this must give partner a choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrace: will make this though i guess|pg||
nt|alunand7: thats right Japp|pg||
nt|jaapfr: which:)???????|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: effortless|pg||
nt|kit: Well, they got it right -- this time.  But much easier if either one of them bids their hand properly the first time.|pg||
nt|kareno: No way to go wrong.|pg||
nt|josj: making 5 I think|pg||
mb|d|nt|kit: speak for yourself :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|alunand7: sorry *jaap|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i meant -1 OR -2 harry\|pg||

nt|kareno: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: the declarer in question is a world champion, tim|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: 11 is likely now|pg||

nt|mrace: it has been a challenge to me to remember to spell his name|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a lot depends on your overcall range - North is close to an invite opposite 16-18, but opposite 15-17 you can understand the pass|pg||
nt|alunand7: Slam Zone now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a very light 6@S which makes|pg||
mb|1N|nt|xenya: "only" 8 imps for AIC on 17 -- EW bid and made 4@H in the OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|gowdy: pass ?|pg||
nt|ritong: please, can some polish spec tell me?|pg||
nt|ritong: pszczola, my bad|pg||
nt|ritong: thanks all|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|nt|gowdy: 4 D now|pg||
nt|me argent: everyone overcall 2@Hs|pg||

nt|alunand7: i beat slam!!|pg||
nt|ritong: hi there|pg||
nt|caruga: mine is yes|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi henri welcome too Bandung|pg||
mb|3C|an|ask dist|mb|p|nt|kit: this is difficult bidding hand -- slam is reasonable|pg||
nt|ritong: you get it|pg||
nt|josj: all of them|pg||
nt|alunand7: hi henri and fabio..welcome|pg||
mb|3N|an|4-3-3-3|nt|mdgraham: no shrinking violet, West|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: indeed|pg||
nt|kit: Opposite the strong jump shift, I don't think East will quit with the good 8-bagger|pg||
nt|caruga: hi all|pg||
nt|ritong: no, he does not try  reasonable|pg||
nt|alunand7: you won jaap :)|pg||
mb|6H|nt|kit: 2@H overcall clear in my book opposite passed hand -- partner can't have enough to bury you by bidding 3NT or something like that|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Spector: Splinter? Just kidding.  Pollack: Lead-directing.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this should be regarded as protective as there was no double of the 2@H transfer |pg||
nt|jaapfr: after 1nt one must have a lot of imagination as S to see a slam:)|pg||
nt|lml: so maybe he should consider notrump rather than hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: but from what i have seen over past 2 bds pollack likes to pass|pg||
nt|kareno: especially once he gets raised.|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Which world championship?|pg||
nt|kit: This will get them to the good 6@D contract|pg||
nt|ritong: pairs|pg||
nt|josj: 3@H worked well as it pushed the opps too high|pg||
nt|xenya: i think W must balance non-vulnerable|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: totally agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzbq: I agreed |pg||
pc|d9|nt|kit: When your entire hand is in one suit, it is a good idea to bid that suit|pg||
nt|alunand7: manappo did not try it....:(|pg||
nt|ritong: however, there is an interesting proceeding to suggest slam without getting too involved|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||
nt|ritong: it is " other major"|pg||
nt|lml: can he make it if he doesn't guess hearts?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kit: West will like his hand a lot -- the question is whether or not he should bid more then just jumping to 6@D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: opposite the wrong hand, you could go for a penalty, but if you don't lose 500 once in a while you are not bidding enough - you will lose part-score swings   |pg||
pc|d3|pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|ritong: here, 3@h|pg||
nt|lml: we are about to find out|pg||
nt|lml: I think he is down now|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: declarer take a breath :)|pg||
nt|lml: east doesnt have enough diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: north south are being heavily punished for very small wrong choices|pg||
nt|lml: one thing I have learned.  When you are in this zone... the third and bad zone don't push|pg||
nt|lml: don't do anything unusual|pg||
nt|lml: and pray for flat hands|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: balance hand sometimes give us "dangerous & mistery" :(|pg||
pc|d8|nt|kit: play will go quickly here, with ace of spades still an entry.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kareno: His partner is moving to slam missing KQ of his suit.|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|dburn: well, it depends on the extent to which 1@d shows diamonds, perhaps|pg||
nt|dburn: five-card majors, and all...|pg||
nt|dburn: still, I'd have opened the bidding|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Next up: Becker vs Diamond|pg||
nt|gowdy: well it does not deny @D|pg||
nt|kit: If East hadn't returned a spade, declarer might well have gone wrong -- taking diamond finesse instead of spade finesse, for example.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Roland will post standings when they're available|pg||
nt|gowdy: true  give e aq @S and ak of @C  then  @D q is on side with the bidding|pg||
nt|kit: of course if East didn't have queen of diamonds, he might just cash ace of spades fearing declarer could take 7 hearts and 5 diamonds|pg||
nt|xenya: even holding the @DQ, he might fear declarer can take 12 tricks|pg||
nt|gowdy: and then why did w lead a club  must have a @s card|pg||
nt|kit: from QJ10 of clubs, club lead would be pretty clear -- no inference there I don't think|pg||
nt|kit: Holding guarded queen of diamonds East doesn't need to cash -- how can declarer take 12 tricks?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ritong: meaning " i like my hand  do you too?"|pg||
nt|alunand7: bid 3@H better|pg||
nt|lml: he had two decisions to make ... notrump or hearts and then which hand to cash the trump from|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kit: grand is decent, but pretty hard to put it all together I think.|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|c9|nt|xenya: the dummy is not quite suitable, so he will go down a few|pg||
nt|lml: and he got both wrong|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||

mb|p|nt|lml: a flat type hand... one for north south to catch their breath on|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: reasonable hand for 4-card overcall|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzbq: what is about 6@C?|pg||

nt|xenya: when you have an 8-card fit in a major|pg||

nt|kit: Precision here |pg||
nt|kareno: Thanks :)|pg||
nt|josj: and another light overcall|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: saying it will make usually invokes the commetators curse :(|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kit: Natural overcall in responder's suit -- often difficult to deal with|pg||
nt|kareno: East's bid does not fit the Pearson Point Law :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@S is an optimistic contract|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not justified by success|pg||
nt|lml: well that bid is going to keep north quiet for a bit|pg||
mb|d|an|T O !s|nt|ritong: worst possible layout|pg||
nt|jaapfr: you clicked harry away:)|pg||
nt|ritong: @d K off and @c 4/1|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lml: this could definitely be an action board|pg||
mb|3D|mb|4H|nt|me argent: what would double mean from north now?|pg||
nt|gowdy: nice|pg||
nt|kit: good question -- does everybody know in their partnerships?|pg||
nt|me argent: not i|pg||
nt|jaapfr: only @CJ lead mite help:)|pg||
nt|ritong: this means that 6@c is dommed|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: so 9 more to Djarum...probably|pg||
nt|ritong: doomed*|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: which illustrates why the bid is difficult to deal with|pg||
nt|me argent: of course i like to discuss methods as little as possible|pg||
nt|josj: N says it won;'t make :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: in 6@D|pg||
nt|lml: this is one of those hands where you don't really want to press north south|pg||
nt|lml: remember the zone|pg||
nt|lml: or is it the force... well whatever|pg||
mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|gowdy: cute splinter in P suit  well bid|pg||
nt|kit: thoughtful 4@H splinter -- in case North has slam possibilities|pg||
nt|kit: missed 4-4 club fit, but this probably plays as well |pg||
nt|kareno: And in the OR, South is playing 4@s.  That will be down several I think, and vulnerable no less.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|Vugraphu2: N to E: We haven't discussed this auction.|pg||
nt|kit: However, the splinter will keep East away from heart lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Who has? :)|pg||
nt|kit: and he will probably lead a low trump|pg||
nt|josj: and he's right provided S wins and plays a @C|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, but they are good players|pg||
nt|ahalim: 6@D makes|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|me argent: people who play the un q bid are more likely to discuss these type of auctions than those who dont|pg||
nt|kareno: Starting to see some tired bridge at this point.|pg||
nt|ritong: thus, they will land in @cs imho|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jaapfr: but then still has to hit @DA and @D back to avoid trumping @C so unlikely|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|nt|kit: this presents declarer with an interesting problem|pg||
nt|frankaus: wil need a @C switch|pg||
nt|josj: but X suggested a sing. @D|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|kit: his best play now might be an unusual low club (remember, East might have stiff club), planning on ruffin 2 clubs in his hand|pg||
nt|jaapfr: we go back too 6m-1|pg||
nt|ahalim: on a @C lead decl will play that way|pg||

pc|d6|nt|kit: declarer will be able to set up club suit, losing a club trick along the way -- but he still gets 4 spades, 3 diamonds, 3 clubs for 10 tricks|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d5|pg||
pc|c5|nt|xenya: seems he could take 11 but that won't matter|pg||
nt|kit: apparently N-S in other room didn't know how to deal with the 2@H overcall -- they doubled it for only 500|pg||
nt|kareno: East working on eloping with his small trumps.|pg||
nt|mrace: sry private|pg||
nt|ritong: it was extremely dangerous anyway, i can t see why he led that|pg||
pc|c7|nt|alunand7: but karwur did not do it :) |pg||
pc|h4|nt|jaapfr: i miss the logic of a @C lead with JT9x and @DK|pg||
nt|ritong: he would do it with 9 @cs, no doubt|pg||
nt|ritong: since south would show out|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lml: yes I know West might have made it but he took a reasonable line|pg||
