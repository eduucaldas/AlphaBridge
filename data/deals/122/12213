mb|p|mb|1C|nt|ritong: hey, our heroes again|pg||
mb|d|mb|1S|nt|ritong: ouch|pg||
nt|ritong: brad vs mom|pg||
nt|xenya: 6@C -- but can they bid it?|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3C|nt|me argent: alot of Y K and Zs at this table|pg||
nt|kit: South will compete to 3@H with 6 hearts and stiff club, and that should end it.|pg||
nt|kareno: I concur.|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: might be tough|pg||
mb|3S|nt|kit: not sure I see motivation behin this call -- it should be a game try, and he just isn't worth it.|pg||
nt|frankaus: both red i dont expect any heroics|pg||
nt|xenya: maybe they'll do well to bid 5@C?|pg||
mb|4D|nt|kareno: What's the purpose of that 3@d bid?  invitation?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Vugraphu2: and one of them isn't even polish|pg||
nt|mrace: must be |pg||
nt|josj: hi Frank|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day Jos Jacobs welcome|pg||
nt|xenya: a hand for bidding competition actually|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: hi all and selamat siang|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|nt|kareno: We're on a wavelength, Kit.|pg||
nt|kareno: And it has given west too much information.  |pg||
nt|kit: no reason for West to lead anything but a trump with everything under control.|pg||
nt|josj: this can go down on a club ruff but it probably won't|pg||
nt|xenya: well 4@S would have got a few points in a bidding competition |pg||
pc|c2|nt|dburn: odd sort of bidding, this, especially at BAM|pg||
nt|dburn: but West seemed unwilling to open or to rebid 1NT|pg||
nt|mrace: he heard ya |pg||
nt|ritong: she|pg||
nt|mrace: sry she|pg||
nt|ritong: gail greenberg|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer will lead club up immediately, and make with club ace on and hearts 2-2 -- can eventually ruff third diamond in dummy.|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, it gives up a spade trick, that is a reason not to lead trumps |pg||
nt|kit: Normal result, and that was achieved in other room.|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c8|pg||
nt|kit: West had has awkward rebid -- hate to bid 2@D, but weak to reverse for most|pg||
nt|dburn: and did not consider he had enough for 2@h|pg||
pc|h4|nt|xenya: the trouble is that it might go down|pg||
pc|hT|nt|me argent: i like 2@Cs|pg||
nt|gowdy: I admit I would have pushed with 2 H's|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@c certainly possible, but only if 2@h-3@h is natural after it|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't see how he can make it now -- he can't get to dummy's clubs and retain a @D control|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|kit: some would solve problem by opening 1NT, but that has obvious flaws also|pg||
nt|josj: well it still can...|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d9|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kit: will win in dummy, pitch spade on king of clubs, and diamond to king.|pg||
nt|kareno: I am not fond of trump leads|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d4|nt|xenya: the question is whether EW can make 8 tricks in 1N -- on the surface, they can't|pg||
nt|kareno: They give up tempo and if you need to get your suits going, tempo matters a lot!|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kit: might not be fond of them, but on this hand was clear (although it turned out badly this time)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h9|pg||
nt|xenya: mind you, N did very well to switch to @Hs -- on any other switch, 4@S makes|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|nt|me argent: i played with kokish much too long to ever consider bidding 2@Hs|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, West has bought pretty well for his actual sequence - he isn't going lots down in a 5-1 or 5-0 fit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: After 4 rounds: 1. Nickell 2.Delmonte  3.Kendrick 4. Polowan 5.Shugart 6.Kwiecien  7. Spector 8.Becker  9.Greenberg 10.Diamond |pg||
nt|gowdy: no  the question is how could they ever find 1NT|pg||
nt|xenya: 1@D -- 1@S -- 1N?|pg||
nt|me argent: opening 1nt?|pg||
nt|dburn: well, if you are not prepared to open it, maybe you ought to be prepared to rebid it|pg||
nt|gowdy: transfer then Joey|pg||
nt|xenya: then E might transfer|pg||
nt|me argent: i must admit i open 1@D and rebid 2@Cs|pg||
nt|gowdy: playing weak NT then perhaps|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: I wonder why W isn't claiming?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|me argent: not close 4 moi|pg||
nt|dburn: still, the reverse at the other table got a minus score, so this is a win for Spector|pg||

mb|1D!|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N!|an|15-17|nt|Vugraphu1: I think that Hampson said 2@c was some number of HCPs and Greco said it was natural, but not sure|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h5|nt|barnets: if south opens2@s they may well save in 4@S|pg||
nt|paulhac:  The advantage is you may be able to prempt the disadvantage is you do not want a spade lead from Kx|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it's not clear to pre-empt with only 2 card support, either|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|nt|barnets: moss opened 2@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: In the NA Swiss after 2 tonight, my spy says Lynch has retaken the lead, Agica is second, Lall 3rd|pg||

nt|josj: as declarer did not want to take the @C finesse, he accepted one down right from the start...|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kareno: I'd be passing with south's hand...|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: yes, should be|pg||
nt|josj: apparently NS play Strong Club|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrace: yes u dont have QX in @H Karen :)|pg||
nt|ritong: no way brad passes, i think|pg||
nt|kit: 2@S looks a lot more descriptive than pass to me, but to each his own.|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: 2N?|pg||
nt|xenya: better|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kit: 3@H may be somewhat conservative -- but East will probably bid game anyway.|pg||
nt|xenya: but even this might not make|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kareno: Well, I hate to bid a jack-high suit first or second seat.  Too often it seduces partner into leading from honor-x to the detriment of the defense.|pg||
nt|ritong: he had a tough decision, with this scoring|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kit: I'll worry about that when the bidding is over|pg||
nt|ritong: no doubt he would not think twice playing imps|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|xenya: well the lead helps a lot|pg||
pc|s3|nt|frankaus: this looks like a very strange aution|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kit: If South bids out his shape here, North may make the winning decision to play 4@S|pg||
nt|kit: Well, he got the disaster lead -- and won the board!|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, IMPs is a different reward system :)|pg||
nt|ritong: but kit is right, jeff hand is a conservative player in general|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kit: But instead North unnecessarily rushed to 3NT|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he didn't get the chance, which is a bit odd|pg||
nt|me argent: EW play polish@C so that probably influenced their choice of bids on 13|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|me argent: and 14 for that matter|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, sure - in Polish Club that sequence is automatci|pg||
nt|me argent: sorry cant keep my directions streight this is my first job|pg||
nt|kit: declarer will probably duck first heart, win second, and go after clubs|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|kit: I don't see that much difference between IMPs and matchpoints on East hand -- you bid game if you think it is a favorite, not otherwise, at both games.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kit: Note that after the initial pass at other table they had no difficulty getting to game|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|s4|nt|frankaus: and a strange result as well|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sT|nt|me argent: dummy squeezed|pg||

pc|d6|pg||
nt|gowdy: if @s lay right then this is bad   so right play|pg||
nt|josj: I am|pg||
nt|xenya: on a closer look, 1N seems a make on any other lead |pg||
pc|h9|pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h3|pg||

pc|h8|mc|9|nt|josj: no game on for NS but -200 does not look too good|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|tejjyid: that's a well timed lead directing X on pretty marginal values|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|barnets: this is a bad hand for texas with a club lead endangering a slam on trick1|pg||

nt|barnets: so a win for e/w|pg||
nt|me argent: another tired auction by east in CR to land in 4@Hs|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: From now on we'll be seeing the top 3 teams. The directors will choose which of the 3, usually planning to send us the top 3 team that is playing the team currently placed highest ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: of the rest|pg||
nt|me argent: with same result of making one more trick than in OR|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Next round we'll have Nickell vs Kendrick|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Our NS pair will be Jan Van Cleef and Jon Sveindal - does anyone know which of them sits N and which S?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Otherwise I'll guess|pg||
nt|me argent: jon sits south|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: I know which is which, they're not here yet, though|pg||

nt|mrace: i am bidding it in both...4 trumps and an Ace is too much to pass to a pd who overcalled at 3 level....just the @H support may make pd's hand a giant|pg||
nt|josj: yes...|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|xenya: sorry i should have said "her ace" -- NS are women|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Now the old choice -- 3NT or 4@H?|pg||
mb|p|pc|h3|nt|josj: but if W showed @S and it was alerted, 2NT is not easy to understand|pg||
nt|frankaus: 4@S EW may be playable here|pg||
nt|josj: sure but makeable? try a @D lead|pg||
pc|h2|nt|xenya: this might not be an easy one -- i'm abit surprised E raised|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kit: North afraid to compete to 3@H, fearing his partner will play him for invite values|pg||
nt|kit: Doesn't seem to me that whether partner has 3 hearts or not should make much difference.|pg||
nt|kareno: 2@h is a bit of an underbid with that hand, no?|pg||
nt|mrace: too many QJs|pg||
nt|kareno: Any more and she would have a 1nt opener.  |pg||
nt|kit: I would have bid 3NT on East hand, right or wrong.|pg||
nt|mrace: after 1 nt ? |pg||
nt|mrace: or 2@H ? |pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|h6|nt|me argent: but north did well to get his side out of nt|pg||
nt|josj: N should pass now but will he know that?|pg||
nt|josj: yes he did!|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kit: was just as well, as 3@H probably down 2 losing both club finesses|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|kit: after 1NT|pg||
nt|kareno: This form of scoring that makes great sense, kit.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|dburn: indeed he did - that was a pretty good view|pg||
nt|ritong: agree, kit|pg||
nt|frankaus: this is likely to make|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c4|nt|me argent: south playing 1nt in OR on a @D lead|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|kit: very unusual hand where at IMPs I'd tend toward 4@H, but at matchpoints 3NT -- it is usually the other way around.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|gowdy: good bid by E not 100% obvious|pg||
nt|xenya: 9 tricks now -- E's @CJ is a big card|pg||
pc|c3|nt|me argent: a triumph 4 Garbage Stayman|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|pg||
nt|josj: even more likely now :)|pg||
pc|hT|pc|s2|nt|gowdy: yep   that 2 is not 100%|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h9|pg||
nt|kit: making them all, but lose the board|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|nt|josj: maybe an overtrick now as the hearts go on the @S|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ritong: again|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|pc|d2|nt|me argent: easts action irrelevant on this hand north won the bd with 2@Cs|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Next match Greenberg vs Kendrick|pg||
nt|gowdy: but he can only do what he can do|pg||
nt|dburn: if Kendrick still bids as he used to, should be an interesting match|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: There's a problem with bd 16, they're skipping to 17 and they'll get a substitute bd 16|pg||
nt|josj: no he played safe lready|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|kit: at IMPs the major needs to take 2 extra tricks to be really better, so lean towards notrump if close.  At matchpoints, needs to take only 1 extra trick.|pg||
nt|josj: a|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|d9|nt|josj: should be just made I think|pg||
nt|josj: and that's what it says now|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: 4@c just made :)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|kit: Here, however, 4@H figures to be completely safe while 3NT might have  a hole, but on balance I would bet on same number of tricks.|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|c8|pc|s4|pc|d7|pc|s8|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s3|pc|sT|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kareno: I think e/w in the OR play 1NT 14-16 in their club system so this hand was perhaps easier for them to evaluate.|pg||
nt|kit: 6@H was still pretty lucky in any event|pg||
nt|ritong: pretty lucky?|pg||
nt|kit: particularly played from West side, where club lead might beat it outright in addition to queen of hearts problem.|pg||
nt|mrace: they do play 15/17 but open almost all 14 hcp with good spots or 5 card suits as far as i watched them Karen |pg||
nt|mrace: i am not % 100 sure with their range though |pg||
nt|kit: greco-hampson I'm pretty sure 14-16|pg||
nt|mrace: ok|pg||
nt|mrace: how about Fred and Brad ? |pg||
nt|mrace: same ? |pg||
nt|ritong: shhh|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: The Brits are here, we're waiting for Hamman and Zia|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: After 21 boards, Nickell leading Delmonte by 3.6 boards|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: 12 boards :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: I can't predict the future|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: don't have any Swiss standings here|pg||

nt|josj: very quick correction, Adi: wd :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: E-W have easy 4@S -- the question is how many clubs will North bid, and how many hearts will South bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: hello Mike|pg||
mb|1H|nt|kit: Somehow, 2@C looks like an insufficient bid to me|pg||

mb|3N|nt|josj: here we have a very good Roland slam|pg||

mb|d|nt|me argent: east worth a double here?|pg||
nt|dburn: well, what can he do?|pg||
nt|kit: I can't believe West didn't compete to 4@S|pg||
nt|dburn: true - whichever minor partner had, you'd have some cards for him|pg||
nt|me argent: it does say something about their 2 bids|pg||
nt|dburn: on the other hand, if partner was clowning around with a couple of jack-fifths, you'd go down about 800|pg||
nt|me argent: and why it was WRONG for east 2 open 2@Ss|pg||
nt|josj: I think X shows the blackies v. Strong Club|pg||
nt|xenya: on 13, the ladies in the other bid to the correct 5@C contract and NS took a save in 5@H -- -500 and 12 imps to Djarum ladies |pg||
mb|2H|nt|kit: extra spade -- but didn't matter here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: a hand which shows, once again, that nine-card suits are meant to be trumps|pg||
mb|2S|mb|d|nt|frankaus: the SP cost the contract - loose lips !!!!!!! - N showed @S A @C KJ  did not overcall so E "knew" N does not have @D K|pg||

nt|mdgraham: what on earth....?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mdgraham: South thinks 2@D is major, methinks. A bad time to have a system forget|pg||
nt|xenya: but whatever it might be, obviously NS were not on the same wavelength|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kit: still looks clear to accept the "transfer" -- somebody bids 4@H, so you bid 4@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: director called after E's double, didn't hear the conversation.|pg||
nt|dburn: well, everyone has a good hand for their bid|pg||

nt|me argent: anyhow after opening 1@S EW playing 6@Ss in OR|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s6|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|d2|nt|me argent: wests pass shows that 2@Ss was the WRONGbid|pg||
nt|dburn: having said all of that, 6@s at the other table was... well, it made|pg||
nt|dburn: could have lost a diamond ruff, could have lost a couple of clubs on the go|pg||
nt|xenya: well it says 2@S is 5-11 -- quite a wide range -- was tough for  W to make an intelligent decision|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Board 16 will be replaced by a board we can't show|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Accidentally, a player saw board 16 at the previous table|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: result on 17 was 5@HX+1, pending director decision about whether the double was based on long hesitation by E before his X|pg||
nt|dburn: well, the result is probably not 5@h doubled *plus* one whatever East or West di|pg||
nt|me argent: that east hand is not a 5 to 11 points|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: sorry, it was -1 ,will correct movie|pg||
nt|me argent: as marty bergen says points shmoints|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: doesn't change the bam result|pg||
nt|kit: I can't see what the problem is -- West certainly would never sell to 5@H undoubled after his partner's double of 4@H|pg||
nt|me argent: indeed|pg||
nt|dburn: if West was slow over 4@h, East's double might be cancelled|pg||
nt|dburn: not that any of it will matter, since whether NS were -100 in 5@h doubled or plus 420 in 4@h is irrelevant|pg||
nt|kit: oh come on -- no way East would ever sell to 4@H with that hand after having misdescribed with the 2@S opening|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: maybe that was it, I didn't catch all the td discussion|pg||
nt|xenya: that's true|pg||
nt|xenya: sorry, private|pg||
nt|dburn: I agree with you entirely, Kit, but appeals committees have been known to do some odd things|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: 6@D or 6N|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: overcall on North hand marginal|pg||
nt|kareno: 1@s just loses the heart suit forever.|pg||
nt|kit: North will be back in with 2@H -- this time.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kit: South had other options -- I don't know what is best|pg||
nt|me argent: do everybody agree with norths final pass?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|gowdy: not me !|pg||
nt|Walddk4: After 6: 1. Delmonte 14.95 2. Nickell 13.05 3. Kwiecien  12.00 4. Kendrick 11.61 5. Polowan 9.88 6. Shugart 9.2 7. Becker 8. Spector 9.Greenberg  10.Diamond |pg||
nt|kit: definitely agree -- North "has his bids" -- nothing extra.  North is expected to hold 6 points when they preempt.|pg||
nt|me argent: even with adverse ruff and @HK offside NS make 10 tricks in @Hs|pg||
nt|kit: lif is like that -- South could be a LOT weaker for the 3@H call|pg||
nt|gowdy: ok I relent pass is best|pg||
nt|dburn: sure - pass of 3@H close to obvious at BAM, even close to normal at IMPs|pg||
nt|me argent: unless east quacks the opening @S lead|pg||
nt|gowdy: so my answer is i'm happy to be here and not there|pg||
nt|kit: and not even clear that 4@H will make -- there is that 4th round of clubs, you know|pg||
nt|mrace: he doesnt need to |pg||
nt|kareno: Kwiecien treating his hand like 5-4|pg||

nt|Vugraphu1: Van Cleef to Piekarek: "your diamond can't be short"|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe 6@D was a better choice than 4N|pg||
nt|tejjyid: There's some suggestion that the 3@S bid agreed @H, and 3NT was therefor serious|pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: no shrinking violet, West|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: indeed|pg||
nt|kit: Opposite the strong jump shift, I don't think East will quit with the good 8-bagger|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: 2@H overcall clear in my book opposite passed hand -- partner can't have enough to bury you by bidding 3NT or something like that|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Spector: Splinter? Just kidding.  Pollack: Lead-directing.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this should be regarded as protective as there was no double of the 2@H transfer |pg||
pc|s9|nt|me argent: but from what i have seen over past 2 bds pollack likes to pass|pg||
nt|kareno: especially once he gets raised.|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Which world championship?|pg||
nt|kit: This will get them to the good 6@D contract|pg||
nt|ritong: pairs|pg||
nt|josj: 3@H worked well as it pushed the opps too high|pg||
nt|xenya: i think W must balance non-vulnerable|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mdgraham: totally agree|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s7|pg||
nt|kit: When your entire hand is in one suit, it is a good idea to bid that suit|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|dK|pg||
nt|kit: West will like his hand a lot -- the question is whether or not he should bid more then just jumping to 6@D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: opposite the wrong hand, you could go for a penalty, but if you don't lose 500 once in a while you are not bidding enough - you will lose part-score swings   |pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|h8|pc|h9|pg||

pc|hK|nt|kareno: His partner is moving to slam missing KQ of his suit.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|pc|h3|pg||
nt|dburn: well, it depends on the extent to which 1@d shows diamonds, perhaps|pg||
nt|dburn: five-card majors, and all...|pg||
nt|dburn: still, I'd have opened the bidding|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Next up: Becker vs Diamond|pg||
nt|gowdy: well it does not deny @D|pg||
nt|kit: If East hadn't returned a spade, declarer might well have gone wrong -- taking diamond finesse instead of spade finesse, for example.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Roland will post standings when they're available|pg||
nt|gowdy: true  give e aq @S and ak of @C  then  @D q is on side with the bidding|pg||
nt|kit: of course if East didn't have queen of diamonds, he might just cash ace of spades fearing declarer could take 7 hearts and 5 diamonds|pg||
nt|xenya: even holding the @DQ, he might fear declarer can take 12 tricks|pg||
nt|gowdy: and then why did w lead a club  must have a @s card|pg||
nt|kit: from QJ10 of clubs, club lead would be pretty clear -- no inference there I don't think|pg||
nt|kit: Holding guarded queen of diamonds East doesn't need to cash -- how can declarer take 12 tricks?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|s2|nt|kit: grand is decent, but pretty hard to put it all together I think.|pg||

nt|Vugraphu2: Unless Kwiecien's teammates fail to find this slam, 3/4 place won't change.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Standings are always 1 round behind|pg||
nt|kareno: Hard to imagine they won't bid a slam with those cards... but ...|pg||
nt|ritong: it needs a very wild preempting opening and west decides there are two aces off|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, they missed slam in the OR I hear.|pg||
nt|kareno: Played 5@d|pg||
nt|ritong: like 5@d opening  swish?|pg||

nt|kareno: mmmm.|pg||
nt|xenya: finding a 4-4 minor-suit fit on this type of hand is quite an achievement i think |pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Another hand where both sides are playing same contract I hear.|pg||
nt|peachy: Yes, 3D looks about right|pg||
nt|peachy: sry all,|pg||
nt|kareno: More menagerie.  Wonder if Hamman thought 2@s was forcing.|pg||
nt|kit: apparently 2@S isn't forcing -- it would be with some|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|xenya: when you have an 8-card fit in a major|pg||
mb|4N|nt|me argent: its my bid|pg||
nt|kit: East would prefer to be able to bid 2NT takeout and let partner bid his minor|pg||
nt|ritong: curiouser and curiouser|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: this might end in 6@H|pg||
mb|5D|nt|kareno: n/s apparently landed in 3@c open room in the end.|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: which will probably fail|pg||
mb|6H|nt|kit: the 1@S overcall scared E-W out of notrump -- but the patient died, as 3NT doesn't make|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: lets c if it makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: After 7 rounds: 1. Delmonte 17.54 2. Nickell 15.55 3. Kwiecien  14.50 4. Kendrick 13.11 5. Polowan 11.88 6. Shugart 10.77 7. Becker 8. Spector 9. Diamond 10. Greenberg|pg||
nt|kit: Now 4@H on heart guess, and will likely guess right thinking South has 5 spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: (re)hi all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hi Jos|pg||
nt|josj: hi Mike|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Jos|pg||
nt|josj: (re)hi Adi and Vladimir|pg||
nt|josj: 6@H is the better scoring slam, even more so for NS|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mdgraham: this will go two off I reckon - East will probably try a heart to the queen, hoping for 3-2 hearts with the king in the South hand |pg||
pc|c7|nt|Walddk4: Why would he think that, Kit, after North supported over the double?|pg||
nt|me argent: will the auction tell declarer how to play trumps?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kit: South will be disappointed when his partner unable to ruff second club|pg||
nt|kit: sorry, didn't see the raise|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and that will be 17 imps to NS|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|h9|pc|c8|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|me argent: guess not|pg||
nt|kit: So declarer has to decide what is going on in the club suit -- is South leading length or shortness?|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kit: Hamman scrambling for every trick he can get, which might be quite a few.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|hA|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|kareno: Going well for declarer.|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d6|nt|me argent: he should know about now|pg||
nt|kit: declarer knows (if queen of diamonds honest which it logically should be) that West has all trumps left -- but which ones?|pg||
nt|josj: declarer has just 1 chance and this is working|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Vugraphu2: Zia sugggests underruffing|pg||
nt|kit: leading jack of spades and saving diamond exit feels better to me, but maybe not|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s6|nt|me argent: did i miss something?|pg||
pc|d7|pg||

nt|kit: Precision here |pg||
nt|kareno: Thanks :)|pg||
nt|josj: and another light overcall|pg||
mb|2S|nt|frankaus: saying it will make usually invokes the commetators curse :(|pg||
mb|3D|nt|kit: Natural overcall in responder's suit -- often difficult to deal with|pg||
nt|kareno: East's bid does not fit the Pearson Point Law :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@S is an optimistic contract|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not justified by success|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|me argent: what would double mean from north now?|pg||
nt|gowdy: nice|pg||
nt|kit: good question -- does everybody know in their partnerships?|pg||
nt|me argent: not i|pg||
pc|dT|nt|josj: so 9 more to Djarum...probably|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kit: which illustrates why the bid is difficult to deal with|pg||
nt|me argent: of course i like to discuss methods as little as possible|pg||
nt|josj: N says it won;'t make :)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
nt|gowdy: cute splinter in P suit  well bid|pg||
nt|kit: thoughtful 4@H splinter -- in case North has slam possibilities|pg||
nt|kit: missed 4-4 club fit, but this probably plays as well |pg||
nt|kareno: And in the OR, South is playing 4@s.  That will be down several I think, and vulnerable no less.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|nt|Vugraphu2: N to E: We haven't discussed this auction.|pg||
nt|kit: However, the splinter will keep East away from heart lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Who has? :)|pg||
nt|kit: and he will probably lead a low trump|pg||
nt|josj: and he's right provided S wins and plays a @C|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|me argent: people who play the un q bid are more likely to discuss these type of auctions than those who dont|pg||
nt|kareno: Starting to see some tired bridge at this point.|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|nt|kit: this presents declarer with an interesting problem|pg||

pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||

pc|d3|pc|dJ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|xenya: seems he could take 11 but that won't matter|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: perhaps that wasn't safe enough though?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Flannery :)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|kit: Flnnery -- will get them to routine 4@S|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N by N in the OR... -- a club lead would have made declarer sweat|pg||
mb|2N|nt|kit: South expecting  a bit more for the 2@D call -- I think this will make|pg||
nt|kit: but as N-S are in 3@D doubled at other table, 470 might not be enough!|pg||
nt|lml: I ended it with a simple squeeze but that didn't matter because there actually was a marked finesse|pg||
nt|xenya: this is quite an interesting contract, yes|pg||
nt|me argent: whats 3@Cs? when 1@C ?could be 2|pg||
nt|kareno: Only three losers but ... are there ten winners?  With trump leads, perhaps not.|pg||
nt|kit: with king of diamonds on, should be easy|pg||
nt|josj: now NS will find their real fit|pg||
nt|frankaus: now 3@C will make E wish he had passed|pg||

nt|Vugraphu2: 3@C explained as natural|pg||

pc|sT|nt|xenya: also why N didn't lead a trump?|pg||
nt|gowdy: I think he blew his end play|pg||
nt|kit: yes, I think a trump lead would make more sense, but diamond lead not terrible.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c3|pc|c6|pg||
