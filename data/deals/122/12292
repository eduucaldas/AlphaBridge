nt|jcwla: Matching 100's give Townsend 5 up to 16.  Last board of the set here.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They are still playing 37 in the other room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The contract is 2@CX played by South|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And here you see the result|pg||
nt|athene: surely it's an error to double opps at the 2-level in a 5-4 fit?|pg||
nt|athene: even an 8-card fit is usually wrong|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: i don't agree with Gold's double of 2@C - better just to bid something |pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: townsend was ultra-defensive for a t/o double of 1@C|pg||
nt|athene: so passing looked very reasonable from his side|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sT|nt|mowen: sounds like a misunderstanding, x for t/o surely? why not 2@h?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: this is a common misunderstanding - when does double say "pass if defensive, else bid something" as opposed to just "bid something"?|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hillman has just gained 11 imps on bd 35, and this one has potential for a further gain so could get pretty tight|pg||

nt|athene: many would open 1@H although i don't mind 2@H personally|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is a one-suiter in my view. It's usually better to let 4-6 be one-suited unless the 4-card suit is very good|pg||

nt|athene: but if south had the @SK he would be endplayed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: How?|pg||
nt|athene: and he should have it for his bid :)|pg||
nt|athene: because a diamond gives declarer the diamond finesse he can't take for himself|pg||
nt|ady: if South had the K@S   he would play a diamond|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, that gives him 8 tricks, so what?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Will he not score @SK at trick 13, then?|pg||
nt|athene: ah, right sorry i miscounted, yes|pg||
nt|ady: going to make 8 tricks either way|pg||

mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|athene: declarer only has eight tricks unless he finesses clubs?|pg||

mc|12|nt|jcwla: The description you linked to described it as a 4-card raise, Roland.  I don't think we actually saw pudding.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's an Acol thingy, so you must obviously have 4-card support|pg||
nt|mowen: i think so|pg||
nt|athene: maybe if you raise partner and then go down, that's a "failed soufflé" raise|pg||
nt|mowen: kib suggests a raise without a suet!|pg||
