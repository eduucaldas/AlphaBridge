nt|vugraphzwu: player at south not in seat.....waiting|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Commentators are Raija Davis and Padmanaban Sridhar|pg||
nt|psridhar: going by the trend in 1st segment NS may well crack a grand on this|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Our operator is Ruzbeh Raja|pg||
nt|psridhar: i hv seen the bidding go 1s-4h( splinter)-4s( wasted h kqj of h pd ! )-all pass|pg||
nt|peachy: another slam in this board. not sure what is going on, |pg||
nt|peachy: but we will surely get going soon:)|pg||
nt|psridhar: EW are indian railways and NS are Mango's team|pg||
nt|peachy: can you tell me (and kibs maybe) what systems these pairs use|pg||
nt|psridhar: both pairs use natural methods |pg||
nt|psridhar: 5 card Maj, strong NT|pg||
nt|peachy: thank you|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: error with duplication of open room set|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: closed room will continue as normal|pg||
nt|psridhar: hi all -welcome to the final segment of the QF|pg||
nt|psridhar: the site for results http://indianbridgepages.appspot.com/ Winter_Nationals/2009/Results.el|pg||
nt|patricck: The Semi-Final is 36 boards in 3 segments of 12?|pg||
nt|psridhar: i am not very familiar about the NS pair- but CV RAO is a well known indian team having won several national titles|pg||
nt|Walddk6: A spectator suggests that this is the other semi-final|pg||
nt|Walddk6: CABAL vs Dhampur|pg||
nt|psridhar: something wrong -the EW pair plays for dhampur i am certain|pg||
nt|psridhar: hi all welcome to the 2nd segment of semifinals|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: hi all welcome to the Ruia gold cup finals between Dhampur and railways|pg||
nt|patricck: Welcome to the first 12 boards of a 48 board match in the final of the Indian Winter Nationals|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Hi Good morning all|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|drkvas: hi guys|pg||
mb|2C|nt|psridhar: N hand ideal for a short suit trial bid|pg||
nt|psridhar: kind of splinter game try|pg||
nt|drkvas: u think ok with 3 trumps ps?|pg||
nt|psridhar: N hand doc|pg||
nt|drkvas: ok r|pg||
nt|drkvas: but i think 2@s is misclick|pg||
nt|psridhar: yeah too strong for a simple raise|pg||
nt|patricck: welcome everyone|pg||
nt|patricck: Are NS playing inverted major raises?|pg||
nt|patricck: It appears the other table has been renamed, do we do the same here?|pg||
nt|patricck: Welcome Sunil|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: i have played against Ashok goel and kamal mukh all my life :)  they belong to dhampur|pg||
nt|Walddk6: This is more like it|pg||
nt|patricck: 4 sets of 16 boards, a 64 board Final|pg||
mb|2S|nt|patricck: that makes more sense :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|drkvas: 1INDIAN RAILWAYS - A  15212ARUN JAIN,   132|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Operator, please shut down and reconnect to the other room|pg||
nt|Walddk6: The other operator realised the error and has opened a new broadcast|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: this is the final of the Ruia trophy... the symbol of supremacy in Indian bridge|pg||
mb|2N|nt|sunsamvar: Hello Patrick|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk6: Best to do it now|pg||
nt|psridhar: i think this match is Dhampur Vs cabal|pg||
mb|3C|nt|bjacobs: The challenge is to stay out of the poor grand slam - even though it happens to make|pg||
nt|Walddk6: but ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: in the other match cabal leads dhampur by 10 IMP's|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: yes it is dhampur vs cabal|pg||
nt|Walddk6: The team names are now reversed :(|pg||
nt|panja: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Hi Panja|pg||
nt|psridhar: cabal is a team from Mumbai|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Walddk6: Welcome to Carl Mathiesen from Norway|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: Good Morning Roland, hi all|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, Dhampur is the EW pair, they should be in mauve|pg||
nt|patricck: South will have no trouble finding the right lead if EW get overboard, but I don't anticipate that|pg||
mb|4S|nt|patricck: the defence will need to be careful here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar: touch and go.. d1 at most|pg||
nt|panja: it is good to see Sanjay Damle playing in semis...(South)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i dont think they will overreach as they lck the @H control|pg||
pc|hA|nt|psridhar: key point of partnership understdg here is - what is diff between direct 3s over 2s and 3s via 2nt-since 2s is 6 cards 99% of the time|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sharkey: Good afternoon|pg||
pc|hT|nt|drkvas: yes now the ball is rolling nicely|pg||
nt|psridhar: 4H is pushy with the 'wasted' dia queen ...but i guess the stiff H makes up for it|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: error corrected|pg||
nt|patricck: 4@H would have been a splinter, enabled North to assess correctly to drive to slam|pg||
nt|psridhar: i hear other room also in 6s|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|drkvas: u have sharp ears ps|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Hi Sridhar|pg||
nt|psridhar: i thk via 2nt shd suggest 3nt and 4s while direct 3s shd actively propel towards a spd contract|pg||
nt|psridhar: hi Sunil |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i think u thk right Sridhar :)|pg||

nt|psridhar: i hv placed an agent there doc :)|pg||
nt|panja: he trained a lot of young people in 70's and 80's, under United Bridge Association|pg||
nt|psridhar: if declarer had played a LOW club W might hv ducked and entry to dummy to play dia|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|nt|drkvas: 3 cabal 4SUNIL MACHHAR  5 cvrao 6 india blues 7 dsm 8sreecem 9 formidables 10 mango 11 goverdhan agg hyd|pg||

mb|1N|nt|psridhar: hi all|pg||

mb|p|nt|patricck: that would be a better line|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: thanks for the heads up|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello to P Sridhar and David Bird|pg||
mb|2C|nt|brolucius: Hi to the kibitzers!|pg||
nt|brolucius: Holding the spades, North may risk an opening in the 4th seat.|pg||
nt|psridhar: THAT is a tough decision in 4th seat|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@D, to put up some sort of barrier.|pg||
nt|psridhar: 14 spear points|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, a question of whether West bids game or invites|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: i guess i will cash it|pg||
nt|brolucius: One of the less memorable auctions of the match.|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|patricck: 4-3-3-3 and poor intermediate cards, I invite|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Don't know if NS can find 6@C here - moste likely 3 NT|pg||
nt|psridhar: If S leads a club Kushari may swing it in|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: well stopped|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: they decide not to stretch for the nonvul game|pg||
pc|h6|nt|patricck: even 2NT is not certain|pg||
pc|h5|nt|psridhar: 3 aces to lose and 4-1 trump to handle ...but i expect he will make it|pg||
nt|patricck: 4@H could have been beaten with a @S ruff, but I don't think 4@S can be beaten|pg||
nt|patricck: that solves the problem for declarer in the @C suit|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|patricck: 6@C can make, but not a very good contract|pg||
nt|sharkey: 6@C hinges on finding the @DQ|pg||
nt|psridhar: this will result in 3nt -but say South has AXX,XX,AJXX,AQXX -how will the bidding go? will he raise 3d to 4d?|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|psridhar: he has 2 more jacks to guess|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree - and probably almost unbiddable|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, but needs a reasonable trump break before you get to that point|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes Patrick|pg||
pc|d2|nt|patricck: a heart lead would have been best, but West made a reasonable choice on opening lead|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|nt|bjacobs: threatening lead|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|psridhar: play to 2nt on h lead is similar to 3nt on cl lead :)|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hA|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: a spec tells me " Sumit and laltu are two of the best student of Kushari "|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d9|pc|d6|nt|psridhar: there must be a way to diagnose that stiff facing AXX or AKX in the auction|pg||
pc|c2|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d8|pc|dK|pc|c6|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: MAYBE HE CAN ENDPLAY sUMIT|pg||
pc|dT|pc|sT|nt|psridhar: other room in 4H and defense as suggested by Patrick is on right track|pg||
nt|psridhar: looks like early take off for railways !|pg||
nt|patricck: a @D back would have beaten it for sure with a @D ruff, but now declarer might make by guessing J@D|pg||
nt|psridhar: last dia squeezes S|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Sry for caps|pg||
pc|h8|pc|d3|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and so it may not be the same Sridhar|pg||
nt|patricck: two OF the best?  he has other students good enough to play in the Cup Final? :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: now spd ACE and h will endplay S|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Kushari is a Dada in Indian bridge Patrick|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|s9|pg||

nt|peachy: this one looks routine 6S, probably will be id|pg||
nt|peachy: bid|pg||
nt|psridhar: Roland -about 5 to 6 teams are sponsored regularly; and about 10 to 12 are regular professionals |pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: IR v. Mango|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: Arun Jain v. Dhampur|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: Cabal v. indian Blue|pg||
nt|psridhar: but very little sponsorship and participation in international tourneys sadly|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: CV Rao v. Sunil Machhar|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: coming up in a min.|pg||
nt|psridhar: I have seen Laria/versace diagnose such holdings marvelously but thru artifical bids that r diff to understand|pg||
nt|psridhar: and give up 140 for fear i will be minus 100|pg||
nt|psridhar: in 4s|pg||
nt|roswolf: more action likely here|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: Indian Railways have a phenominal record in the Ruia and have won the event many times in the past 10 years with more or less the same team.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|psridhar: that south hand is 1d opening for me|pg||
nt|brolucius: South judges his hand not worth a reverse (after a 1@D opening) and so shows his strength with a strong 1NT.  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: N-S have all the high cards, but E-W can make many spades|pg||
nt|patricck: too hard for Kushari to guess the winning play without any opposition bidding to guide him, so 1 down|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: i agree especially with that shape|pg||
mb|2D|nt|panja: precision 2@C opening|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@H Majors I assume - DONT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: the NS hands fit nicely, can they bid the good game? it looks like it|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes ..leading to a precarious 4-2 fit|pg||
nt|patricck: reopening double?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Sumit and Laltu are comparitively recent additions to this consistent team|pg||
mb|3C|an| |nt|psridhar: Sumit has done well to pass -many wd open 1s there|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How can East pass if 2@C shows the majors?|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: seems like a routine @S game...yes 6@S can be made, but not a good contract and won't be bid anyway|pg||
nt|psridhar: 6s off trump ace and queen is dicey|pg||
nt|psridhar: other room heading towards slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: again i agree|pg||
nt|brolucius: If you are playing Lebensohl, 3NT denies a spade stopper in one version. (You would travel via 2NT with a stopper).|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe 2@C was Astro-like, promising hearts and another, and then I can understand East's pass|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then he will think partner has hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Just goes to show that Astro is hopeless|pg||
mb|4H|nt|patricck: really, the winning play in trumps is possible, exciting stuff if they bid and make it|pg||
nt|psridhar: that 2nt bid has missed the spd fit|pg||
nt|patricck: no......2NT not an enquiry then?|pg||
nt|panja: and 2N won't make|pg||
nt|psridhar: Sanajy has gone for quanti auction in pref to the spd fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: if it went 2@C-2@D-2@H...I guess 2N would have been forcing....|pg||
nt|panja: so the structure forced him to guess the best response?|pg||
nt|patricck: how could it be by a passed hand?|pg||
nt|psridhar: i wonder what was 3C ..with  a doubleton h ..some misunderstdg i guess|pg||
nt|patricck: As long as NS lead spades sometime 4@H seems doomed|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: was 3@C a super acceptance showing short @C ?... can he do it with doubleton trumps ?|pg||
nt|patricck: 5@D might well make tho|pg||
nt|psridhar: from West's perspective his pd cd well hv held a weak hand with H..so crossing 2h without a fit seems unwise|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: with 5 spades he must have shown that suit as well - otherwise his defence to 1nt is wanting|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A defence to 1NT that does not have 2@C as *both* majors is not worth playing, full stop.|pg||
nt|psridhar: Or did he momentarily (mis) registered 2D as dia ..and ...?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk6: How can anything be forcing by a passed hand?|pg||
nt|psridhar: i think he did well to pass..a reopg X might hv given W a chance to smoke out 2s|pg||
nt|patricck: surely not|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|nt|psridhar: sound conservative auction may earn them 13 if other room fails in slam|pg||
nt|sharkey: Same contract where NS would have landed if W passed....|pg||
nt|psridhar: if W had passed NS might hv declared 2H vul|pg||
nt|patricck: not the best lead from North, I wouldn't have thought there was a need to be that active on the lead|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|brolucius: The club discard from dummy is puzzling. What use are the diamonds?|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: yes|pg||
pc|dT|nt|panja: oh y, passed hand, true|pg||
nt|Walddk6: So if he wants to bid, 2@D must be it|pg||
nt|panja: or, then, 2@D might be passable here for them? passed hand?|pg||
nt|psridhar: u only need yr pd not to screw up|pg||
nt|psridhar: sorry prvt|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|bjacobs: If the @H9 and @H10 were swapped - that was what North was hoping|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|patricck: normally the right play with this holding is to run the 10@S, but it is quite a close call. If you can only lead once because you only have one entry then the correct play is small ...|pg||
nt|patricck: to the K@S|pg||
nt|psridhar: even 3s is conservative in my opinion ...he just needs QJXXX in spd and out for game to make|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: this shd produce the first swing of the match...|pg||
pc|s5|nt|psridhar: the std auction in other room will locate the spd fit at 1 lev and dhampur shd gain a partial here|pg||
nt|brolucius: East not only bid 4@S (over 3NT) at the other table, but persisted to 5@S.|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sJ|nt|panja: they played in 2@S|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Nice and simple|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|drkvas: hi all this is a test run for the feast tommorow|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|nt|sharkey: S elected to open 1 NT with his semi balanced hand and looks like he's be reaping the benefits|pg||
nt|sharkey: Unless W can make 4 @H tricks|pg||
nt|psridhar: he can i thk|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - think so|pg||
nt|psridhar: the h length in N is a liability|pg||
nt|patricck: North gets endplayed twice|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h6|nt|drkvas: tom q n semi live n suday finals live a great weekend ahead for all indian bridge lovers|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|psridhar: he now needs h to be 3-3 and they r not|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: play out of turn - will claim at the end and update score|pg||
nt|psridhar: or 4 card h to hold 3 dia with dia king in finesse--that also is not the case|pg||
nt|patricck: when South wins 3rd heart, must switch to a club after cashing 1@S to get 2 down.... difficult, but worth an extra imp|pg||
mc|9|nt|Walddk6: I am not impressed with the way they played the hearts|pg||
nt|psridhar: is this real?|pg||
nt|patricck: declarer is perhaps lucky that the J@D is onside so still only down 1....I would have been tempted to cash for 6 tricks when the Q@C took a trick|pg||
nt|Walddk6: And I don't know how many tricks they missed now|pg||
nt|Walddk6: About 1 million|pg||

nt|panja: 4@S is on guess here....|pg||
nt|panja: on B4|pg||
nt|psridhar: only declarer had to take care not to hand any ruff to N|pg||
nt|sharkey: we'll never know...|pg||
nt|sharkey: Another slam|pg||
nt|patricck: 6@C is quite a good spot|pg||
nt|brolucius: Without a spade return, declarer had time to set up enough heart tricks for the contract.|pg||
nt|psridhar: there is really no reason for not returning pd's suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@S for e/w looks normal|pg||

nt|sharkey: NS has an excellent sac in @H|pg||
nt|psridhar: but getting there is the fun|pg||
nt|brolucius: No. He had three diamonds, three clubs (with two finesses) two hearts and the @SA.|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|nt|psridhar: hi drvas|pg||
nt|panja: on @D lead A and ruff and @HA and @D?|pg||
nt|patricck: yes par appears to be 500 to EW from 6@H doubled|pg||
nt|sharkey: EW playing Standard or strong @C?|pg||
nt|psridhar: std|pg||

mb|p|nt|panja: if E has @ST, decl must ruff with 9|pg||
nt|sharkey: I like 4@H with North's hand - jam the bidding|pg||
mb|3C|nt|patricck: same mistake I made....North is short of diamonds, not South|pg||
nt|Walddk6: I like to double with the South cards and play ELC. 2@D overcall could well have lost spades|pg||
nt|panja: y|pg||
nt|psridhar: E has to read this 4d as natural and support clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: Passing 1S on that N hand doesnt seem dafe to me|pg||
nt|psridhar: 1h will work when there is h fit ...but here it loses spds|pg||

nt|psridhar: safe |pg||
nt|brolucius: Was that 'daft' or 'safe'?|pg||

nt|psridhar: safe |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk6: ELC = Equal Level Conversion|pg||
mb|3H|nt|psridhar: Mango had their share of slam luck in first session when they landed a grand dropping doubleton Q of trumps in an 8 card fit|pg||
nt|psridhar: i was abt to say that Roland-2D on that moth eaten suit opp a passed hand is not my fav-the take out X is more flex and brings spd into pic|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, I like double rather than 2@D as well, but close decision, would not criticise 2@D|pg||
nt|panja: better still, why not overcall 1@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk6: http://www.bridgeguys.com/EGlossary/EqualLevelConversion.html|pg||
nt|panja: with a structure to handle 4-card overcalls..of course|pg||
nt|sharkey: No - @D breaking bad and communications problem|pg||
nt|psridhar: i expect 6s will go down|pg||
nt|psridhar: h lead taps dummy|pg||
nt|panja: hi all|pg||
nt|panja: 6@C might have been better, I guess|pg||
nt|patricck: definitely|pg||
mb|3N|nt|patricck: 1@S is ok when you find a spde fit, but it makes some auctions very awkward later|pg||
nt|sharkey: I'm not sure I agree with 4@S - 5 points and 6 card suit.|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: 3H is probably Kushari's last game try|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i suppose Sridhar that you are treating the weak @H suit as a 4 carder and the @S suit as a 4 carder :)|pg||
nt|patricck: that is true, double is tempting, but nothing really wrong with 1@H either... because of the @H987 I go with the 1@H call but double very close 2nd choice|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: South will be sqeezed on the play of @D and this cud make|pg||
pc|s4|nt|psridhar: other room ahs saved in 5c --500?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: squeezed|pg||
nt|psridhar: when pd has a weak hand as here it doesnt matter...but if he has values to compete for part score the X will enable him in my opinion|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|nt|patricck: on this lead South might just continue spades anyway|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|sharkey: With @D 3-3 and trumps 3-2 this wud make|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|pc|s2|nt|Walddk6: ELC solves all probs. If partner responds diamonds or spades, all is fine, and if you get (the more likely) 2@C, you convert to 2@D to show diamonds and spades|pg||
nt|psridhar: nice 9 of spd by decl|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|s5|pc|c5|pg||
nt|psridhar: perhaps a consolation 2 imp to mango here..but Railways are taking all big swings|pg||
nt|patricck: If you overcall 1@S and partner bids 2@C what do you do? Bid 2@D and see partner bid 2@S with a doubleton?|pg||
nt|panja: not all, some, perhaps, many|pg||
nt|panja: for one, if W bids 2@h or 3@H, with Club length....what shd partner do?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|brolucius: Ten easy tricks, once the club lead saves any problem in that suit.|pg||
nt|patricck: but a suspicious @S9 given South knows that partner has a 5 card suit|pg||
nt|psridhar: 9 tricks and wd|pg||
pc|dT|nt|panja: it solves problems if W passes, most of them, let us say|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d4|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i suppose a @H was led in the closed room to take 3 nt down|pg||
nt|psridhar: having decided not to lead Pd's suit , N might hv considered leading clubs|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: true Sridhar|pg||

nt|sharkey: W places pd with a GOOD 6 card suit here and jumps to 6@S - dont think W at fault here|pg||
nt|panja: y, more interesting question is, how can E show @CQ to 3, and @SK to 6?|pg||
nt|psridhar: If E had passed 4H as he should..how would the auction proceed? W to bal with 4NT?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Mind you, with declarer playing the @CQ from dummy (which was not at all a good idea), he might still have lost two club tricks.|pg||
nt|psridhar: the theory of leading long suits is based on defense gaining tempo 3 times so that u can set up your long suit; but when declarer threatens to run a long suit of his own defense ...|pg||
nt|psridhar: has to look for QUICK tricks|pg||
mb|1C|nt|psridhar: this one is a lock :)|pg||
nt|panja: South is Sanjay Damle, N is Raju Gulavani, W is Kamal Mukherjee...|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: any 5-1 @H break except singleton Ace would have beaten it|pg||
nt|psridhar: the stiff h is the ace so...|pg||
mb|1H|nt|patricck: Nice distributional 4@S contract, makes even with a spade misguess|pg||
nt|roswolf: west needs to restrain himself|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: like here East shd lead a @S even if he had 1 less @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: hard for EW to bid 6@C against this start|pg||
nt|psridhar: over 1h W found a fitshowing jump to 2s in other room-it was easy to reach 4s thereafter|pg||
nt|sharkey: not sure - if E passes W wud bid 5@D and E wud prefer to 6@C?|pg||
nt|psridhar: or 5d emphasising minor 2 suitor? 6-5|pg||
nt|patricck: avoiding 5@D is the thing here|pg||
nt|psridhar: so the railways lead was short lived|pg||
mb|1N|nt|psridhar: true ..a typical alok sadhu 1H has EW in totters..|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Looks like 6@H doesn't quite fetch|pg||
nt|panja: 9-card fit on both sides......9=19 tricks though, 1 extra|pg||
mb|3N|nt|psridhar: wait ..but his pd has taken him seriously giving EW another bite at the cherry|pg||
nt|brolucius: I was reading some 1955 US bridge magazines while on holiday. They would not have agreed with South's 'free bid' of 1@S on such limited values. Of course we know better nowadays.|pg||
nt|psridhar: 8 card suits are difficult to restrain :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: a preemptive 3h instead of 2h might hv quietened E|pg||
nt|psridhar: a bid of 5D will commit to slam almost|pg||
nt|sharkey: Think I wud bid 5@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would have re-opened as south|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Unless you peek, of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: other room in 5H X|pg||

pc|s9|nt|patricck: trump lead is best|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The defence needs to be a little careful|pg||
nt|patricck: vg, 3NT is no trouble|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: how to best play the @D suit here ?|pg||
nt|patricck: best not to play @D|pg||
nt|patricck: needing 3 extra tricks, you need the clubs anyway|pg||
nt|psridhar: declarer will first test clubs and lose an entry to dummy in the process|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||

nt|patricck: quite surprising that North had no red card for 4@D|pg||

nt|sharkey: I wudnt Dbl with North's hand at IMPs|pg||

pc|c3|pg||
nt|panja: a first time 3@H by N might have solved this problem...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Must cash their side tricks now|pg||
pc|c5|nt|bjacobs: Well if North takes his own advice and leads a club, this will no doubt go down|pg||
nt|psridhar: and declarer has voluntarily forfeited the spd entry as well at trcik1|pg||
pc|cT|nt|bjacobs: Oh, not to worry - E/W have gone bananas.  And there is no miracle, like there was on board 1|pg||

pc|cK|nt|bjacobs: Presumably, N/S are concerned about a hesitation, but it's not going to matter to them in the end|pg||
nt|patricck: when partner opened 1NT and you are sitting over the dimaond bidder with Kxx?|pg||
nt|panja: not a good beginning at trick two, I guess @S would have been better|pg||
nt|Walddk2: done|pg||
pc|h6|nt|patricck: too late|pg||

pc|c6|nt|patricck: escapes for 1 down this time, but that is when partner had a signleton diamond|pg||
nt|psridhar: true|pg||

pc|c9|nt|patricck: -500 is surely some imps for Mango, maybe a lot if they can bid slam in the CR|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: wasn't a safety play in @C better ?|pg||
nt|psridhar: he needed 4 cl tricks sunil|pg||
nt|psridhar: 5 sry|pg||

nt|psridhar: +100 to NS ..somehow i get the feeling it is not enuf|pg||
pc|h5|nt|patricck: yes, that would have been bad too, would need K@D, Q@D overtaken with A@D and a ruff to beat it if east had played A@C|pg||

nt|patricck: but when partner opens 1NT in 3rd seat should you be worried about him taking liberties?|pg||
nt|psridhar: now this south is all hearts ...i wonder if sumit will be tempted to open 1N|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: 4@S is a bit high.....it should end in partial in this room|pg||
mb|1N|nt|patricck: It wasn't a terrible contract tho, needed a club honour onside, and perhaps a 3-2 trump break|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: 14 imps then....some light at the end of the tunnel for Mango, but is there a train coming? :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes 4-4-41 hands dont play well -though they hv huge defense potential ...in general|pg||
nt|panja: there, the liberty was with distribution...|pg||
nt|psridhar: he is lucky his pd is abt to bid H |pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|psridhar: no Pat they hv saved 6D-result depends on lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: Would S bid 4@H if N Dbl 4@D?|pg||
nt|patricck: perhaps we should call 15-17 with anything even close to balanced the Indian No Trump?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|bjacobs: West would like to give 2@D the treatment, but maybe double is not for penalties|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: indeed there was a liberty being taken, but should the possibility affect North's decision when it was a 1NT opener?|pg||
nt|panja: not perhaps, but if E held singleton, 4@D might make..|pg||
nt|roswolf: well the fit is found|pg||
nt|roswolf: surely north will desist from bidding on|pg||
nt|brolucius: Standard bidding is unsatisfactory here. South can force with 3@H when he is really strong but then North does not know whether his partner has 4 or 5 hearts. Some players use 2@C ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: as artificial facing the 1NT response.|pg||
mb|3C|nt|Walddk6: 2@D is probably a sound heart raise, although I don't think he has one. 2@H is enough|pg||
nt|Walddk6: 9 count  4333|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: but double digit swing yes|pg||
nt|patricck: agreed|pg||
nt|psridhar: over the X they play 2h as bad raise and 2d as normal raise...but i agree it can be construed as bad raise|pg||
nt|panja: five honour cards in 9 HCP....not all useful for a @H contract...but here, because @CA is with South, most cards will pull their full weight|pg||
nt|panja: @S singleton, that is|pg||
mb|3H|an| |nt|bjacobs: East certainly thinks it's not for penalties.  And I agree|pg||
nt|psridhar: 11 imp|pg||
nt|psridhar: so make that 30 imp to get in 5 bds|pg||
nt|psridhar: plus KQ doubleton falling|pg||
nt|psridhar: diamonds|pg||
nt|sharkey: No liberties taken at this board - yet...|pg||
nt|panja: 3Nt on finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: y|pg||
nt|patricck: If east had a singleton spade then South would have AKxx, which would be difficult to ruff out completely|pg||
nt|panja: AKxx or AQxx..|pg||
nt|psridhar: 1H-4d-4h wd hv been easy-now 1nt opg may well propel them higher|pg||
nt|psridhar: but Sumit's sensible 2H will help|pg||
nt|patricck: Although I have no disagreement with this hand we have seen some very odd 1NT's in this competition|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|Walddk6: I can understand Sanjay's 4@S. He is hoping for a double fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk6: But as they play Precision, he can get something like this|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, Kxxx of the opponents suit is a disappointment|pg||
nt|psridhar: but i guess their 1D does not promise dia Roland|pg||
nt|panja: the 1@D is amorphous, must not count it as showing @D length|pg||
nt|Walddk6: read above|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Amazing what chaos resulted from that little 2@D bid|pg||
nt|psridhar: this flat 3nt wont do the Magoes any good in their 30 imp pursuit|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|nt|Walddk6: "hoping" not "counting"|pg||
nt|panja: instead of the 4@S jump, a 3@H bid would have been better....|pg||
nt|panja: y, Roland, noticed the hope word now...|pg||
nt|panja: N could well have @CK instead of @HK, or, perhaps, some other minor honours...that would be good for 4@S|pg||
nt|panja: but there often is more of totalitarian bridge, rather than egalitarian...as I like to put it|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|patricck: very true, still about 30 imps, but only 4 boards|pg||
nt|panja: or, in worst case, KQxx|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Of course the 2@D bid has worked both ways.  In fact what normally looks like a cold 4@H is somewhat less cold when North shows the diamonds|pg||

nt|psridhar: 3nt vs 4s on bal hands is a perennial issue-here 3nt scores|pg||
nt|patricck: 3NT might have some chances here, but difficult to bid after the 4 card @H ovecall|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: At the other table North went four down vulnerable in 3NT (after a very strange auction) on the deal where we saw West goings one down in 3@D on his eight-card suit.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Walddk2: This way you can bid non-forcing 3@H and 3@S|pg||
mb|3N|nt|psridhar: 3C= nf in H as opposed to direct 3h which wd be F perhaps|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's anyone's guess why West passed that hand in 1st seat|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: great|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: any reason to pull the first tump from a particular side here?|pg||
nt|sharkey: When I try 2@S on such cards it usually means +800|pg||
nt|sharkey: to opps...|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: but the Laltu conversion will lead to a flat bd|pg||
pc|d4|nt|brolucius: West might have rebid 3@D instead on the basis that diamonds would still play well if partner had club support.|pg||

nt|panja: I would need a bulletproof jacket before I even think of 2@S|pg||
pc|sA|nt|psridhar: Carl- all the bds this segment - the bidding has one underlying assumption " they wont X for cash" - the point that Pat was making|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|sharkey: Certainly got EW off to the best lead|pg||

mb|2N|nt|psridhar: it certainly works well over unusual 2nt showing minors |pg||
nt|roswolf: 15 imps in 4 bds is not insurmountable|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: You could play 2@H as showing the minors, with clubs equal or greater than diamonds; 2@S shows longer diamonds (after the Landy bid)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H heart stop, no spade stop. 2@S spade stop, no heart stop. NT stops in both majors. That's one way of playing it|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: i hear that slam on bd 27 made because when a dia was played off the tbl S played 2 cards -the ACE and 9 of dia- the 9 was visible so diro ruled it in|pg||

nt|psridhar: anybody's match from here|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i favour railways because of their lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: they won't need to|pg||
nt|psridhar: 1. Dia ace was the setting trcik|pg||
nt|panja: @D better..with the 54 fit....easier to remove trumps and take your discards...|pg||
nt|patricck: indeed, I was looking at that, but perhaps the strong intermediate cards and 5 card @D make it too good for 1NT :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: 2nt is certainly ambitious pushing for a NV game|pg||
pc|c6|nt|psridhar: coming to Bd 19 and N's controvertial 1D response...other room got to 3nt EW-let us see if it is a success|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w on the way|pg||
nt|psridhar: w is worth a 3d here|pg||
nt|brolucius: West should not go too high now. His partner is a passed hand.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|bjacobs: This is the same position as the CR.  They took their spade ruff, but failed to cash the diamond tricks|pg||
nt|panja: but 2 IMP difference for a @S contract|pg||
nt|psridhar: he will survive if he gets dia rt|pg||
pc|cT|nt|roswolf: at the score a strange decision by west|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes |pg||
nt|brolucius: A minor-suit game, on a 4-4 fit, needs good values. I think West's pass was correct.|pg||
nt|psridhar: it just may be the winning decn|pg||
nt|brolucius: East might have had more of his values in spades, where they would not have been productive.|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|psridhar: 4s fast arrival showing poor hand but cant stop N from slam|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dJ|nt|patricck: and indeed Sumit agrees with me on the valuation, hence the 2NT rebid|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bjacobs: They didn't get to first base in this room!|pg||

pc|c5|nt|sharkey: Think W shud Dbl 2nd time and correct 2@H to 2@S |pg||
pc|cA|nt|panja: Aces ask that does not tell much here|pg||
nt|panja: once N opens, the ! for finesse goes down...but is W right to bid so conservatively? is there an option? say a dbl of 1@D?|pg||
nt|brolucius: A trump back is best now, because West has a bundle of cards to ruff in the East hand. Yes, he has found the trump return.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|psridhar: defense has essentially done the same mistake here too|pg||
nt|psridhar: the diro should keep in mind that the expert defender is on play with setting trick vs a slam -bd 27|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d7|nt|bjacobs: I'm fairly sympathetic to this particular mistake|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Aloke probably felt that he didn't need to give partner a spade ruff|pg||
nt|psridhar: perhaps Dia king lead and THEN spd shift wd hv achieved|pg||
nt|psridhar: why Panja? he used ace ask as route to discover his pd's trump Q|pg||
nt|panja: well...the ace answer did not tell much..|pg||
nt|panja: I am trying to make out the meaning of further bids..|pg||
nt|panja: 5@D, what was it?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bjacobs: Yes, the diamond lead makes it all so much simpler|pg||

nt|psridhar: Bill thats a cruel thought :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: 2d=nat with 5-7 i guess|pg||
nt|psridhar: i wd suggest u play 2S as strong/intermediate Jump overcall-both oppo hv bid and no purpose in WJO|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok 2 imps only|pg||
nt|psridhar: 3 to go and 13 imp to recover|pg||
nt|psridhar: exciting|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|bjacobs: I bet it happens|pg||
nt|psridhar: i will be keen to know how they bid bd no 9|pg||
nt|panja: good idea, but still, some weak hands where you cannot afford a 2-level bid..|pg||
nt|sharkey: I like 2@S as weak NV - trying to jam their bidding.  |pg||
nt|psridhar: what the doc ordered for the trailing team|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: east passing would produce later fireworks|pg||
mb|2S|nt|psridhar: Laltu may but in 3d and ..regret|pg||
nt|panja: B10...@H guess would be the interesting point....for an OT only though|pg||
nt|panja: will have to be handled with 1@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: the @S suit will win the bidding battle|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: It's up to East now ... he has a diamond stopper, but he's the one looking at the club void|pg||
nt|panja: nine easy tricks here on favourable @SKQ position|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bjacobs: It's still very tough to expect him to pass this|pg||
nt|psridhar: i hear Dhampur didnt bid the slam on bd 9-- means we have a new leader in the match|pg||
nt|psridhar: for the 2nd time this match the Rlwys lead is short lived|pg||
nt|patricck: Ashok's 3@D was successful in the Closed Room, but do we agree with it?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and gain imps here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i would not bid 3@D pAT|pg||
nt|psridhar: 4-3-3-3 and weak suit--only thing going for that 3d is it made|pg||
nt|patricck: just imagine how ugly 3@D would have been if North was the other way around in the minors|pg||
pc|c5|nt|psridhar: well done|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think that's a fantastic pass|pg||
nt|panja: but can make 10th in @H, play AK and back|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt a crude instrument|pg||
nt|brolucius: @DQ lead and South will know he has to try hearts when he wins at Trick 1.|pg||
nt|psridhar: tricky defense though top tricks|pg||
nt|psridhar: dia queen led and ducked will do for CVRAO|pg||
nt|roswolf: ace of hearts my choice|pg||
pc|c8|nt|panja: they stop in 3@H......primarily because the secondary @D fit was not unearthed|pg||
nt|brolucius: @H10 my choice.|pg||
nt|psridhar: gud lead wd|pg||
nt|roswolf: the  10 is murky|pg||
nt|brolucius: West might have @HQ-x-x.|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Now it's up to Aloke to make it|pg||
nt|patricck: There needs to be a big swing to Mango on this board to make an appeal relevant.... I just can't see that happening|pg||
nt|patricck: I guess we were just assuming they would bid game|pg||

pc|s3|pc|sJ|nt|psridhar: defending 2D X with a club void is a nightmare|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|psridhar: yes i agree -Railways have sewed this one up|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: very fast play...missed tricks.....will update score|pg||
nt|panja: 2/1 or sayc?|pg||

nt|psridhar: thx all gl to railways in semifinal-c u all at 1500 hrs IST|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: scores updated|pg||
nt|patricck: and you would expect to make 9 tricks with a combined 29 count, the surprise may be that there are only 9|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|s9|nt|panja: you get 2@D rebid in 2/1, and that might propel N to a stronger invite..|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pc|s4|nt|panja: but of course, it could also be just 1@H 2@H|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|psridhar: Bill -pl note the auction was identical in other room-- kudos to indian bridge judgement? ;)|pg||
nt|patricck: can make a 10th in @H yes, but will probably play on @D|pg||

nt|vugraphzwu: gr8|pg||
nt|panja: the problem...is..their 1@H rebid is artificial..as in last hand|pg||
nt|panja: therefore, with 16 and @H suit, they would often prefer to open 1@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: that settles it with game making n the other room|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|brolucius: @DQ led to the ace at the other table and South (who had apparently not noticed dummy's clubs) returned a diamond!|pg||

mb|3D|nt|psridhar: i do not have scores of other semifinal sorry|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: multiple conn. failure to server|pg||
mb|d|nt|brolucius: Declarer was marked with the @DK by the @DQ lead and the game was cold if he also held the @HA, so South had a 100% switch to hearts.|pg||

mb|3S|nt|panja: will 4@S make here on @D lead? B23|pg||

nt|patricck: correct|pg||
nt|panja: true...so the idea does not have that essential symmetry|pg||
nt|panja: will have to finesse @H and discard two Clubs|pg||
