pc|dJ|nt|Walddk2: The Israeli team for the European Championships this summer: Barel-Zack and the two pairs playing in the other room, I and O Herbst, Pachtman-Ginossar|pg||
nt|daman: coffee laced with rum maybe|pg||

nt|reisig: Hi Hedy :)  |pg||
nt|daman: Hey Rich|pg||
nt|reisig: Hiya George :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@S was a strnage rebid. Lengy felt he was too good for 2@C and not strong enough for 2@D, so he found a compromise|pg||

nt|henryb: perhaps 1N is the best opening bid?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|hedyg: close in any case|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|henryb: stiff queen is a better stopper than two small|pg||
nt|hedyg: especially opposite K109x :p|pg||
nt|Walddk2: One spectator thinks Lengy has a club among his spades|pg||
nt|daman: just ebough risk in this contract to make it interesting|pg||
nt|roswolf: on this layout the contract is cold|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Just like here|pg||

nt|roswolf: was London cold enough for you Roland?|pg||

nt|henryb: problem with being too clever|pg||
nt|hedyg: ofc Barel thinks the 10@s is in S|pg||
nt|daman: so much for the coffee hand|pg||

nt|roswolf: so did i - but bridge3 has its mysteries too|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Should be obvious to Barel by now that the last trump is in partner's hand|pg||
nt|daman: he should get this right  no?   otherwise S would be claiming|pg||
nt|hedyg: why?|pg||
nt|roswolf: eadst should ruff on general principles|pg||

nt|daman: I would have passed|pg||
nt|reisig: Not for me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I open|pg||
nt|roswolf: i agree henry |pg||
nt|hedyg: i would have passed quickly|pg||
nt|daman: you're in the considerable minority Roland|pg||
nt|daman: why would you open?|pg||
nt|hedyg: he is used to it :p|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would open 1@D even if I had 2@D available as weak with diamonds|pg||
nt|henryb: well, you do have a full house, and a straight flush, so I guess it might qualify in Las Vegas|pg||
nt|hedyg: for poker, yes|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Because my weak 2's are not Acol 2's, like in North America|pg||
nt|daman: the hand's a 'tweener'    in between a one @D opening and a weak 2 @D    Al Roth would have opened it 2@D|pg||
mb|3D|nt|hedyg: what now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: I look at all that quackery and say that is an opening for medicine men|pg||
nt|roswolf: north might pass|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|daman: Roland    a Medicine Man?|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: as predicted n/s are in danger of going on tilt|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't like Bareket's approach at all, because 3@S is forcing when preceded by double. Bid 3@S over 3@C like Ophir did in the other room|pg||
nt|daman: now    they will roll this home |pg||
nt|reisig: Might lead @c ace|pg||
nt|daman: perhaps|pg||

nt|roswolf: it should still go off but very possible to slip through|pg||
nt|roswolf: a minor suit is necessary|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As a spec points out, 3NT is cold for E-W, but most anything is possible to bid double dummy|pg||

pc|h9|nt|henryb: While we are watching the slow development of this hand, a question: What do you all think is the difference between these auctions:|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||
nt|henryb: 3@d - X - P - 5@c and 3@d - X - P - 4@d - P - 4@h - P - 5@c|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The second stronger. A direct 5@C could be just a bunch of clubs|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h7|pc|h4|pc|hK|pg||
nt|hedyg: orrrrrr the 2nd version could be cuebid and fit @H with a void in @D|pg||

nt|sybarra: real quacky |pg||
nt|othered1: the 2@C bid may induce north to back off a bit|pg||
nt|april7: N might end up in 4@S with a very bad result|pg||
nt|othered1: Your call on north's hand?  Looks very tough to me|pg||
nt|vugraphzbs: hi all welc back|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder if in their methods the free 2@D bid denied 4@H?|pg||
nt|april7: 3@S might be ok!|pg||
nt|othered1: or some number of @S|pg||

nt|othered1: East is now sort of endplayed|pg||
nt|april7: why did W take the ace of @D instead of K? E could now issue with the @D instead of @S,other leads are very bad|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|april7: only @D breaks the contract|pg||
nt|othered1: @D lets north ruff (if west covers) take 2@S ending in dummy and losing no @H|pg||
nt|sybarra: now can hop the ace of @S and hook the spade |pg||
nt|sybarra: losing only the @H |pg||

nt|Walddk2: 3NT was a practical bid by Ilan Herbst|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe you can make 4@H double dummy|pg||
nt|roswolf: but north should have transferred to his major|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not so sure about that, Geoff|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: No-one knows what 3NT is based upon|pg||
nt|hedyg: should he really with all those @ss?|pg||
nt|daman: whoooops|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|reisig: Off we go....into the wild ...etc|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What if 3NT is   Axx  void  Axx  AKJ10xxx     then 4@H is the wrong spot|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: i would also think my pd has more than this when he bids 2@H vulnerable over multi 2@d|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dQ|pc|d8|pc|d6|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed but i reckon the odds favour the suit bid since a doubleton trump is often found in dummy and certainly 1|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's not altogether impossible that he makes this|pg||
nt|roswolf: they seem to have landed on their feet here since i cant see an easy way to take the third defensive trick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He will lose a trump, yes, but other than that?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk2: He has to take the C finesse, but that is with the odds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A direct finesse that is, not a ruffing finesse|pg||
nt|roswolf: basically the club finesse comes to declarer's rescue|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d3|pc|d5|pg||
nt|hedyg: he needs to get to hand for that|pg||
nt|Walddk2: a heart|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Or he can play for @HJ to be an entry |pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|c7|pc|c4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's what he is doing|pg||
nt|hedyg: this works too with @H as entry to dummy|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|h3|nt|hedyg: sry Roland :(|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|h4|nt|reisig: well done|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed, but is it best?|pg||
nt|hedyg: well this works with Q@C either side and Q@H in E|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h9|pc|h8|pg||
nt|hedyg: with Q@H in W there would have been a @s ruff now|pg||

nt|henryb: Another case of SDAM (six diamonds always makes!)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: First, they are off two keycards for diamonds|pg||
nt|roswolf: after a strong NT they might well have a sniff at the slam|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The worst thing about this is that the team names are reversed on the scoreboard|pg||
nt|henryb: still, Roland, when you have an 11 card fit the trump K is not always relevant|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2D|nt|Walddk2: Itamar?|pg||
