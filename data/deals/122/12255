nt|psridhar: i am not very familiar about the NS pair- but CV RAO is a well known indian team having won several national titles|pg||
nt|Walddk6: A spectator suggests that this is the other semi-final|pg||
nt|Walddk6: CABAL vs Dhampur|pg||

nt|daman: Hi Ruzbeh|pg||
mb|p|nt|drkvas: hi guys|pg||
mb|2C|nt|psridhar: N hand ideal for a short suit trial bid|pg||
nt|psridhar: kind of splinter game try|pg||
nt|drkvas: u think ok with 3 trumps ps?|pg||
nt|psridhar: N hand doc|pg||
nt|drkvas: ok r|pg||
nt|drkvas: but i think 2@s is misclick|pg||
nt|psridhar: yeah too strong for a simple raise|pg||
nt|patricck: welcome everyone|pg||
nt|patricck: Are NS playing inverted major raises?|pg||
nt|patricck: It appears the other table has been renamed, do we do the same here?|pg||
nt|patricck: Welcome Sunil|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: i have played against Ashok goel and kamal mukh all my life :)  they belong to dhampur|pg||

nt|Walddk6: Operator, please shut down and reconnect to the other room|pg||
nt|Walddk6: The other operator realised the error and has opened a new broadcast|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: this is the final of the Ruia trophy... the symbol of supremacy in Indian bridge|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sunsamvar: Hello Patrick|pg||
nt|psridhar: if he had overcalled 2c instead of 1nt Sumit might hv raised with ACE and 4 trumps-then 3nt easy|pg||
nt|rv: Hi all wlc back for this 3rd segment of finals for Ruia trophy|pg||
nt|psridhar: hi |pg||
nt|daman: hopefully they won't wander off into a 4-3 major suit fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk6: Best to do it now|pg||
nt|psridhar: i think this match is Dhampur Vs cabal|pg||
nt|drkvas: hi all|pg||
nt|daman: Howdy|pg||
mb|2N|nt|bjacobs: The challenge is to stay out of the poor grand slam - even though it happens to make|pg||
nt|Walddk6: but ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: in the other match cabal leads dhampur by 10 IMP's|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: This final looks as if it is going down to the wire.... hang on to your seats|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: yes it is dhampur vs cabal|pg||
nt|Walddk6: The team names are now reversed :(|pg||
nt|panja: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Hi Panja|pg||
nt|psridhar: cabal is a team from Mumbai|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Rehi all|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk6: Welcome to Carl Mathiesen from Norway|pg||
nt|psridhar: hi Sunil|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: Good Morning Roland, hi all|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, Dhampur is the EW pair, they should be in mauve|pg||
nt|patricck: South will have no trouble finding the right lead if EW get overboard, but I don't anticipate that|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: the defence will need to be careful here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Hi Sridhar|pg||
nt|psridhar: 7 card suit with 6 controls...i dont think 1Nt did justice to that holding|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: scores were changed after an appeal|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: the scores showing up are right|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: Hello Sridhar, George and Srini|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|psridhar: touch and go.. d1 at most|pg||
nt|panja: it is good to see Sanjay Damle playing in semis...(South)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i dont think they will overreach as they lck the @H control|pg||
nt|rv: Rail playing pairs in rotation, Sumit-Laltu sitting out this set|pg||
pc|c4|nt|psridhar: key point of partnership understdg here is - what is diff between direct 3s over 2s and 3s via 2nt-since 2s is 6 cards 99% of the time|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|sharkey: Good afternoon|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|drkvas: yes now the ball is rolling nicely|pg||
nt|psridhar: 4H is pushy with the 'wasted' dia queen ...but i guess the stiff H makes up for it|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: error corrected|pg||
nt|patricck: 4@H would have been a splinter, enabled North to assess correctly to drive to slam|pg||
nt|psridhar: i hear other room also in 6s|pg||
nt|rv: DSM playing same pairs as last set, Kushari-Bhabesh and Kamal-Ashok|pg||
nt|rv: Souren and Uttam not playing much|pg||
pc|hK|nt|drkvas: u have sharp ears ps|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Hi Sridhar|pg||
nt|psridhar: i thk via 2nt shd suggest 3nt and 4s while direct 3s shd actively propel towards a spd contract|pg||
nt|psridhar: hi Sunil |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i think u thk right Sridhar :)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|psridhar: gud lead-makes life tough for declarer-other room led dia ACE|pg||
pc|h3|nt|r_tibre: DSM in 3D in the CR|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Can you tell us who won the appeal and the IMP impact Raja|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bjacobs: No justice|pg||
nt|psridhar: i hv placed an agent there doc :)|pg||
nt|panja: he trained a lot of young people in 70's and 80's, under United Bridge Association|pg||
nt|psridhar: if declarer had played a LOW club W might hv ducked and entry to dummy to play dia|pg||
pc|h8|nt|drkvas: 11 tricks|pg||

nt|r_tibre: hi RV|pg||
nt|psridhar: Kushari has played all 4 sets this final|pg||
nt|drkvas: rail won 7 imps|pg||
nt|tcpant: Yes he is supposed to be the main trump card of DSM|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|nt|drkvas: 6 sry|pg||
pc|h9|nt|rv: Hi Rajesh and all specs|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cT|nt|panja: a few years ago, he was very unwell, but has now recovered...|pg||
nt|psridhar: in other words one can raise 2s to 3s even on a doubleton if he has a SUIT ORIENTED hand-say KX,XX,AXXX,KQXXX|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s2|pg||
nt|sharkey: Is this the last 12 boards of this match?|pg||
nt|patricck: rehi everyone, got distracted there, hope I haven't missed much|pg||

nt|vugraphzwu: one more round|pg||

nt|patricck: yes, unlikely to make now|pg||

nt|psridhar: wd banerjee|pg||
nt|psridhar: declarer might hv played dia b4 h ruff since he was planning to ruff only one h|pg||
nt|Walddk6: This is better|pg||
nt|psridhar: it was the first deal Pat didnt miss any :)|pg||
nt|rv: defense was less than perfect, it was better for Kushari to overtake @hQ and concede a trick to Manas's @HJ|pg||
nt|rv: Bhabesh's lead of @HQ asked partner to unblock or show count|pg||
nt|tcpant: The appeal was on which board and what was the impact... Ruzbeh if u can pl |pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: checking|pg||
mb|1N|nt|psridhar: hi all|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: E/W may bid to 3 nt and go down here|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: that would be a better line|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: thanks for the heads up|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello to P Sridhar and David Bird|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Hi to the kibitzers!|pg||
nt|brolucius: Holding the spades, North may risk an opening in the 4th seat.|pg||
nt|psridhar: THAT is a tough decision in 4th seat|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@D, to put up some sort of barrier.|pg||
nt|psridhar: 14 spear points|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, a question of whether West bids game or invites|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: talk of controls... Laltu seems to be getting a load of them|pg||
nt|sga1: Hi, there was a pause by Ashok before bidding 3@h after P-P-1@h-X-2N and Kamal bid 4@h|pg||
nt|daman: no need for North to get too ambitious|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: board 9|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: railways got 6 IMPs for that|pg||
mb|3H|nt|psridhar: i guess i will cash it|pg||
nt|brolucius: One of the less memorable auctions of the match.|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: 6s is a reasonable contract but fails on the 4-1 trump break|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i cant believe Kushari passed |pg||
nt|tcpant: Thanks a lot for the information|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: he is known for bidding a lot more with a lot less :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: 3H is tech rt|pg||
nt|drkvas: 3@h makes on the nose|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|patricck: 4-3-3-3 and poor intermediate cards, I invite|pg||
nt|rv: Manas will Invite|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sharkey: Don't know if NS can find 6@C here - moste likely 3 NT|pg||
nt|psridhar: If S leads a club Kushari may swing it in|pg||
nt|psridhar: this time he shows his appreciation of the controls by a gf leap to 3c -quite right|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sunsamvar: well stopped|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sunsamvar: they decide not to stretch for the nonvul game|pg||
nt|psridhar: here 4D over 3s -slam try in spd- is in order yes i agree with him|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|patricck: even 2NT is not certain|pg||
nt|daman: he should have ducked|pg||
pc|hK|nt|psridhar: 3 aces to lose and 4-1 trump to handle ...but i expect he will make it|pg||
nt|patricck: 4@H could have been beaten with a @S ruff, but I don't think 4@S can be beaten|pg||
nt|patricck: that solves the problem for declarer in the @C suit|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: is it a good idea to cuebid shortness in ptners main suit ?|pg||
nt|psridhar: gud pt sunil but he has no other safe way to suggest slam|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: true|pg||
nt|psridhar: it cd well be last train|pg||
pc|hA|nt|patricck: 6@C can make, but not a very good contract|pg||
nt|sharkey: 6@C hinges on finding the @DQ|pg||
nt|psridhar: this will result in 3nt -but say South has AXX,XX,AJXX,AQXX -how will the bidding go? will he raise 3d to 4d?|pg||
nt|r_tibre: cards lying well for the aggression|pg||
pc|hT|nt|psridhar: he has 2 more jacks to guess|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree - and probably almost unbiddable|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, but needs a reasonable trump break before you get to that point|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes Patrick|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|patricck: a heart lead would have been best, but West made a reasonable choice on opening lead|pg||
nt|rv: all these players are regulars on BBO, their Ids are manas555 (Manas Mukherjee), banerjee (Amarnath Banerjee), Kushari (Pritish Kushari) and bhabesh (Bhabesh Saha)|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|nt|bjacobs: threatening lead|pg||
nt|psridhar: Perfect !  i admire this auction|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: well he cud hv confirmed the trump !Q|pg||
nt|rodal f: U mean: The operation was sucsessful, but the pasient died?|pg||
nt|psridhar: :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Hi Rodal|pg||
nt|rodal f: Just a visit. Sr.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: tough lead for north|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: what will you lead Sridhar and why ?|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: he wd hv if he were in 4|pg||
pc|c2|nt|psridhar: play to 2nt on h lead is similar to 3nt on cl lead :)|pg||
nt|daman: and hope for a mistake|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h2|nt|sunsamvar: a spec tells me " Sumit and laltu are two of the best student of Kushari "|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|nt|psridhar: there must be a way to diagnose that stiff facing AXX or AKX in the auction|pg||
pc|c3|nt|psridhar: after spd misguess E cd hv arranged a dia ruff for himself for d1|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|tcpant: Finally Uttam is there with Bhabesh Saha in CR.... against Sumit - Laltu|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|nt|rv: Manas is postponing the inevitable decision to finesse in trumps|pg||
nt|r_tibre: it pays to be aggressive opp std nt, when opps are playing str @C|pg||
nt|rv: he won't/can't postpone any further by playing a 3rd @d|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sunsamvar: MAYBE HE CAN ENDPLAY sUMIT|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|cT|nt|psridhar: other room in 4H and defense as suggested by Patrick is on right track|pg||
nt|psridhar: looks like early take off for railways !|pg||
nt|patricck: a @D back would have beaten it for sure with a @D ruff, but now declarer might make by guessing J@D|pg||
nt|psridhar: last dia squeezes S|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Sry for caps|pg||
pc|c6|pc|sJ|nt|sunsamvar: and so it may not be the same Sridhar|pg||
nt|patricck: two OF the best?  he has other students good enough to play in the Cup Final? :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: now spd ACE and h will endplay S|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Kushari is a Dada in Indian bridge Patrick|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes George...either @S continuation or @Ca wd have resulted in 10 tricks, |pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|nt|rv: strange line|pg||
nt|r_tibre: he played for @STx|pg||

nt|psridhar: in 4s|pg||
nt|roswolf: more action likely here|pg||
nt|r_tibre: are there whispering birds in the sky at the venue, rv?|pg||
nt|drkvas: 6@c makes can they reach|pg||
nt|psridhar: 3nt likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: Indian Railways have a phenominal record in the Ruia and have won the event many times in the past 10 years with more or less the same team.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|psridhar: that south hand is 1d opening for me|pg||
nt|brolucius: South judges his hand not worth a reverse (after a 1@D opening) and so shows his strength with a strong 1NT.  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: N-S have all the high cards, but E-W can make many spades|pg||
nt|patricck: too hard for Kushari to guess the winning play without any opposition bidding to guide him, so 1 down|pg||
nt|tcpant: Total Anti % play|pg||
nt|rv: I am sure Manas wouldn't be amused by the play and he would be glaring at Amarnath|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: i agree especially with that shape|pg||
mb|2H|nt|panja: precision 2@C opening|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@H Majors I assume - DONT?|pg||
nt|rv: Manas Mukherjee is an excellent playing captain for Indian Rail|pg||
nt|tcpant: Or it will be reverse... Amarnath glaring at Manas|pg||
nt|psridhar: 1n-2h-2s-3c-3nt-blink blink and pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: the NS hands fit nicely, can they bid the good game? it looks like it|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes ..leading to a precarious 4-2 fit|pg||
nt|patricck: reopening double?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Sumit and Laltu are comparitively recent additions to this consistent team|pg||
nt|rv: good afternoon Pantji|pg||
mb|2S|nt|psridhar: Sumit has done well to pass -many wd open 1s there|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How can East pass if 2@C shows the majors?|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: seems like a routine @S game...yes 6@S can be made, but not a good contract and won't be bid anyway|pg||
nt|psridhar: 6s off trump ace and queen is dicey|pg||
nt|psridhar: other room heading towards slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: again i agree|pg||
nt|brolucius: If you are playing Lebensohl, 3NT denies a spade stopper in one version. (You would travel via 2NT with a stopper).|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe 2@C was Astro-like, promising hearts and another, and then I can understand East's pass|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then he will think partner has hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Just goes to show that Astro is hopeless|pg||
mb|3C|nt|patricck: really, the winning play in trumps is possible, exciting stuff if they bid and make it|pg||
nt|psridhar: that 2nt bid has missed the spd fit|pg||
nt|patricck: no......2NT not an enquiry then?|pg||
nt|panja: and 2N won't make|pg||
nt|psridhar: Sanajy has gone for quanti auction in pref to the spd fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: if it went 2@C-2@D-2@H...I guess 2N would have been forcing....|pg||
nt|panja: so the structure forced him to guess the best response?|pg||
nt|patricck: how could it be by a passed hand?|pg||
nt|psridhar: i wonder what was 3C ..with  a doubleton h ..some misunderstdg i guess|pg||
nt|patricck: As long as NS lead spades sometime 4@H seems doomed|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: was 3@C a super acceptance showing short @C ?... can he do it with doubleton trumps ?|pg||
nt|patricck: 5@D might well make tho|pg||
nt|psridhar: from West's perspective his pd cd well hv held a weak hand with H..so crossing 2h without a fit seems unwise|pg||
mb|3N|nt|roswolf: with 5 spades he must have shown that suit as well - otherwise his defence to 1nt is wanting|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A defence to 1NT that does not have 2@C as *both* majors is not worth playing, full stop.|pg||
nt|psridhar: Or did he momentarily (mis) registered 2D as dia ..and ...?|pg||
nt|tcpant: Good Afternoon Venky.... |pg||
nt|r_tibre: keeps the match close, and the players awake :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk6: How can anything be forcing by a passed hand?|pg||
nt|psridhar: i think he did well to pass..a reopg X might hv given W a chance to smoke out 2s|pg||
nt|patricck: surely not|pg||
nt|tcpant: May be lunch effect for Manas|pg||
nt|rv: even with right @d guess, declarer has only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|rv: Pant saab, I think Amarnath played last 4@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar: sound conservative auction may earn them 13 if other room fails in slam|pg||
nt|sharkey: Same contract where NS would have landed if W passed....|pg||
nt|psridhar: if W had passed NS might hv declared 2H vul|pg||
nt|patricck: not the best lead from North, I wouldn't have thought there was a need to be that active on the lead|pg||
pc|h3|nt|brolucius: The club discard from dummy is puzzling. What use are the diamonds?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|vugraphzwu: yes|pg||
pc|hK|nt|panja: oh y, passed hand, true|pg||
nt|Walddk6: So if he wants to bid, 2@D must be it|pg||
nt|panja: or, then, 2@D might be passable here for them? passed hand?|pg||
nt|psridhar: u only need yr pd not to screw up|pg||
nt|psridhar: sorry prvt|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|psridhar: Yes - i hv played all my life Vs these players:)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|bjacobs: If the @H9 and @H10 were swapped - that was what North was hoping|pg||
pc|c4|nt|patricck: normally the right play with this holding is to run the 10@S, but it is quite a close call. If you can only lead once because you only have one entry then the correct play is small ...|pg||
nt|patricck: to the K@S|pg||
nt|psridhar: even 3s is conservative in my opinion ...he just needs QJXXX in spd and out for game to make|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: this shd produce the first swing of the match...|pg||
pc|cK|nt|psridhar: the std auction in other room will locate the spd fit at 1 lev and dhampur shd gain a partial here|pg||
nt|brolucius: East not only bid 4@S (over 3NT) at the other table, but persisted to 5@S.|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: this shd finish before we blink blink :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|panja: they played in 2@S|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Nice and simple|pg||
nt|r_tibre: declarer can always hope for defenders to return the favor|pg||
nt|r_tibre: but will be tough on this deal|pg||
nt|rv: no chance for this contract|pg||
pc|d2|nt|drkvas: hi all this is a test run for the feast tommorow|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|sharkey: S elected to open 1 NT with his semi balanced hand and looks like he's be reaping the benefits|pg||
nt|sharkey: Unless W can make 4 @H tricks|pg||
nt|psridhar: he can i thk|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - think so|pg||
nt|psridhar: the h length in N is a liability|pg||
nt|patricck: North gets endplayed twice|pg||
nt|tcpant: Oh yes RV... I thought Manas... but that's more strange as AN usually plays it with better % play|pg||
nt|tcpant: Other room also in 3NT|pg||
pc|c5|nt|drkvas: i liked the blinking part:)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rv: wlc Sridhar|pg||

nt|drkvas: tom q n semi live n suday finals live a great weekend ahead for all indian bridge lovers|pg||
nt|psridhar: hi all hi rv|pg||
nt|daman: keeps the match close for now|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d6|nt|psridhar: he now needs h to be 3-3 and they r not|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: play out of turn - will claim at the end and update score|pg||
nt|psridhar: or 4 card h to hold 3 dia with dia king in finesse--that also is not the case|pg||
nt|patricck: when South wins 3rd heart, must switch to a club after cashing 1@S to get 2 down.... difficult, but worth an extra imp|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk6: I am not impressed with the way they played the hearts|pg||
nt|psridhar: is this real?|pg||
nt|patricck: declarer is perhaps lucky that the J@D is onside so still only down 1....I would have been tempted to cash for 6 tricks when the Q@C took a trick|pg||
nt|Walddk6: And I don't know how many tricks they missed now|pg||
nt|Walddk6: About 1 million|pg||
nt|patricck: wow|pg||
nt|psridhar: lol|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|psridhar: 6s d1 other room so this match is all but over|pg||
pc|c8|nt|patricck: e.g. with singleton opposite KJ10xxxxx the right play once the first player has played small is King because that works with Ax or Axx onside, whereas small to the Jack only wins ...|pg||
nt|patricck: with Qx onside|pg||

nt|panja: on B4|pg||
nt|psridhar: only declarer had to take care not to hand any ruff to N|pg||
nt|sharkey: we'll never know...|pg||
nt|sharkey: Another slam|pg||
nt|patricck: 6@C is quite a good spot|pg||
nt|brolucius: Without a spade return, declarer had time to set up enough heart tricks for the contract.|pg||
nt|psridhar: there is really no reason for not returning pd's suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@S for e/w looks normal|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 5@D shd make here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: if South starts with the top 2 @S|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: power outage|pg||

nt|vugraphzwu: back in action|pg||
nt|psridhar: Sunil did u notice the 7 control pack with Laltu? :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Raiways must have lost the lead because they got unlucky with the decent salm on bd 17|pg||
nt|psridhar: i am tempted to re-start my fav topic ...the trends in dealing m/c !|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: he shd have been plg rubber bridge :) or tried his hand at Bollywood|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: what trends do the dealing m/c throw up ?|pg||
nt|psridhar: no uttam yet ? any problem rv?|pg||
nt|rv: this year we have witnessed nearly 150 teams for Ruia trophy, this has been extremely good response compared to recent years|pg||
nt|psridhar: i hear EW in closed hv reached 6c--gr8!|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and these ots may prove crucial in this close match|pg||
nt|daman: if they did    we have a new leader|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Uttam is riding his luck after satying out all day :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: 38 imps and 7 bds to go...|pg||
nt|drkvas: hi all|pg||
nt|psridhar: 6c is a decent prospect -odds on slam|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS has an excellent sac in @H|pg||
nt|psridhar: but getting there is the fun|pg||
nt|brolucius: No. He had three diamonds, three clubs (with two finesses) two hearts and the @SA.|pg||
nt|psridhar: what shd S bid over the 3rd seat 1D here? i vote for a take out X|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: it seems the 7 pack sold ot to the 7 carder :)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|rv: he didn't seem very happy when he was chatting with me last nite, not sure of internal team dynamics|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: staying|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: hi drvas|pg||
nt|panja: on @D lead A and ruff and @HA and @D?|pg||
nt|patricck: yes par appears to be 500 to EW from 6@H doubled|pg||
nt|sharkey: EW playing Standard or strong @C?|pg||
nt|psridhar: std|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: pause in play.....players updating scorecard|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: in the other room|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes cruel indeed-to open 1C and watch oppo bid and make 2D |pg||
nt|tcpant: Yes I have heard good response in BAM also with 66 Teams|pg||
nt|psridhar: well it is a top trick slam nearly...so i will give the benefit to the bidders and say WELL BID|pg||
mb|1S|nt|patricck: can ruff with J@S|pg||
nt|patricck: oops, wrong hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: :(|pg||
nt|panja: y, @SK stiff or !KT?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i wd bid 1@H|pg||
nt|daman: NS partscore now|pg||
nt|drkvas: 6@c bid by uttam n babesh babesh bid 3@d on 3 club n went on to bid 6|pg||
mb|1N|nt|panja: if E has @ST, decl must ruff with 9|pg||
nt|sharkey: I like 4@H with North's hand - jam the bidding|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: here west managed to get his @C suit in|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: same mistake I made....North is short of diamonds, not South|pg||
nt|Walddk6: I like to double with the South cards and play ELC. 2@D overcall could well have lost spades|pg||
nt|panja: y|pg||
nt|psridhar: E has to read this 4d as natural and support clubs|pg||
nt|tcpant: 204 Pairs in IMP pairs was very encouraging also|pg||
nt|tcpant: That's 12 IMPs to DSM for bidding the good 6@C slam|pg||
mb|2H|an| |nt|psridhar: Passing 1S on that N hand doesnt seem dafe to me|pg||
nt|psridhar: 1h will work when there is h fit ...but here it loses spds|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 6@S make too?|pg||
nt|psridhar: safe |pg||
nt|brolucius: Was that 'daft' or 'safe'?|pg||
nt|psridhar: sry|pg||
nt|psridhar: safe |pg||
nt|psridhar: 2nd seat preempt on a weak suit ( for 4 level), what was the objective there?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk6: ELC = Equal Level Conversion|pg||
nt|psridhar: even 2c may go down|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: Mango had their share of slam luck in first session when they landed a grand dropping doubleton Q of trumps in an 8 card fit|pg||
nt|psridhar: i was abt to say that Roland-2D on that moth eaten suit opp a passed hand is not my fav-the take out X is more flex and brings spd into pic|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, I like double rather than 2@D as well, but close decision, would not criticise 2@D|pg||
nt|panja: better still, why not overcall 1@S?|pg||
nt|psridhar: gud judgement at both tbls|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 2@S wud have gone down a packet|pg||
nt|psridhar: operator pl post results of bds 18 and 19|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk6: http://www.bridgeguys.com/EGlossary/EqualLevelConversion.html|pg||
nt|panja: with a structure to handle 4-card overcalls..of course|pg||
nt|sharkey: No - @D breaking bad and communications problem|pg||
nt|psridhar: i expect 6s will go down|pg||
nt|psridhar: h lead taps dummy|pg||
nt|panja: hi all|pg||
nt|panja: 6@C might have been better, I guess|pg||
nt|patricck: definitely|pg||
nt|rv: maybe it has to do with style, Kushari and Bhabesh probably gel better together since they are from same Kolkatta school|pg||
nt|r_tibre: perhaps it wasnt an objective, and the reason lies in the past|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: 1@S is ok when you find a spde fit, but it makes some auctions very awkward later|pg||
nt|sharkey: I'm not sure I agree with 4@S - 5 points and 6 card suit.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: if east was declaring i dont think is that great as @D and @Hare not protected|pg||
nt|daman: that was strange    I would have passed 1NT|pg||
pc|h2|nt|psridhar: 3H is probably Kushari's last game try|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i suppose Sridhar that you are treating the weak @H suit as a 4 carder and the @S suit as a 4 carder :)|pg||
nt|patricck: that is true, double is tempting, but nothing really wrong with 1@H either... because of the @H987 I go with the 1@H call but double very close 2nd choice|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|nt|sunsamvar: South will be sqeezed on the play of @D and this cud make|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|psridhar: other room ahs saved in 5c --500?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: squeezed|pg||
nt|psridhar: when pd has a weak hand as here it doesnt matter...but if he has values to compete for part score the X will enable him in my opinion|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and if east had a dbleton in either red suit it cud have gone down|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rv: playing @sk is better since you can cash !qxxx only with West|pg||
pc|h7|nt|patricck: on this lead South might just continue spades anyway|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: nice underlead|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sharkey: With @D 3-3 and trumps 3-2 this wud make|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: conn. recovered. will update scores after claim|pg||
nt|psridhar: ty|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|nt|Walddk6: ELC solves all probs. If partner responds diamonds or spades, all is fine, and if you get (the more likely) 2@C, you convert to 2@D to show diamonds and spades|pg||
nt|psridhar: nice 9 of spd by decl|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sunit: i think a dia lead was much better|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|psridhar: perhaps a consolation 2 imp to mango here..but Railways are taking all big swings|pg||
nt|patricck: If you overcall 1@S and partner bids 2@C what do you do? Bid 2@D and see partner bid 2@S with a doubleton?|pg||
nt|panja: not all, some, perhaps, many|pg||
nt|panja: for one, if W bids 2@h or 3@H, with Club length....what shd partner do?|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|brolucius: Ten easy tricks, once the club lead saves any problem in that suit.|pg||
nt|patricck: but a suspicious @S9 given South knows that partner has a 5 card suit|pg||
nt|psridhar: 9 tricks and wd|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: nice as in effective... not that i agree with it :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|panja: it solves problems if W passes, most of them, let us say|pg||
nt|rv: marginally better since you also cater to stiff @sq in other hand|pg||
nt|sunit: now declarer can make 2sp|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|sunsamvar: i suppose a @H was led in the closed room to take 3 nt down|pg||
nt|psridhar: having decided not to lead Pd's suit , N might hv considered leading clubs|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: true Sridhar|pg||
nt|psridhar: both black suits need help from pd-clubs need much less|pg||
nt|psridhar: 6c might hv played better...another reason why u shdn open 4s there|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|psridhar: Manas might hv tried a dia into dummy's AQ-- on winning the spd W returns dia and if decl finesses....cant see any other way of beating 2s|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|rv: this could be another huge swing for DSM|pg||
nt|tcpant: In OR North opened 2S unlike 4S here|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|nt|panja: Roland, do you know who the other SF are?|pg||

pc|s8|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is neat defence - they are going to endplay dummy|pg||
nt|psridhar: in fact the normal dia lead may well beat|pg||

nt|sharkey: W places pd with a GOOD 6 card suit here and jumps to 6@S - dont think W at fault here|pg||
nt|panja: y, more interesting question is, how can E show @CQ to 3, and @SK to 6?|pg||
nt|psridhar: If E had passed 4H as he should..how would the auction proceed? W to bal with 4NT?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Mind you, with declarer playing the @CQ from dummy (which was not at all a good idea), he might still have lost two club tricks.|pg||
nt|psridhar: the theory of leading long suits is based on defense gaining tempo 3 times so that u can set up your long suit; but when declarer threatens to run a long suit of his own defense ...|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: any trends from the dealing m/c yet Sridhar ? :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: this one is a lock :)|pg||
nt|panja: South is Sanjay Damle, N is Raju Gulavani, W is Kamal Mukherjee...|pg||
mb|1S|nt|patricck: any 5-1 @H break except singleton Ace would have beaten it|pg||
nt|psridhar: the stiff h is the ace so...|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: Nice distributional 4@S contract, makes even with a spade misguess|pg||
nt|roswolf: west needs to restrain himself|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: like here East shd lead a @S even if he had 1 less @S|pg||
nt|psridhar: not been very alert Sunil....preparing to go for KK's function|pg||
mb|1N|nt|patricck: hard for EW to bid 6@C against this start|pg||
nt|psridhar: over 1h W found a fitshowing jump to 2s in other room-it was easy to reach 4s thereafter|pg||
nt|sharkey: not sure - if E passes W wud bid 5@D and E wud prefer to 6@C?|pg||
nt|psridhar: or 5d emphasising minor 2 suitor? 6-5|pg||
nt|patricck: avoiding 5@D is the thing here|pg||
nt|psridhar: so the railways lead was short lived|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: true ..a typical alok sadhu 1H has EW in totters..|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: will they strech for the vul 4@H game ?|pg||
nt|tcpant: No 7-carder yet in this set... EW getting more of 5-4-2-2 variety|pg||
mb|2D|nt|bjacobs: Looks like 6@H doesn't quite fetch|pg||
nt|panja: 9-card fit on both sides......9=19 tricks though, 1 extra|pg||
nt|rv: Hi all|pg||
nt|tcpant: So DSM in lead again  ... gaining 29-6 in 4 boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: wait ..but his pd has taken him seriously giving EW another bite at the cherry|pg||
nt|brolucius: I was reading some 1955 US bridge magazines while on holiday. They would not have agreed with South's 'free bid' of 1@S on such limited values. Of course we know better nowadays.|pg||
nt|psridhar: 8 card suits are difficult to restrain :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: this time 6 controls...hmm... laltu is getting poorer by the deal :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: more 6 packs for Laltu Sridhar|pg||
mb|2S|nt|psridhar: a preemptive 3h instead of 2h might hv quietened E|pg||
nt|psridhar: a bid of 5D will commit to slam almost|pg||
nt|sharkey: Think I wud bid 5@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would have re-opened as south|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Unless you peek, of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: other room in 5H X|pg||
nt|patricck: it appears South likes his off shape 1NT hands|pg||
nt|sharkey: Think 4 NT wud show 4-6?|pg||
nt|psridhar: hi RV|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes i think Sunit will be there too :)|pg||
nt|sunit: actually i had booked my bangalore chennai ticket for today evening, assuming i might be in bangalore, but it was optimistic thinking|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: trump lead is best|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The defence needs to be a little careful|pg||
nt|patricck: vg, 3NT is no trouble|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: how to best play the @D suit here ?|pg||
nt|patricck: best not to play @D|pg||
nt|patricck: needing 3 extra tricks, you need the clubs anyway|pg||
nt|psridhar: declarer will first test clubs and lose an entry to dummy in the process|pg||
nt|daman: hard to believe South passed over 1@S|pg||
nt|daman: wow|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: so where are you Sunit ?|pg||
nt|sunit: this is a really funny pass by south|pg||
nt|sunit: in Ahmedabad|pg||
nt|tcpant: Yes but theat was with North... We r talking about the East hand which got too many HCPs as well as 7-carder distn. in 3rd set|pg||
pc|hA|nt|psridhar: it must be frustrating to be not able to bid that club suit :)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|panja: fit-showing?|pg||
nt|patricck: support double showing 3 card @S....   if so then West really should have done more than just correct to 2@S|pg||
nt|panja: is S thinking of a dbl?|pg||
nt|patricck: surely not|pg||
nt|panja: I hope not...|pg||
nt|panja: any bid here will be bad for NS|pg||
nt|babugenu: l|pg||
nt|psridhar: 4nt enables a contract of 5C first of all|pg||
nt|psridhar: RV must be tired by now after all the organising work|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|sharkey: Dont like 1 NT here - 17 HCP and no rebid problems|pg||
nt|patricck: quite surprising that North had no red card for 4@D|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hi Venky|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: again a reasonable slam|pg||
nt|daman: they sell out to 2@S and they are cold for 3@H|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rv: Hi PS, Sunil and all specs, logging in from a very pleasant Bangalore (not at the venue)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|bjacobs: North may have a tricky problem on opening lead here|pg||
nt|sharkey: I wudnt Dbl with North's hand at IMPs|pg||
nt|psridhar: might escape for down 1|pg||
pc|h6|nt|panja: a first time 3@H by N might have solved this problem...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Must cash their side tricks now|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: play out of turn.....missed tricks...will update score on claiming|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: why not dbl 1@S ?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: even tho risk of ptr bidding @D|pg||
mc|8|nt|bjacobs: Well if North takes his own advice and leads a club, this will no doubt go down|pg||
nt|psridhar: and declarer has voluntarily forfeited the spd entry as well at trcik1|pg||
nt|daman: what is going on?|pg||
nt|psridhar: costly thsi is- South thought 2c was risky but failed to appreciate that passing was riskier !|pg||

nt|r_tibre: thankfully for the directors, there are appeals committees|pg||

nt|patricck: go looking for a @C slam, but couldn't quite justify doing so|pg||

nt|vugraphzwu: score updated|pg||
nt|sharkey: On the previous borad E didnt bid and NS ended in 5@H Dbl|pg||
nt|patricck: but when partner opens 1NT in 3rd seat should you be worried about him taking liberties?|pg||
nt|psridhar: now this south is all hearts ...i wonder if sumit will be tempted to open 1N|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the controls have moved to west|pg||
nt|rv: biggest upset was co-favorites Formidables (along with Indian Rail) not qualifying to QFs from super-swiss|pg||
nt|daman: silly*|pg||
nt|daman: passing that South hand|pg||
nt|psridhar: i recall a nice article by Jeff Rubens tilted " how Risky is not taking the risk"  - south's ddilemma last deal is an apt example of that theme|pg||
nt|sunit: ih dbl can get risky because it might go 1h x 3h 4dia p, now it can get your side in a mess|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: These guys have been playing 60 + boards for six days now... fatigue must be setting in|pg||
mb|2D|nt|panja: 4@S is a bit high.....it should end in partial in this room|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: It wasn't a terrible contract tho, needed a club honour onside, and perhaps a 3-2 trump break|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but is is far riskier to miss a vul @H game|pg||
mb|2S|nt|patricck: 14 imps then....some light at the end of the tunnel for Mango, but is there a train coming? :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes 4-4-41 hands dont play well -though they hv huge defense potential ...in general|pg||
nt|panja: there, the liberty was with distribution...|pg||
nt|psridhar: he is lucky his pd is abt to bid H |pg||
nt|daman: hard to predict what will happen on this hand|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|psridhar: no Pat they hv saved 6D-result depends on lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: Would S bid 4@H if N Dbl 4@D?|pg||
nt|patricck: perhaps we should call 15-17 with anything even close to balanced the Indian No Trump?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but again the slam likely to fail|pg||
nt|rv: Kushari is in a belligerent mood against his students and partners:)|pg||
nt|rv: all the top Indian teams with the exception of Texan Aces participated in this most prestigious event of Indian bridge calendar|pg||
nt|sunit: better is to overcall 2cl|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes|pg||
mb|3N|nt|bjacobs: West would like to give 2@D the treatment, but maybe double is not for penalties|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: indeed there was a liberty being taken, but should the possibility affect North's decision when it was a 1NT opener?|pg||
nt|panja: not perhaps, but if E held singleton, 4@D might make..|pg||
nt|roswolf: well the fit is found|pg||
nt|roswolf: surely north will desist from bidding on|pg||
nt|brolucius: Standard bidding is unsatisfactory here. South can force with 3@H when he is really strong but then North does not know whether his partner has 4 or 5 hearts. Some players use 2@C ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: as artificial facing the 1NT response.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk6: 2@D is probably a sound heart raise, although I don't think he has one. 2@H is enough|pg||
nt|Walddk6: 9 count  4333|pg||
nt|rv: I think Laltu's pass shows semi positive hand (GF)|pg||
nt|psridhar: rv - bhabesh sd know that |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: it pays to interfere over 2@C esp at this vul|pg||
nt|rv: this is an easy way to make a living for Rail:)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: laltu with his 6-5 has not got a bid in yet|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: but double digit swing yes|pg||
nt|patricck: agreed|pg||
nt|psridhar: over the X they play 2h as bad raise and 2d as normal raise...but i agree it can be construed as bad raise|pg||
nt|panja: five honour cards in 9 HCP....not all useful for a @H contract...but here, because @CA is with South, most cards will pull their full weight|pg||
nt|panja: @S singleton, that is|pg||
nt|rv: here Sumit's pass clearly shows preference to defend since EW are in forcing pass situation|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes but his pd has expressed an opinion|pg||
nt|daman: obvious @H lead now|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bjacobs: East certainly thinks it's not for penalties.  And I agree|pg||
nt|psridhar: 11 imp|pg||
nt|psridhar: so make that 30 imp to get in 5 bds|pg||
nt|psridhar: plus KQ doubleton falling|pg||
nt|psridhar: diamonds|pg||
nt|sharkey: No liberties taken at this board - yet...|pg||
nt|panja: 3Nt on finesse|pg||
nt|psridhar: wd laltu|pg||
nt|rv: well judged by Laltu|pg||
nt|psridhar: direct 3nt on 9 hcp and 4-3-3-3 seems pushy|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: brave 2 nt by Kushari... may not pay off|pg||
nt|sunit: nothing is obvious in bridge|pg||
nt|daman: it is if you're an expert|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|panja: y|pg||
nt|patricck: If east had a singleton spade then South would have AKxx, which would be difficult to ruff out completely|pg||
nt|panja: AKxx or AQxx..|pg||
nt|psridhar: 1H-4d-4h wd hv been easy-now 1nt opg may well propel them higher|pg||
nt|psridhar: but Sumit's sensible 2H will help|pg||
nt|patricck: Although I have no disagreement with this hand we have seen some very odd 1NT's in this competition|pg||
nt|psridhar: 1100|pg||
nt|mackulky: best done would go for 1100|pg||
nt|rv: most play double in a forcing pass situation as preference to defend, except for Meckwell and a few others who play reverse of meaning of double and pass in a forcing pass ...|pg||
nt|rv: situation|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c9|pg||
nt|Walddk6: I can understand Sanjay's 4@S. He is hoping for a double fit|pg||
nt|psridhar: as it happens opener wd hv accepted the invitn..so no damage|pg||
nt|rv: some of the members of Texan Aces played for other teams though|pg||
nt|rv: Manas and Amarnath would know that their lead would have wiped out after 4@s and 6@s hands|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: n thinking hard with eyes closed|pg||
nt|rv: match on surely and I have a sneaky gut feeling that DSM might actually win this match|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk6: But as they play Precision, he can get something like this|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, Kxxx of the opponents suit is a disappointment|pg||
nt|psridhar: but i guess their 1D does not promise dia Roland|pg||
nt|panja: the 1@D is amorphous, must not count it as showing @D length|pg||
nt|Walddk6: read above|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bjacobs: Amazing what chaos resulted from that little 2@D bid|pg||
nt|psridhar: this flat 3nt wont do the Magoes any good in their 30 imp pursuit|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|Walddk6: "hoping" not "counting"|pg||
nt|panja: instead of the 4@S jump, a 3@H bid would have been better....|pg||
nt|panja: y, Roland, noticed the hope word now...|pg||
nt|panja: N could well have @CK instead of @HK, or, perhaps, some other minor honours...that would be good for 4@S|pg||
nt|panja: but there often is more of totalitarian bridge, rather than egalitarian...as I like to put it|pg||
nt|psridhar: defense will get another chance|pg||
pc|cK|nt|patricck: very true, still about 30 imps, but only 4 boards|pg||
nt|panja: or, in worst case, KQxx|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|nt|rv: correct safety play in @ds to protect @cK|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Banerjee is going to feel the pinch|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sunsamvar: Why India Patrick... top players all over the world open 1 nt with unbalanced hands :)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|sunsamvar: what is the advantage of reversing it rv ?|pg||
pc|c8|pc|h5|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d5|nt|bjacobs: Of course the 2@D bid has worked both ways.  In fact what normally looks like a cold 4@H is somewhat less cold when North shows the diamonds|pg||
nt|sunit: i think he will make it now|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rv: eventually I expect Manas to take @h finesse after cashing his 7 tricks|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|psridhar: the sharp young Sumit will swing an overtrick imp or two here|pg||
nt|psridhar: Panja-are u suggesting you shd X 4d only when u see 4 tricks for sure?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: now making|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d7|nt|psridhar: experts open 1N on unbal hands when they see a rebid problem if they open 1 of a suit Sunil- i thk Pat is referring to several 1nt opg yday when that was not the case|pg||
pc|sA|nt|psridhar: add an ace to that N hand and he wd be doubling 2D !!|pg||

nt|psridhar: 2  pref and one neutral = 3 messages to communicate and 2 bids p/x|pg||
mb|2C|nt|psridhar: bd 26 if W were to declare slam he may make it on the likely nonspd lead - let s see|pg||
nt|psridhar: we can expect further bidding from South on that starwberry field ..notwithstanding the 2nt o/c|pg||
nt|brolucius: Few adjectives would do justice to West's 2@C overcall.|pg||
nt|psridhar: prev hand 1nt opg is fine...but if he chose to open 1H he can easily rebid 2D over the forcing 1nt response|pg||
nt|tcpant: No the auction was 1D by N, 1NT by S and 3NT by N in CR|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: I would not open 1N with singleton @D..so I don't really know whether N was right to P or dbl|pg||
nt|sharkey: S didnt "upgrade" to 1 NT|pg||
nt|patricck: Yes, on this particular hand I would have opened 1NT too, but the question was asked did we think Sumit would open 1NT....  so far I have not seen anyone choose something other ...|pg||
nt|patricck: than 1NT when that call was even remotely possible|pg||
nt|daman: :)  |pg||
mb|2H|nt|patricck: yes, what was the 2@H showing?|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: 2s is a H raise unbal|pg||
nt|roswolf: east will be amazed|pg||
nt|rv: incidetally Kushari, Sumit and Laltu are team-mates in DSM in most of the tournies, only Nationals is an exception|pg||
nt|psridhar: laltu back to his riches|pg||
mb|2S|an| |nt|psridhar: 2hmust be tartan|pg||

mb|p|nt|psridhar: 3h=stiff spd i guess|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1C must be forcing|pg||
nt|psridhar: no 1c is not f|pg||
nt|rv: must be precision with variable NT (12-14 in 4th seat)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: what is 2@S ?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|patricck: at least EW never found their spade fit, that could have been ugly|pg||
nt|sharkey: Why does N bid then?|pg||
nt|psridhar: NS play natural mathods|pg||
nt|panja: amazing, this should have been doubled by E? for lead, of course|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: what was 2 nt ?|pg||
nt|psridhar: 4 card unabl raise|pg||
nt|tcpant: Yes that's right ... May be NV 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|daman: good question|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: with @D to boot :)|pg||
nt|rv: @s lead only 1 to give declarer any toruble|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: and Kushari continues his generosity|pg||
nt|drkvas: @s lead down|pg||
mb|3N|nt|roswolf: well that will let this thriugh|pg||
nt|psridhar: gud lead |pg||
nt|daman: obviously it is intended to be forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: Carl- these days, experts take liberty when NV vs VUl|pg||
nt|sharkey: E didnt bid either .....???|pg||
nt|rv: Kushari can discard 6 of rounded suit cards run of @d, so @s lead should beat it|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i think the dbl told his ptr not to lead @C|pg||
nt|drkvas: strong club 18= catchall@d|pg||
nt|rv: Ashok and may other folks in Delhi like N.K.Gupta prefer to play NT opening in 4th seat as 12-14 to prevent competition from opps|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: lucky 12 tricks here ... a Roland Slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: but decl will cope with that one|pg||

mb|p|nt|psridhar: well thought out 3s by sumit-if his pd can cue 4c he is in slam -|pg||

nt|daman: thanks|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: thanks for the heads up|pg||
pc|s4|nt|panja: or, a 2@D bid|pg||
nt|psridhar: I think that X of 3nt shd say ' they are hping to make this on long dia( other m) and i am short there, do something intelligent" |pg||
pc|s2|nt|sunsamvar: why did he not play the @D4 asking clearly for a @C return ?|pg||
nt|tcpant: In other room 3NT made 10 tricks but not DBLed|pg||
nt|tcpant: NK Gupta may prefer 9-11 NT NV |pg||
pc|s5|nt|psridhar: but over 4d ....i wont see slam|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Looks like a winning lead|pg||

pc|h7|nt|Walddk2: Well ....|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bjacobs: But a losing play by East|pg||
nt|psridhar: tartan worked here- other room S may pass and see W open 1nt-p-p- ? 2h showing Maj/min or 2d Dont needed to comp|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|psridhar: i frankly think sumit shd hv signed off over 4d-playing pd for 2 aces and a stiff is farfetched|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: a spec remarks "4 says the A, and the  5 the K "|pg||
nt|psridhar: 4c is d1 and no one can X..they probably will compete to 4d |pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|c2|nt|sunsamvar: at this level i suppose they watch spot cards like hawks |pg||

pc|hQ|pg||
nt|sunit: now only 11 tricks instead of 12|pg||
pc|s6|nt|patricck: when you play the !% how does partner know you have the @D4, might not declarer be hiding it?|pg||
nt|patricck: *@D5|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: in which case the @C indiction is confirmed Pat|pg||
pc|h5|pc|sK|nt|rv: @d finesse working,  I presume Manas would eventually finesse instead of playing for any esoteric line |pg||
nt|psridhar: decl has 9 in comfort-one more cl trick to def thts all|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|nt|sharkey: Liberties and liberties .... I assume they have a system they're bound to follow as well?|pg||

nt|panja: out here, it must be don't know what to do, so pass|pg||

nt|tcpant: As it turns out, Bd 54 was played in 3NT in CR also and made even after Diamond lead|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|vugraphzwu: lpay out of turn|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: play*|pg||
nt|patricck: claim rest anyway|pg||
pc|c3|nt|psridhar: even if pd gives u dia ace, u hv to ruff 2 spds and bring clubs for no loser....unlikely|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: dispute among players|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: director being called|pg||
nt|patricck: some hope then, a revoke or something is about the only chance of making|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|psridhar: 9 bds and 9 imps :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: 9 bds left|pg||
mc|11|nt|Walddk2: How do you make partner win the ace and switch to a heart?|pg||
nt|tcpant: Declarer took with DA and played a spade afterwards and West after taking King played back a Dia instead of heart to give the contract|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: now a 4 loser hand for Laltu|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: water break|pg||
nt|rv: this one is a really good slam for EW|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Are u suggesting that the dealing m/c favours certain positions like a compass Sridhar ?|pg||
nt|psridhar: no -i see trends( perhaps program logic) everytime; and in a short match, a shrewd player can exploit|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but may be tough to get there RV|pg||
nt|rv: yes 5@c is a reasonable/par contract, 6@c is asking for too much in bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: back after the break|pg||
nt|psridhar: third 7 card suit for laltu this set|pg||
nt|tcpant: Closed room is playing in 5@C|pg||
nt|psridhar: in 8 bds|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: 4@S for NS, but a good sac for EW, too|pg||
nt|psridhar: 5bds and 27 imps|pg||
mb|1S|nt|psridhar: sry Arun Jain Vs dhampur -not shree cements i stand crrected|pg||

mb|3H|an| |nt|sharkey: 1 NT I assume |pg||
nt|psridhar: barring bd no 36, all bds this set hv been balanced hands|pg||
nt|sunit: 3nt makes 10  but 3h dbl goes for 800|pg||
nt|tcpant: Hi Sridhar, another one 7-carder with East....|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Unusual over Unusual. 3@D forcing with spade support|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Looks like 3@D showed some sort of spade hand - "unusual over unusual"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@C would have shown hearts|pg||
nt|psridhar: 3nt vs 4s on bal hands is a perennial issue-here 3nt scores|pg||
nt|patricck: 3NT might have some chances here, but difficult to bid after the 4 card @H ovecall|pg||
nt|tcpant: Yes the Dealing Program is favouring East or as Sridhar informs ... It is the Program Trend which can be exploited in short game|pg||
nt|psridhar: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: At the other table North went four down vulnerable in 3NT (after a very strange auction) on the deal where we saw West goings one down in 3@D on his eight-card suit.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: This way you can bid non-forcing 3@H and 3@S|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: manas feels he is down in the match and is trying to swing|pg||
nt|drkvas: convey my blessings n apologise for my absence ok|pg||
nt|sunit: or 1100 if trump is promoted in south hand|pg||
pc|c4|nt|psridhar: 3C= nf in H as opposed to direct 3h which wd be F perhaps|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's anyone's guess why West passed that hand in 1st seat|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It looks like West is wondering about that as well ...|pg||
nt|psridhar: 5nt possibly is pick a slam including 6nt|pg||
nt|tcpant: Well it must be a record no. of 7-carder in a day, I have seen|pg||
nt|drkvas: sry private|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: would you dbl or bid 3 nt ?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sharkey: Mr Chotan certainly not scared|pg||
nt|rv: it looks like Rail not fielding Subir and DSM not fielding Souren/Uttam in too many rounds|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: after all 3 nt is not sure|pg||
pc|cT|nt|psridhar: this shd go down|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: wow.. grat bid by Sumit|pg||
nt|rv: trump lead might test declarer here|pg||
nt|sunit: i would pass and hope for heart shortage with partner, which is most likely|pg||
nt|daman: the only person I know who wouldn't double is Sorean|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|panja: absolutely...|pg||
nt|patricck: 2@S has worked quite well here, but that doesn't mean I agree with it|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: great|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Wlc Pant ji|pg||
pc|s6|nt|panja: any reason to pull the first tump from a particular side here?|pg||
nt|sharkey: When I try 2@S on such cards it usually means +800|pg||
nt|sharkey: to opps...|pg||
pc|s7|nt|psridhar: but the Laltu conversion will lead to a flat bd|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|brolucius: West might have rebid 3@D instead on the basis that diamonds would still play well if partner had club support.|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@H non forcing - very strange|pg||
nt|psridhar: Sumit is a Superb card player but even he will find it impossible here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: superb and very fast|pg||
nt|tcpant: Hi Sunil|pg||
nt|psridhar: whats that 3D ? DAB? i prefer 3H |pg||
nt|rv: Rail originally started the tourney with 2 trios (Rana, Manas and Subir) and (Sumit, Laltu and Amarnath), but they have subsequently changed|pg||
nt|tcpant: But 1st Set Rana played with Subir|pg||
nt|rv: DSM originally started the event with 3 fixed partnerships, Ashok-Kamal, Bhabesh-Uttam and Kushari-Souren|pg||
nt|psridhar: cant be 4th suit- 3d over 2h is 4th suit not now|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rv: double dummy defense of cashing 3 @s tricks and @CA before exiting in a @h from North hand might have beaten this|pg||
pc|hA|nt|panja: I would need a bulletproof jacket before I even think of 2@S|pg||
pc|h5|nt|psridhar: Carl- all the bds this segment - the bidding has one underlying assumption " they wont X for cash" - the point that Pat was making|pg||
nt|brolucius: Can it be forcing when East passed originally?|pg||
nt|rv: I presume Laltu's 3@c showed min reverse|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|sharkey: Certainly got EW off to the best lead|pg||
nt|psridhar: if east has spds yes|pg||
nt|brolucius: It was a poor bid because West would have doubled if he had three hearts in addition to both minors.|pg||
nt|psridhar: see the danger of 3D... a bid of 3H wd hv definitely led to 5C - at least it helps E to assess 3nt vs 5c|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|drkvas: it is not upto date|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but w/o @H shortage North will pass Sunit|pg||
nt|drkvas: at fav vul pass is perfect at these colours debatable|pg||
nt|sunit: but north is marked with o to 2 hearts for sure|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|rv: Sumit's 2@s should be natural 5+Cards, F1|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|panja: wonder why S bid on|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree Padmanabban |pg||
nt|patricck: I thought 2NT was for the minors|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|nt|tcpant: This is not good for Railways.... Max 8 tricks if played perfect|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sunsamvar: he shd be named the Lightning Kid :)|pg||

pc|s2|pg||

nt|sharkey: think it implies monors - else Dbl wud be t/o with @H|pg||
nt|panja: what is E doing ducking?|pg||
nt|brolucius: It was obvious that West held at most two hearts and East should therefore have bid only 3@D, as I see it.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|nt|psridhar: this year the Ruia Gold field has reduced to an overwhelming presence of players from Mumbai and kolkatta...used be so long ago till formidables changed that pattern in the last ...|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Unusual Over Unusual as explained in the Bridge Glossary:|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: A defensive countermeasure against unusual No Trump overcalls. For example: after a 2 No Trump overcall of 1 Spade, one popular method is the bid of 3 Clubs to show Heart length ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and a strong hand; a bid of 3 Diamonds shows Spade support and a strong hand; a bid of 3 Hearts shows Heart length and a moderate hand; a bid of 3 Spades shows Spade support and a ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: moderate hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: well if he had a real suit with no hcp he would have given preference - would he not |pg||

nt|psridhar: Kushari will discard his dia Jack on 2nd/3rd club to make life easy for his pd- dia 9 shd be 0 or 2 higher|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rv: should Laltu have hedged with 3@h or jumped to 5@c instead of 3n|pg||

nt|patricck: I wouldn't think EW would venture to game here, despite the excellent @S suit|pg||
nt|sharkey: @C lead will set 4@S|pg||
mb|5D|mb|d|nt|psridhar: 15 imps and 4 bds exciting match|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: no 1 nt opening here Patrick :)|pg||
nt|rv: it is a roller-coaster, misses, hits, spills and thrills all the way through|pg||
mb|5H|nt|psridhar: it certainly works well over unusual 2nt showing minors |pg||
nt|roswolf: 15 imps in 4 bds is not insurmountable|pg||
nt|daman: there are basic bridge principles at this supposed level     and first and foremost is to protect partner       so South had a mandatory pas and North had a mandatory reopening ...|pg||
nt|daman: double     |pg||
mb|d|nt|bjacobs: You could play 2@H as showing the minors, with clubs equal or greater than diamonds; 2@S shows longer diamonds (after the Landy bid)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H heart stop, no spade stop. 2@S spade stop, no heart stop. NT stops in both majors. That's one way of playing it|pg||
nt|rv: 3n would have been interesting contract, it might make on @s lead by West|pg||
nt|rv: I suppose you can expect this when all players know each other so well and end of 6th day of continuos bridge|pg||
nt|daman: end of discussion|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: i hear that slam on bd 27 made because when a dia was played off the tbl S played 2 cards -the ACE and 9 of dia- the 9 was visible so diro ruled it in|pg||
nt|psridhar: i thk NS hv enough grounds to contest that decision on appeal|pg||
nt|psridhar: anybody's match from here|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i favour railways because of their lead|pg||
nt|rv: what would the panel open with South hand, I might fancy 1n|pg||
nt|tcpant: Railways bid & made 3NT in closed room so 6 IMPs may go|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: they won't need to|pg||
nt|psridhar: 1. Dia ace was the setting trcik|pg||
nt|panja: @D better..with the 54 fit....easier to remove trumps and take your discards...|pg||
nt|patricck: indeed, I was looking at that, but perhaps the strong intermediate cards and 5 card @D make it too good for 1NT :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: 2nt is certainly ambitious pushing for a NV game|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: coming to Bd 19 and N's controvertial 1D response...other room got to 3nt EW-let us see if it is a success|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w on the way|pg||
nt|psridhar: w is worth a 3d here|pg||
nt|brolucius: West should not go too high now. His partner is a passed hand.|pg||
nt|drkvas: agreed:)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bjacobs: This is the same position as the CR.  They took their spade ruff, but failed to cash the diamond tricks|pg||
nt|panja: but 2 IMP difference for a @S contract|pg||
nt|psridhar: he will survive if he gets dia rt|pg||
nt|rv: Manas's 2N was Jordan showing limit raise or better in @hs|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: at the score a strange decision by west|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes |pg||
nt|brolucius: A minor-suit game, on a 4-4 fit, needs good values. I think West's pass was correct.|pg||
nt|psridhar: it just may be the winning decn|pg||
nt|brolucius: East might have had more of his values in spades, where they would not have been productive.|pg||
nt|sunit: north south can only gain on this deal|pg||
pc|sA|nt|psridhar: 4s fast arrival showing poor hand but cant stop N from slam|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Yes RV but it must be right sided... best if South opened a NT|pg||
nt|psridhar: shd score an overtrick in comfort|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|psridhar: W can overtake ans shoot a trump for 500|pg||
pc|h9|nt|patricck: and indeed Sumit agrees with me on the valuation, hence the 2NT rebid|pg||
nt|psridhar: 1nt is attractive RV no doubt...but how about N bid over 1d? being a passed hand wont 2c be a picture bid? enables rt siding nt if it is rt|pg||
nt|tcpant: Yes that will mean 7|pg||
nt|sunit: still 650 on for ew|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bjacobs: They didn't get to first base in this room!|pg||
nt|psridhar: doesnt 4s make?|pg||
nt|psridhar: how do u defeat 4s?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: why E/W MAY OVERSHOOT TO 6@s|pg||
nt|psridhar: wd banerjee|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pg||
nt|sharkey: Think W shud Dbl 2nd time and correct 2@H to 2@S |pg||
pc|dA|nt|panja: Aces ask that does not tell much here|pg||
nt|panja: once N opens, the ! for finesse goes down...but is W right to bid so conservatively? is there an option? say a dbl of 1@D?|pg||
nt|brolucius: A trump back is best now, because West has a bundle of cards to ruff in the East hand. Yes, he has found the trump return.|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: play out of turn.....will update scores on claiming|pg||
nt|rv: excellent start to defense by Sumit-Laltu, ducking @c not so great by Laltu|pg||
nt|rv: yes time for afternoon cuppa for those in India to keep ourselves awake on a Sun afternoon:)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|psridhar: defense has essentially done the same mistake here too|pg||
nt|psridhar: the diro should keep in mind that the expert defender is on play with setting trick vs a slam -bd 27|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pg||
nt|psridhar: missing 2 aces sunil?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bjacobs: I'm fairly sympathetic to this particular mistake|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Aloke probably felt that he didn't need to give partner a spade ruff|pg||
nt|psridhar: perhaps Dia king lead and THEN spd shift wd hv achieved|pg||
nt|psridhar: why Panja? he used ace ask as route to discover his pd's trump Q|pg||
nt|panja: well...the ace answer did not tell much..|pg||
nt|panja: I am trying to make out the meaning of further bids..|pg||
nt|panja: 5@D, what was it?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bjacobs: Yes, the diamond lead makes it all so much simpler|pg||
nt|psridhar: not very tough as pd has shown dia as one of his suits |pg||
pc|hT|nt|daman: we have to focus|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes 5d asked abt trump q|pg||
nt|psridhar: i am told other room in 3d as NS-so the trailers CVR may gain|pg||
nt|sunit: yes 650 is on champ|pg||
pc|c2|nt|panja: and 5@S shows trump Q?|pg||
nt|psridhar: 2nd step yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: superfast play.....claiming at the end|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: IF north passes and East opens and then North shows his 2 suitor they may not be able to check for aces|pg||
mc|8|nt|tcpant: Defenders may avoid the overtrick....|pg||
nt|rv: this Winter Nationals has been dominated by those from Kolkatta (West Bengal in Eastern part of India) like it has been for awhile|pg||

nt|psridhar: Bill thats a cruel thought :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: 2d=nat with 5-7 i guess|pg||
nt|psridhar: i wd suggest u play 2S as strong/intermediate Jump overcall-both oppo hv bid and no purpose in WJO|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok 2 imps only|pg||
nt|psridhar: 3 to go and 13 imp to recover|pg||
nt|psridhar: exciting|pg||
nt|roswolf: could be some fun here|pg||
nt|rv: only risk with 2@c from North hand is when has opened a light 1@d in 3rd seat especially with majors|pg||
nt|rv: I won't fault Kushari for his 1n response|pg||
nt|rv: 3 of 4 semi-finalists and 5 of 8 QFs comprise of players from Kolkatta|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and if west is pushed after P opens, the odds are he may try 6@S|pg||
nt|sunit: and the odds are south may sacrifice 7h on 6sp|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Sridhar another 7 carder with East|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: looks like we hv lost link with other room|pg||
mb|1C|nt|rv: prefer 2@c overcall from South hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: I bet it happens|pg||
nt|psridhar: i will be keen to know how they bid bd no 9|pg||
nt|panja: good idea, but still, some weak hands where you cannot afford a 2-level bid..|pg||
nt|sharkey: I like 2@S as weak NV - trying to jam their bidding.  |pg||
nt|psridhar: what the doc ordered for the trailing team|pg||
nt|tcpant: Interesting board ... EW can make 4@H and NS 5@C|pg||
nt|psridhar: i hear a trf bid of 4h by West has been passed out in other room bd 57=railways gain|pg||
mb|1D|nt|roswolf: east passing would produce later fireworks|pg||
mb|1S|nt|psridhar: Laltu may but in 3d and ..regret|pg||
nt|panja: B10...@H guess would be the interesting point....for an OT only though|pg||
nt|panja: will have to be handled with 1@S|pg||
nt|rv: now NS would atbest compete till 3@d and may even double 4@h:)|pg||
nt|r_tibre: 3@C= rub i suppose?|pg||
nt|rv: 3@c was rubensohl showing @d suit |pg||
mb|1N|nt|sunsamvar: the @S suit will win the bidding battle|pg||
nt|rv: transfer lebensohl|pg||
nt|psridhar: 5c shd go down on trump leads|pg||
nt|rv: surprised Bhabesh didn't bid 4@h directly|pg||
mb|2S|nt|psridhar: but 4h is gin|pg||
nt|sunit: i was informed the other room is playing in 4sh 9 opp kxx heart|pg||
mb|3H|nt|bjacobs: It's up to East now ... he has a diamond stopper, but he's the one looking at the club void|pg||
nt|panja: nine easy tricks here on favourable @SKQ position|pg||
nt|rv: he gave more respect to opps bidding than partner's vulberable butt-in|pg||
nt|sunit: 4h|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: It's still very tough to expect him to pass this|pg||
nt|psridhar: i hear Dhampur didnt bid the slam on bd 9-- means we have a new leader in the match|pg||
nt|psridhar: for the 2nd time this match the Rlwys lead is short lived|pg||
nt|patricck: Ashok's 3@D was successful in the Closed Room, but do we agree with it?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and gain imps here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i would not bid 3@D pAT|pg||
nt|psridhar: 4-3-3-3 and weak suit--only thing going for that 3d is it made|pg||
nt|patricck: just imagine how ugly 3@D would have been if North was the other way around in the minors|pg||
nt|tcpant: It was more easy in the CR as South opened 1NT and pd raised to 3|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: WUD you pass the North hand in the first instance ?|pg||
nt|sunit: 4h in a 3/ 1 fit|pg||
nt|psridhar: sad for dhampur|pg||
nt|psridhar: but tightens the match |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: so North south did not gain Sumit :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: shd have taken an odds on bet with you :)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|psridhar: well done|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think that's a fantastic pass|pg||
nt|panja: but can make 10th in @H, play AK and back|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt a crude instrument|pg||
nt|brolucius: @DQ lead and South will know he has to try hearts when he wins at Trick 1.|pg||
nt|psridhar: tricky defense though top tricks|pg||
nt|psridhar: dia queen led and ducked will do for CVRAO|pg||
nt|roswolf: ace of hearts my choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: they stop in 3@H......primarily because the secondary @D fit was not unearthed|pg||
nt|brolucius: @H10 my choice.|pg||
nt|psridhar: gud lead wd|pg||
nt|roswolf: the  10 is murky|pg||
nt|brolucius: West might have @HQ-x-x.|pg||
nt|rv: at this vul, I may not bid 3@h on 1@s as well|pg||
nt|rv: according to panel, who amongst E or W is more at fault for missing game?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Now it's up to Aloke to make it|pg||
nt|patricck: There needs to be a big swing to Mango on this board to make an appeal relevant.... I just can't see that happening|pg||
nt|patricck: I guess we were just assuming they would bid game|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: it seems to have worked out well|pg||
nt|rv: would go along with Kushari's view|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: w shouts for director|pg||
nt|rv: in my opinion, well judged|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: as he can make 8 tricks|pg||
nt|tcpant: Well 2@H will make and fetch DSM 5 IMPs as CR 3@H went 1 down|pg||
nt|psridhar: E didnt know abt his pd's club holding rv-for all he knows W might hv held KQ to 6 h and 3 small clubs|pg||
nt|r_tibre: W has to value his @Cx AND @SJ|pg||
nt|daman: South should bid 3@S in my view|pg||
nt|daman: Uttam played in the 3-1 on 57|pg||
nt|daman: down 6|pg||
nt|daman: cold for 5@S|pg||
mb|4S|nt|psridhar: combined with not Doubling 2D...he has done well|pg||
nt|psridhar: now surely d1 |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Uttam has been playing this tourney with Bhabesh isn't it... then why the misunderstanding ?|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|daman: what is going on?|pg||
nt|sunit: that will be a huge pick up for ns|pg||
nt|sunit: if north passes|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: once again picturising how the Std auction wd go on this bd in other room....will it go 1nt -all pass?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunit: 4 imps |pg||
nt|psridhar: 800 vs 650 ? or is it costlier?|pg||
nt|tcpant: The bidding went 1NT - 2NT (by opp) - 3H (meant as TRF to Spades) but some confusion and got passed out|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|psridhar: defending 2D X with a club void is a nightmare|pg||
pc|d7|nt|psridhar: yes i agree -Railways have sewed this one up|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: very fast play...missed tricks.....will update score|pg||
nt|panja: 2/1 or sayc?|pg||
nt|psridhar: now i guess Railways are into Finals|pg||

nt|tcpant: It has costed DSM 15 IMPs and may possibly the match|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|nt|panja: you get 2@D rebid in 2/1, and that might propel N to a stronger invite..|pg||

pc|hA|pg||
pc|s2|nt|daman: let's not be too hasty    the match?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|panja: but of course, it could also be just 1@H 2@H|pg||
pc|s9|nt|psridhar: Bill -pl note the auction was identical in other room-- kudos to indian bridge judgement? ;)|pg||
nt|patricck: can make a 10th in @H yes, but will probably play on @D|pg||
nt|psridhar: so far the signals in this match are just abt rt for a close finish|pg||
nt|rv: maybe Bhabesh should have bid 3@d instead of 3@h as a good raise, surely Kushari would have bid game|pg||

mb|1N|nt|brolucius: Declarer was marked with the @DK by the @DQ lead and the game was cold if he also held the @HA, so South had a 100% switch to hearts.|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: server response crawling....recovered now|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: will 4@S make here on @D lead? B23|pg||
nt|psridhar: Railways have the discipline and card play skills with their past victorious experience ; Dhampur hve the flair and winning aggression|pg||
nt|daman: 1NT    funny really|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: club 8 likely lead ...down1|pg||
nt|psridhar: or a trump|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: I wouldn't have missed this match for the world|pg||
pc|sA|nt|panja: there are the weak points of a system, all systems have some, one must be aware of them...|pg||

pc|s2|nt|psridhar: this Bd hd tie the match|pg||

pc|s3|nt|sunsamvar: i wd lead a@Dq|pg||
nt|rv: transfer advances as advocated by Jeff Rubens is becoming increasingly popular nowadays|pg||

nt|brolucius: Perhaps South's wife had told him that she expected him to be back by Sunday morning at the latest.|pg||
nt|rv: Kushari presumed Sumit's minor is @c|pg||
pc|s8|nt|patricck: must be something wrong here.... I agree with every single bid made in this auction :)|pg||
nt|panja: aceless NS hands, they have already bid enough...|pg||
nt|psridhar: CVR has tried a naughty take out X and will pay for it|pg||
nt|rv: Banerjee would settle for 10 tricks here|pg||
pc|s4|nt|psridhar: now coming to rolands ELC, this east hand has similar shape except it is clubs and not dia -so cant apply that ELC take out X|pg||
nt|patricck: correct|pg||
nt|panja: true...so the idea does not have that essential symmetry|pg||
nt|panja: will have to finesse @H and discard two Clubs|pg||
nt|daman: no way|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sharkey: 2@C 1@S and @D ruff?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: club more likely to be declarer's 2nd suit|pg||
nt|sunit: funny bid of 1nt here|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|sK|nt|tcpant: Kibitzers the VUG operator is trying to update the other room scores as well ... pl. hold for a min'|pg||
nt|rv: still as PS suggested trump lead might have been better|pg||
nt|psridhar: why? he will take his 9 tricks and then finesse in clubs for all 13|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sharkey: Or @HAK and @S finesse?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|psridhar: this wont fetch |pg||

nt|psridhar: down 2|pg||
nt|brolucius: It can be made with a few good views.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|psridhar: and let us Panja's suggestion of 1S overcall here -will u find 3c after that Panaj? |pg||
nt|psridhar: Sumit wd hv made it easy for defense shifting to H at trick3..now defense has to be careful getting 2 h trickd|pg||
pc|sT|nt|tcpant: So back to 2 IMP diff after 10 boards ... So it boils to last 6 boards|pg||
pc|c3|nt|roswolf: desperation measures far too late|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|s9|nt|panja: note that you now know @D6 singleton, good card|pg||
nt|sharkey: down now|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: play out of turn. will claim the remaining tricks|pg||

pc|h4|nt|psridhar: there was no rush for that dia ruff-now defense has it easy|pg||
nt|daman: to me    a @H is automatic now|pg||
pc|h3|nt|panja: how will it go? 1@S, dbl or 2@H?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|psridhar: let us see|pg||

pc|h2|pg||

pc|hK|nt|psridhar: u decide ...overcall 1s and then?|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|hT|nt|daman: asll because of the 1NT bid|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzwu: fast play tricks missed.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes double dummy south cud have been endplayed to concede a ruff and discard|pg||
pc|h5|nt|psridhar: 1s all pass wont be sweet|pg||
nt|psridhar: no end play -south can always rise with h ace and play another ..but decl cd hv tested that|pg||
nt|r_tibre: another 7/8 imps to dsm on 42, and 41 disputed|pg||
pc|h6|pg||

mc|4|nt|vugraphzwu: water break|pg||

nt|daman: no gain|pg||
nt|daman: push|pg||
nt|daman: +140 vs +150|pg||
nt|tcpant: OK initially they wrote 1@S making 10 tricks|pg||
nt|psridhar: right i also went by that pant|pg||
nt|tcpant: That was making it +170 Vs 150 for 1 IMP|pg||
nt|daman: 5 more boards|pg||

nt|rv: none for commentators and also for souvenir article writers:)|pg||
nt|psridhar: i will take at least a beer off you rv-no escape :)|pg||
nt|r_tibre: well.. S contrived to go -1 in 4@C on 42, so the gains for DSM limited to 2 imps|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Kudos are deserved for reaching the final of this gruelling event... started on Tuesday with 154 teams|pg||
nt|daman: maybe a @S partial for EW?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i shd know I got kicked out at the first hurdle|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rv: this should be a prosaic 4@s for EW|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: brb|pg||
nt|psridhar: i expect laltu to bid higher than 4s|pg||
nt|rv: another Tartan bid 2@s shows @s+another|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: Coffee time|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: no....provide for a 4-card overcall|pg||
nt|sunit: same pinch, Sunil|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 154 teams were reduced to 32 with a swiss league in 2 groups|pg||
nt|tcpant: Yes Sunit will also have same pinch....:(:(:(|pg||
mb|p|pc|d6|nt|panja: so..don't correct from a minor suit|pg||
nt|patricck: but then if partner overcalls 4 carders that regularly that I am altering my bidding then maybe the 1@S is alertable so that the opponents are given full information as well|pg||
nt|brolucius: Despite the success of his previous 2@S overcall, Banerjee cannot risk it again on that hand when vulnerable.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and the 32 played a mini Swiss of 8 rounds to identify the quarter finalists|pg||
nt|psridhar: d1 ?|pg||
nt|daman: this will hold them to 8 tricks|pg||
pc|d3|nt|patricck: Welcome back for the last board of this set, there is one more segment of 12 boards after this|pg||
nt|panja: hi all|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Panja|pg||
nt|panja: 2@H @H and another, 3@H  showing another to be @S?|pg||
nt|rv: competitive part-score hand|pg||
pc|dK|nt|psridhar: that is a strange looking 2d Vul !|pg||
nt|panja: minor legal issue, often a trade barrier to ideas, but that is a mere detail to let opponents know|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sunsamvar: Whisky time for you Patrick ?|pg||
nt|patricck: not that late in the evening...and as it happens I don't drink :)|pg||
nt|patricck: hard enough to play this game without drinking as well :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: good -we need such people to keep the Whisky prices in check :)|pg||
nt|sunit: making 2|pg||
pc|d7|nt|psridhar: wd laltu|pg||
nt|rv: well judged by Laltu, 5 level was not very safe on combined hands of EW|pg||
nt|rv: with @h void, it makes sense to be prudent since you can expect half of partner's minimal values to be in that suit|pg||
nt|panja: % view....if W held 5 small @H and @CA, this could be wrong|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sunsamvar: atleast Sunit survived the first hurdle|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|tcpant: The score for this till board 27 turns out to be 33-29 in favour of DSM|pg||
pc|d2|nt|psridhar: are NS on the same wavelength on this bd? |pg||
pc|d9|nt|psridhar: ty pant|pg||
nt|rv: I expect this match to go down to the wire, may be decided on last 4-5 boards|pg||
nt|psridhar: continues to be a close match|pg||
nt|tcpant: That means Railwys leading 59-58 till bd 27|pg||
pc|s5|nt|panja: well, with 4 small @H, North expected a stiff @H in South hand|pg||
nt|psridhar: S said i hv blacks can u compete..and N says I got the diamonds?|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|psridhar: strange auction|pg||
nt|sunit: that was because i did not play on day 1 and 2|pg||
nt|tcpant: This will gain 4 IMPs for Rlys ... CR 1 down in 3@S|pg||
nt|psridhar: if he shifts to a low club and decl plays spd king off tbl d1|pg||
nt|sunit: i started playing on day 3 and ensured by day 4 the team is out|pg||
nt|sunit: but that would be a certain misplay|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Good for me Sunit... atleast you were not round to spoil my chances in the IMP pairs :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes agree|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|nt|rv: all of these folks have been partners, team-mates and opps so many times|pg||
pc|s4|nt|psridhar: but he might make it|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|pc|s8|pc|s3|pg||
nt|psridhar: if S passed 2d it will be the final cont?|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|psridhar: if he can guess the kqjx in dia with W|pg||
pc|h8|nt|brolucius: Many thanks to our excellent VG operator!|pg||

nt|vugraphzwu: thanks for the compliments.....still learning|pg||
nt|brolucius: Dhampur Sugar is the other finalist.|pg||

pc|hA|nt|panja: E hand is dead now|pg||
nt|psridhar: E prepared to miss game then?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer has been gifted the trump position. He had no real reason to get it right on a passive return.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|c6|nt|tcpant: Well done Sunil in IMP Pairs... Congratulations|pg||
pc|cA|nt|psridhar: wow 8 tricks around EW's nacks !|pg||

nt|rv: lot of bragging rights attached in addition to the small matter of most prestigious national title|pg||
nt|psridhar: kushari might hv considered ducking the club|pg||
pc|c5|nt|vugraphzwx: No 3 of 12 boards|pg||
nt|panja: is that all?|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: yes|pg||
nt|psridhar: ok i stand corrected 3X12|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: next session coming shortly|pg||

pc|c2|pg||

nt|rv: Sumit's regular pd is Bhabesh for DSM|pg||
nt|rv: if he had passed 3@d, Bhabesh would have Xed again and then he could have bid 4@c to play there|pg||
nt|psridhar: there was no way for kushari to 'invite' 5c- perhaps X 3D followed by 4c =game try in cl? so 4c was absolutely competing thats all?|pg||
nt|psridhar: these are fine partnership issues|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: again he thinks he is badly down and is tring to swing|pg||
nt|sunit: so railways up by 6, a real thriller|pg||

mb|p|nt|patricck: well at least we dind't miss anything, board 12 seemed an almost certain flat board|pg||
nt|psridhar: wont laltu get tired of holding those aces and kings? :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: if kushari passed 3d , i am unsure Babesh will act- no 3/4 level safety in his hand to X again...and X again at 3 lev shd be virtually gf rv?|pg||
nt|r_tibre: S passed 2@D-x in the other room, making life far easier for EW|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|psridhar: Two 9 card fits ...but neither side belongs at 3 level -strange violation of Law !|pg||
nt|panja: vs 3Nt, @H lead, or @CJ anyone?|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|patricck: In fact the total tricks is only 15, despite that good shape I think that NS only make 1@D|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes and the Railways Discipline that i mentioned earlier wins them the part score swing|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|r_tibre: i agree, 4@C is simply competing with shape|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: a useful 7 imps at this vulnerability|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: no harm in duckind a couple of @S|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|s7|pg||
nt|psridhar: and a 3rd Rwy lead this match|pg||
nt|tcpant: This is a flat bd, but DSM will have chance in next bd... Their EW is playing in 2S which will make against 3H by NS which also makes|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|nt|r_tibre: very strange auction in the other room though... 1@H-2@D-x-p!-3c-p-p-3@D-4@c-p-5@C!!!|pg||

nt|tcpant: In CR, contract 2NT by East making 3|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|bigtrain: the law always needs adjusted for minor honor subtractions (cards that a side holds that don't contribute to the offense) - on this hand there are ALOT|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rv: Sumit clearly has 1 or both majors, but Bhabesh has all the values and entries, so tough choice I would guess|pg||

nt|patricck: will duck a spade in case East wants to switch. Once @SA gone you have to cash out and move on|pg||

nt|bigtrain: i have to disagree with that statement strenuously  :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: very valuable tool -- assuming it's applied correctly|pg||
nt|drkvas: i fell@cj best as u have most values n tenaces pt cant have much so let dec do his work|pg||
nt|panja: partner could hv @HJTx....for @H to work...not unreasonable expectation|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: now the lead down to 5 imps|pg||
nt|psridhar: Docvas- in Std 3c can be 5-4 with 12 hcp OR 5-5 with 14 hcp in that auction, so rana shd hv passed 3d and hoped his pd wd compete to 4c|pg||
nt|daman: I wonder what happened there?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i think Sridhar got it right|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: pass for me with Laltu's hand|pg||
nt|psridhar: right Panja, when u hv no clear lead u hv to hope for spots with pd on the suit u lead|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and west discarded his @Hq|pg||
nt|psridhar: more impotantly kushari got it rt :)|pg||
nt|sunit: north south can make 3hearts on a non trump lead|pg||
nt|sunit: and ew 2sp|pg||
mb|1H|nt|psridhar: still i agree that 5c in that auction is over optimistc|pg||
mb|p|nt|drkvas: rt ps as u said fine tuning of partnerships|pg||
mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|psridhar: 5 imp 3 bds -this is like a ODI between india nad lanka|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: why did North not balance with 1@D ?|pg||
nt|psridhar: Did Laltu really pass out 1c? |pg||
nt|tcpant: Scores 69-58 in favour of Ind Rly|pg||
nt|drkvas: yes u have a point panja but no lead is clear cut may be@cj n @h 40 60|pg||
nt|panja: very good 3N here|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: but..it can be defeated|pg||
nt|drkvas: old malani school says once no game no game.|pg||
nt|prasenjit1: bhul|pg||
mb|d|nt|rv: 4@h makes as cards are|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: if Sumit had Xed, Bhabesh might have run out to 4@d:)|pg||
nt|panja: declarer needs entry to Dummy to cash @D..so has to play a small @C off..upon which EW can cash 3 Spades|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sunit: nice bid by kushari|pg||
mb|3S|nt|drkvas: so either pt with shape can compete with out fear of the hangmans knot|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: they can beat 1C ...but it is tempting to balance on that red suit holding|pg||
nt|patricck: i vote for 1@D|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes - Bhabesh shd hv done more than 2H-on that hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: I expect Sumit and Laltu to find the defense to beat this|pg||
nt|sunit: well done dhampur, the match is really getting gripping|pg||
nt|psridhar: 123-124 with 2 bds -wow|pg||
nt|tcpant: This makes it interesting... On a non H lead 6 IMPs will go DSM way and they will lead by 1|pg||
nt|sunit: on board 63 railways have played in a 13/10 partial, where 3nt makes|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sunsamvar: isn't duck of @D clear ?|pg||
nt|rv: fitting cards|pg||
nt|psridhar: if he is playing drury, 3h is an active option|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes bd 63 may determine the match|pg||
pc|h3|nt|tcpant: CR EW played 3@H down 1|pg||
nt|rv: as a mixed raise|pg||
nt|psridhar: this 2h will swing 6 imp the railways way|pg||
nt|tcpant: OK 3S will go 1 down and hat will be 4 IMs to DSM... and Rlys 1 UP with 2 bds to go|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|sunit: or if on 63 dhampur play in a partial, board 64 will determine the outcome of this thriller!!!!!|pg||

pc|h8|pc|h6|nt|psridhar: i defend 1C only when i feel the hand warrants me to declare in clubs !|pg||

nt|psridhar: why would Kushari disturb tht 2nt? 8 top in 2nt and 3d is down2|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rv: 2@c puppets to 2@d, Kushari's 2@h showed 6+@h Inv hand|pg||

nt|daman: well    a 3-1 fit  down 6 red when you are cold for 5 of your major seems a bit sloppy to me    and that's just one of the boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: note the 2@D rebid|pg||
nt|panja: 1@H could have been much weaker...so N cannot rebid 2@H..that would show a weak hand|pg||
