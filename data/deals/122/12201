nt|wilkinsona: and Hi to you Craig|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk7: Welcome back everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|col3435: hi all|pg||
nt|petepunt: Good morning all|pg||
nt|col3435: the flattest of boards to start with|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Hello David and Craig|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|ady: difficult for Silverstone to stop their|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: rehi everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: welcome all to the 3rd stanza|pg||
nt|athene: hi welcome back everyone|pg||
nt|col3435: hi everyone|pg||
nt|chthonic: Hello, Roland and David|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: Robson has judged well to defend|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: only 1 overboard, not a bad crossing|pg||
nt|ady: looks like a push|pg||
nt|chthonic: Yes.  hard to judge accurately|pg||
mb|p|nt|chthonic: Well, defense still has to perform|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzbe: sorry, different distribution|pg||
nt|athene: @CJ lead could be ducked by declarer|pg||
pc|d5|nt|april7: could it be a misunderstanding√ü|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hello again|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: Welcome back to Stanza 5 of the Gold Cup Semi Final  Christine|pg||
pc|d3|nt|petepunt: nice relaxing 1st board|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|pg||
pc|d8|nt|Walddk7: Morning David, Peter and Mike|pg||
pc|dK|nt|chthonic: good signaling by defense here -- I assume both have suit preferenced for hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: Welcome Back|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: Final Stanza and only 12 imps between the teams|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Good evening to Mike Gold|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphzaf: Welcome back to the 2nd stanza with your operators Christine and Stuart|pg||
nt|mdgraham: difficult to judge what the South hand is worth facing a 2NT opener|pg||
nt|athene: this would have decent chances on a minor-suit lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: AKx of hearts would be better, with the @CQ instead. @HQ is rather wasted  |pg||
nt|april7: unfortunately 1 down, no parkingplace for the @S or @D loser|pg||
nt|athene: as it is, he might duck a spade and hope for (very unlikely) minor-suit squeeze|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: S asking if 4th lead, E says no as he has doubled, therefore presuming its a 3rd or 5th card lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: we could speculate about this for some time, methinks|pg||
nt|athene: ducking a spade rectifies the count but also gives up on the @SJ being some sort of menace|pg||
nt|athene: he will be thinking about complicated three-suit squeezes without the count|pg||
nt|athene: we may be here for some time...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as one does...|pg||
nt|april7: whats the difference whether its 4th or 3d/5th lead|pg||
nt|athene: i think north should bid 3@C over 2@S here|pg||
nt|chthonic: Not sure about covering that card.  Was ten tricks, now nine|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Roland and all All distinguished players here|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: if he isn't going to open 3@C|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mdgraham: Good morning all|pg||
nt|athene: there might be some ending where you really need to know the distribution|pg||
nt|lestergold: Forrester a legend playing with well known Peter Crouch|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: e/w xenior world champions|pg||
nt|lestergold: well east is strictly speaking not west|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk7: and good morning to Jeffrey Allerton|pg||
nt|jallerton: Hello everybody|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|petepunt: hi jeff|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: Welcome back|pg||
nt|chthonic: With the club lead, five will roll smoothly|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|nt|lestergold: but west is his more regular partner and has many successes to his name|pg||
pc|h9|nt|wilkinsona: yep, Chris seemed to suspect some underhand lead from south|pg||
nt|chthonic: surely a diamond now|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|cT|pc|c5|pg||
pc|c3|nt|petepunt: looks like he wil play for a @D @C sqz that doesnt work|pg||
nt|athene: even if you got to a successful throw-in ending (e.g. @SKQ, @CQ with east) he could just exit with the @CQ to block the suit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if West throws a club now, he likely has five, with four on the table|pg||
nt|chthonic: absolutely|pg||
pc|cK|nt|april7: back again and good afternoon|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes good defence|pg||
nt|chthonic: well defended|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c8|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h2|nt|petepunt: needs KQD and 5@C with either opp|pg||

nt|yo_yo: good morning from Manchester|pg||
nt|justin c: forrester-bakhshi system is more natural|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: Welcome to the Gold Cup final|pg||
nt|justin c: and excellent players all|pg||
nt|athene: hi good morning everyone :)|pg||
nt|justin c: welcome back all|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello again Justin  and everyone from Manchester|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and everyone else too :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2 sets to go|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 16 boards|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Can Collins overtake the superstars?|pg||
nt|justin c: i thought there were 24 more|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 24 is correct|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3 x 8|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah yes i cant count    3 more including this|pg||
nt|justin c: plenty of time for collins to get back 30 odd imps|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well i dont think Allfrey's team will sit back and let them do that  but who knows|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: plenty system/defence discussion going on...|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I wonder if Patrick Collins has his usual pint of beer next to him?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: will get going in a minute|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: currently sipping a glass of water...|pg||
mb|1S|nt|justin c: hi Bill, Kath|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hi |pg||
nt|justin c: hope the players are feeling more wide awake than I am|pg||
nt|athene: you might bid 2@C on that south hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is that a 14-16 NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jwit: Good morning everyone'|pg||
mb|1N|nt|yo_yo: is that asptro in action ?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|jcwla: Hi, Jon.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jwit: Hi Jordan|pg||
nt|othered1: Rehi, everyone!|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: pity no cc  on offer so we have to guess|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D spades+another, and 2NT showing both minors i guess|pg||
nt|athene: now west knows his hearts are facing a singleton or void, which isn't great news|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: goodness, he's taking it very seriously|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hi ed|pg||
nt|justin c: hi|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: well half way thru and they are neck and neck 7 imps only one part score swing apart|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@C looks ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: Welcome back to Stanza 5 of the gold Cup final|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Kath.  Hi, Justin and Stephen.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well that with me would show a 6 card @S suit|pg||
nt|justin c: think i saw forrester rebid 2@C on a previous hand as a transfer to diamonds (which would explain this 2@S rebid)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that explains it then|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 2@S is @S and @C|pg||
pc|hA|nt|justin c: every card marked for declarer by the opening bid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Leading from Jxxx  is usually not recommended |pg||
nt|justin c: needs tricks from everywhere, with only limited entries to W|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is this a sort of double-bluff lead|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi Christine|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: Hi Everyone|pg||
nt|lestergold: this perfect fit but not easy to reach the only playable game of 5C|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Christine|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pg||
nt|jallerton: Hi all, takes a @c switch to beat 4@h|pg||
pc|c9|nt|justin c: fourth highest of yr longest & strongest :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes we were all taught that one|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: leading declarer's known short suit is almost always safe|pg||
nt|lestergold: This may even be a good result because 3N only needs the dim finesse which happens to be wrong |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cT|pg||
nt|jallerton: @d7 is a wishy washy card|pg||
nt|jwit: Robson will find the switch|pg||
nt|jallerton: @dA asked for (reverse) attitude|pg||
nt|jallerton: He might even underlead in @d - only one lower pip missing|pg||
nt|jallerton: so Q(9)(8)7 looks likely holding in partner|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I agree but in case W DBLs 2@H, it would be easier for E to bid @C|pg||
nt|yo_yo: thanks Stephen, keep us informed|pg||
nt|tweety1: Hello every1|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hi |pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|pc|h2|nt|yo_yo: that @C109  is like gold dust|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Last time i was in Forrester was playing with Bakhski|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|jallerton: well donw|pg||
pc|dA|nt|justin c: y|pg||
nt|justin c: unpleasant choice for Bakhshi here|pg||
nt|athene: endplayed in four suits :)|pg||
nt|athene: that's usually the way when your partner brings so little to the party|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he has to work out which is the least of all eveils|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: a diamond looks normal|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|d6|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Now Bakshi is playing with Andrew Robson|pg||
nt|tweety1: Bakshish:)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: very flexible obviously|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|nt|tweety1: do you know what bakshis mean?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's a difficult hame :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no, is it polite?|pg||
nt|tweety1: lol|pg||
nt|tweety1: Its an English word|pg||
nt|tweety1: == tip|pg||
nt|yo_yo: equals?|pg||
nt|justin c: @C ruff is eventually going to be the 8th trick|pg||
nt|tweety1: =tip|pg||
pc|cK|nt|yo_yo: no i give in|pg||
nt|tweety1: Its one of the english words taken from Turkish|pg||
nt|tweety1: so back to bridge|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i got it, a tip you would give to a waiter|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|jwit: He probably shifted to the club at trick two fearing declarer had Qxx or QJx for 3NT bid|pg||
pc|s6|nt|yo_yo: i see an endplay looming |pg||
nt|athene: now he can throw north in with the diamond to lead into the clubs, if he reads the position|pg||
nt|justin c: hi all|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Justin|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|justin c: Cash some spades then endplay north with the @DQ to lead into the @C|pg||
nt|tweety1: yes:)|pg||
pc|c4|pc|d8|pc|c8|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: north will drop the @DQ (the card he is known to hold) under the @DA|pg||
nt|justin c: thus completing a fairly miserable hand for poor north|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sQ|nt|jwit: Sorry everyone, supposed to be in other room|pg||

nt|Walddk7: 13 tricks??|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: Welcome to the Gold cup Semifinal Christine Walker operating|pg||
nt|mdgraham: (on a 2-1 trump split)|pg||
nt|april7: du√ºlication of values|pg||
nt|xenya: EW were a bit lucky on that one|pg||
nt|col3435: yes not much going on in that board|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: doubt N will raise 1N here|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lestergold: u would normally want to be in 4S on the e/w cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes, surprising decision from west to pass 3nt with four spades and a small doubleton|pg||
nt|col3435: 14-16 NT, I believe?|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|april7: here we have an easy 4@S contract|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not a superb exampple of a 2@C overcall|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 3N seems to work here ith 5 clubs off|pg||
nt|chthonic: It has been suggested that a club at trick two would have made the defense harder.  True, but declarer must also guess clubs.  I am told that was done at other table but clubs not ...|pg||
nt|chthonic: guessed|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Tony Wilkinson|pg||
nt|lestergold: and they are|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Hi everyone, close match|pg||
nt|lestergold: Waterlow will not expect 5 spades on his left on the bidding|pg||
mb|1N|mb|d|nt|jallerton: 1@d = "Stayman"|pg||
nt|mdgraham: In the other s/f Matheson - Sime bid 1N-3N. @HK lead|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1NT =17-19|pg||
nt|athene: north way too good for 3@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but no convenient cue-bid; it's possible to use 2NT in that position as the good raise|pg||
nt|april7: it wil be a 4@H contract for EW|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: hard to see how many spades there are for NS|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear Crouch to the 'rescue'|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chthonic: What was 2H?  |pg||
nt|col3435: well it looks like this sequence shows an invite with 4 spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: finding the usual Jxx in dummy |pg||
nt|petepunt: 1@C two + ?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ady: chance for Robson    has to sniff club position|pg||
nt|chthonic: This will be difficult enough at the five level...|pg||
nt|chthonic: He cannot really bid six |pg||
nt|chthonic: with those spades and no spade cue bid.|pg||
nt|lestergold: hard to blame crouch he knows pard has length in spades but expects his vlaues to be elsewhere!|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 4Sx in the other room|pg||
nt|lestergold: big swing to Waterlow in the wings then|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Tony|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Hi again Mike ..I have been re-rostered|pg||
nt|lestergold: in time to see Forrester roasted here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Paul leads his partners suit|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: my partners stopped leading my suits a while back|pg||
nt|lestergold: Im not convinced of the soundness o Crouch's actions here with an aceless 6 count and a poor heart suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: at end of day Crouch should realise that his club values are not working too well in offence|pg||
pc|h2|nt|petepunt: X of 2@S would be negative and show similar ahand for N|pg||
nt|athene: four top losers, and nowhere to put them even if the defence don't cash them right off|pg||
nt|athene: @H1097 lead more likely than @HK onside; maybe you rise ace here|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: 17-19 3Hts|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: perhaps he just decided that with everyone bidding, Robson had to have a light 2@C overcall, so 3@C wasn't going to hurt|pg||
nt|april7: after ace of@D E has a choice ow plays and might guess wrong, so E must help and lead @C after K of @H|pg||
nt|athene: a trump lead is possible, with declarer known to have three|pg||
nt|athene: trying just to stop a ruff in the closed hand|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: but that sort of "trusting opponents" strategy can allow opps to talk you out of things|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: dare I say I'm not convinced by the soundness of norths double|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|jallerton: yes, any 11-13/17-19 bal or natural|pg||
nt|athene: of course it might find partner's @HQ :)|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: better to trust your partner|pg||
pc|s7|nt|april7: good duck by N|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|chthonic: Well on the way to nine tricks with straightforward play|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: may be able to get a count now|pg||
nt|ady: can make now without club finesse|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|xenya: 1@D showed @Hs, 2@HS was 4 hearts and minimum -- well, S decided it was worth bidding 4|pg||
nt|lestergold: im getting questionjs from specs is Crouch the footballer -answer er .... no.... another do we agree with forrester's double?|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|pc|h3|nt|jallerton: The @d play for 3 tricks anyway, so the lead did not give away the contract|pg||
nt|chthonic: but needed to play diamonds|pg||
nt|col3435: lack of entries to dummy gives you something to worry about|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|april7: E guessed wron but still down because 9 and 10 of @D dont drop|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|dT|pg||
nt|athene: if declarer had the @D10, it would be necessary for west to play a club now|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: so well done|pg||
nt|ady: now set up long diamond|pg||
nt|lestergold: it was dangerous but passing is also dangerous|pg||
pc|h4|nt|petepunt: playing 1n as 17-19 means you can bid over 1@C on very min values safely|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: east, of course, knows the diamonds aren't going anywhere for declarer|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: mind u on this hand this crouch bravely rushed in for the ball just l;ike his fottball namesake|pg||
pc|c4|pc|sQ|nt|athene: north has to play @SQ right away to block the suit|pg||
nt|ady: cant think why Silverstone dis not cash 2nd spade  and then switch to a diamond|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well oppo seem to be running into trouble so I like the pass found elsewhere|pg||
nt|lestergold: dixon lutrked in the long grass and pounced with the north hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: Dixon was of course a great money player in his youth|pg||
nt|lestergold: money p,layers often have a killer insinct combined with  protective hide|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|nt|col3435: what would 1@c : 1M mean? do we know?|pg||
nt|athene: as well as causing problems in the bidding, the nebulous 1@C opener can make things hard for the defence in the play, though - they might not think of declarer having a concealed ...|pg||
nt|athene: trick source in diamonds|pg||
nt|chthonic: eight. then|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|jallerton: N/S play an interesting treatment: 1@h/@S response to 1@c shows a 5+-card suit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: knowing Crouch, it won't be natural|pg||
nt|athene: oh, sorry, the @DQ is good too :) no need|pg||
nt|april7: 11 tricks  not needing double finesese|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like 14 imps to waterlow|pg||
mc|7|nt|petepunt: id1@D stayman that figures|pg||
nt|jallerton: No, Crouch has to play Forrester's system!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: quite right too|pg||
nt|Walddk7: They make lots of overtricks at this table|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Great players|pg||
nt|april7: otherwise might go down|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: so, both rooms missed game|pg||

mb|1C|nt|wilkinsona: Hi everyone only 12 imps in it, 8 boards to go|pg||
mb|1D|nt|justin c: early morning auctions|pg||
mb|1S|nt|wilkinsona: 4-4 spade fir for EW, but not a nice break|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@h = 4+@s|pg||
nt|athene: proof how much it's good to bid aggressively after a 1NT opener from opps|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2S|nt|justin c: 6@S here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: 3N by N/S looks like a trick short|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: Peter Crouch was part of the winning Premier League team here a few weeks ago|pg||
pc|d6|nt|justin c: this is going to struggle|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I havent seen him  play with Forrester before  |pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: grand slam here is a little better than the diamond finesse, but not much better|pg||
nt|justin c: or 6NT|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: and it does fail to @SJxxx offside, so i doubt anyone is going to be bidding it|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2 Kings and 3 card support  is good|pg||
nt|justin c: chances for a 13th in both minors|pg||
nt|lestergold: but it could be a push at 3N-1 in both rooms|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jallerton: 4th highest of longest and strongest!|pg||
nt|athene: this all looks like an old-fashioned precision auction|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt natural GF; 2@S natural; 2NT minimum without @SHxx or better|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh on this lead i forgot|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jcwla: Hi, Tony.  Well, 4@H came home in the CR, so 10 to Allfrey and Waterlow can't take any more hits like that.|pg||
nt|athene: 3@C improvising; now 3@S shows support|pg||
pc|d8|nt|jallerton: probably 3@h showed a minisplinter in @d and West tried 4@S knowing the EW hands to be fiting well|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 3@H showed a shortage 'somewhere'|pg||
nt|justin c: not an easy hand to bid|pg||
nt|tweety1: To me as a foreigner, Forrester  team members are rather more popular than Collins'.|pg||
nt|justin c: two diamonds, two clubs, two hearts|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h3|nt|jallerton: OK, thanks Stephen|pg||
nt|lestergold: could be a swing because west's hand is not a mandatory overcall|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @C and possible 9|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: west might just bash the grand slam in when he finds his partner with the red kings|pg||
nt|justin c: a Q in east rather than those jacks would be 13 on top|pg||
nt|lestergold: ht lead created 9th trick|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I presume Gerald Tred hasnt shown a 2@C hand yet |pg||
nt|justin c: and still problems for dec|pg||
nt|yo_yo: more well known?  yes certainly|pg||
nt|justin c: if he draws trump they can cash diamonds, if not, a @C ruff for East|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Forrester is probably our best known player  or maybe Andrew Robson|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jallerton: Robson must have guessed it was @d from his hand|pg||
nt|tweety1: So I support Crouch team:)|pg||
nt|tweety1: Go Collins gooo:)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: The English typically support the underdogs|pg||
nt|tweety1: Collins not crouch sry|pg||
pc|c9|nt|tweety1: yes?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: he can count 12 on top and 13 might be cold; can't be worse than a finesse|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: now 6minor will elicit a 6@H cue from east, which might do it|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lestergold: rest is routine for Forrester|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true and that too Q|pg||
nt|justin c: think he might have made 9 without @H lead|pg||
nt|justin c: much harder to play of course|pg||
nt|lestergold: id be delighted to have two honours i9n pard's overalled suit wouldnot ex[pect that leading one would conmcede the contract|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well without lead he only had 3 clubs a heart two spades and two dims available- perhaps squeeze throw in misdefence etc but not at all obvious to me that the contract would make|pg||
nt|rnmalik: but a brave bid|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|pg||
nt|athene: ok, he gives up|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: i don't think east would have bid any differently with a minor-suit queen instead of those two jacks|pg||
nt|athene: so i am not sure this is a triumph for the strong club, personally|pg||
nt|athene: or the @HQ instead|pg||
nt|athene: or a doubleton club :)|pg||
nt|justin c: i guess in 7@S you ruff the third @D to try to drop the @DQ, then when it doesn't appear finish trumps|pg||
nt|justin c: needing either minor suit q to drop, or a minor suit squeeze (or a double squeeze around @H)|pg||
nt|athene: i think in 7@S the best percentage is just cash the @CAK trying to drop the @CQ, and fall back on the diamond finesse?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: maybe the squeezes are better chance|pg||
nt|rnmalik: now he does not want to make it|pg||
nt|lestergold: but he still can|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes that is obvious|pg||
nt|lestergold: and i think he will|pg||
nt|rnmalik: if he can A@C only then|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant see how he can go wrong actually|pg||
pc|s2|nt|justin c: hard to work out the combined odds of all the possibilities|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|justin c: @D play now looks like 2 off|pg||
pc|s9|nt|yo_yo: The Collins teams are last year's losing finalists|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk7: Good, both scores corrected now|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the defence have lots of time to get their club established against 4@S here|pg||

nt|april7: 2 giants meet|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: JD lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 4@S looks normal for north, assuming 1@S promised five|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: shows hearts|pg||
mb|1C|nt|athene: wow, he splinters!?|pg||
nt|petepunt:  4@S looks eniugh for me |pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: the overtricks have vanished :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: Waterlow one of the games great gentlemen not a ompliment i hand out lightly|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|april7: e won't give up|pg||
nt|athene: some might bid only 3@S with south over the double, but you don't really know what to do when they then bid 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: so you might as well take the "4@S over 4@H" push right away|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: best lead for the defence here|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: now double from east|pg||
nt|xenya: 1@S = 1NT|pg||
nt|april7: N will afterwards consider 5@S|pg||

nt|athene: surprising lack of activity from east|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: He's doing a great job at the other table|pg||
nt|chthonic: Hi, Christine.|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: E?W did well not to save bit now theyhave to take care in def|pg||
mb|2S|nt|april7: even making a slam try|pg||
mb|p|nt|chthonic: or back to nine ok, too|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: strangely may be correct to have ducked the J|pg||
nt|chthonic: interesting point.|pg||
mb|p|nt|chthonic: JD in other room?  Seems same line would have brought in contract.  Robson's play was very nice -- not tested to find club queen as he would have been if two spades were cashed|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: how on earth did 5@H make in the other room? :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: I remmeber sparring with Watermow 40 years ago at the Harrow Bridge Club when i was a real beginner as opposed to merely an old begiiner|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mdgraham: in order to take the spade finesse, perhaps....|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk7: lol|pg||
nt|april7: 4th @D could be the second discard|pg||
nt|chthonic: this is not best, though|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: spade ok for +1 it seems|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|april7: and will|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I meant JD lead gave 11 tricks to this contract|pg||
pc|sA|nt|april7: so 6@H would have been a good save, but N made the forward move to stop EW|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: this ok too|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: Silverstone led his aces|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: this should go off now|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: west gets in with a heart to promote a second trump it seems|pg||
pc|c7|nt|chthonic: now the entry is gone for spades|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: so Forrester had two pitches for diamonds, with the ruffing finesse in spades|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|justin c: 3@C some sort of 'mixed' raise|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and if he had 4@S then|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jcwla: A textbook 26-HCP 3NT here.|pg||
nt|jallerton: nasty lead for North to have to make|pg||
nt|jallerton: He was half right - partner does have a 5-card major!|pg||
nt|jcwla: On 26, while Robson was down 2 in 4@SX here, Forrester was down 2 in 5@DX in the CR -- a gain of 14 to Waterlow to within 8.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i see Forrester doesnt mind a 5422 hand to open 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: north can't bid stayman because 1NT - 2@C; 2@D - 2@S isn't that hand for them|pg||

mb|p|nt|dburn:  3@c mixed raise, 3@d "last train" game try|pg||
mb|2D|nt|justin c: this has losers everywhere|pg||
nt|dburn:  then he would bid spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: 10 tricks for EW in @C, but not easy to balance here|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4 card too|pg||
nt|tweety1: 2 @c check back|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|dburn:  a radical approach, perhaps, but it has some technical merit|pg||

nt|vugraphzyf: 2@D was minimum|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|pc|dJ|nt|athene: if north had started with 2@C, east could have doubled, and then west would have an easy 3@C bid|pg||

mb|1H!|mb|p|nt|athene: 6@H always makes, doesn't it?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: sure is with these tens|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 5@C certainly wouldn't be everyone's choice, with three first-round controls|pg||
nt|athene: will declarer play on clubs or diamonds?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hard to tell from W hand what the NT range is:)|pg||
nt|chthonic: Spade and a heart shift will set this, of course|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|col3435: 14-16 I think (for both pairs)|pg||
nt|chthonic: And that seems likely|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 4Hx nipper and tucker|pg||
nt|ady: yes you could say north's take-out double a little thin|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jallerton: Do you agree with North's t/o double?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: but he was a bit unlucky his partner had such a great heart suit|pg||
nt|athene: and nothing at all wasted in spades|pg||
nt|petepunt: trying to cut out @S suit with his opening , i suspect|pg||
nt|athene: double is game-try (3@S would be merely competing)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: this time cards lying badly for declarer it seems|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|petepunt: non vul yes, but vul|pg||
nt|april7: the only way toplay 7@H is the ruffing finesse in @C and fortunate @H are 2-2. Hand much to strong for a 5@C opening.imo|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s9|pc|sK|nt|yo_yo: i believe Bakhshi has shown a strong hand when he bids again|pg||
nt|athene: if you overcall on rubbish, some people play you have to *pass* with a good hand, and come in later|pg||
nt|athene: forrester bid 4@H hoping opps would bid 4@S over it|pg||

nt|vugraphzaf: Short comment by N!|pg||
nt|col3435: he knew West had doubleton heart|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: thanks|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think we can safely assume that|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: Contract -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: was very good x by dixon|pg||
nt|ady: 6 imps|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|d|nt|wilkinsona: sorry i meant the lead 104-100|pg||
mb|p|nt|col3435: I was a bit surprised West passed it - wouldn't you be worried about never having shown three hearts?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: swing of 6 imps on earlies board though when a strong loogin 2 heart bid from Allfrey stole it|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jallerton: take-out double by Dixon|pg||
nt|ady: ok   ses close|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: thanks Stuart|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: i think waterlow had a double here with west|pg||
mb|2H|nt|petepunt: no, 2@Cx making is no disaster|pg||
nt|lestergold: pass very conservative|pg||
nt|lestergold: he has 17 and 4 of the other major|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: another good board for leading your own suit, NOT partner's|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: True, David, but North's double told him hearts were not breaking|pg||
mb|p|pc|cQ|pc|c2|nt|ady: 15 hcp  n/s   playing in 1NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: undoubled|pg||
pc|c6|nt|wilkinsona: yas, and a swing still needed|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|athene: interesting sequence here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: this appears to be on the trump hook, and after that diamond lead from ace must be odds on|pg||
nt|chthonic: easy to see from our vantage point that ace of clubs, ruff, AK of trumps and a diamond works.  But what else?    Except the heart finesse|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|wilkinsona: diamond J for -4|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c4|nt|mdgraham: possible 5@C sacrifice EW, but you don't have to sacrifice if the opps don't bid game|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and anyway not obvious how EW get in the bidding|pg||
nt|petepunt: its a perfect fit n/s |pg||
nt|jallerton: Do you want to play this hand in game? I suppose it's virtually cold if @s are 2-2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: three minor losers, and the hearts can be played either way |pg||
nt|petepunt: need to guess 1major suit right |pg||
nt|athene: 3@C was clearly intended as pre-emptive|pg||
nt|lestergold: givi8ng opps easy ride in 2 of a minor is nor normally recommended bridge altho here cards not lying too well for e/w so their 'pushing' power is limited|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|athene: west can put two spades through but it doesn't quite give east three trump tricks|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: will silverstone hook the @S9 for the overtrick? :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jallerton: why do you have to guess @h?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: trouble is 3N may de on EW|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mdgraham: no, the third heart goes on a diamond |pg||
nt|athene: but i am not sure you can play that without a lot of artificial kit, because you need some way to make a real (invitational) 3@C bid|pg||
nt|col3435: South doesn't have much for his 4@d here|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: Silverstone could have taken action    asfar as Dixon was concerned Silverstone might have a bust|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep 11 tricks now on, testing spades lead required to hold to 10 maybe|pg||
pc|hK|nt|chthonic: this will be bloody |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3NT EW certainly has chances on a heart lead from South|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and was in fact made in OR|pg||
pc|s2|nt|petepunt: y|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still early :)|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|chthonic: different order, same idea|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: he might not have to, of course; robson might not want to pitch a heart|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|wilkinsona: so this is damage limitation|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h7|pc|h4|pc|c3|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk7: Welcome to David Stern|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mdgraham: if EW get this four down, there will be some fun scoring up: "plus 630" "plus 400" "it was game all" "we know"|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: might as well go @DQ, diamond ruff with the @H9|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes well done Victor, keeps the Waterlow team in the match|pg||
nt|davidstern: Hi All|pg||
nt|davidstern: Hi Tony|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Hi David|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|april7: 2@C pass would have been enough, what was the 3@C bid for?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: that gains if someone has @D10xx left but the singleton diamond doesn't have the @H10|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Victor takes his second chance to put the club through|pg||

nt|athene: very tricky for north, when in with the diamond|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i was not expecting that spectacular misplay|pg||
nt|rnmalik: what are we watching, I was thinking about a missed game and there we are|pg||
nt|dburn:  he did not clearly misplay|pg||
nt|dburn:  at least, not as clearly as you are misanalysing|pg||
nt|lestergold: why not run the dim round to his hand discar a heart from dummy|pg||
nt|othered1: this has tightened up considerably|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: that would have given him most chances|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes, more interesting now :)|pg||
mb|1C|mb|d|nt|dburn:  because if South ruffed with the jack of spades and endplayed dummy with a club, he would go down|pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: it looked natural to attack declarer's trump holding by giving the ruff/discard in hearts, but it allowed the extra elopement with the small spade in west's hand|pg||
nt|justin c: y, i think that @h play was a mistake, but not easy for him|pg||
nt|lestergold: on aspeciic layout yes|pg||
mb|1S|nt|othered1: some might consider a number of @H on west's hand.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|jallerton: 4@h, dbl?|pg||
nt|tweety1: 4 @h EW on @d lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Patterson judges he is too good for  4@H overcall|pg||
nt|othered1: Both w ests in this match doubled.|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree.  What about 1@H?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lestergold: but how can he justify burning a high card such as QS when the KJ( are all ouitstanding|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: KJ and 9!|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|yo_yo: it's awful when it's passed out though|pg||
nt|justin c: X then @H looks normal|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jallerton: a well judged 3@H bid, I suppose @sK rates to be sitting over|pg||
nt|tweety1: 1 wld bid 4 @h instead of dbl here|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|yo_yo: anyone explain the bidding?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: it all looked normal until 3@S|pg||
nt|justin c: dont know the details of the bidding system, but 4@S is where you want to be|pg||
nt|dburn:  the queen would be the right play unless South had either the singleton king or a void, and was probably declarer's percentage shot|pg||
pc|c8|nt|othered1: With the relatively flat hand, I'd bid 1@H -- in the minority but likely not alone|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well I wouldnt like to argue with Robson or Patterson|pg||
nt|yo_yo: They have won more things than me|pg||
nt|othered1: Nor would I as to judgment -- this is amatter of style.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and anyone wanting a free lesson from the master (Robson)  go to : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DQ2K2rwnL8|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
nt|lestergold: you may be right but im really not convinced- the trump lenngth was marked with north in any case|pg||
pc|cK|nt|yo_yo: you might not know Veysel that the Collins team lost in this final last year|pg||
nt|tweety1: Happy to know|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h4|nt|tweety1: But|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|athene: now a heart back does at least force east without giving away a heart trick|pg||
nt|athene: if forrester had started with the @HA, it would set up a ruffing finesse against his partner|pg||
nt|henryb: Surely East should have played a @c back? Declarer either has Axx or xx, and in either case it must be right?|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|justin c: 25 imps for Allfrey on the last three boards|pg||
nt|tweety1: I dot agrre with the @h q ruff here|pg||
pc|s3|pc|d2|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: discarding is right for declarer of course; now he doesn't need the diamond onside|pg||
nt|justin c: choosing the safest line|pg||
nt|athene: can just ruff a heart in hand and throw a diamond on the club, and dummy is good|pg||

nt|chthonic: Ouch|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: North not happy!!!|pg||
nt|davidstern: 4@S for EW looks the go here|pg||
nt|lestergold: Waterlow is the anchor player of this partnershuip probably under 'instructions' from hackett to play his steady game andleave the fireworks to partner|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mdgraham: chance missed for EW there - the little red card stayed in the box|pg||
nt|davidstern: Obviously no diamond lead in the OR|pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: 1@S opener or 2NT?|pg||
nt|athene: double is a possible alternative for south|pg||
nt|athene: but he prefers to get the good suit in|pg||
nt|april7: 5@C or 3NT for the lucky position of the @D suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: No -4 agreed|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|athene: 1@S forcing, no major (X would be hearts; 1@H would be spades)|pg||
nt|davidstern: Even so how do you make six|pg||
nt|davidstern: On a heart lead would you really finesse?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|davidstern: Ah win heart and four rounds of clubs pitching heart and three diamonds |pg||
nt|davidstern: South ruffs with natural trump trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|col3435: there goes the lead, then|pg||
nt|chthonic: Rather a disastrous set|pg||
nt|col3435: that's a big advantage disappear in 5 boards|pg||
mb|3C|nt|petepunt: isnt 1n 17-19 ?|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@d = no 5-card major, 1NT =17-19|pg||
nt|athene: many would overcall 2@D with north|pg||
nt|april7: EW has a partscore in @S and NS might try a @C partscore|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|athene: but robson is there for him!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|april7: W will X and E will bid 2@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: Waterlow had a very distinguished career in industry whereas Hackett 's profession has been bridge for many decades|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: no fears about re-opening|pg||
nt|athene: i'm not a big fan of 1NT, with only one spade stop|pg||
nt|athene: silverstone just needs to know if his partner has a singleton diamond|pg||
nt|athene: if he has, 6@C must be good|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|col3435: so what does N have avaiable here? Is this showing short @c?|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: 3@S - singleton club 3 suit hand|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|vugraphzaf: In principle 44 Majors  but TF judged his hand|pg||
nt|petepunt: will worry @D may be 4-1|pg||
nt|jallerton: Declarer may try to lead a @s hoping 2nd hand has the ace, planning to switch to @d|pg||
nt|jallerton: though contuining @s OK if with @s 3-3 or guesses @h|pg||
nt|jallerton: Declarer does not know that @c are 4-4|pg||
nt|petepunt: looks like 7 tricks tho.|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes you might bid 1nt to show values, but here, partner is never moving over it anyway, so you aren't getting to game|pg||
nt|april7: If N finds Q of @C, 7 tricks, if not....|pg||
nt|athene: so why not just bid 2@D?|pg||
nt|april7: should E have a singleton @D then 6 @C to be made|pg||
nt|athene: i'm not sure he has  achieved much by taking this very scenic route to 3nt|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep, thats what happened OR|pg||
pc|d5|nt|petepunt: inersting tx|pg||
nt|athene: i don't have the NS system details; i assume north just asked for 5- and 4-card majors|pg||
nt|davidstern: And same going to happen here for flat board|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: he might duck this|pg||
nt|april7: down again on @S lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 6@C only beaten on a diamond lead... |pg||
pc|dT|nt|petepunt: or @Sare 4-2|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d7|nt|athene: @SK is one hurdle cleared, but no luck in either red suit|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: little red card out of the box this time|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||
nt|petepunt: spec thinks dec may be sqz;d out of 7th |pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|nt|athene: hoping his partner has an entry (major-suit ace or even @CQxx if declarer misguessed)|pg||
nt|lestergold: just the one to be made providing ofm course e/w cash out|pg||
pc|hK|nt|april7: S will try @D and then doublefinesse in @H|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|nt|athene: at BAM i think he takes the @DAK and gives up; there's too much danger of conceding 12 tricks otherwise|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: now he needs three heart tricks |pg||
nt|athene: do you start with the @HJ or a small one? the @HJ looks very silly if west has a singleton @HK|pg||
nt|athene: but gains against singleton @H10 offside or west not covering|pg||
nt|april7: I think J is best|pg||
nt|april7: i OR 2 down, should be only 1 down here|pg||

nt|othered1: or Suction?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jallerton: Was about to be the same auction as the CR|pg||

pc|d7|nt|lestergold: 5D a sane spot lots of work to o cards v favouravle of  course|pg||
nt|lestergold: Crouch off to the most challenging lead|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I hope he does not think of cross ruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: East has to deal with his spade losers one way or another|pg||
nt|lestergold: not at all obvious how to set about the hand- double dummy is one thing|pg||
nt|dburn:  indeed - easier to play seven than five|pg||
nt|lestergold: How would you play this hand David?|pg||
nt|dburn:  not clear - would win this, play a spade to the ace and lead the queen of clubs|pg||
nt|dburn:  but even Crouch would know not to cover that (assuming Forrester gives count in hearts) so would have to guess|pg||
nt|lestergold: well that would ceertsinly achieve success here but is that line obvious single dummy|pg||
nt|dburn:  it's as good as anything else to start with - I don't say I would run the queen of clubs, only that I would play it|pg||

mb|p|nt|col3435: transfer seems likely, given who South is|pg||

nt|mdgraham: depends if West drops @CK under the ace|pg||
nt|chthonic: yes, but a chance|pg||
nt|ady: ruff and discard does not help|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: gained a few imps passing out 2NT, but every possible imp needed now|pg||
pc|c3|nt|april7: but who would think of @C on this bidding|pg||
nt|april7: S is not believing in his luck|pg||
nt|april7: S doesn't trust the @D 10 lead as top of sequence and K with E, E wouldn'*t lead @D now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still a possible chance - exit trump. West has to avoid playing a spade|pg||
pc|cK|nt|chthonic: play club ace first, actually|pg||
pc|cA|nt|petepunt: not by W though|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: can still try something, though defence will find a counter now it seems|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|athene: now a spade to the @S10, maybe|pg||
nt|athene: it's always a delicate business when you want to draw trumps but preserve a trump in dummy to control a weak suit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: going for the drop of @SQ|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c9|pc|c2|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|jallerton: Do you have any reason whatsoever to expect your @d to be better than partner's @h?|pg||
nt|april7: another tough decision|pg||
nt|athene: you might play the @HA now, on the basis that even if east does have @HQxx left, you have chances of getting the diamond away on a club|pg||
nt|april7: restricted choice :)|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|nt|mdgraham: no|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c4|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: no problems now; @DQ, ruff away the ace, etc|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|lestergold: final knockings always held in the plush setting of the Peebles hotel where much fione dining take splace away from the table|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: well done|pg||
nt|april7: now comes the deserved overtrick|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s2|nt|mdgraham: against that, it could go 1@H-1N-2@h next door, so by bidding 2@H you are likely staying even |pg||

nt|jcwla: There _is_ room for an 11-IMP Waterlow gain on 32...fasten your seat belts...|pg||
nt|justin c: aggressive x|pg||
nt|dburn:  you could, but in order to get back to hand to ruff three spades, you would need to ruff clubs|pg||
nt|othered1: south didn't unblock @CK, a possible play|pg||
nt|yo_yo: phew|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Patterson thought then played it in double quick time|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: this looks as though it will be flat|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|jallerton: or maybe not with West in the auction|pg||
nt|Walddk6: 8 extra boards in the event of a tie (I think)|pg||
nt|lestergold: on another day the cross ruff would have been then only viable play|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|lestergold: i assume 2N promises zilch|pg||
nt|justin c: this is looking ominous|pg||
nt|lestergold: trouble is it raises the auction to the three level|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: East quite likely to save now I would think|pg||
nt|tweety1: 1@c alerted?|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|dburn:  well, East does not intend to sit for 2@s in any case|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: yes|pg||
nt|othered1: you don't really want to get much higher|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rnmalik: 2NT=both minors|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn:  so at some point he will have to go to the three lvel|pg||
nt|dburn:  but West might barely have passed 2NT, I suppose|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Crouch does|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|Walddk6: What was 4@C all about?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: we don't know|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: much amusement here...|pg||
nt|othered1: sure, I was remarking about the actual cards and 3 will be OK, I think|pg||
mb|4S|nt|yo_yo: 10 tricks with a @D ruff   |pg||
nt|justin c: would the @HA lead have beaten this?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well had he passed then i do not think 2S would have been doubled and probably one off only|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: or E could pass RDBL to enable W to bid 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: Even if they find the @c ruff (not at all easy) it's only 500|pg||
nt|jallerton: @C2 _should_ be suit preference.  I suppose S might play A and another expecting partner to ruff|pg||
nt|othered1: @CA lead might be enough to let declarer squeek by|pg||
pc|d6|nt|yo_yo: the other table in 3@H|pg||
nt|tweety1: very brave 4 @s|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I wouldnt like to accuse Peter Crouch of overbidding but....|pg||
pc|dA|nt|justin c: pass means he wants to defend, does it not?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i dont know their system but i do know i want to stay low very low with east's de factoYarborough|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: Declarer not happy with his dummy!|pg||
nt|lestergold: really what a surprise|pg||
nt|lestergold: m,ind you i see dummies like that all the time so i wouldnt flinch|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: He called it 'disgusting'|pg||
nt|rnmalik: only|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|yo_yo: West cant get in to lead another trumps , so no|pg||
pc|c6|nt|justin c: sry, u are right.  had a blind spot|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this result will be pretty disgusting especuially when they are already trailing 27 imps on the second half of this final|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|tweety1: so -1|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but kibs arent so polite :)|pg||
nt|tweety1: imps to my team|pg||

pc|d7|pc|s8|pc|d4|pg||

nt|yo_yo: are screens in use?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: no screens|pg||
pc|h6|nt|dburn:  strange sort of ending, this - maybe North should have cashed that second diamond earlier|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|dburn:  then, South could throw a club in this position|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s5|pc|sA|pg||

nt|mdgraham: this will be competitive - NS to reach at least 5@D? |pg||
nt|athene: the opening lead away from a king gave him a tempo|pg||
nt|april7: and the contract|pg||
nt|athene: he might have made the game anyway, though, of course|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: sure|pg||
nt|davidstern: So it seems|pg||
nt|davidstern: Put me down as an opener and I AM conservative|pg||
nt|chthonic: Gee|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: last board then, so thanks to everyone|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|petepunt: last board ?|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D will get them started|pg||
nt|lestergold: well it looks like slam time|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: nice south hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: 5@D will be found now maybe |pg||
nt|april7: 4@H is maximum, so 5 @D a very good save and might push EW to 5 level|pg||
nt|athene: south might bid clubs now, for the lead|pg||
nt|athene: oh, sorry, of course he couldn't|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6C excellent altho in fact nothing wrong with 6N|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: I would open, but maybe there are system points we don't know|pg||
pc|h2|nt|josj: appeal pending in China v. Ch. Taipei match|pg||
pc|h3|nt|col3435: yes score up after every 8 boads|pg||
nt|athene: he needed two diamond tricks :)|pg||
nt|col3435: I'd bid 1@h with the North hand, I think double is unusual these days|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S  or 3NT for e/w |pg||
nt|lestergold: now surely Crouch will make some kind fo ffort with his monster|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: surprise south had to double|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6H of course also rolls in|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: avid 6 diamonds tho'|pg||
nt|lestergold: problem is south could only presumabl;y show his massive two suityer on the first ound with a bid like 4S which may have got them too high on another day|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: he doesn't know that EW aren't going to end up in spades|pg||
nt|april7: without a @C lead, perhaps Q of @H lead|pg||
nt|davidstern: A failing 4@H seems possible here. |pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|petepunt: 5@C sugested as more informative by S first time|pg||
nt|athene: west perhaps thought that dummy was likely to have a trick source in clubs, in which case an aggressive lead was necessary|pg||
pc|c4|nt|april7: due to the 6card suit W might raies to 3|pg||
nt|lestergold: they ahve avoided 6D but sadly all the other cold slams|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|chthonic: I agree.  South showed some restraint -- a good thing|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT   by Silverstone not so good on J@C lead|pg||
nt|davidstern: East will certainly bid game|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jallerton: Yes, this is the last board of the set.  Thanks to our operator, Christine Walker.|pg||
nt|col3435: they're short sets by vugraph standards|pg||
nt|petepunt: a bit of explaining needed to robson :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: funny how we tend to play sets of eight when most others seem to play sets of 16|pg||
nt|jallerton: A bit of waiting for Robson to finish too!|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: Thanks ably assisted by Stuart Bradnam|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might consider holding up the @CK and finessing diamonds into north - that would be right if north had the @HA |pg||
nt|athene: but when people respond 2@C to 1major, it's very often just a balanced hand|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well this could still be a deciding board|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|cT|nt|chthonic: I pass many hands my partners think I should open, but 13 HCP, 2 1/2 quick tricks and two four card majors is a lot|pg||
pc|c7|nt|davidstern: 3NT had some chances as they avoided the spade lead on the bidding|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|april7: E might duck @C and try to finesse @D the right way|pg||
nt|athene: but you look very silly if you lose to @DQx and south has the @HA as entry|pg||
nt|athene: anyway, the @DQ appears so all is well|pg||
nt|davidstern: That isnt the best lead for the defence|pg||
nt|davidstern: 10 tricks now 1-5-1-3|pg||
nt|davidstern: Unless declarer gets confused by the lead|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|ady: as it happens clubs are blocked  and Robson has not entry    so 3NT will make even on wrong spade guess|pg||
nt|lestergold: Crouch was chicken in my view and i do not see why 3n promised vaslues and upper limit can be quite seriously strong|pg||
nt|lestergold: over 3N he cn afford to bid the 4S he did not want to risk on the first round|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so quickly to the other room thanks all|pg||
nt|lestergold: if forrester jumped to 6D then Crouch could try 6H or 6N|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|nt|davidstern: Which he hasn't|pg||
pc|s7|nt|april7: thats true, but if its successful, then?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 12 tricks now|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|nt|petepunt: restart at 11:10, time penalties apply ?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well judged by EW - 5@H is down one|pg||
nt|athene: i might have been a little bit worried with east - you do have a very pure hand|pg||
nt|petepunt: N/S likely to take out insurance in 6@D if Hackets bids one more .|pg||
nt|april7: is 1NT by E forcing, in what system?|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: 17-19|pg||
nt|april7: tu|pg||
nt|athene: i am not a huge fan of 1nt - the sixth heart is too important to bury|pg||
nt|athene: but anyway, they have wandered into game :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well the pass cost as 4 hearts made OR|pg||
nt|chthonic: Twelve IMPs away on the passed out hand|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: i assume 2@C was two-way checkback (forces 2@D, then 2@S is invitational)|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|mdgraham: NS never bid at the other table|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: exactly as explained|pg||
nt|davidstern: Mind you he had to play it well to make. I wouldn't like to have to go back to my team mates and explain why I didnt open|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: it might be more of a double fit - give west the @SK instead of the @DA, for example|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|ady: 11 tricks for 1 imp to waterlow|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: or pehaps 11|pg||

pc|c3|pc|h9|pg||
nt|davidstern: On htis hand in the OR North opened 1@S|pg||
pc|dA|nt|davidstern: Which also is not my taste|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: with no entry, south might well switch after the @CQ gets ducked|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d3|pg||
pc|d4|nt|april7: inOR 4@S were made, but I see only 9 tricks|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|petepunt: 3@D seems fine ar fav vuln with 6-4 minors ?|pg||
nt|athene: yes, @DA, @C10 and @SJ look like defensive tricks from here|pg||
nt|davidstern: And West is playing 1NT so it was successful|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mdgraham: certainly worked well here.|pg||

nt|athene: 2@S is NF here in standard Precision Club|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: 4@c shows @c + @h, but South has a lot more values than he has promised|pg||
nt|Walddk6: But 4@C should be forcing|pg||
nt|othered1: Things could get ugly for a strong NT openingh on west's hand.|pg||
mb|3C|nt|justin c: with @C 3/3 can pitch two @D from E|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk6: Isn't it for you, Jeffrey?|pg||
nt|jallerton: Yes, but he has to guess whether he has sufficient extras for slam|pg||
nt|me argent: 5@Cs not the bravest of bids|pg||
nt|jallerton: I play 4D agrees @H, 4@S agrees @s here|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Right, me too, hence 5@C shows a bad hand|pg||
nt|jallerton: so I would have bid 4@s on North hand|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Dixon's is much better than bad|pg||
mb|3S|nt|yo_yo: isnt the west hand a bit good for a precision 2@C opener?|pg||
nt|justin c: maybe he could have bid 4@H over 2@S|pg||
nt|justin c: (not sure what else it could really mean)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: sorry 4@S agrees @c|pg||
nt|athene: yes, but he doesn't envisage a slam facing a non-forcing bid|pg||
mb|3N|nt|yo_yo: Stuart Tred would go for slam I bet facing a strong @C opener|pg||
nt|athene: west is max for 2@C but not worth 1@C, in my opinion - with a sixth club it would be closer|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if a small diamond were a small club, then he might well have opened 1@C|pg||

nt|othered1: with 5 or 6-card majors and bid like that?  The auction says he doesn't have many @C at all|pg||
