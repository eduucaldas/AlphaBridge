pc|c9|pc|cQ|nt|jtr: They need to play trumps but North can only get in to play more at the expense of a @d trick|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: matter of style, opening 1NT on the North hand. Holding a good 6-card minor can ake it awkward for partner to visualise lots of playing tricks|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|h8|nt|jtr: The @d play sorted it anyway|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as he can hardly know that Kx will give six tricks in a suit.|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jallerton: and trick 1 @h lead on North hand very tough to find in any case|pg||
