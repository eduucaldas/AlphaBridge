mb|p|nt|psridhar: Sumit has done well to pass -many wd open 1s there|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: seems like a routine @S game...yes 6@S can be made, but not a good contract and won't be bid anyway|pg||
nt|psridhar: 6s off trump ace and queen is dicey|pg||
nt|psridhar: other room heading towards slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: really, the winning play in trumps is possible, exciting stuff if they bid and make it|pg||
nt|psridhar: that 2nt bid has missed the spd fit|pg||
nt|patricck: no......2NT not an enquiry then?|pg||
nt|panja: and 2N won't make|pg||
nt|psridhar: Sanajy has gone for quanti auction in pref to the spd fit|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|panja: if it went 2@C-2@D-2@H...I guess 2N would have been forcing....|pg||
nt|panja: so the structure forced him to guess the best response?|pg||
nt|patricck: how could it be by a passed hand?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|Walddk6: How can anything be forcing by a passed hand?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|c2|nt|psridhar: sound conservative auction may earn them 13 if other room fails in slam|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|nt|vugraphzwu: yes|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|panja: oh y, passed hand, true|pg||
nt|Walddk6: So if he wants to bid, 2@D must be it|pg||
nt|panja: or, then, 2@D might be passable here for them? passed hand?|pg||
nt|psridhar: u only need yr pd not to screw up|pg||
nt|psridhar: sorry prvt|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|nt|bjacobs: If the @H9 and @H10 were swapped - that was what North was hoping|pg||
pc|cK|nt|patricck: normally the right play with this holding is to run the 10@S, but it is quite a close call. If you can only lead once because you only have one entry then the correct play is small ...|pg||
nt|patricck: to the K@S|pg||
nt|psridhar: even 3s is conservative in my opinion ...he just needs QJXXX in spd and out for game to make|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|psridhar: the std auction in other room will locate the spd fit at 1 lev and dhampur shd gain a partial here|pg||

nt|psridhar: is this real?|pg||
nt|patricck: declarer is perhaps lucky that the J@D is onside so still only down 1....I would have been tempted to cash for 6 tricks when the Q@C took a trick|pg||
nt|Walddk6: And I don't know how many tricks they missed now|pg||

mb|p|nt|patricck: same mistake I made....North is short of diamonds, not South|pg||
nt|Walddk6: I like to double with the South cards and play ELC. 2@D overcall could well have lost spades|pg||
nt|panja: y|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk6: ELC = Equal Level Conversion|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: Mango had their share of slam luck in first session when they landed a grand dropping doubleton Q of trumps in an 8 card fit|pg||
nt|psridhar: i was abt to say that Roland-2D on that moth eaten suit opp a passed hand is not my fav-the take out X is more flex and brings spd into pic|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, I like double rather than 2@D as well, but close decision, would not criticise 2@D|pg||
nt|panja: better still, why not overcall 1@S?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk6: http://www.bridgeguys.com/EGlossary/EqualLevelConversion.html|pg||
nt|panja: with a structure to handle 4-card overcalls..of course|pg||
pc|c4|nt|patricck: 1@S is ok when you find a spde fit, but it makes some auctions very awkward later|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|Walddk6: ELC solves all probs. If partner responds diamonds or spades, all is fine, and if you get (the more likely) 2@C, you convert to 2@D to show diamonds and spades|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sT|pc|sQ|pc|h2|pg||
pc|d7|nt|psridhar: perhaps a consolation 2 imp to mango here..but Railways are taking all big swings|pg||
nt|patricck: If you overcall 1@S and partner bids 2@C what do you do? Bid 2@D and see partner bid 2@S with a doubleton?|pg||
nt|panja: not all, some, perhaps, many|pg||
nt|panja: for one, if W bids 2@h or 3@H, with Club length....what shd partner do?|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|nt|panja: it solves problems if W passes, most of them, let us say|pg||

mb|p|nt|psridhar: this one is a lock :)|pg||
nt|panja: South is Sanjay Damle, N is Raju Gulavani, W is Kamal Mukherjee...|pg||
mb|1D|nt|patricck: any 5-1 @H break except singleton Ace would have beaten it|pg||
nt|psridhar: the stiff h is the ace so...|pg||
mb|1H|nt|patricck: Nice distributional 4@S contract, makes even with a spade misguess|pg||
mb|1S|nt|patricck: hard for EW to bid 6@C against this start|pg||
nt|psridhar: over 1h W found a fitshowing jump to 2s in other room-it was easy to reach 4s thereafter|pg||
mb|2H|nt|psridhar: true ..a typical alok sadhu 1H has EW in totters..|pg||
mb|d|an| |nt|bjacobs: Looks like 6@H doesn't quite fetch|pg||
nt|panja: 9-card fit on both sides......9=19 tricks though, 1 extra|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: wait ..but his pd has taken him seriously giving EW another bite at the cherry|pg||
mb|2S|nt|psridhar: a preemptive 3h instead of 2h might hv quietened E|pg||
mb|3H|nt|bjacobs: Unless you peek, of course|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|patricck: trump lead is best|pg||
mb|3S|nt|psridhar: it must be frustrating to be not able to bid that club suit :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|panja: fit-showing?|pg||
nt|patricck: support double showing 3 card @S....   if so then West really should have done more than just correct to 2@S|pg||
nt|panja: is S thinking of a dbl?|pg||
nt|patricck: surely not|pg||

nt|babugenu: l|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|bjacobs: North may have a tricky problem on opening lead here|pg||
mb|d|nt|panja: a first time 3@H by N might have solved this problem...|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Well if North takes his own advice and leads a club, this will no doubt go down|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Oh, not to worry - E/W have gone bananas.  And there is no miracle, like there was on board 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: Director intervening|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: A@D lead would be a disaster|pg||
pc|c9|nt|panja: y, this has some chances...|pg||
nt|psridhar: this NS auction sounds confused..and early in the match it will encourage opponents|pg||
nt|panja: even @CA now by E might be bad for EW|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bjacobs: Presumably, N/S are concerned about a hesitation, but it's not going to matter to them in the end|pg||

pc|s7|nt|psridhar: he had to lead a trump to beat it 500|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, that would have been bad too, would need K@D, Q@D overtaken with A@D and a ruff to beat it if east had played A@C|pg||
