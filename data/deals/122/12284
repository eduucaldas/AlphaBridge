nt|drorp: pretty easy slam here|pg||
nt|lml: you hav e to get to the right slam|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Best defence against slam is @DA and another, but declarer can still prevail|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@H that is|pg||
mb|1C|mb|2D|nt|roswolf: the trick is to avoid 6@S|pg||
nt|drorp: a diamond lead can set the slam though|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You sure?|pg||
nt|drorp: oh no, west can't ruff above dummy|pg||
mb|d|mb|3D|nt|lml: some entry probles after diamond diamond|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2 rounds of @D, draw 2 trumps, cash @CA, ruff @D and discard two spades and two clubs.   easy:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: how to get to @H now?|pg||
nt|lml: but the short diamond hand is the short trump hand too and with babies|pg||
nt|drorp: i think that if they'll play in @S it'll be 5@S, finding they miss a keycard and the Q@s|pg||
nt|lml: declarer really has no choice but to play it the right way|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|roswolf: SLAM WILL BE DIFFICULT TO REACH NOW|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's why I dislike negative free bids. You are at the 3-level and you have not shown just one suit yet|pg||
nt|lml: I agree this auction will get them to spades|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|hedyg: would 3@H not be forcing? after 3@d -p-p|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I assume that 2@H by Lengy would have been NF|pg||
nt|drorp: they don't play negative free bids as far as i know, he just preferred to start the hand with X|pg||
mb|5C|nt|drorp: 3@H wouldn't be forcing...|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: If 2@H is forcing, I don't understand double|pg||
nt|ady: in closed room  spades not mentioned     north did not open  and south opened 1 heart|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Get your first suit in right away|pg||
mb|5S|nt|roswolf: i agree i like to bid my suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: well if he could bid a forcing 2@H then the decision to double cost him a big swing|pg||
nt|drorp: North's very light opening ruined the hand for the NS pair|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes ofc Dror if they dont play ned freebids 2@H would be forcing and 3 @H nf|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: negative freebids even|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well a swing to the trailing team|pg||
nt|hedyg: in CR Barel passed as N|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think the first double did scupper them|pg||
nt|lml: after the pass in the CR East also didnt bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Just what Herbst needed to make this match really exciting. 28 is the last board in this room|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d9|pc|dK|pg||
nt|ady: if north had 2 small hearts and QXXX spades would not double work better than bidding hearts after the 2 diamond intervention|pg||
nt|lml: north south have had a discouraging start with a number of at least negative positions|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridge.co.il/results/lum09f4.pdf  for results, SF and F|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think so, David|pg||
nt|hedyg: why? he can bid 2@S over 2@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: South can always bid spades later|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|ady: he can bid 2@S over 2 hearts if he has the chance   there may be more pre-emptive action |pg||
nt|lml: I suppose the lesson is when you have a game forcing hand just bid your suits|pg||
nt|hedyg: then S bids @ss at whatever level|pg||
pc|s2|nt|roswolf: yes kiss is the key to these hands|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|d4|pg||
nt|ady: I see nothing wrong with the double    it just so happens bidding hearts works well on this hand|pg||
nt|drorp: his double has logic, mostly on slam hands 4-4 will play out better than 5-3, this hand could easily be a makeable 7@S while 7@H doesn't have any play, for instance opposite Qxxx, ...|pg||
nt|drorp: Jxx, AQ, KJxx|pg||
nt|lml: one of the many reasons I like the overcall better is that your hearts are so good|pg||
nt|lml: and you have a huge hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: experience has taught me that grands are for the birds unless there are 14/15 obvious top tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: you also have xxx in opps suit, what if your pd bids a number of @cs?|pg||
nt|lml: yes I have never loved grands|pg||
nt|hedyg: you said 3@H would not be forcing so what does he do over 3@c?|pg||
nt|lml: somebody suggested 6NT and that would work on the hand but it is hard to find with a double major fit and weak diamonds|pg||
nt|drorp: 3@D|pg||
nt|drorp: 6NT is down on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: 6NT on a @d lead?|pg||
nt|lml: you cant make it on a diamond lead but isnt it the same as spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's plain silly imo, 3@D over 3@C I mean. How is your partner supposed to guess that you are 4-5 in the majors? You have not shown a suit yet. Double followed by a cue. It ruins ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: the auction completely|pg||
pc|cA|nt|drorp: what else could it be?|pg||
nt|roswolf: i played a hand a couple of days ago when a grand was makeable in either minor but the trick was getting any plus score - 3nt -3 being the usual score!!!!|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|pc|c9|pg||
pc|d6|nt|drorp: partner would bid his 3 card major anyway|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A great hand for clubs|pg||
nt|drorp: unless he has a good diamond stop|pg||
nt|drorp: well it could also be that, if you bid 4@C over whatever he bids|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s5|pc|d5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Too many doubles and unassuming cue bids in my opinion. Play bridge, make life easy on your partner|pg||
nt|hedyg: claim?|pg||
nt|hedyg: thinking to play KQ@C and disc 2@hs|pg||
nt|drorp: someone has to tell him that the difference between making and going down is only 3 imps :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: Barel in CR playing quicker than this table!, much quicker!|pg||
nt|lml: if he plays a spade West will have to return a round suit anyway|pg||
nt|lml: so even if hearts dont break he should be ok|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d3|pc|s7|nt|drorp: he can return the 4th spade|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|s9|pc|cJ|nt|hedyg: no he can play back a @s|pg||
nt|drorp: but hearts are kinda marked 3-2|pg||

nt|vugraphzbs: Hi all, My name is yonatan and Ill be your Opareator :)|pg||

nt|fann4: S has a huge hand, but maybe he has to respect the auction and stop.|pg||

nt|drorp: another slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: another slam for n/s this for me seems much easier|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but impossible to bid on the closed room auction|pg||
nt|ady: good slam missed in CR|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Seriously|pg||
nt|drorp: very good slam, pretty hard to bid|pg||
nt|lml: so are you more likely to bid this one after the last hand or less likely|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|Walddk2: You would really raise to slam with the South cards after that start?|pg||
nt|ady: nice save for e/w |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Give partner some slack for goodness sake|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|hedyg: that is killing pd for bidding 5@d with xx in @H?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Exactly|pg||
nt|hedyg: and ofc the lead is AK@H...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Double dummy you can bid anything, but they don't have the hand records|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup but south will be/is tempted|pg||
nt|lml: but after a bad start maybe ,,,|pg||
nt|roswolf: any way the sac is cheap|pg||
nt|hedyg: up by over 20 you play safe imo|pg||
nt|lml: but after they shot the slam do you sac?|pg||
nt|drorp: the EW sacrifice is great, with a normal diamond lead, they only have 3 losers, can be 4 losers with a heart lead, but even 6@s is a good sacrifice over the making 5@D|pg||
nt|ady: started same way in CR   1@S    4@S    5@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|Walddk2: All very sensible|pg||
nt|hedyg: sensible pass|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes nust be very cheap from west's point of view|pg||
nt|hedyg: push me?|pg||
nt|roswolf: he is sacing anyway|pg||
nt|lml: but West is not done... you think the huddle would discourage him|pg||
mb|d|mb|5S|nt|roswolf: a smooth forcing pass from north|pg||
nt|roswolf: mighr have been better|pg||
nt|hedyg: now N has a problem...would pass show 1st round control in @H?|pg||
nt|drorp: lengy should pass forcing here, if they wanna have a shot at reaching 6@d|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|drorp: wow...|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is more poker than bridge|pg||
nt|lml: South's chances got better with the heart bid I suppose|pg||
nt|hedyg: even without support by E?|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|ady: e/w  could still go to 6@S and show a profit |pg||
nt|roswolf: why is north thinking?|pg||
mb|6S|nt|hedyg: N wasnt thinking, E was|pg||
nt|drorp: systematic X, showing 1 trick|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok the sac is found|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: works well on this hand|pg||
nt|drorp: and Ilan pulls|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Ilan had a plan all along|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ady: heart ruff will get 500|pg||
nt|Walddk2: "If they bid a slam after this, I will save"|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|nt|roswolf: n/s in the other room wont expect to gain imps on this board|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|lml: 2 down now|pg||
nt|drorp: now they'll have to be aware and cash the clubs or it will become very ugly|pg||
nt|lml: West made a good choice it seems to keep the auction alive|pg||
nt|hedyg: Happy New Year to all specs, sorry impossible to reply to all the kind wishes|pg||
nt|lml: It seems obvious to lead a club but not to North|pg||
nt|lml: perhaps he will return a spade?|pg||
nt|roswolf: he is tempted to cash a @D|pg||
nt|ady: I think n/s in CR  might well be pleased with 640  seeing the very cheap sacrifice for e/w|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|lml: he did the normal thing|pg||
nt|lml: not the greedy thing|pg||
nt|lml: is there a position where the @CA is wrong now?|pg||
nt|lml: I cant think of one|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If you decide to switch to clubs, I think the king is the correct card|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In order to prevent partner from doing something silly when he wins|pg||
nt|hedyg: looking at the @hs..|pg||
nt|drorp: if Ilan has A@h and stiff spade, and i agree with roland, K@C was a much better card to play|pg||
nt|hedyg: but if E has @H losers they are not running away|pg||
nt|ady: the pace is very slow    4 hands in around 45 minutes|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes they are not speedy|pg||
nt|hedyg: CR 4 boards ahead of us|pg||
nt|drorp: to be fair, the hands are very hard|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|c6|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes far more meat than the previous set|pg||

nt|ralfwil: I´m not quite sure, two rounds of @d and no entry to @c|pg||
nt|xenya: you get a @D ruff instead|pg||
mb|1S|nt|fann4: 2 rounds of @D, draw 2 trumps, cash @CA, ruff @D and discard 2@S on 2@C.   easy:)|pg||
nt|xenya: so 4 tricks in the minors anyway|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|othered1: how many @S on west's hand and what does north do?|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|fann4: 5@D, what else?|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: At these colors, south does not have to produce 3 tricks|pg||
nt|fann4: you mean you would sell to 4@S at this vul with that hand?|pg||
nt|othered1: No, but it's not without risk.|pg||
nt|fann4: sure there's risk, but I think it's automatic.|pg||
nt|othered1: soiuth did give his partner plenty of room|pg||
nt|xenya: i agree Jeff|pg||
nt|fann4: Very tough for S to know to raise.|pg||
nt|xenya: but well done by W to bid 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|fann4: I think he's thinking about trying 5@H|pg||

nt|lml: nice result east-west|pg||
nt|hedyg: what a hand!|pg||
nt|roswolf: the match tightens but the leaders have a good result in the other room here|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|an|multi|nt|hedyg: 4@s by N?|pg||
nt|roswolf: this could be exciting or a damp squib|pg||
nt|lml: North will be spades and east hearts one would think|pg||
nt|ady: look like 5@H needed a trump lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: east has a 2 way shot|pg||
nt|hedyg: W passed in 1st seat in CR|pg||
nt|drorp: i think 5@H makes on a trump lead aswell, declearer wins and plays a club from dummy|pg||
nt|drorp: from the stiff side that is|pg||
nt|roswolf: if north bids 4@S east could axe that i suppose|pg||
nt|ady: yes can for an extra club trick later with J10|pg||
nt|lml: a trump lead seems very unlikely against 5@H|pg||
nt|drorp: for all who asks how 5@H makes anyway|pg||
nt|hedyg: which is thinking? my bet is E|pg||
nt|drorp: on a trump lead, declerer wins and plays club from the stiff, if north wins, it's over on a cross ruff|pg||
nt|drorp: if south jumps with Q@c and plays a 2nd trump, declerer ruffs 2 clubs, and than has JT left and only 1 more club loser|pg||
nt|lml: you might make 6 without the trump lead on a cross ruff|pg||

nt|lml: its a shot but it seems like a good shot|pg||
nt|drorp: don't see how 5@h can go down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think 5@H is clearcut. You know partner has short spades and you have a black singleton yourself|pg||
nt|drorp: opposite a vul weak 2|pg||
nt|hedyg: and you need imps|pg||
nt|mdgraham: absolutely|pg||
nt|drorp: and shortness in @s|pg||

nt|othered1: After two doubles, was north's pass forcing?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|fann4: In fact, GIB says that only a trump lead will hold this to 11 tricks (double dummy anyway)|pg||

nt|fann4: All he showed was a good 4@S pre-empt. need not be forcing.|pg||
nt|othered1: North's double would show extras on a hand already known to be strong (4@D opening) and south did double, wh ich should show transferrable values, so . . . |pg||

nt|ady: 4@S   has good play|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|drorp: 4@S is cold as the cards lie, there's hardly even any guessing to do|pg||

nt|lml: good bid by Ophir|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 2@cs to tap declarer and duck @D?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|drorp: still makes, you ruff diamond draw trumps and give 1 more diamond|pg||
nt|lml: the diamonds are just too friendly|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lml: if North had bid 4@C it might have been harder for East|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c6|pg||
nt|drorp: he would bid 4@S :)|pg||
nt|lml: or maybe 4@H|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|lml: unless you are certain partner has four spades you might go for the clearer game|pg||
nt|drorp: you're not going to let the opponets play with 11 cards in your suits and a guaranteed fit|pg||
nt|roswolf: true|pg||
nt|lml: no you will bid but maybe hearts|pg||
nt|hedyg: well this helps|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lml: it isnt all that clear to bid spades over 4@C|pg||
nt|po-s: if declarer is allowed to win the diamond he might go for hearts and might finesse spades over North|pg||
nt|lml: well it is to us :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes more imps back to the trailing team|pg||
nt|drorp: if you'd bid hearts on 4@C there's no reason that you won't bid hearts and 3@C, absouloutley no difference|pg||
nt|ady: good swing here for Herbst|pg||
nt|hedyg: why would he switch to @D?|pg||
nt|lml: the difference is that you are going passed game.  Here if partner has a couple of hearts and only 3 spades he can take you back ot hearts|pg||
nt|drorp: i don't think partner can have 3 spades in this bid, if they show a big club fit, more likley he has 6 spades|pg||
nt|lml: most of the time he will have four spades but not always 3-2-5-3 is possible |pg||
nt|lml: for example|pg||
nt|lml: the point is really that without the 4@C bid it was easy|pg||
nt|drorp: yes but when they go 2@c-4@C then he's not likley to hold 3 clubs, and then with 3-2-6-2, very unlikley...|pg||
nt|lml: you might get there anyway|pg||
nt|hedyg: unlikely S bid 2@c with 5 @ds|pg||
nt|lml: West|pg||
nt|lml: West could have diamonds and not enough for the two level|pg||
nt|roswolf: declare trying to cater for as many bad splits as possible|pg||
nt|lml: I am only advocating that North should bid more|pg||
nt|hedyg: because of the great shape of his hand?|pg||
nt|lml: it does look like north is short in diamonds from the switch|pg||
nt|lml: because of the vulnerability really|pg||
nt|hedyg: the vulnerability didnt change his hand|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lml: its safe enough and it makes it harder for east-west to find their best spot|pg||

nt|fann4: Yes, 4@H was very unilateral. W could have had 5@S for all he knew.|pg||
pc|d8|nt|othered1: tough call, but since west could have 5@S, I'd think, @S looks attractive|pg||
nt|fann4: Agreed|pg||

nt|lml: North might pass|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Someone once told me that when you're doubled at the 1-level, it's time to run|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|cT|pg||
nt|lml: seems like they have a shot at a pickup here|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: I think 1NT is best even if you have no agreement re minors. You expect that to be doubled, then redouble must show the minors|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|sT|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hedyg: that is what Barel bid|pg||

pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|reisig: This a probably ...push|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|hedyg: cash 1@c, 7 @c was not from 87|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c8|pc|d3|pc|c3|pg||

nt|ralfwil: why not 2nt from E after !x on 2@d|pg||
nt|xenya: both questions are difficult to answer|pg||
nt|fann4: Boards 20 and 21 look flat (famous last words).|pg||

nt|fann4: a spec who knows these players says that the dbl of 2@D is a |pg||
nt|fann4: is a 'reverse type dbl' saying I don't have a dlb of 2@D.|pg||

pc|dT|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dJ|pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
nt|xenya: likely a swing to the leaders|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c7|pc|c2|nt|fann4: On bd 19 the commentators in the OR reckoned (quite rightly) that E should have bid on to 5@H after partner opened a multi 2@D and a 4@S overcall.|pg||
nt|xenya: maybe not -- if S overcalls in OR too|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|nt|fann4: After a great first 2 boards, the momentum swung straight back to BAREKET|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hT|pg||
pc|d2|nt|othered1: wonder why not high @S first?|pg||
nt|vugraphzbs: E took the @C trick with the K@C i think|pg||
pc|dA|pc|c5|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|fann4: Declarer will not get to enjoying dummy's 4th @C here.|pg||
nt|xenya: also no endplay here -- so just 6 tricks|pg||
nt|fann4: 1 (maybe vital) imp to HERBST on bd 20.|pg||
nt|othered1: Even if east didn't win the @C cheaply, there's not room for 3@C in the south hand.|pg||
nt|fann4: But a potential bad board on bd 24 where NS can make 5@D.|pg||

pc|s8|pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
nt|xenya: well W should keep all his hearts|pg||
nt|fann4: So long as W keeps his 3 little @H as an exit.|pg||
nt|vugraphzbs: hoping @H's are 4-2 and E will have problem comunicating to W's @S's maybe?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|fann4: Bd 21 OR,  EW also in 3@D|pg||
nt|fann4: As it happens, E can discard anything here.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|s6|pg||
nt|othered1: west has been careful|pg||
nt|fann4: S musn't try a fancy @C now, or he will be 3 down.|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|fann4: It is quite an interesting end situation here. W must now play @H to beat it 2.|pg||
nt|vugraphzbs: -1|pg||
nt|vugraphzbs: tempting to cash A@S now|pg||
nt|fann4: I think the way W has defended here that he knows what is going on.|pg||
nt|othered1: but west knows south's count exactly, so should not go wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphzbs: but S played small @H to the J so W can assume he has AQ and the 3 remaining @S's if he remembers the count..|pg||
nt|fann4: They are on bd 22 in the OR, where E jumped to 4@H with that 7-4 hand.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|pc|h2|pc|hQ|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|nt|lml: if North bids clubs now|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: as he did, hearts shows a big hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: now 3@H shows a bigger hand :(|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lml: looks like a swing for Herbst|pg||
nt|hedyg: there was discussion in the CR whether 3@H actually made|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But confirmed by the operator|pg||
nt|lml: so probably about 6 or 8 imps here depending on one or two down|pg||

nt|Walddk2: North could perhaps have bid a responsive double rather than 3@C, but it's not clear at all with a doubleton heart. I think Lengy must take the blame for not overcalling the strong ...|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|fann4: Ed, you are 17imps down with a few boards to go:)|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|fann4: Declarer went 2 down on the @CQ lead, maybe 2@H can even make with some great guessing.|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: But to get to 2@H north has to backpedal|pg||
pc|c2|nt|fann4: Which he didn't|pg||
nt|othered1: Of course, auction doesn't necessarily make the defense easy|pg||
pc|c6|nt|fann4: GIB says theoretically 2 down, so maybe no swing.|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|othered1: GIB cheats.|pg||
nt|fann4: Bd 25, that 2@D for 2 off, has started the same way in the OR|pg||
nt|fann4: No, N decided to let his partner play 1@S doubled there.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|hJ|nt|fann4: So some more imps surely to HERBST on bd 25.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: interesting to see when N plays on @h|pg||
nt|fann4: But I think time is about to run out for HERBST, doesn't look like 21 imps available over the last few boards.|pg||
nt|xenya: might not be easy for EW to find an ideal defence in view of N's 1@S bid|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|d4|nt|xenya: that destroys declarers communications -- nice switch|pg||
nt|vugraphzbs: can he make?|pg||
nt|fann4: no way|pg||
nt|fann4: 2 down unless the defence goes astray.|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||

nt|xenya: returned*|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|pc|cT|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|fann4: E has to play a major suit now for 2 down. not clear cut|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|hedyg: not easy at all|pg||
nt|lml: there was not reason to think the diamond was right and the club was wrong|pg||
nt|hedyg: especially after the tricky Q@c lead|pg||
nt|lml: and even if the club is wrong if trump break he is still okay|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@H splinter|pg||

nt|ady: 5@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|hedyg: quiet pass|pg||

nt|othered1: 5@C is a nice spot that matchpoints addicts might not find|pg||
nt|xenya: good result for Herbst in OR|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S!|an|gf|mb|p|nt|othered1: What's 2@H?|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|vugraphzbs: no clue|pg||
nt|fann4: On bd 25, 1@S doubled is going 3 off for 500, so another 5imps to HERBST.|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fann4: Of course in a long match there are a number of boards the losing team will look at, but for this set bd 19, where they lost 13imps, was the killer.|pg||
nt|othered1: There has been a lot of good bridge in this match, from both sides. |pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|fann4: Agreed, it has been very enjoyable.|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|fann4: On bd 26, where S overcalled 2@H here, his counterpart in the OR decided to dbl.|pg||
nt|fann4: General comments there are they prefer the 2@H overcall.|pg||
nt|fann4: and so the dbl put them into a 3@C contract.|pg||
nt|xenya: i agree -- it's either 2@H or a (cautious) pass|pg||
nt|othered1: guess I"m alone passing AKQ22|pg||
nt|fann4: I think you are Ed.|pg||
nt|othered1: Won't be the first time.|pg||
nt|fann4: The problem for the HERBST team is that boards seem flat.|pg||

nt|othered1: Was @D 10 count?  If so, north can cash here|pg||
nt|fann4: I'm crossing to the other table, bye all.|pg||
nt|othered1: north knows he has 4 more pitches to make|pg||
nt|xenya: whatever N plays now, declarer won't have the nerve to take a @D finesse|pg||
nt|othered1: and, almost certainly, west has @DJ, for why would south play 10 from J10?|pg||
nt|xenya: dis somebody said something about a quick claim|pg||
