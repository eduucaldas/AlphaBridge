mb|p|mb|p|nt|me argent: 2@Ss might be effective in keeping EW out of slam|pg||
nt|dburn: wow - that is a heavy pre-empt|pg||
nt|kit: this one looks really flat|pg||
nt|kareno: Wow!!  That's quite a 2@s bid|pg||
mb|1S|mb|1N|nt|josj: another 6@D this time for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Good hand for Stayman/Smolen - well, it was until North bid 2@D|pg||
mb|3N|nt|me argent: east worth a double here?|pg||
nt|dburn: well, what can he do?|pg||
nt|kit: I can't believe West didn't compete to 4@S|pg||
nt|dburn: true - whichever minor partner had, you'd have some cards for him|pg||
nt|me argent: it does say something about their 2 bids|pg||
nt|dburn: on the other hand, if partner was clowning around with a couple of jack-fifths, you'd go down about 800|pg||
nt|me argent: and why it was WRONG for east 2 open 2@Ss|pg||
nt|josj: I think X shows the blackies v. Strong Club|pg||
nt|xenya: on 13, the ladies in the other bid to the correct 5@C contract and NS took a save in 5@H -- -500 and 12 imps to Djarum ladies |pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: extra spade -- but didn't matter here.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: re|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: a hand which shows, once again, that nine-card suits are meant to be trumps|pg||
mb|p|pc|sT|nt|frankaus: the SP cost the contract - loose lips !!!!!!! - N showed @S A @C KJ  did not overcall so E "knew" N does not have @D K|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|xenya: i wonder what 2@D shows|pg||
nt|mdgraham: what on earth....?|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: re hi @H@H|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mdgraham: South thinks 2@D is major, methinks. A bad time to have a system forget|pg||
nt|xenya: but whatever it might be, obviously NS were not on the same wavelength|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kit: still looks clear to accept the "transfer" -- somebody bids 4@H, so you bid 4@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: director called after E's double, didn't hear the conversation.|pg||
nt|dburn: well, everyone has a good hand for their bid|pg||
nt|ritong: arare case of early claim|pg||
nt|kit: I would have opened 3@S as they did in other room, but matter of style I guess.|pg||
nt|ritong: absolutely nothing could happen|pg||
nt|josj: unlucky lead but only for an overtrick|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|nt|me argent: west was rgt that south could not make 5@Hs|pg||

pc|cT|nt|xenya: the mix-up is going to be costly|pg||
pc|c3|nt|dburn: well, he could worry about it - he knows that if partner's second suit is diamonds, he probably did the wrong thing|pg||

nt|jaapfr: ok 10 then|pg||
nt|alunand7: hi japp :)@H|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi harry re|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: simply too weak for 1@S, and pass isn't part of my vocabulary with a 7-card spade suit.|pg||
nt|mrace: well...most people treat a side A as if it is a crime to open weak 2, most of the top players opens it almost always  as far as i see in BBO vugraphs|pg||
nt|kareno: Not a decent one like that.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Zia has a kibbitzer who operates the BridgeMate for him.|pg||
nt|lml: hi :)|pg||
mb|1C|nt|xenya: some might open with the S hand|pg||
mb|1H|nt|josj: precision style, I assume|pg||
nt|alunand7: maybe 3NT or 5@D by N-S |pg||
nt|jaapfr: also here 6@D too thin and likely to fall so better 3nt again|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|mdgraham: but if you don't, it's a nice feeling when LHO opens in your longest suit |pg||
mb|p|nt|gowdy: x = blackwood|pg||
nt|xenya: no huddle this time? :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: I should have used the substitute bd 16 as my "hospitality" break.  TMI?|pg||
nt|kit: 4NT call very risky here -- only at these colors, and only at BAM or matchpoints might it be right|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, we all know the feeling|pg||
nt|alunand7: good shot japp :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jaapfr: lasut did better:)|pg||
nt|alunand7: lasut heared your said|pg||
nt|jaapfr: played against them 30 years ago in Jakarta:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: sorry, Website can't update now :) because no data  from scoring room|pg||
nt|alunand7: oww...|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|josj: N has an unpleasant lead|pg||
nt|frankaus: this wont trouble the declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: however, had S opened, they might have reached a decent 2@S contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: they are very busy|pg||
nt|alunand7: good feeling = good result happened at this table |pg||
nt|lml: this should be no trouble for declarer|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: big swing on auction -- in other room, 1NT opening, and 2@C stayman bid was doubled -- good double!|pg||
nt|josj: he does not know a @D is best and now declarer's job is easy|pg||
nt|josj: for +1|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Fate of 5@D doubled depends on how declarer handles the heart suit maybe|pg||
nt|kareno: It's nice to have good servants :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: there are a number of kibbitzers in the room.  Zia has 3 men following him, 2 women behind Hamman|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: And plenty following Meckwell|pg||
nt|kit: Nothing here -- with diamonds splitting, 12 tricks and a swing on the double of 2@C.  Many would be afraid to make it.  I think it is clear.|pg||
nt|kareno: You really can't stand any other lead.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: mungkin lebih baik kalau kami berbicara BI sebab banyak kibs mengerti itu lebih baik:)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mrace: true|pg||
pc|d3|nt|dburn: well, the defence got there first, but...|pg||
pc|dK|nt|alunand7: are u sure japp ? :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: kurang tahu:)|pg||
nt|alunand7: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: I agree with you Jaap, Your Indonesian is good|pg||
nt|jaapfr: meanwhile dummy lost his entry|pg||
nt|lml: you can make 6@S on a good day and without a heart lead today is a good day|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|josj: even +2...|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|pc|d5|nt|kit: sure, every now and then they will redouble and wrap it around your neck -- but the gains outweigh the losses IMO.|pg||
nt|ritong: especially when the size of the loss does not matter|pg||
nt|kit: I would double at IMP also without hesitation.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but lucky @C mite help|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|dburn: ...that was not their best shot, as it happens|pg||
pc|d9|nt|dburn: wonder if Shane Blanchard is a fan of James Thurber|pg||
pc|cT|nt|alunand7: no jab...10@C was goo entry|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|d7|pg||
nt|kit: will get heart ruff now -- but declarer can set up 9 of clubs if judges to lead club to 10|pg||
nt|josj: no time to lose here: they played 6 boards in less than half an hour|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|jaapfr: susa sekali|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||
nt|kit: oops|pg||
nt|me argent: whoops|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|lml: just has to guess hearts now|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s4|pc|sK|nt|mrace: also, if  u dont double it, @Cs will be the last one for pd to consider, if he doesnt have clear shot lead, since 2@C went pass in front of us|pg||
nt|mrace: that happened to us :) pd had @Cs and @Ds to to lead and i failed to dbl 2@C..costed us 13 imps...|pg||
nt|ritong: i won t interfere in this debate|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Next up is Kwiecien vs Kendrick|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: break just ended on the clock, but I predict 2-3 minutes for all the players to show up|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Please don't ask me for Swiss standings, they haven't been providing them.|pg||
nt|ritong: charlatan|pg||
nt|ritong: sry pv|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|c2|pc|h6|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|kit: South probably didn't lead spade for fear partner would try to give him another ruff|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|xenya: 2@D plays quite well here -- the lead appears helpful for declarer, but it should always make i think|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d8|pg||
nt|kit: or maybe believed the 3 of hearts suit-preference -- but it was a forced play|pg||
nt|me argent: north might have helped his partner out with his @H return|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: sorry, I don't have any NA Swiss results.|pg||
nt|xenya: strange as it may seem, that @CA play didn't cost a trick |pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Next up is Kwiecen vs Spector|pg||
nt|kit: North might have solved the problem by returning the king of hearts -- couldn't really cost|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|c7|nt|lml: so this seems a decent result but it could win or lose imps|pg||
nt|lml: its in the hands of the OR|pg||

nt|frankaus: the pace of play seems to be increasing - in the bridge that i see|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: But one of those plays easier to find in the post-mortem than at the table|pg||
nt|alunand7: big swing previous board.. i am sure about it...|pg||
mb|1D|nt|jaapfr: anyway 3nt was doomed with @H lead|pg||
mb|1N|nt|josj: ty Adi :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: wonder if they can get to the heart game|pg||
mb|2C|nt|dburn: dull hand, this - except in the Reisinger, where an overtrick matters|pg||
nt|xenya: reasonable slam here|pg||
mb|d|nt|mdgraham: en route to 3N here|pg||
nt|lml: I like to show a limit raise here even with only 3@H|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|Vugraphu2: after 6 rds in swiss Lynch 101, Dawson 93.35, Agica 92.97, Lall 91.46, cooper 86.75|pg||
nt|kit: going to be difficult for E-W to stop after the light opening bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: duck second @H and good quessing would bring it home|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mdgraham: although 6@D is reasonable - difficult to bid perhaps|pg||
mb|3S|nt|xenya: 6@D or 6N|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: 6@D is better|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jaapfr: duck 2nd @H @SK @CA @DQ x@C and so it made but not likely in other room would be played like that|pg||
nt|lml: West should go for sure now... well done|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: don't know if this is forcing or not in their methods -- we will soon find out|pg||
nt|josj: very light overcall by E but EW landed on their feet|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: East gave himself some plus points as he deserves for that chunky suit|pg||
mb|5C|nt|kit: not necessarily so dull -- East may be thinking slam|pg||
nt|kareno: West may not care :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: what would have happened if N does not X 4@D?|pg||
nt|frankaus: this will set it |pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|dburn: well, he can get his hand shown and still stop in 3NT|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe they won't be able to do that so easily at the other table, it's true|pg||
nt|dburn: except that if this is the Kwiecien team, it will also play Polish Club|pg||
mb|p|nt|gowdy: passive @C here  best |pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: On VG here is Pollack-Spector NS vs Tuszynkski-Kowalski EW|pg||
nt|me argent: carefull and lucky play should produce 11tricks|pg||
nt|kit: I think declarer will go after diamonds first, but not totally clear|pg||
nt|me argent: feels rgt kit|pg||
nt|gowdy: my guess is @H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sA|nt|gowdy: na @D  :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @CT entry for all dropping @D nicely|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|nt|josj: yes, no chance to wrong for the def.|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kit: you lose, Bruce -- it seems|pg||
nt|dburn: spies inform me that East-West at the other table are higher than 3NT already|pg||
nt|kit: now heart finesse for sure|pg||
nt|dburn: the same spies inform me that you might make six diamonds. Yes, I suppose you might.|pg||
nt|me argent: looks like the board was won when EW stopped in 3NT|pg||
nt|xenya: as on some layouts it can be made on a trump coup if S has Hxxx in @Ds|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|pc|s6|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|me argent: it wont be played in 6@Ds i am willing 2 bet|pg||
nt|lml: he didnt want the spade ruffed so he tried the safer player in hearts.  A man thinking imps|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kit: declarer taking 2 spade ruffs -- not totally clear to me that this is best approach|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|pc|c3|pg||
nt|josj: well, unless N ducks...|pg||
nt|josj: taking the ace and returning a @C also does not help NS|pg||
pc|cA|nt|me argent: 4@Ss final contract OR|pg||
nt|dburn: meanwhile, at this table East is battling to take as many overtricks as he can in 3NT|pg||
nt|kit: declarer will probably persist with diamonds -- works very well, but only 11 tricks as North guards hearts and South spades|pg||
nt|dburn: two will do, since 4@s at the other table will not make more than 10 tricks|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kareno: Two spade ruffing finesses?|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||
nt|kareno: Better?|pg||
pc|cK|pc|h5|nt|dburn: actually, I suppose it might make 11 - is a 10-point difference a win or a push in this event?|pg||
nt|josj: OK|pg||

nt|alunand7: look likes play in 2@H|pg||
nt|lml: game north south is tough on this lie of the cards|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|nt|kit: overcall on North hand marginal|pg||
nt|kareno: 1@s just loses the heart suit forever.|pg||
nt|kit: North will be back in with 2@H -- this time.|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kit: South had other options -- I don't know what is best|pg||
nt|me argent: do everybody agree with norths final pass?|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|gowdy: not me !|pg||
nt|Walddk4: After 6: 1. Delmonte 14.95 2. Nickell 13.05 3. Kwiecien  12.00 4. Kendrick 11.61 5. Polowan 9.88 6. Shugart 9.2 7. Becker 8. Spector 9.Greenberg  10.Diamond |pg||
nt|kit: definitely agree -- North "has his bids" -- nothing extra.  North is expected to hold 6 points when they preempt.|pg||
nt|me argent: even with adverse ruff and @HK offside NS make 10 tricks in @Hs|pg||
nt|kit: lif is like that -- South could be a LOT weaker for the 3@H call|pg||
nt|gowdy: ok I relent pass is best|pg||
nt|dburn: sure - pass of 3@H close to obvious at BAM, even close to normal at IMPs|pg||
nt|me argent: unless east quacks the opening @S lead|pg||
nt|gowdy: so my answer is i'm happy to be here and not there|pg||
nt|kit: and not even clear that 4@H will make -- there is that 4th round of clubs, you know|pg||
nt|mrace: he doesnt need to |pg||
nt|kareno: Kwiecien treating his hand like 5-4|pg||
nt|josj: good question|pg||
nt|jaapfr: -1 or -2?|pg||
nt|lml: north south are trying to get each other to pick the suit.  |pg||
pc|dA|nt|josj: there they go|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kit: South is bidding a LOT.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lml: if I was going to bid as south I would make that bid|pg||
nt|lml: I doubled spades so this must give partner a choice|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|mrace: will make this though i guess|pg||
nt|alunand7: thats right Japp|pg||
nt|jaapfr: which:)???????|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: effortless|pg||
nt|kit: Well, they got it right -- this time.  But much easier if either one of them bids their hand properly the first time.|pg||
nt|kareno: No way to go wrong.|pg||
nt|josj: making 5 I think|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kit: speak for yourself :)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|alunand7: sorry *jaap|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i meant -1 OR -2 harry\|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|kit: Of course, defending 3@C might have been somewhat more profitable.|pg||
nt|mrace: u mean Declarer proof Karen  ? :) |pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: K asks for count|pg||
nt|kareno: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: the declarer in question is a world champion, tim|pg||
pc|d8|nt|frankaus: 11 is likely now|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lml: East doesnt have much of a double but since they are already in game might as well give it a shot|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d5|pg||
nt|mrace: i know :) |pg||
nt|alunand7: yes, it is...2@H will down 1 or 2 depends on defender way:)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|c8|nt|mrace: thats why i asked :) |pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|kit: surprised declarer didn't split diamond honors there -- not that it will matter|pg||

pc|h2|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ritong: by the way, his pard pepsi is less present these times on the international stage|pg||
pc|s3|nt|xenya: now you can squeeze W or try for a @C ruff in dummy in case they are not 3-3|pg||
nt|me argent: spector on rgt track for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|kit: can you correct count for squeeze conveniently?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|pg||

pc|hT|nt|dburn: no, but this will do|pg||
nt|mrace: pyscola or however u spell his name... ? |pg||
pc|h8|nt|xenya: vulnerable, 3N seems a reasonable proposition here -- admittedly, it needs some luck to make |pg||

nt|jaapfr: ok -1|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|c5|pc|s5|pg||

nt|mrace: it has been a challenge to me to remember to spell his name|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a lot depends on your overcall range - North is close to an invite opposite 16-18, but opposite 15-17 you can understand the pass|pg||
nt|alunand7: Slam Zone now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a very light 6@S which makes|pg||
mb|1S|nt|xenya: "only" 8 imps for AIC on 17 -- EW bid and made 4@H in the OR|pg||
mb|2D|nt|gowdy: pass ?|pg||
nt|ritong: please, can some polish spec tell me?|pg||
nt|ritong: pszczola, my bad|pg||

mb|2S|mb|3H|nt|gowdy: 4 D now|pg||
nt|me argent: everyone overcall 2@Hs|pg||

nt|josj: they already entered the down zone|pg||
nt|jaapfr: bets on will they play slam or not  (my vote is no slam)?|pg||
nt|ritong: bet would be will he try?|pg||
nt|alunand7: i beat slam!!|pg||
nt|ritong: hi there|pg||
nt|caruga: mine is yes|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi henri welcome too Bandung|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|kit: this is difficult bidding hand -- slam is reasonable|pg||
nt|ritong: you get it|pg||
nt|josj: all of them|pg||
nt|alunand7: hi henri and fabio..welcome|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: no shrinking violet, West|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: indeed|pg||
nt|kit: Opposite the strong jump shift, I don't think East will quit with the good 8-bagger|pg||
nt|caruga: hi all|pg||
nt|ritong: no, he does not try  reasonable|pg||
nt|alunand7: you won jaap :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kit: 2@H overcall clear in my book opposite passed hand -- partner can't have enough to bury you by bidding 3NT or something like that|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Spector: Splinter? Just kidding.  Pollack: Lead-directing.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this should be regarded as protective as there was no double of the 2@H transfer |pg||
nt|jaapfr: after 1nt one must have a lot of imagination as S to see a slam:)|pg||
nt|lml: so maybe he should consider notrump rather than hearts|pg||
pc|c2|nt|me argent: but from what i have seen over past 2 bds pollack likes to pass|pg||
nt|kareno: especially once he gets raised.|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Which world championship?|pg||
nt|kit: This will get them to the good 6@D contract|pg||
nt|ritong: pairs|pg||
nt|josj: 3@H worked well as it pushed the opps too high|pg||
nt|xenya: i think W must balance non-vulnerable|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mdgraham: totally agree|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: I agreed |pg||
pc|s6|nt|kit: When your entire hand is in one suit, it is a good idea to bid that suit|pg||
nt|alunand7: manappo did not try it....:(|pg||
nt|ritong: however, there is an interesting proceeding to suggest slam without getting too involved|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|ritong: it is " other major"|pg||
nt|lml: can he make it if he doesn't guess hearts?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|kit: West will like his hand a lot -- the question is whether or not he should bid more then just jumping to 6@D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: opposite the wrong hand, you could go for a penalty, but if you don't lose 500 once in a while you are not bidding enough - you will lose part-score swings   |pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|pc|dA|pg||
nt|ritong: here, 3@h|pg||
nt|lml: we are about to find out|pg||
nt|lml: I think he is down now|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: declarer take a breath :)|pg||
nt|lml: east doesnt have enough diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: north south are being heavily punished for very small wrong choices|pg||
nt|lml: one thing I have learned.  When you are in this zone... the third and bad zone don't push|pg||
nt|lml: don't do anything unusual|pg||
nt|lml: and pray for flat hands|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: balance hand sometimes give us "dangerous & mistery" :(|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kit: play will go quickly here, with ace of spades still an entry.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kareno: His partner is moving to slam missing KQ of his suit.|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|pg||
pc|c3|nt|dburn: well, it depends on the extent to which 1@d shows diamonds, perhaps|pg||
nt|dburn: five-card majors, and all...|pg||
nt|dburn: still, I'd have opened the bidding|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Next up: Becker vs Diamond|pg||
nt|gowdy: well it does not deny @D|pg||
nt|kit: If East hadn't returned a spade, declarer might well have gone wrong -- taking diamond finesse instead of spade finesse, for example.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Roland will post standings when they're available|pg||
nt|gowdy: true  give e aq @S and ak of @C  then  @D q is on side with the bidding|pg||
nt|kit: of course if East didn't have queen of diamonds, he might just cash ace of spades fearing declarer could take 7 hearts and 5 diamonds|pg||
nt|xenya: even holding the @DQ, he might fear declarer can take 12 tricks|pg||
nt|gowdy: and then why did w lead a club  must have a @s card|pg||
nt|kit: from QJ10 of clubs, club lead would be pretty clear -- no inference there I don't think|pg||
nt|kit: Holding guarded queen of diamonds East doesn't need to cash -- how can declarer take 12 tricks?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ritong: meaning " i like my hand  do you too?"|pg||
nt|alunand7: bid 3@H better|pg||
nt|lml: he had two decisions to make ... notrump or hearts and then which hand to cash the trump from|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kit: grand is decent, but pretty hard to put it all together I think.|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|h4|nt|xenya: the dummy is not quite suitable, so he will go down a few|pg||
nt|lml: and he got both wrong|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h7|pg||
nt|lml: but neither was really a "mistake"|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|xenya: 2 or 3 |pg||
pc|h6|pc|d7|pg||
pc|s8|nt|Vugraphu2: After 18 boards, Nickell over Delmonte by 1.1 board, Kwiecien about 2 behind them|pg||
nt|ritong: ty|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: And Kendrick next by 1|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Unless Kwiecien's teammates fail to find this slam, 3/4 place won't change.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Standings are always 1 round behind|pg||
nt|kareno: Hard to imagine they won't bid a slam with those cards... but ...|pg||
nt|ritong: it needs a very wild preempting opening and west decides there are two aces off|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, they missed slam in the OR I hear.|pg||
nt|kareno: Played 5@d|pg||
nt|ritong: like 5@d opening  swish?|pg||
nt|kareno: No, an auction.|pg||
nt|ritong: hm|pg||
nt|kareno: 6 rounds of an auction I'm told.  |pg||
nt|ritong: a LONG auction, even  weird|pg||
nt|kareno: No kidding, weird.|pg||

mb|p|nt|kareno: Um.. scuse me :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, it's a long way to 6@C. They bid it well.|pg||
nt|lml: well this is probably a pretty normal 3NT by east-west |pg||
mb|2D|nt|lml: a flat type hand... one for north south to catch their breath on|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: reasonable hand for 4-card overcall|pg||
mb|2N|nt|vugraphzbq: what is about 6@C?|pg||
nt|lml: I wonder if North is the good partner sort who will lead a heart|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: arhum|pg||
nt|kareno: mmmm.|pg||
nt|xenya: finding a 4-4 minor-suit fit on this type of hand is quite an achievement i think |pg||

nt|alunand7: 11 trick already now|pg||
nt|alunand7: easy claim..|pg||

nt|peachy: Yes, 3D looks about right|pg||
nt|peachy: sry all,|pg||
nt|kareno: More menagerie.  Wonder if Hamman thought 2@s was forcing.|pg||

mb|p|nt|lml: 6@C needs a lot|pg||
mb|3S|nt|xenya: when you have an 8-card fit in a major|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: its my bid|pg||
nt|kit: East would prefer to be able to bid 2NT takeout and let partner bid his minor|pg||
nt|ritong: curiouser and curiouser|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mdgraham: this might end in 6@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: n/s apparently landed in 3@c open room in the end.|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: which will probably fail|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: the 1@S overcall scared E-W out of notrump -- but the patient died, as 3NT doesn't make|pg||
nt|lml: definitely needs to pickup clubs and also another trick, spade ace onside probably|pg||
pc|hT|nt|frankaus: lets c if it makes|pg||

nt|mdgraham: Hi Jos|pg||
nt|josj: hi Mike|pg||

nt|josj: 6@H is the better scoring slam, even more so for NS|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this will go two off I reckon - East will probably try a heart to the queen, hoping for 3-2 hearts with the king in the South hand |pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk4: Why would he think that, Kit, after North supported over the double?|pg||
nt|me argent: will the auction tell declarer how to play trumps?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kit: South will be disappointed when his partner unable to ruff second club|pg||

pc|dK|nt|me argent: he should know about now|pg||

nt|jaapfr: now a real slam 6@D C|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: another @D preempt|pg||
mb|p|nt|gowdy: :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: 1 down|pg||
nt|kit: Precision here |pg||
nt|kareno: Thanks :)|pg||
nt|josj: and another light overcall|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: saying it will make usually invokes the commetators curse :(|pg||
mb|1D|nt|kit: Natural overcall in responder's suit -- often difficult to deal with|pg||
nt|kareno: East's bid does not fit the Pearson Point Law :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@S is an optimistic contract|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not justified by success|pg||
nt|lml: well that bid is going to keep north quiet for a bit|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: worst possible layout|pg||
nt|jaapfr: you clicked harry away:)|pg||
nt|ritong: @d K off and @c 4/1|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lml: this could definitely be an action board|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|me argent: what would double mean from north now?|pg||
nt|gowdy: nice|pg||
nt|kit: good question -- does everybody know in their partnerships?|pg||
nt|me argent: not i|pg||
nt|jaapfr: only @CJ lead mite help:)|pg||
nt|ritong: this means that 6@c is dommed|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: so 9 more to Djarum...probably|pg||
nt|ritong: doomed*|pg||
mb|2N|nt|kit: which illustrates why the bid is difficult to deal with|pg||
nt|me argent: of course i like to discuss methods as little as possible|pg||
nt|josj: N says it won;'t make :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: in 6@D|pg||
nt|lml: this is one of those hands where you don't really want to press north south|pg||
nt|lml: remember the zone|pg||
nt|lml: or is it the force... well whatever|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|gowdy: cute splinter in P suit  well bid|pg||
nt|kit: thoughtful 4@H splinter -- in case North has slam possibilities|pg||
nt|kit: missed 4-4 club fit, but this probably plays as well |pg||
nt|kareno: And in the OR, South is playing 4@s.  That will be down several I think, and vulnerable no less.|pg||
mb|p|pc|cK|nt|Vugraphu2: N to E: We haven't discussed this auction.|pg||
nt|kit: However, the splinter will keep East away from heart lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Who has? :)|pg||
nt|kit: and he will probably lead a low trump|pg||
nt|josj: and he's right provided S wins and plays a @C|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, but they are good players|pg||
nt|ahalim: 6@D makes|pg||
pc|cA|nt|me argent: people who play the un q bid are more likely to discuss these type of auctions than those who dont|pg||
nt|kareno: Starting to see some tired bridge at this point.|pg||
nt|ritong: thus, they will land in @cs imho|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jaapfr: but then still has to hit @DA and @D back to avoid trumping @C so unlikely|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kit: this presents declarer with an interesting problem|pg||
nt|frankaus: wil need a @C switch|pg||
nt|josj: but X suggested a sing. @D|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h8|pc|h3|pg||
nt|kit: his best play now might be an unusual low club (remember, East might have stiff club), planning on ruffin 2 clubs in his hand|pg||
nt|jaapfr: we go back too 6m-1|pg||
nt|ahalim: on a @C lead decl will play that way|pg||
nt|ritong: he will be in @cs kiky  wanna bet?:)|pg||

nt|alunand7: karwur thinking or operator problem ? :)|pg||

pc|d9|nt|mrace: France|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lml: well now North did the right thing by not saving|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|kit: declarer will be able to set up club suit, losing a club trick along the way -- but he still gets 4 spades, 3 diamonds, 3 clubs for 10 tricks|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|pc|d2|nt|xenya: seems he could take 11 but that won't matter|pg||
nt|kit: apparently N-S in other room didn't know how to deal with the 2@H overcall -- they doubled it for only 500|pg||
nt|kareno: East working on eloping with his small trumps.|pg||
nt|mrace: sry private|pg||
nt|ritong: it was extremely dangerous anyway, i can t see why he led that|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|alunand7: but karwur did not do it :) |pg||
pc|h9|nt|jaapfr: i miss the logic of a @C lead with JT9x and @DK|pg||
nt|ritong: he would do it with 9 @cs, no doubt|pg||
nt|ritong: since south would show out|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d3|nt|lml: yes I know West might have made it but he took a reasonable line|pg||

nt|alunand7: strange ove but worked well jaap :)|pg||

nt|rodal f: Hi Linda and specs:) Good morning from Norway.|pg||
nt|lml: hello and welcome|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: hi :) and welcome|pg||
nt|lml: north south has been very unlucky and just a little off so far|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: on winning first trump, ruff @Cs in the N hand|pg||
nt|me argent: does west have a strong or weak nt or both?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|xenya: perhaps that wasn't safe enough though?|pg||
nt|lml: they have at least 2 more quite bad results to come|pg||
mb|d|nt|kareno: Flannery :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: yes the psycholigal part of the play is so difficult to see from here|pg||
mb|r|nt|lml: I was talking a bit about not pressing too hard when things arent working for you|pg||
mb|2C|nt|jaapfr: even spelled that way:(|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Flnnery -- will get them to routine 4@S|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N by N in the OR... -- a club lead would have made declarer sweat|pg||
nt|ritong: guess we got your drift|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kit: South expecting  a bit more for the 2@D call -- I think this will make|pg||
nt|kit: but as N-S are in 3@D doubled at other table, 470 might not be enough!|pg||
nt|lml: I ended it with a simple squeeze but that didn't matter because there actually was a marked finesse|pg||
nt|xenya: this is quite an interesting contract, yes|pg||
nt|me argent: whats 3@Cs? when 1@C ?could be 2|pg||
nt|kareno: Only three losers but ... are there ten winners?  With trump leads, perhaps not.|pg||
nt|kit: with king of diamonds on, should be easy|pg||
nt|josj: now NS will find their real fit|pg||
nt|frankaus: now 3@C will make E wish he had passed|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: for sure -- West has the advantage of knowing where most of the cards are, but will it be enough?|pg||
nt|josj: :)|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|xenya: mysterious, Joey|pg||
nt|josj: 2@D is not yet down either|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: surprising pass by North - 8 hcp and five diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|kit: now only needs to ruff a club and a diamond in dummy|pg||
nt|ritong: so, what will west try to beat that|pg||
nt|jaapfr: all declarers of bbo make 10 tr and a few lucky ones 11 tr|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|jaapfr: here|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|nt|me argent: then again whats 1@C instead of 1NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: 3@C explained as natural|pg||
nt|kit: declarer basically playing double-dummy now -- but can he do it?  I haven't worked it out yet.|pg||
nt|frankaus: !K is a standout here|pg||

pc|s8|pg||

mb|4H|nt|rodal f: Normal to enter game but will be hard. Depend at Ws lead and is OK|pg||
nt|lml: this is very close|pg||
nt|lml: and it is not clear how to play it at all|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrace: Kwiecien and Delmonte race for 2nd place |pg||
nt|kit: Hamman will double again, with good neg double|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Now East is able to take save based on partner's diamond length -- but it is a phantom|pg||
nt|kit: There should be no forcing passes here, since 4@S call made under fire -- it is everybody for himself|pg||
nt|ritong: extremely pragmatic|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jaapfr: and nothing revealing|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kit: and North snatches defeat from the jaws of victory|pg||
nt|kareno: That sounds like a three-card spade suit since south did not bid spades at once.|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d7|pg||
nt|kit: trump lead good enough to prevent heart ruff in the short hand.|pg||
nt|ritong: well, when you go down there when 6m made, you may regret this discretion|pg||
pc|hK|nt|me argent: good biddings by EW|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: double phantom saves |pg||
nt|Walddk4: After 8: 1. Delmonte 18.45 2. Nickell 18.05 3. Kwiecien  17.00 4. Kendrick 13.61 5. Shugart 12.77 6. Polowan 12.38 7. Diamond 8. Becker 9. Greenberg 10. Spector|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|rodal f: Pitching @C at @C and W are endplayed?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kit: Of course North would have to defend accurately to defeat 5@H, finding the club shift|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|nt|jaapfr: true|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||

pc|d6|nt|lml: he was endplayed but it wasn't really needed|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|lml: he could have got the same result leading a diamond from hand|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s8|nt|mrace: seems like d2 now to me |pg||
pc|d5|nt|kit: 7-2-2-2 hands are never as good offensively as one might think.  If you squint a bit and consider them as 6-2-2-2, you get an accurate evaluation.|pg||

nt|rodal f: E gave some help there|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|nt|kit: but may not be good enough, as 3@H doubled in other room, and that might be a make.|pg||
