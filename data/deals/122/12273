mb|3D|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: almost too sound|pg||

nt|othered1: Do we know anything about systems here?|pg||
nt|yuval10: naturalish|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2 over 1 i persume|pg||
nt|yuval10: nothing too fency|pg||
nt|vugraphzbs: 1 minute to start|pg||
nt|mmmakela: hi all! easy 4 @H to start with|pg||
nt|yuval10: shalom Eyal :)|pg||
nt|pelu: but more iff if N open a lot of @D|pg||
nt|yuval10: our operator is Eyal Erez, former member of the Israeli schools team|pg||
nt|vugraphzbs: HI ALL:)|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@d - 3@s -3NT - 4@h ?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 5 dias ok too|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|jtr: I think 3@d said enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: EW figure not to compete, giving NS room to find the major.  But 5@D also scores|pg||
nt|othered1: do they play extra strong preempts?|pg||
nt|othered1: Possible for this to play in 3@D|pg||
nt|yuval10: i don't think South will pass it|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello to all|pg||
nt|yuval10: she knows game is cold against AK@d and 3 major|pg||
nt|othered1: My partners, and we think we're conservative, wouldn't have that side ace.|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@D = 6 losers - sp close to standard|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|jtr: North leaves the room|pg||
nt|bobh1: dont blame him|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe the building too|pg||
nt|othered1: not easy to find @S here|pg||
nt|bobh1: i would doule with the S hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: hi Sveta|pg||
mb|3N|nt|bobh1: double|pg||
nt|jallerton: but you'll miss a lot of games when partner (who is bound to lack a club stop) does not proceed|pg||
nt|othered1: Depends on what 1@C, alerted, implies|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Because of the shape Bob?:)|pg||
nt|bobh1: double is more flexible|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|yuval10: Israeli juniors team has won 2 silver medals in last year's European championship|pg||
nt|yuval10: therefor considered as hot favourite for medals in the World championship as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: maybe i can show my strength later|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Hard to catch them now|pg||
nt|jallerton: what does 1NT mean in your system, Bob?|pg||
nt|othered1: wow, I can't believe east wasn't forced after west's double|pg||
nt|bobh1: i would tend to have a runout suit if the viciously double me|pg||
nt|yuval10: this year's EC sry, at pioana Brasov|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|othered1: fine auction by NS that I couldn't have duplicated.  But south knows her partner.|pg||
nt|pelu: I remember - 10 years ago - that the junior-chanpionship had round 1000 players - in diff grups - how is it to day?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bobh1: and not support for all the unbid suits which is a takeout double|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
nt|jallerton: I play the other way round: if I have a long suit, I bid it immediately|pg||
nt|jallerton: Did West think his pass was forcing?|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||
nt|othered1: Do you all allow east to pass here?  Admitted they're in his "suit" but . . .|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I wouldn't consider preempt opening with side ace, but, agree with Ed - NS know each other better|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think we have less now unfortunately ... but the junior's team championship is still the peak of junior bridge|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|s6|pg||
nt|othered1: 100 percent forcing by uph.|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think this has to be a forcing situation|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|jtr: Seems to me West should double|pg||
nt|yuval10: south might ruff a @s for caution if @s's are 5-2 and @h's are 4-1|pg||
nt|othered1: seems normal enough|pg||
pc|hK|nt|pelu: if @Hs 4-1 - she will not get her @D-trick|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h5|pc|hJ|pg||

nt|jtr: East chickened out on his pile of rubbish (which wasnt opened in the other room)|pg||
nt|jtr: oh it was sorry|pg||
pc|sT|nt|bobh1: W said: can you double this? and E replied: i had a lousy 1@c bid|pg||
nt|jtr: Right|pg||
mc|11|nt|jallerton: Curiously, North also tried to play in 2@C in the other room|pg||
nt|yuval10: but if the A@d was in the hand without the 4th trump she'd have scored her contract regardless|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|hJ|nt|mdgraham: well, no-one forced South to jump to 4@C, so he clearly has some extreme shape |pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|yuval10: another big hand for S|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|yuval10: likely to go all the wat to 4@s by herself|pg||
mb|2D|nt|yuval10: *way|pg||
mb|4C|nt|othered1: not doubling lost 5 imps there.  In this match, that's a lot.|pg||
nt|pelu: I likethe 1-opening by S - if she - with 3 losers - open 2@C - then diff to show both suits|pg||
nt|othered1: West now needs to take a position on getting his long suit into the auction at this high level|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: NS don't believe in superaccepting.   |pg||
nt|jallerton: Weak NT.  By the way, Ed, Keith Bennett found the weak NY opening on the 1444 with stiff @sk on bd 23|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  if he intended to show strong hand, he has to comlete the hand showing|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: *wean NT|pg||
nt|othered1: Anyone simply overcall west's hand?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|othered1: Unless I thought it was a NT hand, too good for 1N overcall . . . |pg||
nt|pelu: close to 2@H - but very strong and the hand can plsy in 3 suits - som I X|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|pc|s2|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c8|pc|c5|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|s3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|othered1: Somehow I get luckier results when I get my long suits into the auction as soon as possible.|pg||
nt|pelu: agree, Ed, but this time I would D|pg||
nt|yuval10: and now? @s to A?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: or 10 maybe|pg||
nt|yuval10: she needs to find @s's 3-2, that's a certainty|pg||
nt|pelu: no @H ruff and @C-ruff|pg||
nt|othered1: West's initial double didn't clearly mark the @SK, but the long huddle over 4@C may have|pg||
nt|pelu: if overruffed @S can be 2-2 after the ruff|pg||
nt|yuval10: she might lose control|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|nt|jallerton: Richard Palmer did not break the transfer here, not liking his @CQ doubleton|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|yuval10: now she'll go down|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|h6|nt|pelu: and now she lose 4tricks|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|d3|pc|s7|pg||

pc|c9|pc|c2|pc|d4|nt|othered1: And there are reasons for that|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|hT|pc|s9|pc|h2|pc|h7|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I am not convinced that it's a good idea to play transfers over a weak NT|pg||
nt|othered1: I play them all the time and am convinced it's not a good idea at all.|pg||

nt|pelu: standard weak 2|pg||

pc|s2|nt|jtr: Not bad company in which to be|pg||
nt|bobh1: @h duck a good start i think|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: with spades 2-2 there is an endplay available|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|bobh1: can trap N if he reads the position|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Three rounds of clubs after a heart ruff|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jallerton: or is it better to play @d to the 10?|pg||
nt|jtr: That works too if he reds|pg||
nt|jtr: reads it|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|jtr: Stops him being endplayed|pg||

pc|hK|nt|jallerton: her|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jtr: Oh?|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  cautious with count now|pg||
nt|yuval10: 6@s, 2@h from S, N affraid of 1@d and 4@c|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks safely to continue @s then S plays @c|pg||
nt|mmmakela: that's why a spade 1st then a club|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|nt|bobh1: not a bad slam|pg||
nt|jtr: Slammish|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@d and @h would be 5+|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: 2NT can be 18-19 or 12-14|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3NT would've been 15-17 from South|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobh1: would bid 3@h as W|pg||
mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|yuval10: looks like declarer will make his contract through 2@s, 2@h, 2@d and 3@c|pg||
nt|pelu: over a jump to 3NT - N would have a problem with 5-5 in major - so I prefer 2NT on all balanced hands|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|jallerton: Depends on their methods|pg||
nt|jtr: 4@h splinter would work better maybe|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  nice surprise in hearts for declarer|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|bobh1: around here 3@h is slam interest in @ss with a short suit somewhere so ideal|pg||
nt|yuval10: E has a problem now|pg||
pc|c6|nt|pelu: all lead would cost tricks |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  it's lesser evil from all possible|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 1st 3 boards compared 0-0|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk2: 3@H should be a balanced slam try in my opinion. 4@H splinter|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jallerton: passed hand, Roland|pg||
nt|othered1: Very, very tough for a passed hand to get to slam opposite a s 15-17 1N opening.  Post-mortem stuff,  Here, 2-way Stayman might have had a shot.|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cJ|pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: Indeed, but generally speaking|pg||
nt|bobh1: i play that 4@d is the balanced slam try|pg||
nt|jtr: Being a passed hand doesnt stop Roland bidding slams|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|othered1: now west will run out of comfortable pitches soon|pg||
nt|yuval10: might be a squeeze for 10th trick over W|pg||
nt|pelu: a small @C from S would again endplay East|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed|pg||
nt|othered1: We're thinking about overtricks, while declarer is still looking for best line to 9.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|s8|pc|sT|pg||
nt|jtr: It encourages him actually|pg||
nt|yuval10: small @c is safety for 9th trick|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  one more kind of endplay|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c8|pc|hQ|pc|h8|pg||
nt|pelu: yes even with @D Q 10 in West - the small @C to East would set up the 9. trick|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: too thin even for a raptor 1NT|pg||

nt|mdgraham: although an old English player (S.J.Simon - Why You Lose At Bridge) - was a great believer in thin doubles on this type of hand  |pg||

pc|s4|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|mdgraham: Doubling 3@H is misconceived, I feel|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
nt|hedyg: passing the double more so imo|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North cannot guarantee two off|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and doubling for one off at teams is...well, daft|pg||
nt|davidb: If you have a reasonable partnership -X is a good bid -strong invitation to 4sp|pg||
nt|hedyg: you think the X was penalty? i dont|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think he needed to duck that diamond. He needs an extra trick later|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agreed, if it is non-penalty.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not easy, but he should have let @DQ hold|pg||
nt|hedyg: N is too strong to just bid 3@s|pg||
nt|mdgraham: However South seems to feel that it is penalty|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I thought Birman would have given it some time before he won the ace|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The tank came one move too late|pg||
nt|hedyg: @H or @c?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Irrespective of the result, it just shows that regular partnerships need to be on firm ground about doubles like this|pg||
nt|davidb: playing H gives him an opportunity |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Even if you get +200, it's too hard on the nerves|pg||
nt|hedyg: spec suggests 9@H, N doesnt cover...@s ruff and @d|pg||
nt|Walddk2: On the surface he only has 2 clubs and 1 diamond to lose from here, but he does not have enough entries to do all he likes|pg||
nt|davidb: I believe very few partnership play any X for penalty when opponets support each other|pg||
nt|hedyg: right David|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's why that diamond duck was essential|pg||
nt|davidb: come on Alon 9 of H |pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|hedyg: trying telepathy?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North should duck the @H9 - then cover the Q|pg||
nt|davidb: I am 20 km away |pg||
nt|hedyg: Alon Birman is a thinker in the best of times, so now...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Basically, declarer needs three finesses (two in hearts and one in clubs), and he only has two entries|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North has the rather inconvenient @H8|pg||
nt|mdgraham: could try one heart hook, then ruff a spade and play a diamond up|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South will be sort-of endplayed |pg||
nt|mdgraham: spade=ruff/sluff, diamond=East plays 10, so @H4 becomes entry, club=ok |pg||

nt|davidb: D & duck spade|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South needed to keep that spade |pg||
nt|mdgraham: or to discard the queen, as Tomas Gotard says|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This has certainly not been Assaraf's hand. Three very serious errors|pg||
