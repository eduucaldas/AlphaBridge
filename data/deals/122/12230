nt|psridhar: going by the trend in 1st segment NS may well crack a grand on this|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Our operator is Ruzbeh Raja|pg||
nt|psridhar: i hv seen the bidding go 1s-4h( splinter)-4s( wasted h kqj of h pd ! )-all pass|pg||

nt|psridhar: hi all -welcome to the final segment of the QF|pg||
nt|psridhar: the site for results http://indianbridgepages.appspot.com/ Winter_Nationals/2009/Results.el|pg||
nt|patricck: The Semi-Final is 36 boards in 3 segments of 12?|pg||
nt|psridhar: i am not very familiar about the NS pair- but CV RAO is a well known indian team having won several national titles|pg||
nt|Walddk6: A spectator suggests that this is the other semi-final|pg||
nt|Walddk6: CABAL vs Dhampur|pg||
nt|psridhar: something wrong -the EW pair plays for dhampur i am certain|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|drkvas: hi guys|pg||
mb|1N|nt|psridhar: N hand ideal for a short suit trial bid|pg||
nt|psridhar: kind of splinter game try|pg||
nt|drkvas: u think ok with 3 trumps ps?|pg||
nt|psridhar: N hand doc|pg||
nt|drkvas: ok r|pg||
nt|drkvas: but i think 2@s is misclick|pg||
nt|psridhar: yeah too strong for a simple raise|pg||
nt|patricck: welcome everyone|pg||
nt|patricck: Are NS playing inverted major raises?|pg||
nt|patricck: It appears the other table has been renamed, do we do the same here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: i have played against Ashok goel and kamal mukh all my life :)  they belong to dhampur|pg||
nt|Walddk6: This is more like it|pg||
mb|2C|nt|patricck: that makes more sense :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|drkvas: 1INDIAN RAILWAYS - A  15212ARUN JAIN,   132|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Operator, please shut down and reconnect to the other room|pg||
nt|Walddk6: The other operator realised the error and has opened a new broadcast|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk6: Best to do it now|pg||
nt|psridhar: i think this match is Dhampur Vs cabal|pg||
mb|d|nt|bjacobs: The challenge is to stay out of the poor grand slam - even though it happens to make|pg||
nt|Walddk6: but ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: yes it is dhampur vs cabal|pg||
nt|Walddk6: The team names are now reversed :(|pg||
nt|panja: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Hi Panja|pg||
nt|psridhar: cabal is a team from Mumbai|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|panja: Good Morning Roland, hi all|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, Dhampur is the EW pair, they should be in mauve|pg||
pc|sK|nt|patricck: the defence will need to be careful here|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||

nt|panja: it is good to see Sanjay Damle playing in semis...(South)|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|c9|nt|drkvas: yes now the ball is rolling nicely|pg||
nt|psridhar: 4H is pushy with the 'wasted' dia queen ...but i guess the stiff H makes up for it|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: error corrected|pg||
nt|patricck: 4@H would have been a splinter, enabled North to assess correctly to drive to slam|pg||
nt|psridhar: i hear other room also in 6s|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|drkvas: u have sharp ears ps|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|nt|psridhar: gud lead-makes life tough for declarer-other room led dia ACE|pg||
