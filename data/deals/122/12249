nt|vugraphzwu: player at south not in seat.....waiting|pg||

nt|peachy: but we will surely get going soon:)|pg||
nt|psridhar: EW are indian railways and NS are Mango's team|pg||
nt|peachy: can you tell me (and kibs maybe) what systems these pairs use|pg||
nt|psridhar: both pairs use natural methods |pg||
nt|psridhar: 5 card Maj, strong NT|pg||
nt|peachy: thank you|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: error with duplication of open room set|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: closed room will continue as normal|pg||
nt|psridhar: hi all -welcome to the final segment of the QF|pg||
nt|psridhar: the site for results http://indianbridgepages.appspot.com/ Winter_Nationals/2009/Results.el|pg||
nt|patricck: The Semi-Final is 36 boards in 3 segments of 12?|pg||
nt|psridhar: i am not very familiar about the NS pair- but CV RAO is a well known indian team having won several national titles|pg||
nt|Walddk6: A spectator suggests that this is the other semi-final|pg||
nt|Walddk6: CABAL vs Dhampur|pg||
nt|psridhar: something wrong -the EW pair plays for dhampur i am certain|pg||
nt|psridhar: hi all welcome to the 2nd segment of semifinals|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: Welcome back to all|pg||
nt|psridhar: hi all welcome to the 2nd edition of this needle match|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: Hi Good morning all|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2S|nt|drkvas: hi guys|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: N hand ideal for a short suit trial bid|pg||
nt|psridhar: kind of splinter game try|pg||
nt|drkvas: u think ok with 3 trumps ps?|pg||
nt|psridhar: N hand doc|pg||
nt|drkvas: ok r|pg||
nt|drkvas: but i think 2@s is misclick|pg||
nt|psridhar: yeah too strong for a simple raise|pg||
nt|patricck: welcome everyone|pg||
nt|patricck: Are NS playing inverted major raises?|pg||
nt|patricck: It appears the other table has been renamed, do we do the same here?|pg||
nt|patricck: Welcome Sunil|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: i have played against Ashok goel and kamal mukh all my life :)  they belong to dhampur|pg||
nt|Walddk6: This is more like it|pg||
nt|patricck: 4 sets of 16 boards, a 64 board Final|pg||
mb|3C|nt|patricck: that makes more sense :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|drkvas: 1INDIAN RAILWAYS - A  15212ARUN JAIN,   132|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Operator, please shut down and reconnect to the other room|pg||
nt|Walddk6: The other operator realised the error and has opened a new broadcast|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: this is the final of the Ruia trophy... the symbol of supremacy in Indian bridge|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: Hello Patrick|pg||
nt|psridhar: if he had overcalled 2c instead of 1nt Sumit might hv raised with ACE and 4 trumps-then 3nt easy|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Walddk6: Best to do it now|pg||
nt|psridhar: i think this match is Dhampur Vs cabal|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: The challenge is to stay out of the poor grand slam - even though it happens to make|pg||
nt|Walddk6: but ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: in the other match cabal leads dhampur by 10 IMP's|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: yes it is dhampur vs cabal|pg||
nt|Walddk6: The team names are now reversed :(|pg||
nt|panja: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Hi Panja|pg||
nt|psridhar: cabal is a team from Mumbai|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Rehi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk6: Welcome to Carl Mathiesen from Norway|pg||
nt|psridhar: hi Sunil|pg||
pc|cA|nt|panja: Good Morning Roland, hi all|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, Dhampur is the EW pair, they should be in mauve|pg||
nt|patricck: South will have no trouble finding the right lead if EW get overboard, but I don't anticipate that|pg||
pc|cK|nt|patricck: the defence will need to be careful here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Hi Sridhar|pg||
nt|psridhar: 7 card suit with 6 controls...i dont think 1Nt did justice to that holding|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|dA|nt|psridhar: touch and go.. d1 at most|pg||
nt|panja: it is good to see Sanjay Damle playing in semis...(South)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i dont think they will overreach as they lck the @H control|pg||
pc|d3|nt|psridhar: key point of partnership understdg here is - what is diff between direct 3s over 2s and 3s via 2nt-since 2s is 6 cards 99% of the time|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sharkey: Good afternoon|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|drkvas: yes now the ball is rolling nicely|pg||
nt|psridhar: 4H is pushy with the 'wasted' dia queen ...but i guess the stiff H makes up for it|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: error corrected|pg||
nt|patricck: 4@H would have been a splinter, enabled North to assess correctly to drive to slam|pg||
nt|psridhar: i hear other room also in 6s|pg||
pc|d8|nt|drkvas: u have sharp ears ps|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Hi Sridhar|pg||
nt|psridhar: i thk via 2nt shd suggest 3nt and 4s while direct 3s shd actively propel towards a spd contract|pg||
nt|psridhar: hi Sunil |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i think u thk right Sridhar :)|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d4|nt|psridhar: gud lead-makes life tough for declarer-other room led dia ACE|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bjacobs: No justice|pg||
nt|psridhar: i hv placed an agent there doc :)|pg||
nt|panja: he trained a lot of young people in 70's and 80's, under United Bridge Association|pg||
nt|psridhar: if declarer had played a LOW club W might hv ducked and entry to dummy to play dia|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|drkvas: 3 cabal 4SUNIL MACHHAR  5 cvrao 6 india blues 7 dsm 8sreecem 9 formidables 10 mango 11 goverdhan agg hyd|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h6|pg||
pc|sK|nt|panja: a few years ago, he was very unwell, but has now recovered...|pg||
nt|psridhar: in other words one can raise 2s to 3s even on a doubleton if he has a SUIT ORIENTED hand-say KX,XX,AXXX,KQXXX|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|nt|sharkey: Is this the last 12 boards of this match?|pg||
nt|patricck: rehi everyone, got distracted there, hope I haven't missed much|pg||
