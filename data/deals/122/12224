nt|xenya: 6@C -- but can they bid it?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|me argent: alot of Y K and Zs at this table|pg||
nt|kit: South will compete to 3@H with 6 hearts and stiff club, and that should end it.|pg||
nt|kareno: I concur.|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: might be tough|pg||
mb|2N|nt|kit: not sure I see motivation behin this call -- it should be a game try, and he just isn't worth it.|pg||
nt|frankaus: both red i dont expect any heroics|pg||
nt|xenya: maybe they'll do well to bid 5@C?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: What's the purpose of that 3@d bid?  invitation?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|Vugraphu2: and one of them isn't even polish|pg||
nt|mrace: must be |pg||
nt|josj: hi Frank|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day Jos Jacobs welcome|pg||
nt|xenya: a hand for bidding competition actually|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: hi all and selamat siang|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|kareno: We're on a wavelength, Kit.|pg||
nt|kareno: And it has given west too much information.  |pg||
nt|kit: no reason for West to lead anything but a trump with everything under control.|pg||
nt|josj: this can go down on a club ruff but it probably won't|pg||
nt|xenya: well 4@S would have got a few points in a bidding competition |pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: odd sort of bidding, this, especially at BAM|pg||
nt|dburn: but West seemed unwilling to open or to rebid 1NT|pg||
nt|mrace: he heard ya |pg||
nt|ritong: she|pg||
nt|mrace: sry she|pg||
nt|ritong: gail greenberg|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer will lead club up immediately, and make with club ace on and hearts 2-2 -- can eventually ruff third diamond in dummy.|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, it gives up a spade trick, that is a reason not to lead trumps |pg||
nt|kit: Normal result, and that was achieved in other room.|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|kit: West had has awkward rebid -- hate to bid 2@D, but weak to reverse for most|pg||
nt|dburn: and did not consider he had enough for 2@h|pg||
mb|5C|nt|xenya: the trouble is that it might go down|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: i like 2@Cs|pg||
nt|gowdy: I admit I would have pushed with 2 H's|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@c certainly possible, but only if 2@h-3@h is natural after it|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: hi all :) welcome @H@H@H|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|xenya: i don't see how he can make it now -- he can't get to dummy's clubs and retain a @D control|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: some would solve problem by opening 1NT, but that has obvious flaws also|pg||
nt|josj: well it still can...|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|dT|nt|kit: will win in dummy, pitch spade on king of clubs, and diamond to king.|pg||
nt|kareno: I am not fond of trump leads|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|d4|nt|xenya: the question is whether EW can make 8 tricks in 1N -- on the surface, they can't|pg||
nt|kareno: They give up tempo and if you need to get your suits going, tempo matters a lot!|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|nt|kit: might not be fond of them, but on this hand was clear (although it turned out badly this time)|pg||

nt|josj: as declarer did not want to take the @C finesse, he accepted one down right from the start...|pg||
mb|1C|nt|kareno: I'd be passing with south's hand...|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: yes, should be|pg||
nt|josj: apparently NS play Strong Club|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mrace: yes u dont have QX in @H Karen :)|pg||
nt|ritong: no way brad passes, i think|pg||
nt|kit: 2@S looks a lot more descriptive than pass to me, but to each his own.|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: 2N?|pg||
nt|xenya: better|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kit: 3@H may be somewhat conservative -- but East will probably bid game anyway.|pg||
nt|xenya: but even this might not make|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Well, I hate to bid a jack-high suit first or second seat.  Too often it seduces partner into leading from honor-x to the detriment of the defense.|pg||
nt|ritong: he had a tough decision, with this scoring|pg||
mb|2C|an|forc|nt|kit: I'll worry about that when the bidding is over|pg||
nt|ritong: no doubt he would not think twice playing imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: well the lead helps a lot|pg||
mb|2D|nt|frankaus: this looks like a very strange aution|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: If South bids out his shape here, North may make the winning decision to play 4@S|pg||
nt|kit: Well, he got the disaster lead -- and won the board!|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, IMPs is a different reward system :)|pg||
nt|ritong: but kit is right, jeff hand is a conservative player in general|pg||
mb|2N|nt|kit: But instead North unnecessarily rushed to 3NT|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he didn't get the chance, which is a bit odd|pg||
nt|me argent: EW play polish@C so that probably influenced their choice of bids on 13|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: and 14 for that matter|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, sure - in Polish Club that sequence is automatci|pg||
nt|me argent: sorry cant keep my directions streight this is my first job|pg||
nt|kit: declarer will probably duck first heart, win second, and go after clubs|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|kit: I don't see that much difference between IMPs and matchpoints on East hand -- you bid game if you think it is a favorite, not otherwise, at both games.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Note that after the initial pass at other table they had no difficulty getting to game|pg||
mb|p|pc|d9|nt|frankaus: and a strange result as well|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|me argent: dummy squeezed|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|pc|c5|nt|josj: I an wondering if W showed @S at any time|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|gowdy: if @s lay right then this is bad   so right play|pg||
nt|josj: I am|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|h8|pc|h6|pg||

pc|c9|pc|d4|nt|josj: no game on for NS but -200 does not look too good|pg||

pc|c6|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kit: Now declarer has to decide whether West did this with queen of spades or not|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: I think I got W's pitch wrong a few tricks back, he probably threw @H|pg||

nt|mrace: i am bidding it in both...4 trumps and an Ace is too much to pass to a pd who overcalled at 3 level....just the @H support may make pd's hand a giant|pg||
nt|josj: yes...|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|xenya: sorry i should have said "her ace" -- NS are women|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Now the old choice -- 3NT or 4@H?|pg||
mb|p|pc|hT|nt|josj: but if W showed @S and it was alerted, 2NT is not easy to understand|pg||
nt|frankaus: 4@S EW may be playable here|pg||
nt|josj: sure but makeable? try a @D lead|pg||
pc|hK|nt|xenya: this might not be an easy one -- i'm abit surprised E raised|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kit: North afraid to compete to 3@H, fearing his partner will play him for invite values|pg||
nt|kit: Doesn't seem to me that whether partner has 3 hearts or not should make much difference.|pg||
nt|kareno: 2@h is a bit of an underbid with that hand, no?|pg||
nt|mrace: too many QJs|pg||
nt|kareno: Any more and she would have a 1nt opener.  |pg||
nt|kit: I would have bid 3NT on East hand, right or wrong.|pg||
nt|mrace: after 1 nt ? |pg||
nt|mrace: or 2@H ? |pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|s4|nt|me argent: but north did well to get his side out of nt|pg||
nt|josj: N should pass now but will he know that?|pg||
nt|josj: yes he did!|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kit: was just as well, as 3@H probably down 2 losing both club finesses|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|pg||
nt|kit: after 1NT|pg||
nt|kareno: This form of scoring that makes great sense, kit.|pg||
pc|c9|nt|dburn: indeed he did - that was a pretty good view|pg||
nt|ritong: agree, kit|pg||
nt|frankaus: this is likely to make|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|nt|me argent: south playing 1nt in OR on a @D lead|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|kit: very unusual hand where at IMPs I'd tend toward 4@H, but at matchpoints 3NT -- it is usually the other way around.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|gowdy: good bid by E not 100% obvious|pg||
nt|xenya: 9 tricks now -- E's @CJ is a big card|pg||
pc|c2|nt|me argent: a triumph 4 Garbage Stayman|pg||
pc|cT|pc|d5|pg||
nt|josj: even more likely now :)|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|nt|gowdy: yep   that 2 is not 100%|pg||
pc|c8|pc|sT|pg||
nt|kit: making them all, but lose the board|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|nt|josj: maybe an overtrick now as the hearts go on the @S|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ritong: again|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s3|pc|sK|nt|me argent: easts action irrelevant on this hand north won the bd with 2@Cs|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Next match Greenberg vs Kendrick|pg||
nt|gowdy: but he can only do what he can do|pg||
nt|dburn: if Kendrick still bids as he used to, should be an interesting match|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: There's a problem with bd 16, they're skipping to 17 and they'll get a substitute bd 16|pg||
nt|josj: no he played safe lready|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|kit: at IMPs the major needs to take 2 extra tricks to be really better, so lean towards notrump if close.  At matchpoints, needs to take only 1 extra trick.|pg||
nt|josj: a|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|nt|josj: should be just made I think|pg||
nt|josj: and that's what it says now|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: 4@c just made :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kit: Here, however, 4@H figures to be completely safe while 3NT might have  a hole, but on balance I would bet on same number of tricks.|pg||

mb|1C|nt|Vugraphu2: EW play 4-card majors and weak NT|pg||
nt|kareno: I think this will come back to west at a high level :)|pg||
nt|josj: very quick correction, Adi: wd :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: E-W have easy 4@S -- the question is how many clubs will North bid, and how many hearts will South bid|pg||
mb|1H|nt|xenya: hello Mike|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Somehow, 2@C looks like an insufficient bid to me|pg||
nt|mrace: not much after 3@H i suppose |pg||
mb|1S|nt|kit: I doubt if notrump looks right to East|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: here we have a very good Roland slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: No doubt 3@c has some other meaning|pg||
nt|xenya: N can bid 1 or 2NT, depending on the range of S's 1@H|pg||
mb|p|pc|d5|nt|xenya: but not 3 i'm sure|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good morning all from a cold and snowy London|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mdgraham: my, 3NT is going it a bit|pg||
nt|xenya: i bet it's colder in Moscow, Mike |pg||
nt|xenya: where i am|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kit: could be swing on lead here -- your singleton or partner's?|pg||
nt|frankaus: need to drop stiff !K ( a rabbi play ) here|pg||
nt|josj: in fact, 6@D is a much better contract than 3NT|pg||
nt|josj: needs the same @D layout but brings a better score|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I won't argue|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|nt|josj: proper contract would be 5@D|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d8|pg||

pc|d3|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|kit: At other table ace of hearts lead ended it quickly.  Here, won't be so quick at all -- I think proper defense still holds declarer to 10 tricks.|pg||

nt|Walddk4: And here I am thinking that one could escape the snow we have here by travelling to London. No such luck it seems|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It might change before Sunday, though|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Well, it's sunny now. It won't last long.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kit: now, the big decision|pg||
nt|kareno: Oh, no dummy entry for that second heart ... but a decision for south.|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|s7|nt|kit: key is that declarer drew trumps|pg||
nt|kit: and Zia worked it out|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North might have tried a 2@C cue-bid over the protective 1@H, but maybe that would have been natural|pg||

nt|dburn: well, what can he do?|pg||
nt|kit: I can't believe West didn't compete to 4@S|pg||
nt|dburn: true - whichever minor partner had, you'd have some cards for him|pg||
nt|me argent: it does say something about their 2 bids|pg||

nt|me argent: and why it was WRONG for east 2 open 2@Ss|pg||
nt|josj: I think X shows the blackies v. Strong Club|pg||
nt|xenya: on 13, the ladies in the other bid to the correct 5@C contract and NS took a save in 5@H -- -500 and 12 imps to Djarum ladies |pg||
pc|d2|nt|kit: extra spade -- but didn't matter here.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mdgraham: a hand which shows, once again, that nine-card suits are meant to be trumps|pg||

nt|xenya: but whatever it might be, obviously NS were not on the same wavelength|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kit: still looks clear to accept the "transfer" -- somebody bids 4@H, so you bid 4@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: director called after E's double, didn't hear the conversation.|pg||

mb|p|nt|kit: simply too weak for 1@S, and pass isn't part of my vocabulary with a 7-card spade suit.|pg||
nt|mrace: well...most people treat a side A as if it is a crime to open weak 2, most of the top players opens it almost always  as far as i see in BBO vugraphs|pg||
nt|kareno: Not a decent one like that.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Zia has a kibbitzer who operates the BridgeMate for him.|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: some might open with the S hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: precision style, I assume|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: but if you don't, it's a nice feeling when LHO opens in your longest suit |pg||

nt|Vugraphu2: I should have used the substitute bd 16 as my "hospitality" break.  TMI?|pg||
nt|kit: 4NT call very risky here -- only at these colors, and only at BAM or matchpoints might it be right|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, we all know the feeling|pg||

nt|xenya: however, had S opened, they might have reached a decent 2@S contract|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c9|nt|kit: big swing on auction -- in other room, 1NT opening, and 2@C stayman bid was doubled -- good double!|pg||
nt|josj: he does not know a @D is best and now declarer's job is easy|pg||
nt|josj: for +1|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|kit: Fate of 5@D doubled depends on how declarer handles the heart suit maybe|pg||

nt|Vugraphu2: there are a number of kibbitzers in the room.  Zia has 3 men following him, 2 women behind Hamman|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: And plenty following Meckwell|pg||
nt|kit: Nothing here -- with diamonds splitting, 12 tricks and a swing on the double of 2@C.  Many would be afraid to make it.  I think it is clear.|pg||

nt|mdgraham: this should be regarded as protective as there was no double of the 2@H transfer |pg||
pc|sA|nt|me argent: but from what i have seen over past 2 bds pollack likes to pass|pg||
nt|kareno: especially once he gets raised.|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Which world championship?|pg||
nt|kit: This will get them to the good 6@D contract|pg||
nt|ritong: pairs|pg||
nt|josj: 3@H worked well as it pushed the opps too high|pg||
nt|xenya: i think W must balance non-vulnerable|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mdgraham: totally agree|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kit: When your entire hand is in one suit, it is a good idea to bid that suit|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kit: West will like his hand a lot -- the question is whether or not he should bid more then just jumping to 6@D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: opposite the wrong hand, you could go for a penalty, but if you don't lose 500 once in a while you are not bidding enough - you will lose part-score swings   |pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h4|pc|h8|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|kit: play will go quickly here, with ace of spades still an entry.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kareno: His partner is moving to slam missing KQ of his suit.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|c3|nt|dburn: well, it depends on the extent to which 1@d shows diamonds, perhaps|pg||
nt|dburn: five-card majors, and all...|pg||
nt|dburn: still, I'd have opened the bidding|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Next up: Becker vs Diamond|pg||
nt|gowdy: well it does not deny @D|pg||
nt|kit: If East hadn't returned a spade, declarer might well have gone wrong -- taking diamond finesse instead of spade finesse, for example.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Roland will post standings when they're available|pg||
nt|gowdy: true  give e aq @S and ak of @C  then  @D q is on side with the bidding|pg||
nt|kit: of course if East didn't have queen of diamonds, he might just cash ace of spades fearing declarer could take 7 hearts and 5 diamonds|pg||
nt|xenya: even holding the @DQ, he might fear declarer can take 12 tricks|pg||
nt|gowdy: and then why did w lead a club  must have a @s card|pg||
nt|kit: from QJ10 of clubs, club lead would be pretty clear -- no inference there I don't think|pg||
nt|kit: Holding guarded queen of diamonds East doesn't need to cash -- how can declarer take 12 tricks?|pg||

mb|1S|nt|frankaus: 4@S may have a play|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Um.. scuse me :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, it's a long way to 6@C. They bid it well.|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|kit: reasonable hand for 4-card overcall|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|ritong: arhum|pg||
nt|kareno: mmmm.|pg||
nt|xenya: finding a 4-4 minor-suit fit on this type of hand is quite an achievement i think |pg||
mb|4N|nt|kareno: Another hand where both sides are playing same contract I hear.|pg||
nt|peachy: Yes, 3D looks about right|pg||
nt|peachy: sry all,|pg||
nt|kareno: More menagerie.  Wonder if Hamman thought 2@s was forcing.|pg||
nt|kit: apparently 2@S isn't forcing -- it would be with some|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|nt|xenya: when you have an 8-card fit in a major|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: its my bid|pg||
nt|kit: East would prefer to be able to bid 2NT takeout and let partner bid his minor|pg||
nt|ritong: curiouser and curiouser|pg||
mb|6S|nt|mdgraham: this might end in 6@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: n/s apparently landed in 3@c open room in the end.|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: which will probably fail|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: the 1@S overcall scared E-W out of notrump -- but the patient died, as 3NT doesn't make|pg||

nt|mdgraham: Hi Jos|pg||
nt|josj: hi Mike|pg||

nt|josj: (re)hi Adi and Vladimir|pg||
nt|josj: 6@H is the better scoring slam, even more so for NS|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this will go two off I reckon - East will probably try a heart to the queen, hoping for 3-2 hearts with the king in the South hand |pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk4: Why would he think that, Kit, after North supported over the double?|pg||
nt|me argent: will the auction tell declarer how to play trumps?|pg||

mb|p|nt|kit: Natural overcall in responder's suit -- often difficult to deal with|pg||

nt|kit: thoughtful 4@H splinter -- in case North has slam possibilities|pg||
nt|kit: missed 4-4 club fit, but this probably plays as well |pg||
nt|kareno: And in the OR, South is playing 4@s.  That will be down several I think, and vulnerable no less.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: N to E: We haven't discussed this auction.|pg||
nt|kit: However, the splinter will keep East away from heart lead|pg||

nt|kit: and he will probably lead a low trump|pg||
nt|josj: and he's right provided S wins and plays a @C|pg||

mb|1C|an|precision|mb|d|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|kit: Flnnery -- will get them to routine 4@S|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N by N in the OR... -- a club lead would have made declarer sweat|pg||
mb|2N|nt|kit: South expecting  a bit more for the 2@D call -- I think this will make|pg||
nt|kit: but as N-S are in 3@D doubled at other table, 470 might not be enough!|pg||

nt|kareno: Only three losers but ... are there ten winners?  With trump leads, perhaps not.|pg||
