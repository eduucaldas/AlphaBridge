mc|10|nt|jcmax: Most people would usually just lay down the ace|pg||
nt|jbgood: but is it best?|pg||
nt|jcmax: So if you are in desperate need for a swing this would be a classic situation where one could try to do something "different" from the other table|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Hi hans|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: declarer's only decision here is how to play trumps|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Easy board here, I think|pg||
nt|athene: running the @HJ would be very wrong but i don't think he will do that|pg||
nt|mamos:  not sure there are any alternatives|pg||
nt|chick: low to the @HJ, I would think|pg||
nt|athene: that would gain against @HKQx onside but lose to singleton honour offside|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|pc|cA|nt|chick: which is more likely? :)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|athene: i guess east is as likely to have a small singleton as a singleton honour, but this line also risks a spade ruff|pg||
nt|mamos:  ? I think Ace is the only option|pg||
nt|athene: yes, i would expect @HA, heart|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hK|nt|mamos:  we cannot succeed against KQx|pg||

pc|s9|nt|Walddk2: N-S in the other room play a weak NT, so 1@D led to a different contract|pg||
nt|jcmax: Let's say the 1NT opening had been weak and West would have doubled. should one bid with the East hand?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As you can't decide which suit to bid, you should probably pass|pg||
nt|xenya: my opinion too|pg||
nt|mowen: bid 2@C and alert it|pg||
nt|vugraphzzg: Certainly if the oppo are canny enough not to x 2C :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: 3 @s unforced was a tad too much|pg||
pc|c5|pc|sT|nt|jcmax: You sort of are afraid partner will lead a club, which probably won't be so good|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c6|pg||
nt|mowen: I would want to bid so perhaps 2@C should be staymanish by agreement|pg||

pc|c8|pc|cQ|pc|cT|pc|h5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Rosen somewhat endplayed now, but as long as he does not give dummy an entry with a club, declarer is down|pg||
pc|dT|nt|jcmax: In any event it is very important to have really good agreements on what any bid, especially double, means after partner has doubled 1NT for penalty. In any sequqnece. I have seen ...|pg||
nt|jcmax: many accidents happen, because a partnership wasn't on the same wavelength|pg||

pc|hQ|mc|6|nt|jcmax: Defending against a weak NT it is extermely difficult to limit yourself. may people land in hopeless games with 22 or 23 hcps. But sometimes those hopeless games also make :)|pg||

pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|pc|d7|pc|d8|pg||
nt|athene: it's an area without much consensus - some play that double then raise is just courtesy with four trumps|pg||
nt|athene: some play it shows significant extras|pg||
nt|mamos:  in thta case East bid too much|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: selway must have thought 2@S was a real hand, to bid 3@H on that|pg||

nt|jcmax: Are we sure 61D goes down?|pg||
nt|mowen: it looks like 6@D can make as there is no way to get the @H tricks|pg||
nt|jbgood: sure|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sorry, yes looks like it|pg||
nt|xenya: but how do you beat 6@D?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|jbgood: and matchball|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So a decisive board for someone one would assume. 6@D is unbelievably lucky|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Singleton heart and @CA in the same hand|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|jcmax: Let's have a little discourse on multi to end with. If one played a structure where the 2NT response always was gameforcing one could play this sequence of choice of games|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d9|pc|dJ|nt|mowen: 9 tricks and 13 imps - goodnight all|pg||
nt|jcmax: If, however 2NT is not GF, then this sequence says: knowing what you have now I want to play 3NT|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcmax: The West hand is quite tricky if partner's opening bid of 1@D is not limited. There could easily be a slam and partner will rarely bid over 4H knowing it sometime can be a stretch|pg||

nt|mamos:  no this just isnt going to make|pg||
nt|athene: but it does mean an extra undertrick - 300 instead of 50 isn't to be sneezed at :)|pg||

nt|athene: actually the double doesn't gain an extra trick, does it? even if south didn't cash his @SA, he could be endplayed with it|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: if he exited a trump, say, declarer can draw trumps, play three rounds of clubs throwing a spade from dummy, then exit a spade|pg||
mc|11|nt|athene: and south has to give a ruff and discard so north never gets the @DK|pg||
