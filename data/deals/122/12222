nt|Walddk2: South could have asked for more information with 2NT and would then get 3253 shape.. Instead he chose to bid a slammy 3@D|pg||
nt|henryb: South had a slammy hand|pg||
nt|henryb: might make 4@h E-W if N-S do not get their club tricks early|pg||
nt|capercliff: needs a @c lead to beat 4@h?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Geo Tislevoll|pg||
nt|geot: Hi all:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Mikolaj:) |pg||
mb|1D|nt|henryb: So East is likely to make 4@h, West not|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|d|nt|capercliff: yes, unlikely to lead a @s from S|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|rodal f: Hi for u to Henry:) AND at least the specs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: On a good day you make a slam in diamonds|pg||
nt|henryb: 6@d is somewha unlucky, although the values are skimpy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I have been in worse, and today is not a good day|pg||
mb|4C!|mb|p|nt|xenya: interesting hand, especially at matchpoints|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Remember that at matchpoints, 3NT is always a possibility because you can't bypass it to get to 5m instead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S also an option here of course|pg||
nt|henryb: needs the heart king (probably) and a diamond honor onside. But on a good day you just need a singleton @d honor|pg||
nt|rodal f: Belive most of the pairs will use Polich club, but belive Nikolaj will tell us:) Easyest if they don't play Polich club I belive:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good evening to Thomas Gotard|pg||
nt|tomi2: hi all|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Thomas|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Vladimir and Thomas:)|pg||
nt|tomi2: good evening from the rhine river btw :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S a splinter in support of what?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@C I mean|pg||
nt|henryb: Polish Club, I think, covers almost as many possibilities as "Standard American" in termas of systemic variations|pg||
nt|xenya: you don't want to be in 5@D, as Roland said, especially with this club holding in the N hand |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Tomi is our expert on Polish Club|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@D promised 5 dias normaly|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|xenya: N is not amused i think|pg||
nt|tomi2: and N's pass on x denied 3 card support, I guess they play support redoubles|pg||
nt|henryb: hopes 4N is to play|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|xenya: no way|pg||
nt|henryb: South thought it was RKC in @d|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Right-siding 4@H now|pg||
nt|tomi2: now they are overboard|pg||
nt|tomi2: N tries one more time to stop the train|pg||
nt|henryb: not if S passes|pg||
nt|rodal f: Many play Strefa (Zona) system wich is the system for Martens - Przybora the spec Vicek told me. THX:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Long tnak followed by 5NT, is that a sign-off :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: tank|pg||
mb|6D|nt|geot: Likely to be 10 imps to team Homme|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now it all depends on the lead|pg||
nt|capercliff: well it is a @d or a @s|pg||
nt|capercliff: 50/50|pg||
nt|henryb: Interesting NT ranges with 2@c-2@d-2N including 20. Not standard|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: On a spade lead North has to switch which is not 100 pct obvious|pg||
nt|tomi2: I agree to N's point of view that 4nt has to be a stoooop in MP|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: @s is maybe more attractive|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: long tank in this partnership means nothing, they are slow players|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: North tried to show wasted values in clubs, twice even, but Skr was not on the same wavelength|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk2: or win, Geo|pg||
pc|h3|nt|capercliff: oops|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|geot: yes|pg||
nt|tomi2: N could have bid 4@D and 4@H, both should be forwardgoing|pg||
nt|rodal f: So was at the short wave at the radio this time?:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I hope specs will excuse us for not typing player names|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|dT|pc|c2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think it's wrong to duck when looking at @HQx|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|nt|geot: omg|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unlikely to get a ruff later|pg||
nt|henryb: better to goose?|pg||
nt|geot: he played a spade and gave them another chance|pg||
nt|capercliff: good point Roland, if pard doesnt have a natural trump trick 4@h is unbeatable|pg||
nt|henryb: second chance rose|pg||
pc|c4|pc|d8|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|pc|h4|pc|h8|pg||
mc|11|nt|geot: that was obviously a misplay. He cant lose anything by trying the diamonds first|pg||
nt|henryb: South, in this country, would be known as "Skipjack" as Pepsi has also changed his name|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk4: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|d|mb|r|nt|xenya: the only upside is that you normally want to intervene with 2@C over 1@D opening|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cicus: why did E not take action over 2@C?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: This is not BAM as indidicated on the scoreboard, but it's the only way to link two tables when it's not an IMP Match|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: only one pitch no?|pg||
nt|henryb: pass 1@s?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|henryb: skveeze|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The software does not allow us to link two tables with Pairs|pg||
nt|tomi2: N/S have represented poland in various international championships in the last few years. Highlight was I think back in 2008 when they one the Vanderbilt (wasnt it?)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Do we need to tape there whole name Roland? Service is on here. The mouse at the player and u get the full name|pg||
mb|1N|nt|capercliff: ah yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Is that natural? What would 3@H be?|pg||
nt|capercliff: N is wondering how good his hand is|pg||
nt|Walddk2: After North's jump, 3@H is game-forcing, so 4@H should be a cue agreeing spades I think|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|capercliff: and weather 4@h is a splinter?|pg||
nt|xenya: however the result may not be a bottom for NS as many pairs will be facing the same problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: well, as we know, you and I think similarly, Roland. 3@h would be forcing, so 4@h should be something else.|pg||
nt|geot: Yes. After a invitational jump as response to a t/o double 3@H is forcing, no doubt about that|pg||
nt|henryb: Me, I would overcall 1@h in the first place.|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|Walddk2: http://www.pzbs.pl/wyniki/2009/krajowe/gpp/gppp2009final/final2009participants.html  for standings before the final weekend|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb: West is eager for a substantial minus score|pg||
nt|rodal f: Balanced at E but trouble on for EW now|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: e/w are no regular partnership. W is a young player and unusualy N/S's teammate playing with one of the guys in the other room. I guess they split their partnership in this tourney ...|pg||

pc|sT|pg||
pc|c7|pc|sA|pc|c8|pc|cT|pg||
nt|rodal f: 24 players qualigfied for the final and each could choose a player to play with. If one choosed an other by the 24 who qualified a new person (25) comein for the final|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 9 rounds of 2 boards tonight. Short break between rounds|pg||
nt|xenya: he could have made it at the end, which would have been a clear top, but even -50 might not be too bad for EW|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hope and belive Mikalaj will give us a link for running resaults in a while, or Roland:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Mikolaj|pg||
nt|tomi2: results http://www.pzbs.pl/gp10el.html|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@H NS looks a make -- any attempt by EW to bid higher may well run into a more solid defence than at this table|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I can give you a link to the climate fiasco in Copenhagen. They are leaving one after the other without having achieved anything|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|cicus: well, clubs did not want to get going, probably|pg||
nt|bridge_one: need lead @S to beat the slam (both, @H and NT)|pg||

nt|jaapfr: 2@C:11-15 with 5@C+ in prec?|pg||

mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 2Nt raise in @H, no Jacoby, SEF style|pg||
