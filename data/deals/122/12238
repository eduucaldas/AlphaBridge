nt|peachy: Hi everyone, |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Commentators are Raija Davis and Padmanaban Sridhar|pg||
nt|psridhar: going by the trend in 1st segment NS may well crack a grand on this|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Our operator is Ruzbeh Raja|pg||
nt|psridhar: i hv seen the bidding go 1s-4h( splinter)-4s( wasted h kqj of h pd ! )-all pass|pg||
nt|peachy: another slam in this board. not sure what is going on, |pg||
nt|peachy: but we will surely get going soon:)|pg||
nt|psridhar: EW are indian railways and NS are Mango's team|pg||
nt|peachy: can you tell me (and kibs maybe) what systems these pairs use|pg||
nt|psridhar: both pairs use natural methods |pg||
nt|psridhar: 5 card Maj, strong NT|pg||
nt|peachy: thank you|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: error with duplication of open room set|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: closed room will continue as normal|pg||
nt|psridhar: hi all -welcome to the final segment of the QF|pg||
nt|psridhar: the site for results http://indianbridgepages.appspot.com/ Winter_Nationals/2009/Results.el|pg||
nt|patricck: The Semi-Final is 36 boards in 3 segments of 12?|pg||
nt|psridhar: i am not very familiar about the NS pair- but CV RAO is a well known indian team having won several national titles|pg||
nt|Walddk6: A spectator suggests that this is the other semi-final|pg||
nt|Walddk6: CABAL vs Dhampur|pg||
nt|psridhar: something wrong -the EW pair plays for dhampur i am certain|pg||
nt|psridhar: hi all welcome to the 2nd segment of semifinals|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|drkvas: hi guys|pg||
mb|2D|nt|psridhar: N hand ideal for a short suit trial bid|pg||
nt|psridhar: kind of splinter game try|pg||
nt|drkvas: u think ok with 3 trumps ps?|pg||
nt|psridhar: N hand doc|pg||
nt|drkvas: ok r|pg||
nt|drkvas: but i think 2@s is misclick|pg||
nt|psridhar: yeah too strong for a simple raise|pg||
nt|patricck: welcome everyone|pg||
nt|patricck: Are NS playing inverted major raises?|pg||
nt|patricck: It appears the other table has been renamed, do we do the same here?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|psridhar: i have played against Ashok goel and kamal mukh all my life :)  they belong to dhampur|pg||
nt|Walddk6: This is more like it|pg||
mb|2S|nt|patricck: that makes more sense :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|drkvas: 1INDIAN RAILWAYS - A  15212ARUN JAIN,   132|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Operator, please shut down and reconnect to the other room|pg||
nt|Walddk6: The other operator realised the error and has opened a new broadcast|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|Walddk6: Best to do it now|pg||
nt|psridhar: i think this match is Dhampur Vs cabal|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: The challenge is to stay out of the poor grand slam - even though it happens to make|pg||
nt|Walddk6: but ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: in the other match cabal leads dhampur by 10 IMP's|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: yes it is dhampur vs cabal|pg||
nt|Walddk6: The team names are now reversed :(|pg||

pc|c2|nt|Walddk6: Welcome to Carl Mathiesen from Norway|pg||
pc|cA|nt|panja: Good Morning Roland, hi all|pg||

nt|sharkey: Good afternoon|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|drkvas: yes now the ball is rolling nicely|pg||
nt|psridhar: 4H is pushy with the 'wasted' dia queen ...but i guess the stiff H makes up for it|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: error corrected|pg||
nt|patricck: 4@H would have been a splinter, enabled North to assess correctly to drive to slam|pg||
nt|psridhar: i hear other room also in 6s|pg||
pc|dK|nt|drkvas: u have sharp ears ps|pg||

nt|psridhar: Roland -about 5 to 6 teams are sponsored regularly; and about 10 to 12 are regular professionals |pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: IR v. Mango|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: Arun Jain v. Dhampur|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: Cabal v. indian Blue|pg||
nt|psridhar: but very little sponsorship and participation in international tourneys sadly|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: CV Rao v. Sunil Machhar|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: coming up in a min.|pg||
nt|psridhar: I have seen Laria/versace diagnose such holdings marvelously but thru artifical bids that r diff to understand|pg||
nt|psridhar: and give up 140 for fear i will be minus 100|pg||
nt|psridhar: in 4s|pg||
nt|roswolf: more action likely here|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2C|an| |nt|psridhar: that south hand is 1d opening for me|pg||
nt|brolucius: South judges his hand not worth a reverse (after a 1@D opening) and so shows his strength with a strong 1NT.  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: N-S have all the high cards, but E-W can make many spades|pg||
mb|3N|nt|roswolf: i agree especially with that shape|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: precision 2@C opening|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@H Majors I assume - DONT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: the NS hands fit nicely, can they bid the good game? it looks like it|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes ..leading to a precarious 4-2 fit|pg||
nt|patricck: reopening double?|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: Sumit has done well to pass -many wd open 1s there|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How can East pass if 2@C shows the majors?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|patricck: seems like a routine @S game...yes 6@S can be made, but not a good contract and won't be bid anyway|pg||
nt|psridhar: 6s off trump ace and queen is dicey|pg||
nt|psridhar: other room heading towards slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: again i agree|pg||
nt|brolucius: If you are playing Lebensohl, 3NT denies a spade stopper in one version. (You would travel via 2NT with a stopper).|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe 2@C was Astro-like, promising hearts and another, and then I can understand East's pass|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then he will think partner has hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Just goes to show that Astro is hopeless|pg||
pc|c3|nt|patricck: really, the winning play in trumps is possible, exciting stuff if they bid and make it|pg||
nt|psridhar: that 2nt bid has missed the spd fit|pg||
nt|patricck: no......2NT not an enquiry then?|pg||
nt|panja: and 2N won't make|pg||
nt|psridhar: Sanajy has gone for quanti auction in pref to the spd fit|pg||
pc|sK|nt|panja: if it went 2@C-2@D-2@H...I guess 2N would have been forcing....|pg||
nt|panja: so the structure forced him to guess the best response?|pg||
nt|patricck: how could it be by a passed hand?|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|roswolf: with 5 spades he must have shown that suit as well - otherwise his defence to 1nt is wanting|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A defence to 1NT that does not have 2@C as *both* majors is not worth playing, full stop.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk6: How can anything be forcing by a passed hand?|pg||
nt|psridhar: i think he did well to pass..a reopg X might hv given W a chance to smoke out 2s|pg||
pc|dA|pc|h2|nt|psridhar: sound conservative auction may earn them 13 if other room fails in slam|pg||
nt|sharkey: Same contract where NS would have landed if W passed....|pg||
nt|psridhar: if W had passed NS might hv declared 2H vul|pg||
nt|patricck: not the best lead from North, I wouldn't have thought there was a need to be that active on the lead|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|brolucius: The club discard from dummy is puzzling. What use are the diamonds?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphzwu: yes|pg||
pc|h5|nt|panja: oh y, passed hand, true|pg||
nt|Walddk6: So if he wants to bid, 2@D must be it|pg||
nt|panja: or, then, 2@D might be passable here for them? passed hand?|pg||
nt|psridhar: u only need yr pd not to screw up|pg||
nt|psridhar: sorry prvt|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If the @H9 and @H10 were swapped - that was what North was hoping|pg||
pc|d9|nt|patricck: normally the right play with this holding is to run the 10@S, but it is quite a close call. If you can only lead once because you only have one entry then the correct play is small ...|pg||
nt|patricck: to the K@S|pg||
nt|psridhar: even 3s is conservative in my opinion ...he just needs QJXXX in spd and out for game to make|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|psridhar: the std auction in other room will locate the spd fit at 1 lev and dhampur shd gain a partial here|pg||
nt|brolucius: East not only bid 4@S (over 3NT) at the other table, but persisted to 5@S.|pg||

mb|2C|nt|sybarra: hello Ed  welcome |pg||
mb|3N|mb|4S|nt|othered1: In a strong club system I might have opened previous north hand, since I could show @C length and minimum in one bid.  But not a standard 1@C|pg||
nt|rv: Badal's 3@c slightly agricultural|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|5C|nt|rv: Badal might bid 4n again?|pg||

nt|sharkey: Another slam|pg||
nt|patricck: 6@C is quite a good spot|pg||
nt|brolucius: Without a spade return, declarer had time to set up enough heart tricks for the contract.|pg||
nt|psridhar: there is really no reason for not returning pd's suit|pg||

nt|panja: on @D lead A and ruff and @HA and @D?|pg||

nt|sharkey: I like 4@H with North's hand - jam the bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: same mistake I made....North is short of diamonds, not South|pg||
nt|Walddk6: I like to double with the South cards and play ELC. 2@D overcall could well have lost spades|pg||
nt|panja: y|pg||
nt|psridhar: E has to read this 4d as natural and support clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: Passing 1S on that N hand doesnt seem dafe to me|pg||

nt|psridhar: sry|pg||
nt|psridhar: safe |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk6: ELC = Equal Level Conversion|pg||
pc|cK|nt|psridhar: Mango had their share of slam luck in first session when they landed a grand dropping doubleton Q of trumps in an 8 card fit|pg||
nt|psridhar: i was abt to say that Roland-2D on that moth eaten suit opp a passed hand is not my fav-the take out X is more flex and brings spd into pic|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, I like double rather than 2@D as well, but close decision, would not criticise 2@D|pg||
nt|panja: better still, why not overcall 1@S?|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|Walddk6: http://www.bridgeguys.com/EGlossary/EqualLevelConversion.html|pg||
nt|panja: with a structure to handle 4-card overcalls..of course|pg||

nt|psridhar: h lead taps dummy|pg||
nt|panja: hi all|pg||
nt|panja: 6@C might have been better, I guess|pg||
nt|patricck: definitely|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|patricck: 1@S is ok when you find a spde fit, but it makes some auctions very awkward later|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|d9|nt|Walddk6: ELC solves all probs. If partner responds diamonds or spades, all is fine, and if you get (the more likely) 2@C, you convert to 2@D to show diamonds and spades|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|h7|pc|d7|pc|dA|pg||
nt|psridhar: perhaps a consolation 2 imp to mango here..but Railways are taking all big swings|pg||

nt|panja: not all, some, perhaps, many|pg||
nt|panja: for one, if W bids 2@h or 3@H, with Club length....what shd partner do?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|brolucius: Ten easy tricks, once the club lead saves any problem in that suit.|pg||

mb|1S|nt|patricck: Nice distributional 4@S contract, makes even with a spade misguess|pg||
nt|roswolf: west needs to restrain himself|pg||
mb|3D|nt|patricck: hard for EW to bid 6@C against this start|pg||
nt|psridhar: over 1h W found a fitshowing jump to 2s in other room-it was easy to reach 4s thereafter|pg||
nt|sharkey: not sure - if E passes W wud bid 5@D and E wud prefer to 6@C?|pg||
nt|psridhar: or 5d emphasising minor 2 suitor? 6-5|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: true ..a typical alok sadhu 1H has EW in totters..|pg||

mb|p|nt|psridhar: wait ..but his pd has taken him seriously giving EW another bite at the cherry|pg||
nt|brolucius: I was reading some 1955 US bridge magazines while on holiday. They would not have agreed with South's 'free bid' of 1@S on such limited values. Of course we know better nowadays.|pg||

nt|othered1: These hands don't come up very often and I expect players who play fit-showing jumps gain on frequency and more accurtate game or save decisions|pg||

nt|sharkey: On the previous borad E didnt bid and NS ended in 5@H Dbl|pg||
nt|patricck: but when partner opens 1NT in 3rd seat should you be worried about him taking liberties?|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: 4@S is a bit high.....it should end in partial in this room|pg||
mb|1S|nt|patricck: It wasn't a terrible contract tho, needed a club honour onside, and perhaps a 3-2 trump break|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: 14 imps then....some light at the end of the tunnel for Mango, but is there a train coming? :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes 4-4-41 hands dont play well -though they hv huge defense potential ...in general|pg||
nt|panja: there, the liberty was with distribution...|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|psridhar: no Pat they hv saved 6D-result depends on lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: Would S bid 4@H if N Dbl 4@D?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|bjacobs: West would like to give 2@D the treatment, but maybe double is not for penalties|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: indeed there was a liberty being taken, but should the possibility affect North's decision when it was a 1NT opener?|pg||
nt|panja: not perhaps, but if E held singleton, 4@D might make..|pg||
nt|roswolf: well the fit is found|pg||
nt|roswolf: surely north will desist from bidding on|pg||
nt|brolucius: Standard bidding is unsatisfactory here. South can force with 3@H when he is really strong but then North does not know whether his partner has 4 or 5 hearts. Some players use 2@C ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: as artificial facing the 1NT response.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk6: 2@D is probably a sound heart raise, although I don't think he has one. 2@H is enough|pg||
nt|Walddk6: 9 count  4333|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: but double digit swing yes|pg||
nt|patricck: agreed|pg||
nt|psridhar: over the X they play 2h as bad raise and 2d as normal raise...but i agree it can be construed as bad raise|pg||
nt|panja: five honour cards in 9 HCP....not all useful for a @H contract...but here, because @CA is with South, most cards will pull their full weight|pg||
nt|panja: @S singleton, that is|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bjacobs: East certainly thinks it's not for penalties.  And I agree|pg||
nt|psridhar: 11 imp|pg||
nt|psridhar: so make that 30 imp to get in 5 bds|pg||
nt|psridhar: plus KQ doubleton falling|pg||

nt|sharkey: No liberties taken at this board - yet...|pg||
nt|panja: 3Nt on finesse|pg||
pc|c5|nt|panja: y|pg||
nt|patricck: If east had a singleton spade then South would have AKxx, which would be difficult to ruff out completely|pg||
nt|panja: AKxx or AQxx..|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|Walddk6: I can understand Sanjay's 4@S. He is hoping for a double fit|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk6: But as they play Precision, he can get something like this|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, Kxxx of the opponents suit is a disappointment|pg||
nt|psridhar: but i guess their 1D does not promise dia Roland|pg||
nt|panja: the 1@D is amorphous, must not count it as showing @D length|pg||
nt|Walddk6: read above|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bjacobs: Amazing what chaos resulted from that little 2@D bid|pg||
nt|psridhar: this flat 3nt wont do the Magoes any good in their 30 imp pursuit|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dK|pg||
nt|Walddk6: "hoping" not "counting"|pg||
nt|panja: instead of the 4@S jump, a 3@H bid would have been better....|pg||
nt|panja: y, Roland, noticed the hope word now...|pg||
nt|panja: N could well have @CK instead of @HK, or, perhaps, some other minor honours...that would be good for 4@S|pg||
nt|panja: but there often is more of totalitarian bridge, rather than egalitarian...as I like to put it|pg||
pc|sT|nt|patricck: very true, still about 30 imps, but only 4 boards|pg||

pc|s2|nt|panja: any reason to pull the first tump from a particular side here?|pg||

nt|sharkey: to opps...|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|pg||
nt|brolucius: West might have rebid 3@D instead on the basis that diamonds would still play well if partner had club support.|pg||

pc|s4|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|panja: I would need a bulletproof jacket before I even think of 2@S|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|psridhar: Carl- all the bds this segment - the bidding has one underlying assumption " they wont X for cash" - the point that Pat was making|pg||
nt|brolucius: Can it be forcing when East passed originally?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|sharkey: Certainly got EW off to the best lead|pg||
nt|psridhar: if east has spds yes|pg||
nt|brolucius: It was a poor bid because West would have doubled if he had three hearts in addition to both minors.|pg||

nt|panja: B21, 4@S or 3Nt for EW on @H finesse and @S break|pg||

nt|vugraphzwu: break in play|pg||

nt|psridhar: but bd no 32 wont help|pg||
nt|brolucius: The did reach 4@H on the hand where South was strong and North held 5 points with @HQ-J-x-x-x. Their bidding was 1@S - 2@S - 3@H - 4@H.|pg||
nt|brolucius: An excellent auction. Well bid,|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: 3@H seems beatable|pg||
nt|psridhar: thx Roland; we tried to extend the principle ( lower vs lower) vs any 2 suitor o/c; ran into complications -for eg u open 1nt lho overcalls 2c -landy now?|pg||
nt|psridhar: if u must open 2nt on a 19 counter make sure u hv a decent 5 card suit !|pg||
nt|psridhar: but the bidding may well die at 1s Panja|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|patricck: good slam in either @S or @D here|pg||
nt|patricck: I wouldn't think EW would venture to game here, despite the excellent @S suit|pg||
nt|sharkey: @C lead will set 4@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|psridhar: 15 imps and 4 bds exciting match|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: it certainly works well over unusual 2nt showing minors |pg||
nt|roswolf: 15 imps in 4 bds is not insurmountable|pg||
mb|2C|nt|bjacobs: You could play 2@H as showing the minors, with clubs equal or greater than diamonds; 2@S shows longer diamonds (after the Landy bid)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H heart stop, no spade stop. 2@S spade stop, no heart stop. NT stops in both majors. That's one way of playing it|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: i hear that slam on bd 27 made because when a dia was played off the tbl S played 2 cards -the ACE and 9 of dia- the 9 was visible so diro ruled it in|pg||
nt|psridhar: i thk NS hv enough grounds to contest that decision on appeal|pg||
nt|psridhar: anybody's match from here|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i favour railways because of their lead|pg||
mb|3C|nt|patricck: they won't need to|pg||
nt|psridhar: 1. Dia ace was the setting trcik|pg||
nt|panja: @D better..with the 54 fit....easier to remove trumps and take your discards...|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: coming to Bd 19 and N's controvertial 1D response...other room got to 3nt EW-let us see if it is a success|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w on the way|pg||
nt|psridhar: w is worth a 3d here|pg||
nt|brolucius: West should not go too high now. His partner is a passed hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: This is the same position as the CR.  They took their spade ruff, but failed to cash the diamond tricks|pg||
nt|panja: but 2 IMP difference for a @S contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: at the score a strange decision by west|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes |pg||
nt|brolucius: A minor-suit game, on a 4-4 fit, needs good values. I think West's pass was correct.|pg||
nt|psridhar: it just may be the winning decn|pg||
nt|brolucius: East might have had more of his values in spades, where they would not have been productive.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|psridhar: 4s fast arrival showing poor hand but cant stop N from slam|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dQ|pc|d4|pg||
nt|bjacobs: They didn't get to first base in this room!|pg||
nt|psridhar: doesnt 4s make?|pg||
nt|psridhar: how do u defeat 4s?|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c6|nt|sharkey: Think W shud Dbl 2nd time and correct 2@H to 2@S |pg||
pc|c3|nt|panja: Aces ask that does not tell much here|pg||
nt|panja: once N opens, the ! for finesse goes down...but is W right to bid so conservatively? is there an option? say a dbl of 1@D?|pg||
nt|brolucius: A trump back is best now, because West has a bundle of cards to ruff in the East hand. Yes, he has found the trump return.|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|psridhar: defense has essentially done the same mistake here too|pg||
nt|psridhar: the diro should keep in mind that the expert defender is on play with setting trick vs a slam -bd 27|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pc|h2|nt|bjacobs: I'm fairly sympathetic to this particular mistake|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Aloke probably felt that he didn't need to give partner a spade ruff|pg||
nt|psridhar: perhaps Dia king lead and THEN spd shift wd hv achieved|pg||
nt|psridhar: why Panja? he used ace ask as route to discover his pd's trump Q|pg||
nt|panja: well...the ace answer did not tell much..|pg||
nt|panja: I am trying to make out the meaning of further bids..|pg||
nt|panja: 5@D, what was it?|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, the diamond lead makes it all so much simpler|pg||

mb|2D|mb|3C|nt|panja: so..don't correct from a minor suit|pg||
nt|patricck: but then if partner overcalls 4 carders that regularly that I am altering my bidding then maybe the 1@S is alertable so that the opponents are given full information as well|pg||
