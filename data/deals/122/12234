nt|peachy: Hi everyone, |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Commentators are Raija Davis and Padmanaban Sridhar|pg||
nt|psridhar: going by the trend in 1st segment NS may well crack a grand on this|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Our operator is Ruzbeh Raja|pg||
nt|psridhar: i hv seen the bidding go 1s-4h( splinter)-4s( wasted h kqj of h pd ! )-all pass|pg||
nt|peachy: another slam in this board. not sure what is going on, |pg||
nt|peachy: but we will surely get going soon:)|pg||
nt|psridhar: EW are indian railways and NS are Mango's team|pg||
nt|peachy: can you tell me (and kibs maybe) what systems these pairs use|pg||
nt|psridhar: both pairs use natural methods |pg||
nt|psridhar: 5 card Maj, strong NT|pg||

nt|vugraphzwu: closed room will continue as normal|pg||
nt|psridhar: hi all -welcome to the final segment of the QF|pg||
nt|psridhar: the site for results http://indianbridgepages.appspot.com/ Winter_Nationals/2009/Results.el|pg||
nt|patricck: The Semi-Final is 36 boards in 3 segments of 12?|pg||
nt|psridhar: i am not very familiar about the NS pair- but CV RAO is a well known indian team having won several national titles|pg||
nt|Walddk6: A spectator suggests that this is the other semi-final|pg||
nt|Walddk6: CABAL vs Dhampur|pg||
nt|psridhar: something wrong -the EW pair plays for dhampur i am certain|pg||
nt|psridhar: hi all welcome to the 2nd segment of semifinals|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1D|nt|drkvas: hi guys|pg||
mb|1H|nt|psridhar: N hand ideal for a short suit trial bid|pg||

nt|drkvas: u think ok with 3 trumps ps?|pg||
nt|psridhar: N hand doc|pg||
nt|drkvas: ok r|pg||
nt|drkvas: but i think 2@s is misclick|pg||
nt|psridhar: yeah too strong for a simple raise|pg||
nt|patricck: welcome everyone|pg||
nt|patricck: Are NS playing inverted major raises?|pg||
nt|patricck: It appears the other table has been renamed, do we do the same here?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|psridhar: i have played against Ashok goel and kamal mukh all my life :)  they belong to dhampur|pg||
nt|Walddk6: This is more like it|pg||
mb|2H|nt|patricck: that makes more sense :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|drkvas: 1INDIAN RAILWAYS - A  15212ARUN JAIN,   132|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Operator, please shut down and reconnect to the other room|pg||
nt|Walddk6: The other operator realised the error and has opened a new broadcast|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|Walddk6: Best to do it now|pg||
nt|psridhar: i think this match is Dhampur Vs cabal|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: The challenge is to stay out of the poor grand slam - even though it happens to make|pg||
nt|Walddk6: but ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: yes it is dhampur vs cabal|pg||
nt|Walddk6: The team names are now reversed :(|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|drkvas: yes now the ball is rolling nicely|pg||
nt|psridhar: 4H is pushy with the 'wasted' dia queen ...but i guess the stiff H makes up for it|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: error corrected|pg||
nt|patricck: 4@H would have been a splinter, enabled North to assess correctly to drive to slam|pg||
nt|psridhar: i hear other room also in 6s|pg||
pc|h8|nt|drkvas: u have sharp ears ps|pg||

nt|sharkey: 6@C hinges on finding the @DQ|pg||
nt|psridhar: this will result in 3nt -but say South has AXX,XX,AJXX,AQXX -how will the bidding go? will he raise 3d to 4d?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|psridhar: he has 2 more jacks to guess|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree - and probably almost unbiddable|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, but needs a reasonable trump break before you get to that point|pg||

mb|p|nt|patricck: the NS hands fit nicely, can they bid the good game? it looks like it|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes ..leading to a precarious 4-2 fit|pg||
nt|patricck: reopening double?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|psridhar: Sumit has done well to pass -many wd open 1s there|pg||
pc|c6|nt|patricck: seems like a routine @S game...yes 6@S can be made, but not a good contract and won't be bid anyway|pg||
nt|psridhar: 6s off trump ace and queen is dicey|pg||
nt|psridhar: other room heading towards slam|pg||
pc|c5|nt|patricck: really, the winning play in trumps is possible, exciting stuff if they bid and make it|pg||
nt|psridhar: that 2nt bid has missed the spd fit|pg||
nt|patricck: no......2NT not an enquiry then?|pg||
nt|panja: and 2N won't make|pg||
nt|psridhar: Sanajy has gone for quanti auction in pref to the spd fit|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|panja: if it went 2@C-2@D-2@H...I guess 2N would have been forcing....|pg||
nt|panja: so the structure forced him to guess the best response?|pg||
nt|patricck: how could it be by a passed hand?|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|nt|Walddk6: How can anything be forcing by a passed hand?|pg||
nt|psridhar: i think he did well to pass..a reopg X might hv given W a chance to smoke out 2s|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|psridhar: sound conservative auction may earn them 13 if other room fails in slam|pg||
nt|sharkey: Same contract where NS would have landed if W passed....|pg||
nt|psridhar: if W had passed NS might hv declared 2H vul|pg||
nt|patricck: not the best lead from North, I wouldn't have thought there was a need to be that active on the lead|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|nt|vugraphzwu: yes|pg||
pc|c4|nt|panja: oh y, passed hand, true|pg||
nt|Walddk6: So if he wants to bid, 2@D must be it|pg||
nt|panja: or, then, 2@D might be passable here for them? passed hand?|pg||
nt|psridhar: u only need yr pd not to screw up|pg||
nt|psridhar: sorry prvt|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bjacobs: If the @H9 and @H10 were swapped - that was what North was hoping|pg||
pc|s4|nt|patricck: normally the right play with this holding is to run the 10@S, but it is quite a close call. If you can only lead once because you only have one entry then the correct play is small ...|pg||
nt|patricck: to the K@S|pg||
nt|psridhar: even 3s is conservative in my opinion ...he just needs QJXXX in spd and out for game to make|pg||
pc|sT|nt|psridhar: the std auction in other room will locate the spd fit at 1 lev and dhampur shd gain a partial here|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|s7|nt|panja: they played in 2@S|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Nice and simple|pg||

nt|sharkey: I like 4@H with North's hand - jam the bidding|pg||
mb|4S|nt|patricck: same mistake I made....North is short of diamonds, not South|pg||
nt|Walddk6: I like to double with the South cards and play ELC. 2@D overcall could well have lost spades|pg||

mb|p|mb|6S|nt|sharkey: 6@S make too?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk6: ELC = Equal Level Conversion|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: Mango had their share of slam luck in first session when they landed a grand dropping doubleton Q of trumps in an 8 card fit|pg||
nt|psridhar: i was abt to say that Roland-2D on that moth eaten suit opp a passed hand is not my fav-the take out X is more flex and brings spd into pic|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, I like double rather than 2@D as well, but close decision, would not criticise 2@D|pg||
nt|panja: better still, why not overcall 1@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk6: http://www.bridgeguys.com/EGlossary/EqualLevelConversion.html|pg||
nt|panja: with a structure to handle 4-card overcalls..of course|pg||

nt|psridhar: h lead taps dummy|pg||
nt|panja: hi all|pg||
nt|panja: 6@C might have been better, I guess|pg||
nt|patricck: definitely|pg||
pc|h6|nt|patricck: 1@S is ok when you find a spde fit, but it makes some auctions very awkward later|pg||

nt|vugraphzwu: score updated|pg||
nt|sharkey: On the previous borad E didnt bid and NS ended in 5@H Dbl|pg||
nt|patricck: but when partner opens 1NT in 3rd seat should you be worried about him taking liberties?|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: 4@S is a bit high.....it should end in partial in this room|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: It wasn't a terrible contract tho, needed a club honour onside, and perhaps a 3-2 trump break|pg||
mb|1C|nt|patricck: 14 imps then....some light at the end of the tunnel for Mango, but is there a train coming? :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes 4-4-41 hands dont play well -though they hv huge defense potential ...in general|pg||
nt|panja: there, the liberty was with distribution...|pg||
mb|d|mb|1H|nt|psridhar: no Pat they hv saved 6D-result depends on lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: Would S bid 4@H if N Dbl 4@D?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: West would like to give 2@D the treatment, but maybe double is not for penalties|pg||
mb|2C|nt|patricck: indeed there was a liberty being taken, but should the possibility affect North's decision when it was a 1NT opener?|pg||
nt|panja: not perhaps, but if E held singleton, 4@D might make..|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk6: 2@D is probably a sound heart raise, although I don't think he has one. 2@H is enough|pg||
nt|Walddk6: 9 count  4333|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: but double digit swing yes|pg||
nt|patricck: agreed|pg||
nt|psridhar: over the X they play 2h as bad raise and 2d as normal raise...but i agree it can be construed as bad raise|pg||
nt|panja: five honour cards in 9 HCP....not all useful for a @H contract...but here, because @CA is with South, most cards will pull their full weight|pg||
nt|panja: @S singleton, that is|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: East certainly thinks it's not for penalties.  And I agree|pg||
nt|psridhar: 11 imp|pg||
nt|psridhar: so make that 30 imp to get in 5 bds|pg||
nt|psridhar: plus KQ doubleton falling|pg||

nt|patricck: If east had a singleton spade then South would have AKxx, which would be difficult to ruff out completely|pg||
nt|panja: AKxx or AQxx..|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|Walddk6: I can understand Sanjay's 4@S. He is hoping for a double fit|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|Walddk6: But as they play Precision, he can get something like this|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, Kxxx of the opponents suit is a disappointment|pg||
nt|psridhar: but i guess their 1D does not promise dia Roland|pg||
nt|panja: the 1@D is amorphous, must not count it as showing @D length|pg||
nt|Walddk6: read above|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bjacobs: Amazing what chaos resulted from that little 2@D bid|pg||
nt|psridhar: this flat 3nt wont do the Magoes any good in their 30 imp pursuit|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|nt|Walddk6: "hoping" not "counting"|pg||
nt|panja: instead of the 4@S jump, a 3@H bid would have been better....|pg||
nt|panja: y, Roland, noticed the hope word now...|pg||
nt|panja: N could well have @CK instead of @HK, or, perhaps, some other minor honours...that would be good for 4@S|pg||
nt|panja: but there often is more of totalitarian bridge, rather than egalitarian...as I like to put it|pg||

mb|p|nt|psridhar: coming to Bd 19 and N's controvertial 1D response...other room got to 3nt EW-let us see if it is a success|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bjacobs: This is the same position as the CR.  They took their spade ruff, but failed to cash the diamond tricks|pg||
nt|panja: but 2 IMP difference for a @S contract|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|nt|psridhar: 4s fast arrival showing poor hand but cant stop N from slam|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s7|nt|bjacobs: They didn't get to first base in this room!|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|sharkey: Think W shud Dbl 2nd time and correct 2@H to 2@S |pg||
pc|sK|nt|panja: Aces ask that does not tell much here|pg||
nt|panja: once N opens, the ! for finesse goes down...but is W right to bid so conservatively? is there an option? say a dbl of 1@D?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|psridhar: defense has essentially done the same mistake here too|pg||
nt|psridhar: the diro should keep in mind that the expert defender is on play with setting trick vs a slam -bd 27|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bjacobs: I'm fairly sympathetic to this particular mistake|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Aloke probably felt that he didn't need to give partner a spade ruff|pg||
nt|psridhar: perhaps Dia king lead and THEN spd shift wd hv achieved|pg||
nt|psridhar: why Panja? he used ace ask as route to discover his pd's trump Q|pg||
nt|panja: well...the ace answer did not tell much..|pg||
nt|panja: I am trying to make out the meaning of further bids..|pg||
nt|panja: 5@D, what was it?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bjacobs: Yes, the diamond lead makes it all so much simpler|pg||
nt|psridhar: not very tough as pd has shown dia as one of his suits |pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes 5d asked abt trump q|pg||
pc|c9|nt|panja: and 5@S shows trump Q?|pg||
nt|psridhar: 2nd step yes|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c8|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|panja: that would be @SQ, what about @DQ then?|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c4|pc|d9|pg||
nt|sharkey: Dbl of 1@D wud be better too|pg||
mc|9|nt|psridhar: he bid 2D .....N has AK of dia|pg||
nt|panja: I presume 1@S on 1@H would have been 0-4 HCP....|pg||

nt|bjacobs: This is one of those horrible hands where West thinks he has 9 tricks for 3NT, but ...|pg||
nt|psridhar: Bill thats a cruel thought :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: 2d=nat with 5-7 i guess|pg||
nt|psridhar: i wd suggest u play 2S as strong/intermediate Jump overcall-both oppo hv bid and no purpose in WJO|pg||
mb|1C|nt|psridhar: looks like we hv lost link with other room|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|bjacobs: I bet it happens|pg||
nt|psridhar: i will be keen to know how they bid bd no 9|pg||
nt|panja: good idea, but still, some weak hands where you cannot afford a 2-level bid..|pg||
nt|sharkey: I like 2@S as weak NV - trying to jam their bidding.  |pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|psridhar: Laltu may but in 3d and ..regret|pg||
nt|panja: B10...@H guess would be the interesting point....for an OT only though|pg||
nt|panja: will have to be handled with 1@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: It's up to East now ... he has a diamond stopper, but he's the one looking at the club void|pg||
nt|panja: nine easy tricks here on favourable @SKQ position|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bjacobs: It's still very tough to expect him to pass this|pg||
nt|psridhar: i hear Dhampur didnt bid the slam on bd 9-- means we have a new leader in the match|pg||
pc|s2|nt|psridhar: well done|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think that's a fantastic pass|pg||
nt|panja: but can make 10th in @H, play AK and back|pg||
pc|s8|nt|panja: they stop in 3@H......primarily because the secondary @D fit was not unearthed|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Now it's up to Aloke to make it|pg||
nt|patricck: There needs to be a big swing to Mango on this board to make an appeal relevant.... I just can't see that happening|pg||
nt|patricck: I guess we were just assuming they would bid game|pg||

pc|d5|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|psridhar: once again picturising how the Std auction wd go on this bd in other room....will it go 1nt -all pass?|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s4|nt|psridhar: defending 2D X with a club void is a nightmare|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|psridhar: yes i agree -Railways have sewed this one up|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: very fast play...missed tricks.....will update score|pg||
nt|panja: 2/1 or sayc?|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|psridhar: thx all gl to railways in semifinal-c u all at 1500 hrs IST|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: scores updated|pg||
nt|patricck: and you would expect to make 9 tricks with a combined 29 count, the surprise may be that there are only 9|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|panja: you get 2@D rebid in 2/1, and that might propel N to a stronger invite..|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|d3|nt|panja: but of course, it could also be just 1@H 2@H|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|psridhar: Bill -pl note the auction was identical in other room-- kudos to indian bridge judgement? ;)|pg||
nt|patricck: can make a 10th in @H yes, but will probably play on @D|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bjacobs: Indeed|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Pity about the two grand slams in this set, but this board produced excellent bridge|pg||

nt|psridhar: and...2s by pd? :)|pg||
nt|patricck: not sure that I think 1NT is automatic on the west hand...perhaps if partner is a regular 4 card overcaller it might have to be|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|panja: no....provide for a 4-card overcall|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|panja: so..don't correct from a minor suit|pg||
nt|patricck: but then if partner overcalls 4 carders that regularly that I am altering my bidding then maybe the 1@S is alertable so that the opponents are given full information as well|pg||
mb|2S|nt|patricck: Welcome back for the last board of this set, there is one more segment of 12 boards after this|pg||
