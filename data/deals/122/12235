nt|mdgraham: Hi  Mike|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: bidding should work out better than dobeling|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Vladimir Ivanov|pg||
nt|me argent: or even doubling|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Jan van Cleeff from the Netherlands and Jon Sveindal from Norway|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@CX in the other room|pg||

nt|Walddk4: and hi to Joe Silver|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|josj: hi Mike (2)|pg||
nt|sybarra: beaten on a club ruff |pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: the flaw is that @HK s wrong so it will be -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: piece of cake|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant see any defence|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: yes|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sybarra: and S not giving the hand away |pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|nt|josj: This is the first round of the final round robin|pg||
nt|josj: the top 7 from the Swiss qualified and the host team Geo Timah B gets a wild card for the final|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|reisig: -100 in same spot in other room|pg||
nt|gowdy: if the K denies the A  he may find it|pg||
nt|ritong: his alternate play is cross to dummy and @c J, in case east has Qxx|pg||
nt|ritong: and west A10x, then|pg||
nt|ritong: this is not clearcut, by far|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no real alternative to the club finesse - playing for singleton K offside is anti-percentage|pg||
nt|josj: the format is 7 rounds of 16 boards, ending tomorrow at about 18.30 local time, 11.30 GMT|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ritong: aie..|pg||
pc|cK|nt|josj: 3 rounds today (this is the first) and 4 tomorrow|pg||

nt|josj: now it's plain sailing|pg||
pc|dK|nt|me argent: the 3@C bid should help declarer guess @Ss|pg||
nt|ritong: ah no:)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ritong: well done braddy boy|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
pc|sA|nt|me argent: if he has the nerve that is|pg||
pc|s4|pc|cT|nt|lestergold: hm ht switch at trick 3 followed by spade then defence make ht 2 dims spade and club but who would find that|pg||
nt|lestergold: south meeded to win second dim and take club finesse|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h7|pc|d4|pc|d9|pg||
nt|josj: so not a good start for Bhineka again, after their heavy defeat in previous match|pg||

mb|p|nt|reisig: Hi Kit :)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ritong: wow|pg||
nt|ritong: jan is not determined to let this board go|pg||
nt|reisig: Not 3@H by Jansma ?   :) :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|josj: all four players at this table have been in and out of the national team of Indonesia over the years|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: 8@Ss played by EW final contract OR|pg||
nt|kit: normal 4@H contract, but it may matter where declarer first plays the hearts from if a spade lead, as there is danger of the 10 of hearts scoring on  promotion|pg||
nt|ritong: was a decision:)|pg||
nt|josj: this definitely looks like a slam|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|xenya: 4@H 1 down, so is 3@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: slam as cards lie with hts btreaking 3/3 but not a good slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: 3@H looks very conservative -- was devaluing his spade and diamond holdings -- but that can be overdone|pg||
nt|josj: NS play 2/1 GF|pg||
mb|4H|nt|kareno: Hello from not-so-sunny Las Vegas :)|pg||
nt|ritong: hi|pg||
nt|kit: The 3@D call got the diamond lead, and now declarer can't have any problems as the cards lie|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzbq: yes|pg||

pc|cT|nt|sybarra: N had no idea of the minor suit aces |pg||

pc|c2|nt|xenya: sorry 3@S 2 off|pg||
nt|lestergold: North has a move on south's bidding|pg||
pc|cK|nt|me argent: think south a little timid here|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Kit Woolsey|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Kit|pg||
nt|ritong: so, he could get this wrong, but not easily:)|pg||
nt|gowdy: no the key was not losing to k 10|pg||
nt|lestergold: but it was on and it may well be bid in the open room|pg||
nt|josj: easy to get a little too high and worthwhile too|pg||
mb|1H|nt|kit: so East should have won first round of hearts with, ace, not king, then.|pg||
nt|josj: this is a good Roland slam|pg||
nt|josj: trumps 2-2, @H 3-3...|pg||
mb|1S|nt|me argent: a question of which pair gets into trouble here|pg||
nt|kareno: mmm club slam I see|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, absolutely so|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|lestergold: looks like a reasonable 3N contract here for E/W|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: 6NT clearly optimal here, not 6@C|pg||
nt|kareno: 6nt definitely safer.|pg||
nt|lestergold: quite easy to make no defence|pg||
nt|josj: rather a coffee hand|pg||
nt|josj: that's about what you need for 12 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: heavy raise by E but quite right this time, with all his soft values|pg||
pc|d4|nt|me argent: i like cleeffs 3@D bid|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 1@H and 1@S do make|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but 2@H bid likely|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|nt|lestergold: indeed|pg||
nt|xenya: slightly better than Roland's as it also makes if @H 4-2 with the J doubleton|pg||
nt|josj: comes down to about 20%...|pg||
nt|josj: sure, I took that into account :)|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ritong: and, in a sort of bonus, system right handed no trumps, so they will get there i guess|pg||
nt|josj: Roland's requirements are 12.89%|pg||
nt|sybarra: and a 4333 hand |pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|pc|d5|nt|kit: hard to fault the 3NT call, but it works out very badly|pg||
nt|josj: or less...|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ritong: ecco|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kareno: Good auction and it is, as Henri points out, right-sided.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ritong: ugly board for greco hampson, although robson did not leave them alone|pg||
nt|kit: pretty hard to imagine wrong-siding it|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|nt|me argent: this will be very tough to make a defensive revoke would help|pg||
nt|xenya: put EW on the spot -- a point for AC|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|kit: in other room North bid only 2@D, and that gave E-W a chance to escape|pg||
nt|me argent: so cleefs approach helped win the board 4 NS|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ritong: right sided means " i am declarer" for jansma:)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jaapfr: 2@S-1 discarding @C|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kareno: lol|pg||
nt|kit: I think opposite a strong 1@C opening the East hand should just drive it to slam|pg||
nt|ritong: who, by the way, is a super nice guy and does not deserve dubious jokes like that one  sorry, jan|pg||
nt|kareno: I agree, Kit - I think Greco dogged it.|pg||
nt|kareno: Do we have any update on positions?  |pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Next up is Becker vs Polowan|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Standings are posted 1 round behind, so nothing since the 1st session|pg||
nt|kareno: I believe standings after the half would be posted at www.acbl.org, no?|pg||
nt|kareno: Also specs asking for any updates on the NA Swiss.|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Vugraphu2: Jan says hello to all his friends out there :)|pg||

nt|Vugraphu2: Meant Jan Van Cleef. Jan Martel is operating VG in the OR|pg||
nt|me argent: give jon @H@H from me|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: We aren't displaying team names because the match-ups change every 3 boards|pg||

nt|kit: North shouldn't do anything I don't think -- only 3 spades, which definitely promised by the double, and nothing extra|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: east in the tank|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm thinking that could end the auction.... but ... east has other ideas.|pg||
nt|kareno: At some point n/s could start applying their hob-nailed boots here :)|pg||
nt|kit: East doesn't know his partner is 5-5 -- 2@D looks pretty reasonable to me|pg||
nt|kareno: e/w headed for a minus for sure.|pg||
nt|josj: nice misfit so far :)|pg||
nt|josj: will they end up in @D?|pg||

nt|lestergold: he opted for playing in an undoubled contract- |pg||

nt|josj: should make a disciplined pass|pg||
nt|josj: yes but she cannot come to hand for the @D finesse so easily :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes too bad |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|me argent: opening 1 @S might have worked out better|pg||
nt|josj: if declarer goes after the @D when he believes the @CQ, he makes unless the def. switch to hearts|pg||
nt|xenya: think it makes -- 2 clubs, 4 diamonds a heart and 2 spades|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kareno: Feldman to the rescue|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s6|nt|me argent: not a big fan of opening 1NT at any excuse|pg||
nt|kit: The good news for declarer is that he starts out knowing the exact enemy distribution (or at least should)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sybarra: double dummy you can get to hand 2x  now ok also |pg||
pc|sQ|pg||

nt|josj: @SJ|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|kit: if your partnership is going to open 1NTwith a hand such as South hand, it helps to have methods which can locate a 5-card major|pg||

nt|ritong: guess demirev will not consider playing in NT|pg||
nt|josj: I think you find find the advice "playing from the top" in his book |pg||
nt|xenya: ah|pg||
nt|josj: the big volume on suit combinations|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: but he might consider playing higher than four|pg||
mb|1C|nt|jaapfr: max 4m C by EW here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kit: bidding test here -- 7@C clearly best at IMPs, but at BAM not so clear|pg||
nt|kareno: Surely not a forcing raise - mini splinter perhaps?|pg||
nt|kit: Jason or Mark -- Jason I think|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: 7NT quite reasonable, but on lie of cards (spade hook off, squeeze not working) it goes down|pg||
nt|me argent: this hand should test EWs bidding methods|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@D and 4@C do make|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|kit: they might play limit raise or better for the 2NT call|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Jason|pg||
nt|xenya: worth reading i suppose? Must be quite boring though... |pg||
mb|2H|nt|jaapfr: and to make 2@H need a crystall ball:)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kit: 3@S probably some kind of minor-suit Stayman|pg||
nt|ritong: hm hm hmm...|pg||
nt|ritong: he knows that a @c is ruffable from the short trump hand|pg||
nt|kit: this might be some kind of slam try -- but maybe he means as offer to play|pg||
nt|ritong: so, 3 NT is a huge gambling imho|pg||
nt|gowdy: wana bet he gets @H wrong ?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: there was no alert of 3n|pg||
nt|ahri: i take that bet|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: up until 2NT SAME AUCTION IN or|pg||

nt|ritong: hi john|pg||
nt|ahri: hi :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Both E and W just led|pg||
nt|kit: seems like a big position to pass 3NT unless he had already shown a stiff club with the 2NT call|pg||
nt|kareno: Deep position for sure.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: and they pulled up the screen before it was noticed.  Director at the table to sort this out.|pg||
nt|ritong: sheesh|pg||
nt|kareno: North has no particular lead advantage in notrump.|pg||
nt|kit: probably won't matter -- likely they both led a club|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: E led @D2, W led @DQ, both led face up.|pg||
nt|ritong: lol!|pg||

nt|gowdy: :)|pg||
nt|kareno: funny!.  |pg||
nt|kit: at least E-W were on the same page|pg||
nt|kareno: I can't imagine leading either card on this auction!|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: anybody have any idea what the rules are here|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, but too long to explain|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Q is led card, 2 is penalty, must be played at 1st legal opportunity.|pg||
nt|ritong: roughly there are three options|pg||
nt|kareno: I know declarer has a bunch of choices, especially since east thought he was leading.  He can even allow south to declare!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: double....|pg||
nt|sybarra: n/s were probably at their limit in 2 @H |pg||
nt|josj: if only W could reach dummy to lead a @S...|pg||

pc|h9|nt|xenya: great|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: W is thinking....|pg||
nt|xenya: unless,,,|pg||
nt|kit: you would want to be in 7NT at this form of scoring (assuming some grand bid at other table), since it is at worst on spade hook|pg||
nt|xenya: W elects to convert to NT|pg||
nt|kit: I think at this point West will pass, as any grand may be thin from his point of view|pg||
nt|me argent: CANT STAND THE TENSION\|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Think how Lindqvist must feel!|pg||
nt|me argent: good biddings by EW inOR|pg||
nt|xenya: Lindqvist doesn't know 7N fails -- we do|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Brogeland just almost touched the Pass card, pulled away, then played it|pg||
nt|josj: but S does so all is well for the def.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mdgraham: yes|pg||

pc|h8|nt|kit: at least the play will go a lot quicker here than in 7NT|pg||
nt|kit: key guess coming here|pg||
nt|ritong: i wonder if one can inquire about leading conventions before making a decision:)|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|nt|lestergold: north has introduced this festering heart suit at the 4 level|pg||
nt|mdgraham: although I must admit, I don't agree with 4@H |pg||
nt|lestergold: north has heard paertner make a vulbnerable ovecall and a free bid of 3S but doesnt consider the opps are taking the absolute Mickey|pg||
nt|lestergold: I would be standing on the chair doubling|pg||
nt|josj: only 50 p. extra :)|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|josj: bt S has to attack dummy's entry now|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Vugraphu2: declarer wasn't given options, card that's supposed to be led is the led card.|pg||
nt|ahri: i lost the bet, well bid john :D|pg||
nt|kit: best defense is to duck, but I think declarer can work an end-play on West in that case|pg||
nt|ritong: you should not bet against gowdy, tom|pg||
nt|kareno: And the other card?  Forced to play it?|pg||
nt|ahri: now i learnt my lession|pg||
pc|c9|nt|josj: time for @DK|pg||
nt|xenya: @DK -- Merrimac coup|pg||

nt|sybarra: now another ht pls |pg||
nt|josj: if declarer plays @DJ, def. have no chance|pg||
pc|hK|pc|d5|nt|Vugraphu2: yes, it's a penalty card|pg||
nt|xenya: S was lucky that E didn't have the @DQ|pg||

mb|p|nt|josj: but undoubled...|pg||

mb|p|nt|kareno: We are hearing that the unbeatable Lynch team is now in second place |pg||

mb|p|nt|kit: I would have led a higher diamond -- no need to lead low with all those entries, and might lose to a jack-doubleton|pg||
nt|me argent: in OR north had methods over 1nt opening enabling his side to play 2@Cs|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: S finger @H 2|pg||
nt|kit: good philosophy -- when partner leads a suit vs. NT and you win the 10, your side has led the right suit|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Closed door to ask declarer if they open 1N with 5-card major|pg||

nt|josj: if N leads a @D, it will be interesting|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kit: declarer will have choice but to follow the rabbi's rule here, with no dummy entries|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|josj: but with S on lead, it's easier|pg||
nt|xenya: this should make with careful play i think|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kareno: Unless e/w can manufacture a dummy entry for declarer, he's going to be forced to make this.|pg||
nt|kareno: Perhaps when west is in with the club he can shift to a trump!!|pg||
nt|kit: The defense will have to cash out, but hard to see why they wouldn't.|pg||
nt|kit: If East wins 3 spades and shifts to a club, West will have a club back in 2 seconds|pg||
nt|kit: from West's point of view, East might hold king of clubs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no strong feelings about it|pg||

mb|p|nt|me argent: kit 4 those of you who dont know might have written the best book on defence ever written it certainly was best book on def i ever read|pg||
nt|kit: very heavy 3@S opening -- may lead to missed game|pg||
nt|me argent: i hate 3@Ss|pg||
nt|ritong: he might open 4@s|pg||
nt|lestergold: part score battle the minor suits|pg||

mb|1H|nt|jaapfr: a solid 6@D C but will it be bid?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|lestergold: maybge N/S not even getting into auction here|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: it's just their style it seems|pg||
nt|josj: Roland slam time|pg||
nt|sybarra: I will let him play these types of slam |pg||
nt|josj: but not in @H|pg||
nt|sybarra: this about 14%? or so?|pg||
nt|josj: he will make this one|pg||
nt|josj: played by N 6@S is quite good...needs trumps 3-2 and K onside, 34%?|pg||
nt|josj: and no immediate ruff|pg||
nt|josj: @H are 4-0 ...|pg||
mb|4H|nt|kit: apparently East can expect that strong a preempt, since he bid the game|pg||
nt|me argent: so it seems because one cannot argue with the final contract|pg||
nt|xenya: considering E had no difficulty raising to 4|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: I raised my pd to 4 with a void a couple of nights ago.  But I had 19 HCP!|pg||
nt|kit: effective lead by North, setting up quick heart trick and giving declarer a problem -- should he use his entry for a spade play, or should he go after clubs?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: I think he will go after clubs, although on the lie of the cards a spade play is more successful|pg||
nt|kareno: Certainly a reasonable bid.  Six makes with the club position AND the heart finesse.|pg||
nt|kit: 4@S not such a bad opening bid IMO -- even if you have a good slam, will you really be able to find it?|pg||
nt|josj: longest & strongest or else...|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm 3N shouldnt make dim lead kills it immediately for exampkle|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: gross overbidding|pg||
nt|josj: N is on lead so this does not apply...|pg||
nt|lestergold: ht lead good enough too|pg||

nt|josj: no wild fantasies|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jaapfr: now easy (nice 5@D:)|pg||

pc|hK|nt|kit: Declarer will have to not go wrong in clubs to make 12 tricks|pg||
nt|gowdy: and the club position will be clear ak @D and the @H K in south|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: And again when declarer played @SA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, we should not be too unkind. It is quite hard to reproduce your best form on Vugraph - I should know|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h3|nt|lestergold: well on a dim lead the contract would be off even with clubs coming in for no losers which missing KJxx is rather against theodds|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|sybarra: in the other room on bd 2, the long @H hand drove it to slam |pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|hT|nt|josj: so it's less absurd than it should be|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|josj: the OR is catching up|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s3|nt|josj: that's why we lose board 7 temporarily|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kareno: Split honors works from dummy with two heart entries (south can block a third heart entry)|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a very bad shot lets face it once in a blue moon players get away with these contracts|pg||
nt|josj: definitely|pg||
nt|josj: yes but S rebid 2NT which shows doubleton @H|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|kit: not 100% clear, but yes, odds are North has king of clubs from South's silence -- still, what bid could South have made?|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a bad shot because of the lack of major suit fast tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes and something outside of spade suit |pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|lestergold: N/S have an opportunity to overbid here to a less than 50% spade game which here is zero percent due to the 4/1 break|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ends probably in 3@H C or 2@H+1|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|ahri: is there a link to standings, please, karen?|pg||
nt|kit: South invites, and North will certainly bid game with the good 5-card suit|pg||
nt|josj: plus a chance of gettign X'ed|pg||
nt|lestergold: no danger of that|pg||
nt|mdgraham: what's wrong with 2@S from North?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: three trumps to the ace and a side doubleton|pg||
nt|josj: good question|pg||
nt|lestergold: i know that north cant envisage a game but are they not playing 5 card majors in which case a defensive raise to 2S would be mandatory|pg||
nt|jaapfr: depends if @C@C in trouble|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3x|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|josj: a normal contract but it looks a bit doomed|pg||
nt|xenya: a somewhat thin contract|pg||
nt|josj: with the strange @C block, 3NT might make...|pg||
nt|josj: but EW found their nice save, vul. v. not|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|josj: they are but 1@S is limited |pg||
nt|jaapfr: 2@H safe anyway|pg||
pc|h4|nt|josj: which is of relative relevance only|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kit: some kind of artificiality there -- maybe 2@S was a size ask and 3@C showed a maximum?|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm not aware if there is unless it is on ACBL's home page www.acbl.org  I'm getting updates from specs.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: 2@S and 3@C were alerted|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|kit: 3NT a fair contract, but will not make on lie of cards -- would have stopped with 15-17 1NT opening|pg||
nt|me argent: south opened 1nt in OR and is playing there|pg||
nt|kit: Club lead seems pretty normal from East hand -- don't want to lead from any other holding.  And quite effective here.|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, it is their best.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mdgraham: NS are strong club - not sure about 5cM, but it is usual to do that in a strong club system|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|nt|kit: Declarer will play low in case East has led from QJ|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|josj: sure 5cM|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kit: due to limited entries to dummy, declarer will have to give up on diamond finesse I think|pg||
nt|kit: declarer ducked heart, playing West for QJ9xx -- would have been wrong if West had ace of hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: so north should have raised to 2S - they shouldnt be defending 1N whichshould be ioff but has been let thru|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@S makes the opponents come in at the three level if they wish to compete|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h2|nt|kit: now declarer knows hearts likely 4-4|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kit: and will duck in hand, as he wants to win club in dummy for diamond finesse|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|nt|ritong: so this board, which likely will be played in 3 NT both rooms, unless south passes 1 NT, is a matter of undertricks|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|josj: N ruffs from the natural trump trick|pg||
pc|s3|nt|josj: biut a low spade now is nasty|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kit: this is not clear play, particularly since now he has to make uncomfortable discard|pg||
nt|josj: that's the obvious reason to raise anyway|pg||
pc|s4|nt|gowdy: or if garbage stayman  2 @S|pg||
nt|josj: even more so at this vul.|pg||
nt|lestergold: North not in aqgain to lead club thru so declarer has time to establish heart or bve given 7th trick in clubs|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|lestergold: North seems a little timid she failed to double the horrific 4H bid earlier on and now she has passed when she was dealt a raise|pg||
nt|josj: at least she's acting consequently|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jaapfr: in real life is or lose @HJ or @C9 same result|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d7|nt|kit: will put in queen of clubs, so if finesse loses at least he has a second dummy entry|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: do you mean consistently Jos?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kit: Good card reading by East -- he wants his partner to win the 4th round of clubs, and knows if he leads the 4 his parter may play the queen|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|pg||
nt|josj: yes I do sry|pg||
nt|josj: settling for a quiet -1 |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|xenya: this can't be real|pg||
nt|kit: I'm sure he won jack of clubs and took diamond finesse|pg||
nt|xenya: incidentally, hardly mattered as far as the score is concerned|pg||
nt|kit: actually, I like declarer's line of play upon reconsideration|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s7|nt|kit: 4th round of clubs looks pretty clear I think -- make declarer discard|pg||
nt|ritong: no|pg||
nt|ritong: he wonders why @c |pg||
nt|ritong: Q|pg||
nt|ritong: and might deduce @s A|pg||
nt|kit: ace of spades won't run away -- he does own king of hearts|pg||
nt|ritong: since both @cs were equivalent|pg||
nt|ritong: there must be some SF in @c Q|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|nt|kareno: Squeezes declarer's hand - he can't pitch a heart.  He actually sort of needs to pitch the spade ten.|pg||
nt|ritong: SP|pg||
pc|d6|nt|kit: but your point is well-taken -- West probably erred playing queen of clubs|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: next up: Becker vs Nickell|pg||
nt|gowdy: west got busy in the open room and overcalled 1@H  the @H lead let NS make 3nt|pg||
nt|gowdy: :)  or 1 less down trick I guess|pg||
nt|ritong: well, at least it loses a (fatal) trick|pg||
nt|kareno: That overcall reeks, especially vul.|pg||
nt|mrace: i think cold if played from South |pg||

mb|p|nt|josj: for EW it's just next week :)|pg||

nt|josj: as N introduced the @C first, things may well change|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u im notm con vinced 3C should have made here|pg||
nt|josj: if E returns a trump at any time, 3@C is certainly off|pg||

pc|c4|nt|Vugraphu2: yes, I got the last few tricks wrong, but result is correct|pg||
nt|kit: 6@S is reasonable here, but the bad splits will doom it|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Now we have Shugart vs Diamond, Robson-Shugart NS Greco-Hampson EW|pg||
nt|kit: This gives South a problem -- bid 2NT with xxx of clubs, bid that weak heart suit again, or raise 2nd suit on 3?|pg||

pc|cA|nt|me argent: i dislike least 3@Hs|pg||

nt|Vugraphu2: Standings: Nickell 8.55, Delmonte 8.45, Kwiecen 6.00 Spector 5.70 Kendrick 5.61, Polowan 5.38|pg||
nt|kit: the 3@S call will definitely get them to slam -- here comes RKC|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Shugart 5.27, Becker 4.68, Greenberg 4.61, Diamond 2.02|pg||
nt|xenya: i think 6@S is a bit of a stretch as you apart from @S 3-2 you also need some luck in the reds|pg||
nt|kit: Hamman passes so South can declare I think|pg||
nt|kareno: Obviously.  Hamman lurking in the bushes with his diamonds :)|pg||

nt|josj: E apparently thought p held S's trumps as well|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kareno: Backward heart finesse needed to make this.|pg||
nt|kit: this will be a costly lead if declarer guesses the hearts -- and declarer might -- has to guess whether to play South for Qx or 10x.|pg||
nt|kit: South will be marked with doubleton heart on the auction.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jaapfr: a less than 20% game this is but why  fight with success:)?|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|gowdy: or stiff|pg||

nt|ritong: not my point to cantradict big bob, but suspecting zia to overcall on @d xxxxx is not er...reasonable|pg||
nt|ritong: so he must have some other good reason not to lead @d ace|pg||
nt|kit: I really think North should have led a minor -- Qxx of hearts when partner has the minors means cashout time to me.|pg||

nt|mrace: interesting|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|kareno: I hear you Kit and I agree.  But now they should cash and tuck west in with his club queen for no decision... yet.|pg||
nt|kit: this is just a bad play -- there is no end-play possible, so what can he hope to gain?|pg||
nt|ahri: i guess he believes that making it willl be sufficient, and if south has quite many honors he'll play north for queen of hearts|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|nt|xenya: of course, once EW have failed to cash their ace slam becomes a fair proposition |pg||

nt|kit: not my idea of how to win at BAM (or any other form of scoring)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: or do they give at the table an explanation?|pg||
nt|josj: 4@D makes in EW and maybe 5@D on a @S lead|pg||

mb|2D|nt|ritong: good hand for a gazzilli|pg||
nt|josj: a conservative number again|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3D|nt|josj: yes but after winning a club, def. cannot continue @S...|pg||
mb|3S|nt|josj: E expecting at least 7 hearts|pg||

nt|josj: not at all|pg||

nt|xenya: oh|pg||
nt|jaapfr: nah tim A can still win easily due to first  3 boards in open :)|pg||
nt|josj: but tactically well done by E|pg||
mb|5D|nt|ritong: not really needed here since south has a lot|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4H in some ways too'good to bid in front of pard very heavy in 'controls- somewhat off centre|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh|pg||
nt|josj: a possibly revealing lead...|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: declarer claim|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: gazzilli is a 2@c rebid by opener indicating a good hand|pg||
nt|kit: pretty easy to get to 4@H with any sensible methods -- now the question is how many tricks can he take|pg||
nt|kit: With the strong hearts in North hand, the natural play appears to be to set up the spades immediately|pg||
nt|kareno: Setting up declarer'|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: since NS in OR playing 3@Ss @D team should win the bd|pg||
nt|kit: tough problem for declarer here -- would North underlead ace of spades with club danger staring him in face|pg||
nt|kareno: declarer's hand looks right but won't work this time.|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: I wonder if Lusje gets over this lead hurdle|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ritong: why?|pg||
nt|kareno: In the open room they are in six.|pg||
nt|josj: @D ruff now....|pg||
pc|c3|nt|josj: either ace works|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: well makeable maybe double dummy|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|c4|nt|ritong: the long @s will not be good, but he can ruff some of them nonetheless|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|kit: now trick comes back -- if declarer believes king of clubs was honest -- I think he will|pg||
nt|lestergold: but why should declarer prefer spade finesse to club finesse|pg||
nt|po-s: dummy squeezed|pg||
nt|lestergold: certainly whatever result i withdraw remark about flat board|pg||
nt|po-s: should perhaps have stayed in dummy and ruffed AKx in pades|pg||
nt|po-s: now it seems D discards are best|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kareno: Once spades don't work, cross ruff will prove good as long as declarer gets diamonds cashed before east can pitch two of them.|pg||
pc|sT|pc|cT|nt|kit: he can ruff a lot of them -- if he times it right, might come to 12 tricks|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dQ|nt|mrace: can actually take a lot by xruff , with @ds behaving |pg||
nt|po-s: good|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|kit: if East pitches diamond, will be key for declarer to cash diamond before trying to ruff another spade|pg||
nt|ritong: he knows @d are 4/3|pg||

pc|cK|nt|xenya: even if you have 9 trumps|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|josj: low @C now...|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kareno: We're on a wavelength, Kit.|pg||
nt|kareno: And it has given west too much information.  |pg||
nt|kit: no reason for West to lead anything but a trump with everything under control.|pg||
nt|josj: this can go down on a club ruff but it probably won't|pg||
nt|xenya: well 4@S would have got a few points in a bidding competition |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|dburn: odd sort of bidding, this, especially at BAM|pg||
nt|dburn: but West seemed unwilling to open or to rebid 1NT|pg||
nt|mrace: he heard ya |pg||
nt|ritong: she|pg||
nt|mrace: sry she|pg||
nt|ritong: gail greenberg|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer will lead club up immediately, and make with club ace on and hearts 2-2 -- can eventually ruff third diamond in dummy.|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, it gives up a spade trick, that is a reason not to lead trumps |pg||
nt|kit: Normal result, and that was achieved in other room.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|kit: West had has awkward rebid -- hate to bid 2@D, but weak to reverse for most|pg||
nt|dburn: and did not consider he had enough for 2@h|pg||
nt|sybarra: I like your play better Jos|pg||
pc|c2|nt|xenya: the trouble is that it might go down|pg||
pc|d4|nt|me argent: i like 2@Cs|pg||
nt|gowdy: I admit I would have pushed with 2 H's|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@c certainly possible, but only if 2@h-3@h is natural after it|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: hi all :) welcome @H@H@H|pg||
nt|xenya: so well done|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c7|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't see how he can make it now -- he can't get to dummy's clubs and retain a @D control|pg||
pc|d3|nt|josj: this way, it makes no difference :)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kit: some would solve problem by opening 1NT, but that has obvious flaws also|pg||
nt|josj: well it still can...|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kit: will win in dummy, pitch spade on king of clubs, and diamond to king.|pg||
nt|kareno: I am not fond of trump leads|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|nt|xenya: the question is whether EW can make 8 tricks in 1N -- on the surface, they can't|pg||
nt|kareno: They give up tempo and if you need to get your suits going, tempo matters a lot!|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|sT|nt|kit: might not be fond of them, but on this hand was clear (although it turned out badly this time)|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|nt|xenya: W is happy|pg||
nt|xenya: to see the @H split|pg||
nt|josj: so the match quickly closing in :)|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|xenya: mind you, N did very well to switch to @Hs -- on any other switch, 4@S makes|pg||
nt|josj: and the @H guess still to come|pg||
nt|sybarra: so may cash |pg||
nt|sybarra: South|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|nt|me argent: i played with kokish much too long to ever consider bidding 2@Hs|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, West has bought pretty well for his actual sequence - he isn't going lots down in a 5-1 or 5-0 fit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: After 4 rounds: 1. Nickell 2.Delmonte  3.Kendrick 4. Polowan 5.Shugart 6.Kwiecien  7. Spector 8.Becker  9.Greenberg 10.Diamond |pg||
nt|gowdy: no  the question is how could they ever find 1NT|pg||
nt|xenya: 1@D -- 1@S -- 1N?|pg||
nt|me argent: opening 1nt?|pg||
nt|dburn: well, if you are not prepared to open it, maybe you ought to be prepared to rebid it|pg||
nt|gowdy: transfer then Joey|pg||
nt|xenya: then E might transfer|pg||
nt|me argent: i must admit i open 1@D and rebid 2@Cs|pg||
nt|gowdy: playing weak NT then perhaps|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: I wonder why W isn't claiming?|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s3|pg||
nt|me argent: not close 4 moi|pg||

nt|ritong: but kit is right, jeff hand is a conservative player in general|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|kit: But instead North unnecessarily rushed to 3NT|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he didn't get the chance, which is a bit odd|pg||
nt|me argent: EW play polish@C so that probably influenced their choice of bids on 13|pg||
pc|dK|nt|me argent: and 14 for that matter|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, sure - in Polish Club that sequence is automatci|pg||
nt|me argent: sorry cant keep my directions streight this is my first job|pg||
nt|kit: declarer will probably duck first heart, win second, and go after clubs|pg||
pc|d3|nt|josj: it still needs a @D guess|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kit: I don't see that much difference between IMPs and matchpoints on East hand -- you bid game if you think it is a favorite, not otherwise, at both games.|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|kit: Note that after the initial pass at other table they had no difficulty getting to game|pg||
nt|josj: @H now|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jaapfr: chance bigger N not @CKQJ and @DA? in review of the pass?|pg||
nt|xenya: not really -- N is unlikely to have A and KQ on this auction|pg||
nt|xenya: so S is marked with the @DA|pg||
pc|h4|nt|frankaus: and a strange result as well|pg||
pc|hK|nt|josj: she listened well :)|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|me argent: dummy squeezed|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|pc|h5|pc|h9|pg||
nt|josj: I an wondering if W showed @S at any time|pg||
pc|sT|nt|gowdy: if @s lay right then this is bad   so right play|pg||
nt|josj: I am|pg||
nt|xenya: on a closer look, 1N seems a make on any other lead |pg||
nt|josj: in OR S did not overcall|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|xenya: actually S was sort of endplayed on the lead|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jaapfr: therefor went wrong indeed|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s7|pc|s8|pg||
nt|xenya: 8 tricks|pg||
pc|h8|nt|xenya: if S cashes his ace that is|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|c5|pc|cT|nt|josj: no game on for NS but -200 does not look too good|pg||
nt|frankaus: an officail may be required here if W showed @S without an alert|pg||
nt|xenya: 9 now -- claimable|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|h7|pc|cJ|pc|d4|nt|kit: West trying to blow the club trick -- may have succeeded|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dT|pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
nt|dburn: well, declarer may not take the spade finesse, but...|pg||
pc|cA|nt|josj: nice finale...|pg||
mc|8|nt|kit: Now declarer has to decide whether West did this with queen of spades or not|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: I think I got W's pitch wrong a few tricks back, he probably threw @H|pg||
nt|dburn: ..at least at this form of scoring he has a problem - is West a genius or a numbskull?|pg||

nt|mrace: i am bidding it in both...4 trumps and an Ace is too much to pass to a pd who overcalled at 3 level....just the @H support may make pd's hand a giant|pg||
nt|josj: yes...|pg||
nt|xenya: some hand|pg||
nt|josj: @C are 9-4-0-0...not an everyday sight|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: new leader expected after this freak:)|pg||
mb|2C|an|!C|nt|xenya: hard to predict|pg||
nt|josj: EW here won't get as high as their OR counterparts|pg||
mb|3H|nt|xenya: sorry i should have said "her ace" -- NS are women|pg||
nt|josj: for EW in OR the sky is the limit, as we saw just now|pg||
nt|xenya: -500 is good against -600|pg||
nt|jaapfr: IF you make 5@C|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, if|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 2 aces and @CJ not easy to get|pg||
nt|josj: what can E bid now to show his suits?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if bid 5@H?|pg||
nt|xenya: ah -- i didn't notice that Jxxx -- sorry|pg||
nt|jaapfr: we saw it before:)|pg||
nt|josj: looks like game for EW but 500 is better|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: do EW have a pen alty X available here???|pg||
nt|sybarra: tought to X seems not penalty dbls anymore|pg||
mb|4C|nt|kit: Now the old choice -- 3NT or 4@H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: well, Shirley, you see now what that costs|pg||
nt|josj: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: just pointing out, that few X's at the lower level are for penalty |pg||
nt|josj: sure...|pg||
mb|4S|nt|josj: but if W showed @S and it was alerted, 2NT is not easy to understand|pg||
nt|frankaus: 4@S EW may be playable here|pg||
nt|josj: sure but makeable? try a @D lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: this might not be an easy one -- i'm abit surprised E raised|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: North afraid to compete to 3@H, fearing his partner will play him for invite values|pg||
nt|kit: Doesn't seem to me that whether partner has 3 hearts or not should make much difference.|pg||
nt|kareno: 2@h is a bit of an underbid with that hand, no?|pg||
nt|mrace: too many QJs|pg||
nt|kareno: Any more and she would have a 1nt opener.  |pg||
nt|kit: I would have bid 3NT on East hand, right or wrong.|pg||
nt|mrace: after 1 nt ? |pg||
nt|mrace: or 2@H ? |pg||
nt|jaapfr: would you bid 5@H here?|pg||
nt|josj: remarkable pass but worth 12 imps, I think|pg||
nt|josj: @H mandatory now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i would bid 5@H|pg||
nt|xenya: spade will also do|pg||
nt|josj: removes the entry, yes|pg||
nt|xenya: removing the entry|pg||
mb|p|pc|h7|nt|me argent: but north did well to get his side out of nt|pg||
nt|josj: N should pass now but will he know that?|pg||
nt|josj: yes he did!|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kit: was just as well, as 3@H probably down 2 losing both club finesses|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
nt|kit: after 1NT|pg||
nt|kareno: This form of scoring that makes great sense, kit.|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: thinking|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|dburn: indeed he did - that was a pretty good view|pg||
nt|ritong: agree, kit|pg||
nt|frankaus: this is likely to make|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d5|nt|me argent: south playing 1nt in OR on a @D lead|pg||
nt|josj: Parpar will be very disappointed now|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|kit: very unusual hand where at IMPs I'd tend toward 4@H, but at matchpoints 3NT -- it is usually the other way around.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|gowdy: good bid by E not 100% obvious|pg||
nt|xenya: 9 tricks now -- E's @CJ is a big card|pg||
pc|c6|nt|me argent: a triumph 4 Garbage Stayman|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|xenya: not clear whether N should have unblocked the @DK i think|pg||
nt|josj: it looks the better play but might give the show away|pg||
nt|jaapfr: then defense sees the @H return imo|pg||
nt|xenya: exactly|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|josj: even more likely now :)|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|nt|gowdy: yep   that 2 is not 100%|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c4|pg||
nt|kit: making them all, but lose the board|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s7|nt|josj: maybe an overtrick now as the hearts go on the @S|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ritong: again|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s4|nt|me argent: easts action irrelevant on this hand north won the bd with 2@Cs|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Next match Greenberg vs Kendrick|pg||
nt|gowdy: but he can only do what he can do|pg||
nt|dburn: if Kendrick still bids as he used to, should be an interesting match|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: There's a problem with bd 16, they're skipping to 17 and they'll get a substitute bd 16|pg||
nt|josj: no he played safe lready|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|kit: at IMPs the major needs to take 2 extra tricks to be really better, so lean towards notrump if close.  At matchpoints, needs to take only 1 extra trick.|pg||
nt|josj: a|pg||
pc|s6|nt|josj: so a much needed swing to the ladies here|pg||
pc|s9|nt|josj: should be just made I think|pg||
nt|josj: and that's what it says now|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: 4@c just made :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kit: Here, however, 4@H figures to be completely safe while 3NT might have  a hole, but on balance I would bet on same number of tricks.|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|cT|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h5|pc|hT|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kareno: I think e/w in the OR play 1NT 14-16 in their club system so this hand was perhaps easier for them to evaluate.|pg||
nt|kit: 6@H was still pretty lucky in any event|pg||
nt|ritong: pretty lucky?|pg||
nt|kit: particularly played from West side, where club lead might beat it outright in addition to queen of hearts problem.|pg||
nt|mrace: they do play 15/17 but open almost all 14 hcp with good spots or 5 card suits as far as i watched them Karen |pg||
nt|mrace: i am not % 100 sure with their range though |pg||
nt|kit: greco-hampson I'm pretty sure 14-16|pg||
nt|mrace: ok|pg||
nt|mrace: how about Fred and Brad ? |pg||
nt|mrace: same ? |pg||
nt|ritong: shhh|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: The Brits are here, we're waiting for Hamman and Zia|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: After 21 boards, Nickell leading Delmonte by 3.6 boards|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: 12 boards :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: I can't predict the future|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: don't have any Swiss standings here|pg||
nt|kareno: Someone just gave me the Swiss leaders but I lost them.  Lynch is leading I remember that :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Okay, here is information about the NA Swiss:  Official scores in Swiss - after 6: Lynch 101, Dawson 93.35, Agica 92.97, Lall 91.46, Cooper 86.75 per other table|pg||

nt|sybarra: (toinight)|pg||
mb|d|nt|xenya: hello Mike|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am raising on the S hand not matter what system I play|pg||
mb|4S|nt|kit: Somehow, 2@C looks like an insufficient bid to me|pg||
nt|mrace: not much after 3@H i suppose |pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: I doubt if notrump looks right to East|pg||
nt|josj: 4@S unlucky to go down: @D 3-1 and @SQ wrong...|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: here we have a very good Roland slam|pg||
mb|5C|nt|kareno: No doubt 3@c has some other meaning|pg||

mb|p|nt|kit: could be swing on lead here -- your singleton or partner's?|pg||

nt|mdgraham: I won't argue|pg||
nt|josj: so another big swing for the ladies' team|pg||
pc|sA|nt|josj: 500 on a @H ruff should be easy enough|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|nt|josj: proper contract would be 5@D|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d8|nt|kit: key is that declarer drew trumps|pg||
nt|kit: and Zia worked it out|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North might have tried a 2@C cue-bid over the protective 1@H, but maybe that would have been natural|pg||
