nt|roswolf: at least it is only 50's|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think the Pass card is underused! if he passes North can describe his hand perfectly with a takeout double and the can reach a makeable 3@C|pg||
nt|brolucius: With the @SQ a probable wasted value, South had a totally obvious pass.  He seems to be playing rather light-headedly.|pg||

nt|roswolf: are these teams of 4 ?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Somewhere with testosterone overload, accoring to Geoffrey.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Funnily enough the defence could have come to one more trick if they had tapped declarer sith spades. But that is obviously double dummy as no-one can play him for a stiff spade|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Always nice when defenders have a long think when you are in a realy awful spot. Guives you time to brood|pg||
nt|roswolf: on 5 n/s gained 5 imps when they missed the cold slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe luck is on their side|pg||
nt|brolucius: It was a difficult slam to bid, on around 25 points. The gain was to the side who found the 500 sacrifice in spades, really.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes, to crticise a pair who did not reach slam there is a bit harsh IMO|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Is Green thinking or have we dozed off|pg||
nt|brolucius: I only tend to doze off on the even-numbered boards.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 2 spades, 1 heart, 3 diamonds and 2 clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Making 8|pg||
nt|roswolf: 8 tricks then|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and a 3rd spade = 9|pg||
nt|brolucius: 'Operation Big Deal', as Flint would have described it. A large number of IMPs at stake for making the game.|pg||
nt|vugraphzzg: reasonable to assume that S has a heart hinour and therefore N must hold the DK, so maybe win and play a low diamond from dummy?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What's the Rule of 9 I am asked. Good question, I don't think there's an answer|pg||
pc|sT|nt|brolucius: Quite rightly, Green gives it some thought.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: The rule of nines, in mathematics, is a divisibility rule for the divisor 9. It is notable because it illustrates some interesting properties of modular arithmetic, and its proof ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: is derived from that basis. The rule is that any positive integer is divisible by 9 if and only if the sum of its digits is also divisible by 9, when expressed in decimal notation ...|pg||

nt|brolucius: The Landy game-try.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is that hand really worth a leap to game?|pg||
nt|daman: the exuberance of youth|pg||
nt|cuttysark: If partner opened a strong Nt would you not get your side to 4@H? The 1Nt rebid is just the same|pg||
nt|brolucius: Some players tell you that it is not worth making game try bids of 2NT or three of a major. I have always regarded them as totally mad.|pg||
nt|roswolf: absolutely not but at rge young chelsea youthful enthusiasm still occupies the ageing bodies|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's not like the hand improved after a 1@C opening, perhaps after 1@D|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Gives us a chance to watch experts cash 4 top winners|pg||
nt|roswolf: a difficult art|pg||
nt|vugraphzzg: slight chance if N switches to a club and S misreads who holds the spade doubleton|pg||
nt|brolucius: North now needs a club and a diamond, or two diamonds (possibly after a mis-guess by declarer).|pg||
pc|dA|nt|daman: unblock|pg||

nt|Walddk2: So cashing four top tricks was too difficult after all|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmmmmmmm the art needs some science too|pg||
nt|cuttysark: It can be very difficult - especially when opponents have bid with exuberance|pg||
nt|vugraphzzg: I thought they might have gone wrong oif Espen had played a club before the DA and S thought he had the doubleton spade|pg||
nt|brolucius: North concluded that the @SA lead made it very likely that South held @SA-x, rather than @SA-x-x-x. But East might have bid differently with four spades.|pg||
