mb|1H|mb|d|nt|ritong: wow|pg||
nt|ritong: jan is not determined to let this board go|pg||
nt|reisig: Not 3@H by Jansma ?   :) :)|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|me argent: 8@Ss played by EW final contract OR|pg||
nt|kit: normal 4@H contract, but it may matter where declarer first plays the hearts from if a spade lead, as there is danger of the 10 of hearts scoring on  promotion|pg||
nt|ritong: was a decision:)|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: 4@H 1 down, so is 3@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: 3@H looks very conservative -- was devaluing his spade and diamond holdings -- but that can be overdone|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kareno: Hello from not-so-sunny Las Vegas :)|pg||
nt|ritong: hi|pg||

nt|me argent: 6nt or 6@Cs?|pg||
nt|barnets: top spot 6N|pg||
nt|barnets: by west|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Not so good played by East but it would make|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|dburn: well, West has laid claim to 6@c already|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2C|nt|dburn: and will lay claim to notrump in a minute|pg||
mb|2H|nt|paulhac:  True|pg||
nt|dburn: East will move - in fact, he might just bid a slam|pg||
mb|3D|mb|4H|nt|dburn: but 4@c is the technical route|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Sensible giving all the options in slam choice|pg||
nt|me argent: keeping 7 in the picture|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|me argent: east will now sign of in 6|pg||
nt|paulhac:  West does not like his doubleton club despite having top cards|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Hampson had the pass card out, but is thinking some more|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|dburn: pass seems a bit pessimistic, but it's true that if West had a stiff club, slam might not be so great|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s9|pc|sA|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Could easily be off 2 top cards and as they have only 29 between them|pg||
nt|dburn: and I guess West could be weaker than he is, but even so...|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|hK|pc|sT|pc|h2|nt|barnets: looks like both e and w undervalued their hands here to miss the cold slam|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: I think we will have Becker vs Polowan next round, but some of the team numbers changed between sessions and I'm not certain I have them right now. |pg||
nt|dburn: sure - neither did anything really stupid, but both conservative at the same time|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: 6 minutes to go in the round|pg||
nt|barnets: i think shugart will push this round with a win on his board|pg||
nt|me argent: think east more than west but difficult to say since they know their system better than we do|pg||
nt|barnets: h did not bid his 9 high  heart suit|pg||
nt|dburn: trouble was, East could not really do anything without leaving what might be a safe haven in 4NT|pg||
nt|paulhac:  I think it was tough again its easy for us |pg||
nt|me argent: robsons bid of 2@Hs screwed up their auction so credit 2 him|pg||
nt|barnets: in other room north passed not a big surprise|pg||
nt|barnets: that was fred|pg||
nt|dburn: was he dealing with a strong club also?|pg||
nt|barnets: and they reached the top spot of 6N by W|pg||
nt|me argent: oui|pg||
nt|barnets: yes but I dont blame him|pg||
nt|barnets: he is a disciplined player|pg||
nt|me argent: nor do i blame robson|pg||
nt|dburn: after pass - strong club at these colors, I would blame anyone who failed to overcall on a six-card suit, but...|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Its right to intervene in case you can bounce them before they know any fit they have|pg||
nt|barnets: but you give away any trump guess|pg||
nt|paulhac:  But also it might give the distribution away|pg||
nt|paulhac:  As both David and Barnet state there are + and -|pg||
nt|barnets: also perhaps there may be a difference between imps and match point scoring|pg||

nt|xenya: hello Kit|pg||
nt|ritong: so, he could get this wrong, but not easily:)|pg||
nt|gowdy: no the key was not losing to k 10|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: so East should have won first round of hearts with, ace, not king, then.|pg||
mb|2C|an|precision|nt|me argent: a question of which pair gets into trouble here|pg||
nt|kareno: mmm club slam I see|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, absolutely so|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|kit: 6NT clearly optimal here, not 6@C|pg||
nt|kareno: 6nt definitely safer.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|me argent: i like cleeffs 3@D bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: and, in a sort of bonus, system right handed no trumps, so they will get there i guess|pg||

nt|me argent: does everyone pass that west hand?|pg||
nt|dburn: may be seriously offshape, but not on this occasion|pg||
nt|barnets: its a strong weak nt|pg||
nt|dburn: 14-16? have they changed the system completely?|pg||
nt|barnets: now its a weak strong nt!|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|me argent: west wont pass here|pg||
nt|dburn: at any rate, West may feel he has some catching up to do|pg||
nt|me argent: rightfully so david|pg||
nt|paulhac:  But what can he bid? good hand for Asptro|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Sorry - I couldn't read the note on the NE side, but S gave me the right point count - both wrote either bal, or 5332 or 5422 or 4441, but not enough room for me to write that|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphu1: I think that Morgan said 2@c is Majors|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|barnets: looks like e/w may be in trouble|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: start x|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Nunes asked about 2@s & 3@c and Polowan shrugged - I think he thought 2@c was hearts and a minor|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Some play 2@C as a passed hand to show clubs and a major|pg||
nt|me argent: opening the bidding might well have been safer|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Or maybe @CS + Major, I don't know|pg||
nt|barnets: south will x this|pg||
nt|dburn: well, if East thinks West has majors, East-West are indeed in depp trouble|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: East definitely took the spade & heart cards out of his bidding box and showed them to N, so I'm pretty sure he thinks it's Majors|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Are they not already there David?|pg||
nt|dburn: not altogether clear what West is doing, though - maybe he is playing Astro, where 2@c is hearts and another|pg||
nt|dburn: but I would not expect Polowan to be playing that|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: East asking to look at NS's convention card.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|dburn: perhaps 2@c is supposed to be DONT - clubs and another|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|barnets: perhaps they play2 systems|pg||
pc|d5|nt|me argent: dont think EW a partnership of long standing so lots of room for error|pg||
nt|dburn: but no, East still thinks it is the majors|pg||
nt|paulhac:  When I played with michael 2@C by a passed hand was clubs and a major|pg||
nt|barnets: 1 over wk nt and 1 over strong|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: I can now see Polowan's note about 2@c - clubs + Major|pg||
nt|me argent: morgan obviously doesnt agree|pg||
nt|barnets: west is plying meckwell as a passed hand|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|barnets: had he not passed 2C would be majors|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Polowan: "sorry, I thought we used our strong NT defense by a passed hand"|pg||
nt|me argent: in CR NS playing 2@Ss|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Either he forgot West was a passed hand or they have a disagreement about whether 14-16 is weak or strong|pg||
nt|barnets: anyway not much of a success|pg||
nt|me argent: not doubled|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s2|nt|dburn: I still don't believe that 1NT was 14-16 - that would mean a complete rewrite of "standard Fantunes"|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Joey South doubled!|pg||
nt|sybarra: not easy for sure|pg||
nt|dburn: not in the closed room, he didn't|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry |pg||

pc|s5|pc|s4|nt|me argent: is that another of your rules david?|pg||

nt|Vugraphu1: 10.Spector|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|barnets: so most expert pairs play a different system for wk and strong nt|pg||
pc|d4|nt|dburn: it would help - after all, most of the time the opponents cannot double us for penalty, which is why we all bid so much|pg||
nt|barnets: the confusion was caused by west being a passed hand and changing their defense from wk to strong|pg||
nt|dburn: if I could double partner every now and again, it might curb some of his enthusiasm|pg||

mb|p|nt|Vugraphu2: http://www.acbl.org/nabc/recaps/2009/03/6/|pg||
nt|kit: North shouldn't do anything I don't think -- only 3 spades, which definitely promised by the double, and nothing extra|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|ritong: east in the tank|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm thinking that could end the auction.... but ... east has other ideas.|pg||
nt|kareno: At some point n/s could start applying their hob-nailed boots here :)|pg||
nt|kit: East doesn't know his partner is 5-5 -- 2@D looks pretty reasonable to me|pg||

nt|ritong: if i were brogeland, i would hate the entire hand|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|me argent: not a big fan of opening 1NT at any excuse|pg||

pc|hT|pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|kit: if your partnership is going to open 1NTwith a hand such as South hand, it helps to have methods which can locate a 5-card major|pg||

nt|kareno: This result may not matter as I am told e/w are in 3@s doubled in the OR|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: 7NT quite reasonable, but on lie of cards (spade hook off, squeeze not working) it goes down|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|d4|pg||
nt|kit: some kind of artificiality there -- maybe 2@S was a size ask and 3@C showed a maximum?|pg||

nt|Vugraphu2: 2@S and 3@C were alerted|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kit: 3NT a fair contract, but will not make on lie of cards -- would have stopped with 15-17 1NT opening|pg||
nt|me argent: south opened 1nt in OR and is playing there|pg||
nt|kit: Club lead seems pretty normal from East hand -- don't want to lead from any other holding.  And quite effective here.|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, it is their best.|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer will play low in case East has led from QJ|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|nt|kit: due to limited entries to dummy, declarer will have to give up on diamond finesse I think|pg||
nt|kit: declarer ducked heart, playing West for QJ9xx -- would have been wrong if West had ace of hearts|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pg||
nt|kit: now declarer knows hearts likely 4-4|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|kit: and will duck in hand, as he wants to win club in dummy for diamond finesse|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h6|pg||
nt|ritong: so this board, which likely will be played in 3 NT both rooms, unless south passes 1 NT, is a matter of undertricks|pg||

nt|gowdy: or if garbage stayman  2 @S|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|pc|h3|pc|cJ|pg||

pc|dT|pc|s2|pc|h4|nt|kit: Good card reading by East -- he wants his partner to win the 4th round of clubs, and knows if he leads the 4 his parter may play the queen|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s8|pg||

nt|xenya: i think 6@S is a bit of a stretch as you apart from @S 3-2 you also need some luck in the reds|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|kareno: Backward heart finesse needed to make this.|pg||
nt|kit: this will be a costly lead if declarer guesses the hearts -- and declarer might -- has to guess whether to play South for Qx or 10x.|pg||
nt|kit: South will be marked with doubleton heart on the auction.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||
nt|gowdy: or stiff|pg||
nt|kit: And since South didn't open, I think declarer will get it right.|pg||

nt|ritong: not my point to cantradict big bob, but suspecting zia to overcall on @d xxxxx is not er...reasonable|pg||
nt|ritong: so he must have some other good reason not to lead @d ace|pg||

pc|d9|pc|h2|pc|dA|pc|dJ|pg||

pc|dT|pc|c2|nt|kit: what????|pg||
pc|d8|nt|me argent: north did well 2 avoid slam on this auction|pg||

nt|mrace: interesting|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|kareno: I hear you Kit and I agree.  But now they should cash and tuck west in with his club queen for no decision... yet.|pg||
nt|kit: this is just a bad play -- there is no end-play possible, so what can he hope to gain?|pg||
nt|ahri: i guess he believes that making it willl be sufficient, and if south has quite many honors he'll play north for queen of hearts|pg||
pc|d7|pc|c4|nt|xenya: of course, once EW have failed to cash their ace slam becomes a fair proposition |pg||

mb|2N|nt|Walddk4:  Nickell 8.55 Delmonte 8.45 Kweicen 6 Spector 5.7 Kendrick 5.61|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|me argent: west blew a trick on hand11 but won the bd|pg||
nt|mrace: E refused to ruff @Ss, he is more likely to have K rather than J, no ? |pg||
nt|kareno: That's why I suggested ruffing with the ace.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|kareno: Board 6 is a late play, folks, we can't show a score for it.|pg||
nt|kit: West properly accepts the transfer|pg||
nt|mrace: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|ritong: so does north|pg||
nt|kit: A bit too much at this vulnerability, as it turns out|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|kit: Assuming West sits, and I can't see why he wouldn't|pg||
nt|ritong: lindqvist has an opinion to propose|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, no reason for west to remove the double.|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|nt|xenya: all very reasonable but 9 tricks are available here|pg||
nt|ritong: a classical " periscope" lead|pg||
nt|kareno: Good lead by Brogeland just in case his partner needs him to shift.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|me argent: same auction in OR sorta|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: thanks all @H@H :)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|kit: pretty lucky lie of cards, to put it mildly|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|cK|pg||
nt|kareno: Lindqvist calls for a diamond.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|dburn: true, but it's not obvious to play for the singleton king of spades|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|kit: not at all -- but what else might she do?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kit: yes -- normal in this sort of situation|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|d5|pc|d4|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ritong: push|pg||
nt|kareno: Both north/south pairs will think they've lost that board :)|pg||
nt|ritong: they at least suppose they did not win it|pg||
nt|kareno: In that they are both correct :)|pg||
nt|kit: they sure were off by quite a bit -- 4@S isn't close|pg||
nt|mrace: i watched Hamman and Zia practicing BAM in bbo previous recent weeks, they are too agressive at low level and tend to leave opponents after first shock...not at his board.|pg||
nt|kareno: I assume we still do not have any running scores, do we?|pg||
nt|kit: I don't like the 5@H call -- he has a lot of trumps, but so what?|pg||
nt|kareno: Too many losers.  Caught up in the heat of the auction.|pg||
nt|ritong: what would you pick at barbu with zia shand, kit?|pg||
nt|kareno: I pick last 2 tricks :)|pg||
nt|ritong: pff:) small player:)|pg||
nt|mrace: haha|pg||
nt|mrace: i wld go for trumps :) |pg||
nt|kareno: By the way, Henri, I am the one who actually brought Barbu to the US after my year and a half playing it in Paris :)|pg||
nt|kit: anything which I thought I could get doubled in Henri|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|kareno: That was in 1965!!|pg||
nt|ritong: that s why it is a tuff hand imo|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: next up: Greenberg vs Diamond|pg||
nt|kareno: Barbu is a fine card game :)|pg||
nt|ritong: i should have precised: first hand|pg||
nt|ritong: oh yeah!|pg||
nt|ritong: it is marvellous|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: After 9 bds, Nickell leading Delmonte by 1.6 boards|pg||
nt|kit: and probably more after last round|pg||
nt|kareno: Did you know it was played at the Club Elysee in Paris, Henri?  |pg||
nt|mrace: we call it "KING" in Turkey , and "Bloody King " where u pick b4 u see ur hand |pg||
nt|ritong: yes, naturally:)|pg||
nt|kareno: And for stakes :)|pg||
nt|ritong: although i mostly was in BCP or albarran clubs|pg||
nt|ritong: bcp = bridge club de paris|pg||
nt|kareno: Somehow I landed at Elysee early and there I played the whole year and a half I lived in Paris.|pg||
nt|ritong: french mecque of bridge, sort of|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sA|nt|Walddk4: Next round we'll have Spector vs Delmonte|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pc|h7|pc|h5|pg||
nt|kit: and now  ton of tricks|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sT|pc|h9|nt|xenya: typo, Kit -- ten, not ton|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|nt|kit: East likely to have ace of hearts from opening bid, so can cash 10 of spades and lead heart up, making 10 tricks|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dT|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|nt|me argent: have we played 12 bds all ready? how time flys|pg||
nt|kit: made 10 tricks I believe, but won't matter|pg||
nt|gowdy: east was a bit quick winning the @D   ducking would have saved a trick or 2|pg||
nt|kit: yes, but far from obvious from his point of view|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: NS Bathurst-Zagorin vs EW Tuszynski-Kowalski|pg||
pc|dK|pc|h4|pg||
pc|c5|mc|12|pg||
