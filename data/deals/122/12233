mb|p|nt|patricck: seems like a routine @S game...yes 6@S can be made, but not a good contract and won't be bid anyway|pg||

nt|psridhar: other room heading towards slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: really, the winning play in trumps is possible, exciting stuff if they bid and make it|pg||
nt|psridhar: that 2nt bid has missed the spd fit|pg||
nt|patricck: no......2NT not an enquiry then?|pg||
nt|panja: and 2N won't make|pg||
nt|psridhar: Sanajy has gone for quanti auction in pref to the spd fit|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|panja: if it went 2@C-2@D-2@H...I guess 2N would have been forcing....|pg||
nt|panja: so the structure forced him to guess the best response?|pg||
nt|patricck: how could it be by a passed hand?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|Walddk6: How can anything be forcing by a passed hand?|pg||

nt|panja: oh y, passed hand, true|pg||
nt|Walddk6: So if he wants to bid, 2@D must be it|pg||

nt|psridhar: u only need yr pd not to screw up|pg||
nt|psridhar: sorry prvt|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|nt|bjacobs: If the @H9 and @H10 were swapped - that was what North was hoping|pg||
pc|cK|nt|patricck: normally the right play with this holding is to run the 10@S, but it is quite a close call. If you can only lead once because you only have one entry then the correct play is small ...|pg||
nt|patricck: to the K@S|pg||
nt|psridhar: even 3s is conservative in my opinion ...he just needs QJXXX in spd and out for game to make|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|psridhar: the std auction in other room will locate the spd fit at 1 lev and dhampur shd gain a partial here|pg||

mb|p|nt|patricck: same mistake I made....North is short of diamonds, not South|pg||
nt|Walddk6: I like to double with the South cards and play ELC. 2@D overcall could well have lost spades|pg||
nt|panja: y|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk6: ELC = Equal Level Conversion|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: Mango had their share of slam luck in first session when they landed a grand dropping doubleton Q of trumps in an 8 card fit|pg||
nt|psridhar: i was abt to say that Roland-2D on that moth eaten suit opp a passed hand is not my fav-the take out X is more flex and brings spd into pic|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, I like double rather than 2@D as well, but close decision, would not criticise 2@D|pg||
nt|panja: better still, why not overcall 1@S?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk6: http://www.bridgeguys.com/EGlossary/EqualLevelConversion.html|pg||
nt|panja: with a structure to handle 4-card overcalls..of course|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|Walddk6: ELC solves all probs. If partner responds diamonds or spades, all is fine, and if you get (the more likely) 2@C, you convert to 2@D to show diamonds and spades|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sT|pc|sQ|pc|h2|pg||
pc|d7|nt|psridhar: perhaps a consolation 2 imp to mango here..but Railways are taking all big swings|pg||
nt|patricck: If you overcall 1@S and partner bids 2@C what do you do? Bid 2@D and see partner bid 2@S with a doubleton?|pg||
nt|panja: not all, some, perhaps, many|pg||
nt|panja: for one, if W bids 2@h or 3@H, with Club length....what shd partner do?|pg||

mb|p|nt|psridhar: this one is a lock :)|pg||
nt|panja: South is Sanjay Damle, N is Raju Gulavani, W is Kamal Mukherjee...|pg||
mb|1D|nt|patricck: any 5-1 @H break except singleton Ace would have beaten it|pg||
nt|psridhar: the stiff h is the ace so...|pg||
mb|1H|nt|patricck: Nice distributional 4@S contract, makes even with a spade misguess|pg||
mb|1S|nt|patricck: hard for EW to bid 6@C against this start|pg||
nt|psridhar: over 1h W found a fitshowing jump to 2s in other room-it was easy to reach 4s thereafter|pg||
mb|2H|nt|psridhar: true ..a typical alok sadhu 1H has EW in totters..|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|panja: fit-showing?|pg||
nt|patricck: support double showing 3 card @S....   if so then West really should have done more than just correct to 2@S|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|bjacobs: North may have a tricky problem on opening lead here|pg||
mb|d|nt|panja: a first time 3@H by N might have solved this problem...|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Well if North takes his own advice and leads a club, this will no doubt go down|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Oh, not to worry - E/W have gone bananas.  And there is no miracle, like there was on board 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: Director intervening|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: A@D lead would be a disaster|pg||
pc|c9|nt|panja: y, this has some chances...|pg||
nt|psridhar: this NS auction sounds confused..and early in the match it will encourage opponents|pg||
nt|panja: even @CA now by E might be bad for EW|pg||

pc|s7|nt|psridhar: he had to lead a trump to beat it 500|pg||
pc|s8|pg||

nt|psridhar: here are some scores- after 2 sets- cabal leading by 1imp over blues; CVrao up 21 over machchar ; Arun jain leading by 8 over dhampur|pg||
nt|patricck: that's the ned of the match then, no way back for Mango now|pg||
nt|patricck: *end|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: 4@S for NS, but a good sac for EW, too|pg||
mb|3S|nt|psridhar: sry Arun Jain Vs dhampur -not shree cements i stand crrected|pg||
nt|psridhar: we guess slam made on a revoke -i do not see any other possibility|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Unusual over Unusual. 3@D forcing with spade support|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Looks like 3@D showed some sort of spade hand - "unusual over unusual"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@C would have shown hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: This way you can bid non-forcing 3@H and 3@S|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|psridhar: 3C= nf in H as opposed to direct 3h which wd be F perhaps|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's anyone's guess why West passed that hand in 1st seat|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It looks like West is wondering about that as well ...|pg||
nt|psridhar: 5nt possibly is pick a slam including 6nt|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|nt|psridhar: this shd go down|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|c7|nt|panja: any reason to pull the first tump from a particular side here?|pg||

pc|c8|pc|c9|nt|psridhar: this year the Ruia Gold field has reduced to an overwhelming presence of players from Mumbai and kolkatta...used be so long ago till formidables changed that pattern in the last ...|pg||
nt|psridhar: decade|pg||
nt|panja: yes, I counted in QF, out of 48, 23 from W bengal|pg||

nt|panja: 19 from Mumbai, 20 if you count Dudhane as Mumbai|pg||
nt|psridhar: Dudh is ofcourse mumbaiker|pg||
nt|panja: dudh is sushegad|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: 3@H seems beatable|pg||
nt|psridhar: thx Roland; we tried to extend the principle ( lower vs lower) vs any 2 suitor o/c; ran into complications -for eg u open 1nt lho overcalls 2c -landy now?|pg||
nt|psridhar: if u must open 2nt on a 19 counter make sure u hv a decent 5 card suit !|pg||
mb|1D|an| |mb|p|nt|patricck: good slam in either @S or @D here|pg||
mb|1H|an| |mb|p|mb|2D|an| |nt|psridhar: it certainly works well over unusual 2nt showing minors |pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: You could play 2@H as showing the minors, with clubs equal or greater than diamonds; 2@S shows longer diamonds (after the Landy bid)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H heart stop, no spade stop. 2@S spade stop, no heart stop. NT stops in both majors. That's one way of playing it|pg||
mb|2S|nt|psridhar: i hear that slam on bd 27 made because when a dia was played off the tbl S played 2 cards -the ACE and 9 of dia- the 9 was visible so diro ruled it in|pg||
nt|psridhar: i thk NS hv enough grounds to contest that decision on appeal|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: they won't need to|pg||
nt|psridhar: 1. Dia ace was the setting trcik|pg||
nt|panja: @D better..with the 54 fit....easier to remove trumps and take your discards...|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: This is the same position as the CR.  They took their spade ruff, but failed to cash the diamond tricks|pg||
nt|panja: but 2 IMP difference for a @S contract|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|psridhar: 4s fast arrival showing poor hand but cant stop N from slam|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5D|nt|bjacobs: They didn't get to first base in this room!|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|an| |mb|p|nt|panja: Aces ask that does not tell much here|pg||
mb|6S|nt|psridhar: defense has essentially done the same mistake here too|pg||
nt|psridhar: the diro should keep in mind that the expert defender is on play with setting trick vs a slam -bd 27|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: I'm fairly sympathetic to this particular mistake|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Aloke probably felt that he didn't need to give partner a spade ruff|pg||
nt|psridhar: perhaps Dia king lead and THEN spd shift wd hv achieved|pg||
nt|psridhar: why Panja? he used ace ask as route to discover his pd's trump Q|pg||
nt|panja: well...the ace answer did not tell much..|pg||
nt|panja: I am trying to make out the meaning of further bids..|pg||
nt|panja: 5@D, what was it?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bjacobs: Yes, the diamond lead makes it all so much simpler|pg||
nt|psridhar: not very tough as pd has shown dia as one of his suits |pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|psridhar: yes 5d asked abt trump q|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|panja: and 5@S shows trump Q?|pg||
nt|psridhar: 2nd step yes|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s7|pc|h6|pc|h9|pg||
nt|panja: that would be @SQ, what about @DQ then?|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
nt|psridhar: he bid 2D .....N has AK of dia|pg||
nt|panja: I presume 1@S on 1@H would have been 0-4 HCP....|pg||
mc|12|nt|panja: so 2@D primarily shows 5-7....possibly 5 Diamonds too...but could it be 4 with a good hand that does not want to bid Nt?|pg||
nt|psridhar: the Std auction may be difficult-perhaps 1s-2s-3d-4d? on to slam?|pg||
pg||

nt|bjacobs: This is one of those horrible hands where West thinks he has 9 tricks for 3NT, but ...|pg||
nt|psridhar: Bill thats a cruel thought :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: 2d=nat with 5-7 i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: looks like we hv lost link with other room|pg||

mb|1N|an| |mb|p|nt|psridhar: Laltu may but in 3d and ..regret|pg||
nt|panja: B10...@H guess would be the interesting point....for an OT only though|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|bjacobs: It's up to East now ... he has a diamond stopper, but he's the one looking at the club void|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: It's still very tough to expect him to pass this|pg||
nt|psridhar: i hear Dhampur didnt bid the slam on bd 9-- means we have a new leader in the match|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: well done|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think that's a fantastic pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: they stop in 3@H......primarily because the secondary @D fit was not unearthed|pg||
pc|sT|nt|bjacobs: Now it's up to Aloke to make it|pg||
nt|patricck: There needs to be a big swing to Mango on this board to make an appeal relevant.... I just can't see that happening|pg||
nt|patricck: I guess we were just assuming they would bid game|pg||
pc|s3|nt|psridhar: combined with not Doubling 2D...he has done well|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|c2|nt|psridhar: once again picturising how the Std auction wd go on this bd in other room....will it go 1nt -all pass?|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|nt|psridhar: defending 2D X with a club void is a nightmare|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes i agree -Railways have sewed this one up|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: very fast play...missed tricks.....will update score|pg||
nt|panja: 2/1 or sayc?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|psridhar: thx all gl to railways in semifinal-c u all at 1500 hrs IST|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: scores updated|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c6|pc|c4|pg||
nt|panja: you get 2@D rebid in 2/1, and that might propel N to a stronger invite..|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s4|pg||
nt|panja: but of course, it could also be just 1@H 2@H|pg||
pc|c9|nt|psridhar: Bill -pl note the auction was identical in other room-- kudos to indian bridge judgement? ;)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bjacobs: Indeed|pg||

nt|vugraphzwu: gr8|pg||
nt|panja: the problem...is..their 1@H rebid is artificial..as in last hand|pg||
nt|panja: therefore, with 16 and @H suit, they would often prefer to open 1@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|panja: last hand, I mean, B9, where they bid a @S slam|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|panja: there are the weak points of a system, all systems have some, one must be aware of them...|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|patricck: must be something wrong here.... I agree with every single bid made in this auction :)|pg||
nt|panja: aceless NS hands, they have already bid enough...|pg||

nt|psridhar: and...2s by pd? :)|pg||
nt|patricck: not sure that I think 1NT is automatic on the west hand...perhaps if partner is a regular 4 card overcaller it might have to be|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|panja: no....provide for a 4-card overcall|pg||
mb|d|mb|r|nt|panja: so..don't correct from a minor suit|pg||
nt|patricck: but then if partner overcalls 4 carders that regularly that I am altering my bidding then maybe the 1@S is alertable so that the opponents are given full information as well|pg||
