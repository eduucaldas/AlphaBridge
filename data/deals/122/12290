nt|jwit: Great result for EW in closed room|pg||
mb|1N|an|11-14|nt|athene: so he really shouldn't ask for a club|pg||
mb|2D!|an|single suited major|mb|2S|mb|d!|an|pens if 2!D bid was !Ss|nt|Walddk2: Townsend got everything right after a heart to the king and a heart return|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|jwit: 4S no piece of cake, especially with a heart lead.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: east will do well to bid here|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: but pass is understandable|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|roswolf: a sizeable pickup for erichsen here|pg||
nt|athene: of course east has a pretty good hand for spades but 2@S doesn't really have game interest, in theory|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|cA|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: South's weak jump overcall helped Townsend in the sense that he found @SQ and played diamonds the way he did|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C  (2@H)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jwit: I think I would have bid 3S with the East hand.  After all, even if 2S doesn't show game interest, it was a free bid, and East has a max with three trumps and ruffing values|pg||
nt|xenya: might not be easy for E to give W a ruff now|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|athene: so that gave east at least @DA @HA @SK @CQ - he can't have the @HQ too for a weak notrump|pg||

nt|roswolf: design here i think|pg||
nt|athene: these fits often fall into the cracks in a natural system - maybe north was worried his partner had a singleton spade?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzg: at the table Espen has just said he thinks the 5431 is more likely than the 5422|pg||
nt|jwit: Interesting that South chose 3NT rather than 4S.  Turns out it is a good contract, but reverse North's clubs and hearts and 4S is a million times superior|pg||

nt|athene: maybe he will have to pass now though|pg||
nt|jwit: I would bid 3C|pg||
nt|athene: thinking that if he redoubles and now bids 3@C that's overdoing it a bit|pg||
nt|athene: he is a passed hand of course|pg||
mb|p|pc|cK|nt|jwit: Very timid, especially down in the match|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes a conservative view|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cT|pc|c3|pg||

nt|athene: this redouble really isn't at all well-defined|pg||
nt|xenya: or did 1@S promise 5 cards?|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|dT|pc|dQ|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Would that be on K109xx?|pg||

nt|jwit: I would play west for KQ with the 2H bid.  Can't imagine even at this vulnerability venturing into auction on K10xxx or Q10xxx|pg||

nt|jwit: especially with a big lead|pg||
nt|athene: i think there is another reason, maybe, to rise the jack|pg||
nt|roswolf: good point|pg||

mb|1C|mb|1S|mb|2D|mb|d|mb|p|nt|jwit: Interesting hand to start with.  3NT most likely game for NS, but would require picking up the diamond suit|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|d9|pg||
nt|athene: there might be a double squeeze here if the defence aren't careful|pg||

nt|athene: now declarer ruffs and runs the trumps|pg||
nt|athene: and west is squeezed in clubs and hearts, and east in diamonds and hearts|pg||
