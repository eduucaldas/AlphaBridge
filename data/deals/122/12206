nt|reisig: Not 3@H by Jansma ?   :) :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|me argent: 8@Ss played by EW final contract OR|pg||
nt|kit: normal 4@H contract, but it may matter where declarer first plays the hearts from if a spade lead, as there is danger of the 10 of hearts scoring on  promotion|pg||
nt|ritong: was a decision:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|xenya: 4@H 1 down, so is 3@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: 3@H looks very conservative -- was devaluing his spade and diamond holdings -- but that can be overdone|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Hello from not-so-sunny Las Vegas :)|pg||

nt|me argent: 6nt or 6@Cs?|pg||
nt|barnets: top spot 6N|pg||
nt|barnets: by west|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Not so good played by East but it would make|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|dburn: well, West has laid claim to 6@c already|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|dburn: and will lay claim to notrump in a minute|pg||
mb|1N|nt|paulhac:  True|pg||
nt|dburn: East will move - in fact, he might just bid a slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: but 4@c is the technical route|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Sensible giving all the options in slam choice|pg||
nt|me argent: keeping 7 in the picture|pg||
mb|p|pc|hK|nt|me argent: east will now sign of in 6|pg||
nt|paulhac:  West does not like his doubleton club despite having top cards|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Hampson had the pass card out, but is thinking some more|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hT|pc|h2|pg||
nt|dburn: pass seems a bit pessimistic, but it's true that if West had a stiff club, slam might not be so great|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s4|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|nt|paulhac:  Could easily be off 2 top cards and as they have only 29 between them|pg||
nt|dburn: and I guess West could be weaker than he is, but even so...|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|pc|c5|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|barnets: looks like both e and w undervalued their hands here to miss the cold slam|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: I think we will have Becker vs Polowan next round, but some of the team numbers changed between sessions and I'm not certain I have them right now. |pg||
nt|dburn: sure - neither did anything really stupid, but both conservative at the same time|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: 6 minutes to go in the round|pg||
nt|barnets: i think shugart will push this round with a win on his board|pg||
nt|me argent: think east more than west but difficult to say since they know their system better than we do|pg||
nt|barnets: h did not bid his 9 high  heart suit|pg||
nt|dburn: trouble was, East could not really do anything without leaving what might be a safe haven in 4NT|pg||
nt|paulhac:  I think it was tough again its easy for us |pg||
nt|me argent: robsons bid of 2@Hs screwed up their auction so credit 2 him|pg||
nt|barnets: in other room north passed not a big surprise|pg||
nt|barnets: that was fred|pg||
nt|dburn: was he dealing with a strong club also?|pg||
nt|barnets: and they reached the top spot of 6N by W|pg||
nt|me argent: oui|pg||
nt|barnets: yes but I dont blame him|pg||
nt|barnets: he is a disciplined player|pg||
nt|me argent: nor do i blame robson|pg||
nt|dburn: after pass - strong club at these colors, I would blame anyone who failed to overcall on a six-card suit, but...|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Its right to intervene in case you can bounce them before they know any fit they have|pg||
nt|barnets: but you give away any trump guess|pg||
nt|paulhac:  But also it might give the distribution away|pg||
nt|paulhac:  As both David and Barnet state there are + and -|pg||
nt|barnets: also perhaps there may be a difference between imps and match point scoring|pg||

nt|ritong: so, he could get this wrong, but not easily:)|pg||
nt|gowdy: no the key was not losing to k 10|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: so East should have won first round of hearts with, ace, not king, then.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|me argent: a question of which pair gets into trouble here|pg||
nt|kareno: mmm club slam I see|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, absolutely so|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|kit: 6NT clearly optimal here, not 6@C|pg||
nt|kareno: 6nt definitely safer.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|me argent: i like cleeffs 3@D bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: and, in a sort of bonus, system right handed no trumps, so they will get there i guess|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c2|pc|cJ|nt|kit: hard to fault the 3NT call, but it works out very badly|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ritong: ecco|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kareno: Good auction and it is, as Henri points out, right-sided.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ritong: ugly board for greco hampson, although robson did not leave them alone|pg||
nt|kit: pretty hard to imagine wrong-siding it|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|nt|me argent: this will be very tough to make a defensive revoke would help|pg||
nt|xenya: put EW on the spot -- a point for AC|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|pg||
nt|kit: in other room North bid only 2@D, and that gave E-W a chance to escape|pg||
nt|me argent: so cleefs approach helped win the board 4 NS|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ritong: right sided means " i am declarer" for jansma:)|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|kareno: lol|pg||
nt|kit: I think opposite a strong 1@C opening the East hand should just drive it to slam|pg||
nt|ritong: who, by the way, is a super nice guy and does not deserve dubious jokes like that one  sorry, jan|pg||
nt|kareno: I agree, Kit - I think Greco dogged it.|pg||
nt|kareno: Do we have any update on positions?  |pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Next up is Becker vs Polowan|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Standings are posted 1 round behind, so nothing since the 1st session|pg||

nt|dburn: at any rate, West may feel he has some catching up to do|pg||
nt|me argent: rightfully so david|pg||
nt|paulhac:  But what can he bid? good hand for Asptro|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Sorry - I couldn't read the note on the NE side, but S gave me the right point count - both wrote either bal, or 5332 or 5422 or 4441, but not enough room for me to write that|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Vugraphu1: I think that Morgan said 2@c is Majors|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|barnets: looks like e/w may be in trouble|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: start x|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Nunes asked about 2@s & 3@c and Polowan shrugged - I think he thought 2@c was hearts and a minor|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Some play 2@C as a passed hand to show clubs and a major|pg||
nt|me argent: opening the bidding might well have been safer|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Or maybe @CS + Major, I don't know|pg||
nt|barnets: south will x this|pg||
nt|dburn: well, if East thinks West has majors, East-West are indeed in depp trouble|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: East definitely took the spade & heart cards out of his bidding box and showed them to N, so I'm pretty sure he thinks it's Majors|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Are they not already there David?|pg||
nt|dburn: not altogether clear what West is doing, though - maybe he is playing Astro, where 2@c is hearts and another|pg||
nt|dburn: but I would not expect Polowan to be playing that|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: East asking to look at NS's convention card.|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: perhaps 2@c is supposed to be DONT - clubs and another|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|barnets: perhaps they play2 systems|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|me argent: dont think EW a partnership of long standing so lots of room for error|pg||
nt|dburn: but no, East still thinks it is the majors|pg||
nt|paulhac:  When I played with michael 2@C by a passed hand was clubs and a major|pg||
nt|barnets: 1 over wk nt and 1 over strong|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: I can now see Polowan's note about 2@c - clubs + Major|pg||
nt|me argent: morgan obviously doesnt agree|pg||
nt|barnets: west is plying meckwell as a passed hand|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|nt|barnets: had he not passed 2C would be majors|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Polowan: "sorry, I thought we used our strong NT defense by a passed hand"|pg||
nt|me argent: in CR NS playing 2@Ss|pg||
pc|sA|nt|paulhac:  Either he forgot West was a passed hand or they have a disagreement about whether 14-16 is weak or strong|pg||
nt|barnets: anyway not much of a success|pg||
nt|me argent: not doubled|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|s3|nt|dburn: I still don't believe that 1NT was 14-16 - that would mean a complete rewrite of "standard Fantunes"|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h6|pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|ahri: is there a link to standings, please, karen?|pg||

pc|hQ|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kit: some kind of artificiality there -- maybe 2@S was a size ask and 3@C showed a maximum?|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm not aware if there is unless it is on ACBL's home page www.acbl.org  I'm getting updates from specs.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: 2@S and 3@C were alerted|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kit: 3NT a fair contract, but will not make on lie of cards -- would have stopped with 15-17 1NT opening|pg||
nt|me argent: south opened 1nt in OR and is playing there|pg||
nt|kit: Club lead seems pretty normal from East hand -- don't want to lead from any other holding.  And quite effective here.|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, it is their best.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kit: Declarer will play low in case East has led from QJ|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c3|nt|kit: due to limited entries to dummy, declarer will have to give up on diamond finesse I think|pg||
nt|kit: declarer ducked heart, playing West for QJ9xx -- would have been wrong if West had ace of hearts|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kit: now declarer knows hearts likely 4-4|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sJ|nt|kit: and will duck in hand, as he wants to win club in dummy for diamond finesse|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ritong: so this board, which likely will be played in 3 NT both rooms, unless south passes 1 NT, is a matter of undertricks|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||

pc|sK|nt|gowdy: or if garbage stayman  2 @S|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|sT|nt|kit: will put in queen of clubs, so if finesse loses at least he has a second dummy entry|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|d7|pg||
nt|kit: Good card reading by East -- he wants his partner to win the 4th round of clubs, and knows if he leads the 4 his parter may play the queen|pg||

nt|Vugraphu2: Now we have Shugart vs Diamond, Robson-Shugart NS Greco-Hampson EW|pg||

nt|Vugraphu2: Shugart 5.27, Becker 4.68, Greenberg 4.61, Diamond 2.02|pg||
nt|xenya: i think 6@S is a bit of a stretch as you apart from @S 3-2 you also need some luck in the reds|pg||

nt|kareno: Obviously.  Hamman lurking in the bushes with his diamonds :)|pg||

pc|cT|pc|s4|pc|c8|nt|kit: Well he was right -- maybe he didn't think his partner had 4 spades|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|kit: now the tough decision -- and he chose well to sell out|pg||
pc|d8|nt|kareno: Backward heart finesse needed to make this.|pg||
nt|kit: this will be a costly lead if declarer guesses the hearts -- and declarer might -- has to guess whether to play South for Qx or 10x.|pg||
nt|kit: South will be marked with doubleton heart on the auction.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|gowdy: or stiff|pg||
nt|kit: And since South didn't open, I think declarer will get it right.|pg||
nt|mrace: makes 11 tricks if guesses @H now |pg||
nt|ritong: not my point to cantradict big bob, but suspecting zia to overcall on @d xxxxx is not er...reasonable|pg||
nt|ritong: so he must have some other good reason not to lead @d ace|pg||
nt|kit: I really think North should have led a minor -- Qxx of hearts when partner has the minors means cashout time to me.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|h7|pg||
nt|kit: moment of truth now|pg||
pc|c5|pc|sJ|nt|kit: what????|pg||
pc|c3|nt|me argent: north did well 2 avoid slam on this auction|pg||
nt|kit: opening lead was costly -- lets declarer just draw trump, pitch the club on ace of hearts, and make 6|pg||
nt|mrace: interesting|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|kareno: I hear you Kit and I agree.  But now they should cash and tuck west in with his club queen for no decision... yet.|pg||
nt|kit: this is just a bad play -- there is no end-play possible, so what can he hope to gain?|pg||
nt|ahri: i guess he believes that making it willl be sufficient, and if south has quite many honors he'll play north for queen of hearts|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|nt|xenya: of course, once EW have failed to cash their ace slam becomes a fair proposition |pg||
nt|mrace: just a lille more info about how to play @Hs i guess, bailed out from extras|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kit: And the ping-pong battle continues|pg||

nt|kit: pretty easy to get to 4@H with any sensible methods -- now the question is how many tricks can he take|pg||
nt|kit: With the strong hearts in North hand, the natural play appears to be to set up the spades immediately|pg||
nt|kareno: Setting up declarer'|pg||
pc|s6|nt|me argent: since NS in OR playing 3@Ss @D team should win the bd|pg||
nt|kit: tough problem for declarer here -- would North underlead ace of spades with club danger staring him in face|pg||

pc|s9|pg||
nt|kareno: Once spades don't work, cross ruff will prove good as long as declarer gets diamonds cashed before east can pitch two of them.|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d8|pg||

nt|kit: they sure were off by quite a bit -- 4@S isn't close|pg||
nt|mrace: i watched Hamman and Zia practicing BAM in bbo previous recent weeks, they are too agressive at low level and tend to leave opponents after first shock...not at his board.|pg||
