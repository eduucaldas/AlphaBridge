mb|p|mb|2D|nt|ritong: wow|pg||
nt|ritong: jan is not determined to let this board go|pg||
nt|reisig: Not 3@H by Jansma ?   :) :)|pg||
mb|4H|mb|5C|nt|me argent: 8@Ss played by EW final contract OR|pg||
nt|kit: normal 4@H contract, but it may matter where declarer first plays the hearts from if a spade lead, as there is danger of the 10 of hearts scoring on  promotion|pg||
nt|ritong: was a decision:)|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|6H|nt|xenya: 4@H 1 down, so is 3@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: slam as cards lie with hts btreaking 3/3 but not a good slam|pg||
mb|7C|nt|kit: 3@H looks very conservative -- was devaluing his spade and diamond holdings -- but that can be overdone|pg||
mb|d|nt|kareno: Hello from not-so-sunny Las Vegas :)|pg||
nt|ritong: hi|pg||
nt|kit: The 3@D call got the diamond lead, and now declarer can't have any problems as the cards lie|pg||

nt|kareno: Henri :)  Kit :)|pg||

nt|lestergold: North has a move on south's bidding|pg||

nt|xenya: and 4@H makes -- doubly sorry|pg||
nt|me argent: after all partner came in vul at 3 level|pg||

pc|c5|pc|cJ|nt|ritong: no.|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|lestergold: well North's pass conservative unless Ive misunderstood south's bidding|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mdgraham: NS strong club, so 3@D doesn't carry the same "extra values" overtones as in a natiral system|pg||
pc|h7|nt|gowdy: no way|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: 3@D = @S raise with @D|pg||
nt|reisig: BAM is brutal at times|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||

nt|kareno: Surviving that hurdle.|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Kit Woolsey|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Kit|pg||
nt|ritong: so, he could get this wrong, but not easily:)|pg||
nt|gowdy: no the key was not losing to k 10|pg||
nt|lestergold: but it was on and it may well be bid in the open room|pg||
nt|josj: easy to get a little too high and worthwhile too|pg||
mb|1C|nt|kit: so East should have won first round of hearts with, ace, not king, then.|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: a question of which pair gets into trouble here|pg||
nt|kareno: mmm club slam I see|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, absolutely so|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|lestergold: looks like a reasonable 3N contract here for E/W|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|kit: 6NT clearly optimal here, not 6@C|pg||
nt|kareno: 6nt definitely safer.|pg||
nt|lestergold: quite easy to make no defence|pg||
nt|josj: rather a coffee hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|me argent: i like cleeffs 3@D bid|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 1@H and 1@S do make|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but 2@H bid likely|pg||
mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|lestergold: indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: and, in a sort of bonus, system right handed no trumps, so they will get there i guess|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|nt|kit: hard to fault the 3NT call, but it works out very badly|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c5|nt|ritong: ecco|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|kareno: Good auction and it is, as Henri points out, right-sided.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ritong: ugly board for greco hampson, although robson did not leave them alone|pg||
nt|kit: pretty hard to imagine wrong-siding it|pg||
pc|h5|pc|c6|pc|hT|pg||
nt|me argent: this will be very tough to make a defensive revoke would help|pg||
nt|xenya: put EW on the spot -- a point for AC|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|nt|kit: in other room North bid only 2@D, and that gave E-W a chance to escape|pg||
nt|me argent: so cleefs approach helped win the board 4 NS|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ritong: right sided means " i am declarer" for jansma:)|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 2@S-1 discarding @C|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kareno: lol|pg||
nt|kit: I think opposite a strong 1@C opening the East hand should just drive it to slam|pg||
nt|ritong: who, by the way, is a super nice guy and does not deserve dubious jokes like that one  sorry, jan|pg||
nt|kareno: I agree, Kit - I think Greco dogged it.|pg||
nt|kareno: Do we have any update on positions?  |pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Next up is Becker vs Polowan|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Standings are posted 1 round behind, so nothing since the 1st session|pg||
nt|kareno: I believe standings after the half would be posted at www.acbl.org, no?|pg||
nt|kareno: Also specs asking for any updates on the NA Swiss.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|nt|Vugraphu2: Jan says hello to all his friends out there :)|pg||
nt|me argent: personally i also would have bid 3nt on this auction with mecks hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Meant Jan Van Cleef. Jan Martel is operating VG in the OR|pg||
nt|me argent: give jon @H@H from me|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: We aren't displaying team names because the match-ups change every 3 boards|pg||

mb|p|nt|Vugraphu2: http://www.acbl.org/nabc/recaps/2009/03/6/|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: east in the tank|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm thinking that could end the auction.... but ... east has other ideas.|pg||
nt|kareno: At some point n/s could start applying their hob-nailed boots here :)|pg||
nt|kit: East doesn't know his partner is 5-5 -- 2@D looks pretty reasonable to me|pg||
nt|kareno: e/w headed for a minus for sure.|pg||

nt|josj: should make a disciplined pass|pg||

pc|h6|nt|kareno: Feldman to the rescue|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||

nt|ritong: if i were brogeland, i would hate the entire hand|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|me argent: not a big fan of opening 1NT at any excuse|pg||
nt|kit: The good news for declarer is that he starts out knowing the exact enemy distribution (or at least should)|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pg||
nt|kit: West would never have bid 2@H with a doubleton diamond|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|pc|dQ|pc|dT|pg||
nt|kit: if your partnership is going to open 1NTwith a hand such as South hand, it helps to have methods which can locate a 5-card major|pg||

nt|kareno: This result may not matter as I am told e/w are in 3@s doubled in the OR|pg||

nt|ritong: 3@s EW is rather ambitious|pg||

nt|ritong: he knows that a @c is ruffable from the short trump hand|pg||
nt|kit: this might be some kind of slam try -- but maybe he means as offer to play|pg||

nt|kareno: Deep position for sure.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: and they pulled up the screen before it was noticed.  Director at the table to sort this out.|pg||
nt|ritong: sheesh|pg||
nt|kareno: North has no particular lead advantage in notrump.|pg||

mc|10|nt|kit: anybody have any idea what the rules are here|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, but too long to explain|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Q is led card, 2 is penalty, must be played at 1st legal opportunity.|pg||
nt|ritong: roughly there are three options|pg||

nt|kareno: Perhaps when west is in with the club he can shift to a trump!!|pg||
nt|kit: The defense will have to cash out, but hard to see why they wouldn't.|pg||
nt|kit: If East wins 3 spades and shifts to a club, West will have a club back in 2 seconds|pg||

nt|Vugraphu2: I raised my pd to 4 with a void a couple of nights ago.  But I had 19 HCP!|pg||
nt|kit: effective lead by North, setting up quick heart trick and giving declarer a problem -- should he use his entry for a spade play, or should he go after clubs?|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|kit: I think he will go after clubs, although on the lie of the cards a spade play is more successful|pg||
nt|kareno: Certainly a reasonable bid.  Six makes with the club position AND the heart finesse.|pg||
nt|kit: 4@S not such a bad opening bid IMO -- even if you have a good slam, will you really be able to find it?|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|2C|nt|lestergold: N/S have an opportunity to overbid here to a less than 50% spade game which here is zero percent due to the 4/1 break|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ends probably in 3@H C or 2@H+1|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahri: is there a link to standings, please, karen?|pg||
nt|kit: South invites, and North will certainly bid game with the good 5-card suit|pg||
nt|josj: plus a chance of gettign X'ed|pg||
nt|lestergold: no danger of that|pg||
nt|mdgraham: what's wrong with 2@S from North?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: three trumps to the ace and a side doubleton|pg||
nt|josj: good question|pg||
nt|lestergold: i know that north cant envisage a game but are they not playing 5 card majors in which case a defensive raise to 2S would be mandatory|pg||
nt|jaapfr: depends if @C@C in trouble|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3x|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|josj: they are but 1@S is limited |pg||
nt|jaapfr: 2@H safe anyway|pg||
pc|c7|nt|josj: which is of relative relevance only|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kit: some kind of artificiality there -- maybe 2@S was a size ask and 3@C showed a maximum?|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm not aware if there is unless it is on ACBL's home page www.acbl.org  I'm getting updates from specs.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: 2@S and 3@C were alerted|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kit: 3NT a fair contract, but will not make on lie of cards -- would have stopped with 15-17 1NT opening|pg||
nt|me argent: south opened 1nt in OR and is playing there|pg||
nt|kit: Club lead seems pretty normal from East hand -- don't want to lead from any other holding.  And quite effective here.|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, it is their best.|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS are strong club - not sure about 5cM, but it is usual to do that in a strong club system|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|nt|kit: Declarer will play low in case East has led from QJ|pg||
pc|d4|nt|josj: sure 5cM|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|kit: due to limited entries to dummy, declarer will have to give up on diamond finesse I think|pg||
nt|kit: declarer ducked heart, playing West for QJ9xx -- would have been wrong if West had ace of hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: so north should have raised to 2S - they shouldnt be defending 1N whichshould be ioff but has been let thru|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@S makes the opponents come in at the three level if they wish to compete|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d9|nt|kit: now declarer knows hearts likely 4-4|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|pg||
nt|kit: and will duck in hand, as he wants to win club in dummy for diamond finesse|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|ritong: so this board, which likely will be played in 3 NT both rooms, unless south passes 1 NT, is a matter of undertricks|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kit: this is not clear play, particularly since now he has to make uncomfortable discard|pg||
nt|josj: that's the obvious reason to raise anyway|pg||
pc|cA|nt|gowdy: or if garbage stayman  2 @S|pg||
nt|josj: even more so at this vul.|pg||
nt|lestergold: North not in aqgain to lead club thru so declarer has time to establish heart or bve given 7th trick in clubs|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: North seems a little timid she failed to double the horrific 4H bid earlier on and now she has passed when she was dealt a raise|pg||
nt|josj: at least she's acting consequently|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|jaapfr: in real life is or lose @HJ or @C9 same result|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|nt|kit: will put in queen of clubs, so if finesse loses at least he has a second dummy entry|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|lestergold: do you mean consistently Jos?|pg||
mc|8|nt|kit: Good card reading by East -- he wants his partner to win the 4th round of clubs, and knows if he leads the 4 his parter may play the queen|pg||

nt|josj: and here is a game swing on a partscore hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: doubling the opponents into game is quite important, too|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|lestergold: we see that in the open west got the needle stuck in the doubling groove|pg||
mb|2H|nt|josj: after E opened, like he did here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I must admit that I don't blame him at all|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|mdgraham: he has what looks like four tricks facing an opening bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: 5@D would be very lucky here|pg||
mb|4S|nt|kit: avoiding the ever-popular 1NT opening with a 5-card major|pg||
nt|kareno: If Hamman finds a takeout double, Zia will bid a lot.|pg||
nt|lestergold: yep I think im with you Mike hard to believe that xmas hasnt come unfortunately it was xmas for n/s|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: for EW it's just next week :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and once you have doubled 2@C for penalty, it's kind of heard not to double 3@C  |pg||
nt|josj: as N introduced the @C first, things may well change|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u im notm con vinced 3C should have made here|pg||
nt|josj: if E returns a trump at any time, 3@C is certainly off|pg||
nt|lestergold: rofl|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, but there isa problem with that|pg||
nt|lestergold: i wonder what that is Mike|pg||
nt|josj: for W it's not so easy to defeat it on  his(her) own|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, me too :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphu2: yes, I got the last few tricks wrong, but result is correct|pg||
nt|kit: 6@S is reasonable here, but the bad splits will doom it|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Now we have Shugart vs Diamond, Robson-Shugart NS Greco-Hampson EW|pg||
nt|kit: This gives South a problem -- bid 2NT with xxx of clubs, bid that weak heart suit again, or raise 2nd suit on 3?|pg||
nt|kit: or bid 3@C, saying none of the above|pg||
nt|ritong: he does not need that:)|pg||
nt|gowdy: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well at kleast 2C doubled doesnt give game!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's often the case, though - partner is dying for you to lead a trump, and you can't|pg||
pc|c3|nt|me argent: i dislike least 3@Hs|pg||
nt|kit: I would bid 3@C -- don't tell a lie if you don't have to|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Standings: Nickell 8.55, Delmonte 8.45, Kwiecen 6.00 Spector 5.70 Kendrick 5.61, Polowan 5.38|pg||
nt|kit: the 3@S call will definitely get them to slam -- here comes RKC|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Shugart 5.27, Becker 4.68, Greenberg 4.61, Diamond 2.02|pg||
nt|xenya: i think 6@S is a bit of a stretch as you apart from @S 3-2 you also need some luck in the reds|pg||
nt|kit: Hamman passes so South can declare I think|pg||
nt|kareno: Obviously.  Hamman lurking in the bushes with his diamonds :)|pg||
nt|josj: so a very good X by Giovani then :)|pg||
nt|po-s: I suppose there must be a limit to trust|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@S equally lucky imo|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|jaapfr: must find @DQJ|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kit: Well he was right -- maybe he didn't think his partner had 4 spades|pg||
pc|c7|nt|kit: now the tough decision -- and he chose well to sell out|pg||
nt|josj: E apparently thought p held S's trumps as well|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kareno: Backward heart finesse needed to make this.|pg||
nt|kit: this will be a costly lead if declarer guesses the hearts -- and declarer might -- has to guess whether to play South for Qx or 10x.|pg||
nt|kit: South will be marked with doubleton heart on the auction.|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a less than 20% game this is but why  fight with success:)?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|nt|gowdy: or stiff|pg||
nt|kit: And since South didn't open, I think declarer will get it right.|pg||
nt|mrace: makes 11 tricks if guesses @H now |pg||
nt|ritong: not my point to cantradict big bob, but suspecting zia to overcall on @d xxxxx is not er...reasonable|pg||
nt|ritong: so he must have some other good reason not to lead @d ace|pg||
nt|kit: I really think North should have led a minor -- Qxx of hearts when partner has the minors means cashout time to me.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jaapfr: but IF later @DA first than -1|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i think this will go -1 after long thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: I think not needed find @DQ|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|josj: defending doubled partscores with no trumps does not appeal to me|pg||
nt|po-s: is this a form of striped tail double?|pg||
nt|josj: advanced, yes PO|pg||
nt|lestergold: and now the sinking feeling for weest as the second dim gets ruffed|pg||
nt|josj: hej PO :)|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hJ|nt|kit: moment of truth now|pg||
nt|josj: or is it anticipated?|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|pg||
nt|kit: what????|pg||
nt|jaapfr: not now:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but amazed N keeps attacking @H with bidding in mind:(|pg||
pc|h3|nt|me argent: north did well 2 avoid slam on this auction|pg||
nt|kit: opening lead was costly -- lets declarer just draw trump, pitch the club on ace of hearts, and make 6|pg||
nt|mrace: interesting|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kareno: I hear you Kit and I agree.  But now they should cash and tuck west in with his club queen for no decision... yet.|pg||
nt|kit: this is just a bad play -- there is no end-play possible, so what can he hope to gain?|pg||
nt|ahri: i guess he believes that making it willl be sufficient, and if south has quite many honors he'll play north for queen of hearts|pg||
pc|s9|pc|hT|pg||
nt|xenya: of course, once EW have failed to cash their ace slam becomes a fair proposition |pg||
nt|mrace: just a lille more info about how to play @Hs i guess, bailed out from extras|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|sK|nt|kit: And the ping-pong battle continues|pg||
nt|gowdy: playing N for all the H|pg||
nt|kit: Now declarer can only make 4 on right heart guess -- surely North should have led a club|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: slam time|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|nt|me argent: pass by SOUTH A TAD CONERVATIVE AFTER NOT OPENING THE BIDDING|pg||

nt|kit: yes, trump lead, and apparently declrarer just went right in hearts.|pg||
nt|josj: this may end up in 7 now...|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: conservative whether passed hand or not|pg||
nt|kit: not my idea of how to win at BAM (or any other form of scoring)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: or do they give at the table an explanation?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ritong: good hand for a gazzilli|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|josj: E expecting at least 7 hearts|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ritong: not really needed here since south has a lot|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4H in some ways too'good to bid in front of pard very heavy in 'controls- somewhat off centre|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh|pg||
nt|josj: a possibly revealing lead...|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ritong: gazzilli is a 2@c rebid by opener indicating a good hand|pg||
nt|kit: pretty easy to get to 4@H with any sensible methods -- now the question is how many tricks can he take|pg||
nt|kit: With the strong hearts in North hand, the natural play appears to be to set up the spades immediately|pg||
nt|kareno: Setting up declarer'|pg||
pc|c3|nt|me argent: since NS in OR playing 3@Ss @D team should win the bd|pg||
nt|kit: tough problem for declarer here -- would North underlead ace of spades with club danger staring him in face|pg||
nt|kareno: declarer's hand looks right but won't work this time.|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ritong: why?|pg||

pc|h6|pc|h2|pc|hT|pg||
nt|lestergold: well makeable maybe double dummy|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|hA|nt|ritong: the long @s will not be good, but he can ruff some of them nonetheless|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|kit: now trick comes back -- if declarer believes king of clubs was honest -- I think he will|pg||
nt|lestergold: but why should declarer prefer spade finesse to club finesse|pg||
nt|po-s: dummy squeezed|pg||
nt|lestergold: certainly whatever result i withdraw remark about flat board|pg||
nt|po-s: should perhaps have stayed in dummy and ruffed AKx in pades|pg||
nt|po-s: now it seems D discards are best|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kareno: Once spades don't work, cross ruff will prove good as long as declarer gets diamonds cashed before east can pitch two of them.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s2|nt|kit: he can ruff a lot of them -- if he times it right, might come to 12 tricks|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|c2|pc|s6|nt|mrace: can actually take a lot by xruff , with @ds behaving |pg||
nt|po-s: good|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|nt|kareno: Board 6 is a late play, folks, we can't show a score for it.|pg||

mb|3C|nt|kit: Assuming West sits, and I can't see why he wouldn't|pg||
nt|ritong: lindqvist has an opinion to propose|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, no reason for west to remove the double.|pg||
mb|d|nt|mdgraham: South has lots of entries to give North club ruffs |pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: all very reasonable but 9 tricks are available here|pg||
nt|ritong: a classical " periscope" lead|pg||

nt|kareno: Both north/south pairs will think they've lost that board :)|pg||
nt|ritong: they at least suppose they did not win it|pg||
nt|kareno: In that they are both correct :)|pg||
nt|kit: they sure were off by quite a bit -- 4@S isn't close|pg||
nt|mrace: i watched Hamman and Zia practicing BAM in bbo previous recent weeks, they are too agressive at low level and tend to leave opponents after first shock...not at his board.|pg||
nt|kareno: I assume we still do not have any running scores, do we?|pg||
nt|kit: I don't like the 5@H call -- he has a lot of trumps, but so what?|pg||
nt|kareno: Too many losers.  Caught up in the heat of the auction.|pg||
nt|ritong: what would you pick at barbu with zia shand, kit?|pg||
nt|kareno: I pick last 2 tricks :)|pg||
nt|ritong: pff:) small player:)|pg||
nt|mrace: haha|pg||
nt|mrace: i wld go for trumps :) |pg||
nt|kareno: By the way, Henri, I am the one who actually brought Barbu to the US after my year and a half playing it in Paris :)|pg||
nt|kit: anything which I thought I could get doubled in Henri|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|kareno: That was in 1965!!|pg||

nt|ritong: i should have precised: first hand|pg||
nt|ritong: oh yeah!|pg||
nt|ritong: it is marvellous|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: After 9 bds, Nickell leading Delmonte by 1.6 boards|pg||
nt|kit: and probably more after last round|pg||
nt|kareno: Did you know it was played at the Club Elysee in Paris, Henri?  |pg||
nt|mrace: we call it "KING" in Turkey , and "Bloody King " where u pick b4 u see ur hand |pg||
nt|ritong: yes, naturally:)|pg||
nt|kareno: And for stakes :)|pg||
nt|ritong: although i mostly was in BCP or albarran clubs|pg||
