pc|s9|nt|reisig: -100 in same spot in other room|pg||
nt|gowdy: if the K denies the A  he may find it|pg||

nt|ritong: this is not clearcut, by far|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no real alternative to the club finesse - playing for singleton K offside is anti-percentage|pg||

mb|p|nt|josj: all four players at this table have been in and out of the national team of Indonesia over the years|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: 8@Ss played by EW final contract OR|pg||
nt|kit: normal 4@H contract, but it may matter where declarer first plays the hearts from if a spade lead, as there is danger of the 10 of hearts scoring on  promotion|pg||
nt|ritong: was a decision:)|pg||
nt|josj: this definitely looks like a slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: OK ty|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|nt|xenya: 4@H 1 down, so is 3@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: slam as cards lie with hts btreaking 3/3 but not a good slam|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kit: 3@H looks very conservative -- was devaluing his spade and diamond holdings -- but that can be overdone|pg||
nt|josj: NS play 2/1 GF|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|kareno: Hello from not-so-sunny Las Vegas :)|pg||

pc|c6|nt|vugraphzbq: yes|pg||
pc|cK|nt|josj: ty Adi :)|pg||

pc|c9|pg||

nt|josj: that's why S should have started showing them|pg||
pc|sK|nt|xenya: sorry 3@S 2 off|pg||
nt|lestergold: North has a move on south's bidding|pg||
nt|xenya: from shortest|pg||
pc|s8|nt|me argent: think south a little timid here|pg||
nt|me argent: i like double over 3@Ss|pg||
nt|xenya: and 4@H makes -- doubly sorry|pg||

nt|sybarra: cliam coming up |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS strong club, so 3@D doesn't carry the same "extra values" overtones as in a natiral system|pg||
pc|c3|nt|gowdy: no way|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: 3@D = @S raise with @D|pg||
nt|reisig: BAM is brutal at times|pg||
nt|kit: if he things the lead is a singleton, he could easily get this wrong|pg||
nt|josj: yes but it can be made DD for sure|pg||
pc|c5|nt|xenya: oh yews|pg||
nt|xenya: yes*|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|ritong: no|pg||
nt|gowdy: whew|pg||
nt|kareno: Surviving that hurdle.|pg||
nt|ritong: because west would have hopped trump ace to give the ruff|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hT|nt|lestergold: sure but 4c cue is pretty encouraging and north holds the dim control the nut cards in the majors - worth a move surely?|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Kit Woolsey|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Kit|pg||
nt|ritong: so, he could get this wrong, but not easily:)|pg||
nt|gowdy: no the key was not losing to k 10|pg||
nt|lestergold: but it was on and it may well be bid in the open room|pg||
nt|josj: easy to get a little too high and worthwhile too|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: so East should have won first round of hearts with, ace, not king, then.|pg||
nt|josj: this is a good Roland slam|pg||
nt|josj: trumps 2-2, @H 3-3...|pg||
nt|otoj: some may choose weak 2 with S's hand..|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: a question of which pair gets into trouble here|pg||
nt|kareno: mmm club slam I see|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, absolutely so|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|lestergold: looks like a reasonable 3N contract here for E/W|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|kit: 6NT clearly optimal here, not 6@C|pg||
nt|kareno: 6nt definitely safer.|pg||
nt|lestergold: quite easy to make no defence|pg||
nt|josj: rather a coffee hand|pg||
nt|josj: that's about what you need for 12 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: i might try that|pg||
mb|2S|nt|josj: heavy raise by E but quite right this time, with all his soft values|pg||
mb|3D|nt|me argent: i like cleeffs 3@D bid|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 1@H and 1@S do make|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but 2@H bid likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: non vul. anything goes|pg||
nt|josj: it might be difficult to get to 4@H now|pg||
nt|xenya: might have worked well here|pg||
mb|3H|nt|lestergold: indeed|pg||
nt|xenya: slightly better than Roland's as it also makes if @H 4-2 with the J doubleton|pg||
nt|josj: comes down to about 20%...|pg||
nt|josj: sure, I took that into account :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: and, in a sort of bonus, system right handed no trumps, so they will get there i guess|pg||
nt|josj: Roland's requirements are 12.89%|pg||
nt|sybarra: and a 4333 hand |pg||
nt|josj: wd by W|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: hard to fault the 3NT call, but it works out very badly|pg||
nt|josj: or less...|pg||
nt|josj: now E will bid one for the road|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|ritong: ecco|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Good auction and it is, as Henri points out, right-sided.|pg||
mb|d|nt|ritong: ugly board for greco hampson, although robson did not leave them alone|pg||
nt|kit: pretty hard to imagine wrong-siding it|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|me argent: this will be very tough to make a defensive revoke would help|pg||
nt|xenya: put EW on the spot -- a point for AC|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|josj: good save|pg||
nt|otoj: will you go with @sK if S play small @s from hand?|pg||
nt|josj: 300 is about par for the hand|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kit: in other room North bid only 2@D, and that gave E-W a chance to escape|pg||
nt|me argent: so cleefs approach helped win the board 4 NS|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ritong: right sided means " i am declarer" for jansma:)|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 2@S-1 discarding @C|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kareno: lol|pg||
nt|kit: I think opposite a strong 1@C opening the East hand should just drive it to slam|pg||
nt|ritong: who, by the way, is a super nice guy and does not deserve dubious jokes like that one  sorry, jan|pg||
nt|kareno: I agree, Kit - I think Greco dogged it.|pg||
nt|kareno: Do we have any update on positions?  |pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Next up is Becker vs Polowan|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Standings are posted 1 round behind, so nothing since the 1st session|pg||

nt|xenya: ah|pg||
nt|josj: the big volume on suit combinations|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|ritong: but he might consider playing higher than four|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: max 4m C by EW here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kit: bidding test here -- 7@C clearly best at IMPs, but at BAM not so clear|pg||
nt|kareno: Surely not a forcing raise - mini splinter perhaps?|pg||
nt|kit: Jason or Mark -- Jason I think|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|kit: 7NT quite reasonable, but on lie of cards (spade hook off, squeeze not working) it goes down|pg||
nt|me argent: this hand should test EWs bidding methods|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@D and 4@C do make|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps he was sure spades were 3-1 as E didn't win 1st spade but who knows?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|kit: they might play limit raise or better for the 2NT call|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Jason|pg||
nt|xenya: worth reading i suppose? Must be quite boring though... |pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: and to make 2@H need a crystall ball:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: 3@S probably some kind of minor-suit Stayman|pg||
nt|ritong: hm hm hmm...|pg||
nt|ritong: he knows that a @c is ruffable from the short trump hand|pg||
nt|kit: this might be some kind of slam try -- but maybe he means as offer to play|pg||
nt|ritong: so, 3 NT is a huge gambling imho|pg||

nt|Vugraphu2: there was no alert of 3n|pg||
nt|ahri: i take that bet|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: up until 2NT SAME AUCTION IN or|pg||

nt|ritong: hiya tommy|pg||
nt|ritong: hi john|pg||

nt|Vugraphu2: Both E and W just led|pg||
nt|kit: seems like a big position to pass 3NT unless he had already shown a stiff club with the 2NT call|pg||
nt|kareno: Deep position for sure.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: and they pulled up the screen before it was noticed.  Director at the table to sort this out.|pg||
nt|ritong: sheesh|pg||
nt|kareno: North has no particular lead advantage in notrump.|pg||
nt|kit: probably won't matter -- likely they both led a club|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: E led @D2, W led @DQ, both led face up.|pg||
nt|ritong: lol!|pg||
nt|kit: shows how much I know|pg||
nt|gowdy: :)|pg||
nt|kareno: funny!.  |pg||
nt|kit: at least E-W were on the same page|pg||

pc|s2|nt|kit: anybody have any idea what the rules are here|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, but too long to explain|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Q is led card, 2 is penalty, must be played at 1st legal opportunity.|pg||
nt|ritong: roughly there are three options|pg||
nt|kareno: I know declarer has a bunch of choices, especially since east thought he was leading.  He can even allow south to declare!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: double....|pg||
nt|sybarra: n/s were probably at their limit in 2 @H |pg||
nt|josj: if only W could reach dummy to lead a @S...|pg||

nt|josj: yes it is. You shoud not read it but you have to know it :)|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|xenya: great|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: W is thinking....|pg||
nt|xenya: unless,,,|pg||
nt|kit: you would want to be in 7NT at this form of scoring (assuming some grand bid at other table), since it is at worst on spade hook|pg||
nt|xenya: W elects to convert to NT|pg||
nt|kit: I think at this point West will pass, as any grand may be thin from his point of view|pg||
nt|me argent: CANT STAND THE TENSION\|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Think how Lindqvist must feel!|pg||
nt|me argent: good biddings by EW inOR|pg||

nt|ritong: i wonder if one can inquire about leading conventions before making a decision:)|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: north has introduced this festering heart suit at the 4 level|pg||
nt|mdgraham: although I must admit, I don't agree with 4@H |pg||
nt|lestergold: north has heard paertner make a vulbnerable ovecall and a free bid of 3S but doesnt consider the opps are taking the absolute Mickey|pg||
nt|lestergold: I would be standing on the chair doubling|pg||
nt|josj: only 50 p. extra :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|josj: bt S has to attack dummy's entry now|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Vugraphu2: declarer wasn't given options, card that's supposed to be led is the led card.|pg||
nt|ahri: i lost the bet, well bid john :D|pg||
nt|kit: best defense is to duck, but I think declarer can work an end-play on West in that case|pg||
nt|ritong: you should not bet against gowdy, tom|pg||
nt|kareno: And the other card?  Forced to play it?|pg||
nt|ahri: now i learnt my lession|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|josj: time for @DK|pg||

nt|josj: if declarer plays @DJ, def. have no chance|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: yes, it's a penalty card|pg||
nt|xenya: S was lucky that E didn't have the @DQ|pg||
pc|sT|nt|kit: now if only declarer could run the hearts and end up in his hand West would be squeezed, but it can't happen|pg||

mb|p|nt|josj: they do|pg||

nt|sybarra: *her|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kit: Another 1NT with 5-card major|pg||

nt|jaapfr: here XX = SOS|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: but undoubled...|pg||
nt|xenya: true|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kareno: We are hearing that the unbeatable Lynch team is now in second place |pg||
nt|mdgraham: also it is convenient to bid both suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: I would have led a higher diamond -- no need to lead low with all those entries, and might lose to a jack-doubleton|pg||
nt|me argent: in OR north had methods over 1nt opening enabling his side to play 2@Cs|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: S finger @H 2|pg||
nt|kit: good philosophy -- when partner leads a suit vs. NT and you win the 10, your side has led the right suit|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Closed door to ask declarer if they open 1N with 5-card major|pg||
nt|lestergold: i wouldnt  personally - the hand looks like a stronmg club|pg||
nt|josj: -3 I guess|pg||
nt|sybarra: and no way anyone can say X |pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: good point kit|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like he has shown bith now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: situasi ini sulid sekali untuk S|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: so first imps to A but how many?|pg||
nt|josj: if N leads a @D, it will be interesting|pg||
nt|josj: N has two usefuls queens for declarer|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kit: declarer will have choice but to follow the rabbi's rule here, with no dummy entries|pg||
nt|otoj: 2Q's are behave nicely..|pg||
nt|josj: usefuls?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|josj: but with S on lead, it's easier|pg||
nt|xenya: this should make with careful play i think|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kareno: Unless e/w can manufacture a dummy entry for declarer, he's going to be forced to make this.|pg||
nt|kareno: Perhaps when west is in with the club he can shift to a trump!!|pg||
nt|kit: The defense will have to cash out, but hard to see why they wouldn't.|pg||
nt|kit: If East wins 3 spades and shifts to a club, West will have a club back in 2 seconds|pg||
nt|kit: from West's point of view, East might hold king of clubs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no strong feelings about it|pg||
pc|hA|pg||

nt|lestergold: best lead found|pg||

nt|vugraphzbq: I think 2@h is ....|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|nt|me argent: maybe south should have read your book on defence|pg||

nt|lestergold: even 4H may make as cards lie!|pg||
pc|c2|nt|josj: @HJ from N causes more worries|pg||

pc|h4|nt|roswolf: yup the 3-3 fit may play better|pg||

mb|p|nt|me argent: kit 4 those of you who dont know might have written the best book on defence ever written it certainly was best book on def i ever read|pg||
nt|kit: very heavy 3@S opening -- may lead to missed game|pg||
nt|me argent: i hate 3@Ss|pg||
nt|ritong: he might open 4@s|pg||
nt|lestergold: part score battle the minor suits|pg||
mb|1D|nt|xenya: was a lucky board for EW, but likely to be diplicated in the other room|pg||
mb|1N|nt|me argent: on this hand id rather pass and i hate that 2|pg||
nt|ritong: no, he s disciplined|pg||
nt|josj: maybe another push, that previous board? :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: could be |pg||
nt|josj: I think so|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: a solid 6@D C but will it be bid?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|josj: here N may get punished for his opening bid but he won't|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: maybge N/S not even getting into auction here|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: it's just their style it seems|pg||
nt|josj: Roland slam time|pg||
nt|sybarra: I will let him play these types of slam |pg||
nt|josj: but not in @H|pg||
nt|sybarra: this about 14%? or so?|pg||
nt|josj: he will make this one|pg||
nt|josj: played by N 6@S is quite good...needs trumps 3-2 and K onside, 34%?|pg||
nt|josj: and no immediate ruff|pg||
nt|josj: @H are 4-0 ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: apparently East can expect that strong a preempt, since he bid the game|pg||
nt|me argent: so it seems because one cannot argue with the final contract|pg||
nt|xenya: considering E had no difficulty raising to 4|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: I raised my pd to 4 with a void a couple of nights ago.  But I had 19 HCP!|pg||
nt|kit: effective lead by North, setting up quick heart trick and giving declarer a problem -- should he use his entry for a spade play, or should he go after clubs?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|kit: I think he will go after clubs, although on the lie of the cards a spade play is more successful|pg||
nt|kareno: Certainly a reasonable bid.  Six makes with the club position AND the heart finesse.|pg||
nt|kit: 4@S not such a bad opening bid IMO -- even if you have a good slam, will you really be able to find it?|pg||
nt|josj: longest & strongest or else...|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm 3N shouldnt make dim lead kills it immediately for exampkle|pg||
nt|mdgraham: didn't envisage this|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: gross overbidding|pg||
nt|josj: N is on lead so this does not apply...|pg||
nt|lestergold: ht lead good enough too|pg||
nt|josj: but with @HA wrong no chance...|pg||
nt|sybarra: in spades,  N could get a ht lead |pg||
nt|josj: no wild fantasies|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|jaapfr: now easy (nice 5@D:)|pg||
nt|josj: on  4 another big swing as Parpar's off-shape 1NT opening bid paid off|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|nt|Vugraphu2: Kwiecien: Whoah!|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lestergold: Mkike we ae not paid to envisage such absurdities|pg||
nt|lestergold: well we arent paid at all but dont tell anyone|pg||
nt|josj: when def. did not find the @H lead/switch in time|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|josj: declarer knows @CAQ are likely to be right and will play accordingly|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mdgraham: we are not paid at all, absurdities or not :(|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lestergold: we should form a commentator's union|pg||
nt|josj: well with @CK right there nearly are 9 tricks :)|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer will have to not go wrong in clubs to make 12 tricks|pg||
nt|gowdy: and the club position will be clear ak @D and the @H K in south|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: And again when declarer played @SA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, we should not be too unkind. It is quite hard to reproduce your best form on Vugraph - I should know|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: well on a dim lead the contract would be off even with clubs coming in for no losers which missing KJxx is rather against theodds|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sybarra: in the other room on bd 2, the long @H hand drove it to slam |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h3|nt|josj: so it's less absurd than it should be|pg||
pc|dT|nt|josj: the OR is catching up|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|xenya: making 10 it seems|pg||
pc|c9|nt|josj: that's why we lose board 7 temporarily|pg||
pc|c7|nt|kareno: Split honors works from dummy with two heart entries (south can block a third heart entry)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|lestergold: its a very bad shot lets face it once in a blue moon players get away with these contracts|pg||
nt|josj: definitely|pg||
nt|josj: yes but S rebid 2NT which shows doubleton @H|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|kit: not 100% clear, but yes, odds are North has king of clubs from South's silence -- still, what bid could South have made?|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a bad shot because of the lack of major suit fast tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes and something outside of spade suit |pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|cT|pc|c5|pg||
nt|xenya: making 11|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s4|pc|h7|nt|kit: ruffing with queen of spades feels more natural, but maybe not with declarer about to take a pitch anyway|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|josj: sure so one more try was OK|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|nt|kit: well, declarer chose to play North for one of the club honors -- reasonable enough|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|lestergold: N/S have an opportunity to overbid here to a less than 50% spade game which here is zero percent due to the 4/1 break|pg||

nt|josj: strong club here|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|ahri: is there a link to standings, please, karen?|pg||
nt|kit: South invites, and North will certainly bid game with the good 5-card suit|pg||
nt|josj: plus a chance of gettign X'ed|pg||
nt|lestergold: no danger of that|pg||
nt|mdgraham: what's wrong with 2@S from North?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: three trumps to the ace and a side doubleton|pg||
nt|josj: good question|pg||
nt|lestergold: i know that north cant envisage a game but are they not playing 5 card majors in which case a defensive raise to 2S would be mandatory|pg||
nt|jaapfr: depends if @C@C in trouble|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3x|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|josj: a normal contract but it looks a bit doomed|pg||
nt|xenya: a somewhat thin contract|pg||
nt|josj: with the strange @C block, 3NT might make...|pg||
nt|josj: but EW found their nice save, vul. v. not|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: they are but 1@S is limited |pg||
nt|jaapfr: 2@H safe anyway|pg||
mb|3H|nt|josj: which is of relative relevance only|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: some kind of artificiality there -- maybe 2@S was a size ask and 3@C showed a maximum?|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm not aware if there is unless it is on ACBL's home page www.acbl.org  I'm getting updates from specs.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: 2@S and 3@C were alerted|pg||
nt|josj: with @HQ doubleton, 4M makes|pg||
mb|4H|nt|kit: 3NT a fair contract, but will not make on lie of cards -- would have stopped with 15-17 1NT opening|pg||
nt|me argent: south opened 1nt in OR and is playing there|pg||
nt|kit: Club lead seems pretty normal from East hand -- don't want to lead from any other holding.  And quite effective here.|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, it is their best.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: NS are strong club - not sure about 5cM, but it is usual to do that in a strong club system|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Declarer will play low in case East has led from QJ|pg||
pc|cA|nt|josj: sure 5cM|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kit: due to limited entries to dummy, declarer will have to give up on diamond finesse I think|pg||
nt|kit: declarer ducked heart, playing West for QJ9xx -- would have been wrong if West had ace of hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: so north should have raised to 2S - they shouldnt be defending 1N whichshould be ioff but has been let thru|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@S makes the opponents come in at the three level if they wish to compete|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|kit: now declarer knows hearts likely 4-4|pg||
nt|xenya: in practice, however, this may go down|pg||
nt|josj: yes as you may try to get to dummy with @HJ for the @D finesse|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|kit: and will duck in hand, as he wants to win club in dummy for diamond finesse|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
nt|ritong: so this board, which likely will be played in 3 NT both rooms, unless south passes 1 NT, is a matter of undertricks|pg||
nt|xenya: exactly|pg||
pc|s8|nt|josj: N ruffs from the natural trump trick|pg||
pc|s4|nt|josj: biut a low spade now is nasty|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kit: this is not clear play, particularly since now he has to make uncomfortable discard|pg||
nt|josj: that's the obvious reason to raise anyway|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|gowdy: or if garbage stayman  2 @S|pg||
nt|josj: even more so at this vul.|pg||
nt|lestergold: North not in aqgain to lead club thru so declarer has time to establish heart or bve given 7th trick in clubs|pg||
nt|josj: now you can't afford it as you will get a @S ruff :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: North seems a little timid she failed to double the horrific 4H bid earlier on and now she has passed when she was dealt a raise|pg||
nt|josj: at least she's acting consequently|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jaapfr: in real life is or lose @HJ or @C9 same result|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|pg||
nt|kit: will put in queen of clubs, so if finesse loses at least he has a second dummy entry|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|nt|lestergold: do you mean consistently Jos?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kit: Good card reading by East -- he wants his partner to win the 4th round of clubs, and knows if he leads the 4 his parter may play the queen|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|xenya: bingo|pg||
pc|h3|nt|josj: yes I do sry|pg||
nt|josj: settling for a quiet -1 |pg||
pc|hT|nt|xenya: this can't be real|pg||

nt|josj: and here is a game swing on a partscore hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: doubling the opponents into game is quite important, too|pg||
nt|josj: then a trump will come next if N returns a @D to the 10 and Q, who knows?|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, murky|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: N said success finest @D +1, fail =|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: might be difficult to stay out of game here for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: we see that in the open west got the needle stuck in the doubling groove|pg||
nt|josj: easiest way of claiming :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: after E opened, like he did here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I must admit that I don't blame him at all|pg||
nt|josj: sort of optional claim, I like that...|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: he has what looks like four tricks facing an opening bid|pg||
nt|josj: trf to @H|pg||
mb|2C|nt|jaapfr: 5@D would be very lucky here|pg||
nt|josj: now it's easy...|pg||
nt|sybarra: another constructive raise by E |pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: avoiding the ever-popular 1NT opening with a 5-card major|pg||
nt|kareno: If Hamman finds a takeout double, Zia will bid a lot.|pg||
nt|lestergold: yep I think im with you Mike hard to believe that xmas hasnt come unfortunately it was xmas for n/s|pg||
mb|2S|nt|josj: for EW it's just next week :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and once you have doubled 2@C for penalty, it's kind of heard not to double 3@C  |pg||
nt|josj: as N introduced the @C first, things may well change|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u im notm con vinced 3C should have made here|pg||
nt|josj: if E returns a trump at any time, 3@C is certainly off|pg||
nt|lestergold: rofl|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, but there isa problem with that|pg||
nt|lestergold: i wonder what that is Mike|pg||
nt|josj: for W it's not so easy to defeat it on  his(her) own|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, me too :)|pg||
nt|josj: modern approach: 8-10 and 3-crd support|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphu2: yes, I got the last few tricks wrong, but result is correct|pg||
nt|kit: 6@S is reasonable here, but the bad splits will doom it|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Now we have Shugart vs Diamond, Robson-Shugart NS Greco-Hampson EW|pg||
nt|kit: This gives South a problem -- bid 2NT with xxx of clubs, bid that weak heart suit again, or raise 2nd suit on 3?|pg||
nt|kit: or bid 3@C, saying none of the above|pg||
nt|ritong: he does not need that:)|pg||
nt|gowdy: :)|pg||
nt|josj: well judges opposite 3rd hand opening|pg||
nt|josj: judged|pg||
mb|2N|nt|lestergold: well at kleast 2C doubled doesnt give game!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's often the case, though - partner is dying for you to lead a trump, and you can't|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: i dislike least 3@Hs|pg||
nt|kit: I would bid 3@C -- don't tell a lie if you don't have to|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Standings: Nickell 8.55, Delmonte 8.45, Kwiecen 6.00 Spector 5.70 Kendrick 5.61, Polowan 5.38|pg||
nt|kit: the 3@S call will definitely get them to slam -- here comes RKC|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Shugart 5.27, Becker 4.68, Greenberg 4.61, Diamond 2.02|pg||
nt|xenya: i think 6@S is a bit of a stretch as you apart from @S 3-2 you also need some luck in the reds|pg||
nt|kit: Hamman passes so South can declare I think|pg||
nt|kareno: Obviously.  Hamman lurking in the bushes with his diamonds :)|pg||
nt|josj: so a very good X by Giovani then :)|pg||
nt|po-s: I suppose there must be a limit to trust|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@S equally lucky imo|pg||
nt|josj: this should be a simple 3nt|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|josj: might be difficult to defeat this...|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: must find @DQJ|pg||
nt|sybarra: given the other table's previous bidding  (see bd 3)....they might be in game|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Well he was right -- maybe he didn't think his partner had 4 spades|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kit: now the tough decision -- and he chose well to sell out|pg||
nt|josj: E apparently thought p held S's trumps as well|pg||
nt|josj: many overtricks now|pg||
nt|josj: if declarer unblocks @D9|pg||
pc|d9|nt|kareno: Backward heart finesse needed to make this.|pg||
nt|kit: this will be a costly lead if declarer guesses the hearts -- and declarer might -- has to guess whether to play South for Qx or 10x.|pg||
nt|kit: South will be marked with doubleton heart on the auction.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jaapfr: a less than 20% game this is but why  fight with success:)?|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|d8|nt|gowdy: or stiff|pg||
nt|kit: And since South didn't open, I think declarer will get it right.|pg||
nt|mrace: makes 11 tricks if guesses @H now |pg||
nt|ritong: not my point to cantradict big bob, but suspecting zia to overcall on @d xxxxx is not er...reasonable|pg||
nt|ritong: so he must have some other good reason not to lead @d ace|pg||
nt|kit: I really think North should have led a minor -- Qxx of hearts when partner has the minors means cashout time to me.|pg||
nt|josj: maybe they learned their lesson on  3 :) :(|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jaapfr: but IF later @DA first than -1|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i think this will go -1 after long thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: I think not needed find @DQ|pg||
pc|d7|nt|josj: defending doubled partscores with no trumps does not appeal to me|pg||
nt|po-s: is this a form of striped tail double?|pg||
nt|josj: advanced, yes PO|pg||
nt|lestergold: and now the sinking feeling for weest as the second dim gets ruffed|pg||
nt|josj: hej PO :)|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kit: moment of truth now|pg||
nt|josj: or is it anticipated?|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|nt|kit: what????|pg||
nt|jaapfr: not now:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but amazed N keeps attacking @H with bidding in mind:(|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|me argent: north did well 2 avoid slam on this auction|pg||
nt|kit: opening lead was costly -- lets declarer just draw trump, pitch the club on ace of hearts, and make 6|pg||
nt|mrace: interesting|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kareno: I hear you Kit and I agree.  But now they should cash and tuck west in with his club queen for no decision... yet.|pg||
nt|kit: this is just a bad play -- there is no end-play possible, so what can he hope to gain?|pg||
nt|ahri: i guess he believes that making it willl be sufficient, and if south has quite many honors he'll play north for queen of hearts|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|xenya: of course, once EW have failed to cash their ace slam becomes a fair proposition |pg||
nt|mrace: just a lille more info about how to play @Hs i guess, bailed out from extras|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|nt|kit: And the ping-pong battle continues|pg||
nt|gowdy: playing N for all the H|pg||
nt|kit: Now declarer can only make 4 on right heart guess -- surely North should have led a club|pg||
pc|hA|nt|josj: OK next|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
mc|11|nt|kit: Declarer can't have AQ, or Zia would have shifted to a club|pg||
nt|xenya: was it 11 or 10?|pg||
nt|josj: 11, apparently|pg||
nt|xenya: looked like 10 to me|pg||

nt|jaapfr: or do they give at the table an explanation?|pg||
nt|josj: 4@D makes in EW and maybe 5@D on a @S lead|pg||

nt|xenya: oh|pg||
nt|jaapfr: nah tim A can still win easily due to first  3 boards in open :)|pg||
nt|josj: but tactically well done by E|pg||
mb|4N|nt|ritong: not really needed here since south has a lot|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4H in some ways too'good to bid in front of pard very heavy in 'controls- somewhat off centre|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh|pg||
nt|josj: a possibly revealing lead...|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: declarer claim|pg||
nt|otoj: board 5..Syabas gain 11 imps out of nothing.. due to West bid @S twice with 6xxx|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: gazzilli is a 2@c rebid by opener indicating a good hand|pg||
nt|kit: pretty easy to get to 4@H with any sensible methods -- now the question is how many tricks can he take|pg||
nt|kit: With the strong hearts in North hand, the natural play appears to be to set up the spades immediately|pg||
nt|kareno: Setting up declarer'|pg||
mb|5C|nt|me argent: since NS in OR playing 3@Ss @D team should win the bd|pg||
nt|kit: tough problem for declarer here -- would North underlead ace of spades with club danger staring him in face|pg||
nt|kareno: declarer's hand looks right but won't work this time.|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: I wonder if Lusje gets over this lead hurdle|pg||
nt|xenya: very odd indeed|pg||
mb|6D|nt|ritong: why?|pg||
nt|kareno: In the open room they are in six.|pg||
nt|josj: @D ruff now....|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: either ace works|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: well makeable maybe double dummy|pg||
nt|josj: needs @SA lead...|pg||
nt|xenya: very tough|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: thinking....|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|josj: still awkward as declarer cannot touch @S before drawing trumps|pg||
nt|xenya: he hasn't made it yet|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|ritong: the long @s will not be good, but he can ruff some of them nonetheless|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|kit: now trick comes back -- if declarer believes king of clubs was honest -- I think he will|pg||
nt|lestergold: but why should declarer prefer spade finesse to club finesse|pg||
nt|po-s: dummy squeezed|pg||
nt|lestergold: certainly whatever result i withdraw remark about flat board|pg||
nt|po-s: should perhaps have stayed in dummy and ruffed AKx in pades|pg||
nt|po-s: now it seems D discards are best|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kareno: Once spades don't work, cross ruff will prove good as long as declarer gets diamonds cashed before east can pitch two of them.|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|nt|kit: he can ruff a lot of them -- if he times it right, might come to 12 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: right -- suppose he draws trumps, then what about spades?|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|xenya: so he starts on his long suit first|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|nt|mrace: can actually take a lot by xruff , with @ds behaving |pg||
nt|po-s: good|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|kit: if East pitches diamond, will be key for declarer to cash diamond before trying to ruff another spade|pg||

nt|sybarra: think likely to hear 3 @H from S |pg||
mb|4D|nt|josj: about 2 kings too strong I would say|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: bye for now thx operator and exc fellow commentators|pg||
nt|josj: tahnks also to GABSI to make these broadcasts possible|pg||
nt|jaapfr: no idea about other table|pg||
nt|sybarra: or  pass?  then @C can come back into play |pg||
nt|josj: again, no X|pg||
mb|4S|nt|kit: Assuming West sits, and I can't see why he wouldn't|pg||
nt|ritong: lindqvist has an opinion to propose|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, no reason for west to remove the double.|pg||
nt|josj: a well-known Adi special: he says nine tricks and then scores it correctly as 8 :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: I think 9 trick :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: South has lots of entries to give North club ruffs |pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: sorry :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: there is optimism |pg||
nt|josj: NS must have a special agreement here|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: all very reasonable but 9 tricks are available here|pg||
nt|ritong: a classical " periscope" lead|pg||
nt|kareno: Good lead by Brogeland just in case his partner needs him to shift.|pg||
nt|lestergold: I have to go cu all soon|pg||
nt|mdgraham: bye Mike|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: and justified too, now|pg||
nt|xenya: well it's not a classic bergen|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: yes|pg||
nt|otoj: I have no idea what's 3@d and 4@d..|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, Jos|pg||
nt|josj: but they stayed out of a slam off two (three) aces|pg||
pc|h9|nt|me argent: same auction in OR sorta|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: thanks all @H@H :)|pg||
nt|josj: so another quick claim|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kit: pretty lucky lie of cards, to put it mildly|pg||
nt|jaapfr: brave pass by W!|pg||
nt|sybarra: doing nothing wrong at this table (imo)  and no imps for n/s|pg||
nt|josj: cold now but you still can easily go down|pg||
nt|josj: they missed a cold slam|pg||
nt|josj: on  2|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok that one true|pg||
pc|hA|nt|josj: tomorrow's starting time is 9.00 WIB which is 2 am GMT|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|josj: disconnection ahead, it looks...:(|pg||
nt|sybarra: feels like it |pg||
nt|sybarra: it really has been so good today |pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: call director " declarer no order play !K |pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: @HK|pg||
nt|josj: ah, ty Adi :)|pg||
nt|josj: so S and W were disconnected, apparently, near the end of a long day|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: and director decision skip this board|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kareno: Lindqvist calls for a diamond.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: mite go for -200 even -500 so can be big profit EW|pg||
nt|josj: another quiet board before the grand finale begins...|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N looks quite good here -- this hand shows that all those AK's are worth more than their nominal value|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|dburn: true, but it's not obvious to play for the singleton king of spades|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|kit: not at all -- but what else might she do?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kit: yes -- normal in this sort of situation|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jaapfr: then 33-31 djarum if -2|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|sT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I've heard of 2 am|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jaapfr: if -1 26-31|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ritong: push|pg||
nt|kareno: Both north/south pairs will think they've lost that board :)|pg||
nt|ritong: they at least suppose they did not win it|pg||
nt|kareno: In that they are both correct :)|pg||
nt|kit: they sure were off by quite a bit -- 4@S isn't close|pg||
nt|mrace: i watched Hamman and Zia practicing BAM in bbo previous recent weeks, they are too agressive at low level and tend to leave opponents after first shock...not at his board.|pg||
nt|kareno: I assume we still do not have any running scores, do we?|pg||
nt|kit: I don't like the 5@H call -- he has a lot of trumps, but so what?|pg||
nt|kareno: Too many losers.  Caught up in the heat of the auction.|pg||
nt|ritong: what would you pick at barbu with zia shand, kit?|pg||
nt|kareno: I pick last 2 tricks :)|pg||
nt|ritong: pff:) small player:)|pg||
nt|mrace: haha|pg||
nt|mrace: i wld go for trumps :) |pg||
nt|kareno: By the way, Henri, I am the one who actually brought Barbu to the US after my year and a half playing it in Paris :)|pg||
nt|kit: anything which I thought I could get doubled in Henri|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|kareno: That was in 1965!!|pg||
nt|ritong: that s why it is a tuff hand imo|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: next up: Greenberg vs Diamond|pg||
nt|kareno: Barbu is a fine card game :)|pg||
nt|ritong: i should have precised: first hand|pg||
nt|ritong: oh yeah!|pg||
nt|ritong: it is marvellous|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: After 9 bds, Nickell leading Delmonte by 1.6 boards|pg||
nt|kit: and probably more after last round|pg||
nt|kareno: Did you know it was played at the Club Elysee in Paris, Henri?  |pg||
nt|mrace: we call it "KING" in Turkey , and "Bloody King " where u pick b4 u see ur hand |pg||
nt|ritong: yes, naturally:)|pg||
nt|kareno: And for stakes :)|pg||
nt|ritong: although i mostly was in BCP or albarran clubs|pg||
nt|ritong: bcp = bridge club de paris|pg||
nt|kareno: Somehow I landed at Elysee early and there I played the whole year and a half I lived in Paris.|pg||
nt|ritong: french mecque of bridge, sort of|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|josj: right|pg||
pc|h2|pg||

pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d9|pc|d5|pg||

mb|1N|mb|2C|an|single suit|nt|ritong: ouch|pg||
nt|ritong: brad vs mom|pg||
nt|xenya: 6@C -- but can they bid it?|pg||
nt|josj: 2@C is onesuiter, I assume|pg||
mb|d|mb|2D|nt|me argent: alot of Y K and Zs at this table|pg||
nt|kit: South will compete to 3@H with 6 hearts and stiff club, and that should end it.|pg||
nt|kareno: I concur.|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: might be tough|pg||
nt|josj: and X is quite aggressive...|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kit: not sure I see motivation behin this call -- it should be a game try, and he just isn't worth it.|pg||
nt|frankaus: both red i dont expect any heroics|pg||
nt|xenya: maybe they'll do well to bid 5@C?|pg||
nt|otoj: what is the dbl?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kareno: What's the purpose of that 3@d bid?  invitation?|pg||
nt|xenya: grand slam missing the trump Q should not be bid?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphu2: and one of them isn't even polish|pg||
nt|mrace: must be |pg||
nt|josj: hi Frank|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day Jos Jacobs welcome|pg||
nt|xenya: a hand for bidding competition actually|pg||
mb|3S|nt|josj: hi all and selamat siang|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: even if you have 9 trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: low @C now...|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: We're on a wavelength, Kit.|pg||
nt|kareno: And it has given west too much information.  |pg||
nt|kit: no reason for West to lead anything but a trump with everything under control.|pg||
nt|josj: this can go down on a club ruff but it probably won't|pg||
nt|xenya: well 4@S would have got a few points in a bidding competition |pg||
nt|josj: now Ferdi knows his @HKJx are worthless|pg||
pc|dA|nt|dburn: odd sort of bidding, this, especially at BAM|pg||
nt|dburn: but West seemed unwilling to open or to rebid 1NT|pg||
nt|mrace: he heard ya |pg||
nt|ritong: she|pg||
nt|mrace: sry she|pg||
nt|ritong: gail greenberg|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer will lead club up immediately, and make with club ace on and hearts 2-2 -- can eventually ruff third diamond in dummy.|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, it gives up a spade trick, that is a reason not to lead trumps |pg||
nt|kit: Normal result, and that was achieved in other room.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|josj: surprising that E did not raise @H|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kit: West had has awkward rebid -- hate to bid 2@D, but weak to reverse for most|pg||
nt|dburn: and did not consider he had enough for 2@h|pg||
nt|sybarra: I like your play better Jos|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|xenya: the trouble is that it might go down|pg||
pc|dK|nt|me argent: i like 2@Cs|pg||
nt|gowdy: I admit I would have pushed with 2 H's|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@c certainly possible, but only if 2@h-3@h is natural after it|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: hi all :) welcome @H@H@H|pg||
nt|xenya: so well done|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|nt|xenya: i don't see how he can make it now -- he can't get to dummy's clubs and retain a @D control|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|josj: this way, it makes no difference :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kit: some would solve problem by opening 1NT, but that has obvious flaws also|pg||
nt|josj: well it still can...|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|c5|pc|d5|pg||
nt|kit: will win in dummy, pitch spade on king of clubs, and diamond to king.|pg||
nt|kareno: I am not fond of trump leads|pg||
nt|josj: OK and finesse @SJ next :)|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|xenya: the question is whether EW can make 8 tricks in 1N -- on the surface, they can't|pg||
nt|kareno: They give up tempo and if you need to get your suits going, tempo matters a lot!|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pg||
nt|kit: might not be fond of them, but on this hand was clear (although it turned out badly this time)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|nt|xenya: W is happy|pg||
nt|xenya: to see the @H split|pg||
nt|josj: so the match quickly closing in :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|xenya: mind you, N did very well to switch to @Hs -- on any other switch, 4@S makes|pg||
nt|josj: and the @H guess still to come|pg||
nt|sybarra: so may cash |pg||
nt|sybarra: South|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|c8|nt|me argent: i played with kokish much too long to ever consider bidding 2@Hs|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, West has bought pretty well for his actual sequence - he isn't going lots down in a 5-1 or 5-0 fit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: After 4 rounds: 1. Nickell 2.Delmonte  3.Kendrick 4. Polowan 5.Shugart 6.Kwiecien  7. Spector 8.Becker  9.Greenberg 10.Diamond |pg||
nt|gowdy: no  the question is how could they ever find 1NT|pg||
nt|xenya: 1@D -- 1@S -- 1N?|pg||
nt|me argent: opening 1nt?|pg||
nt|dburn: well, if you are not prepared to open it, maybe you ought to be prepared to rebid it|pg||
nt|gowdy: transfer then Joey|pg||
nt|xenya: then E might transfer|pg||
nt|me argent: i must admit i open 1@D and rebid 2@Cs|pg||
nt|gowdy: playing weak NT then perhaps|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: I wonder why W isn't claiming?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|me argent: not close 4 moi|pg||
nt|dburn: still, the reverse at the other table got a minus score, so this is a win for Spector|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|c7|nt|josj: yep...I am falling asleep as well, like the director|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: and now back again to board 12 with director :) but I forgot auction :(|pg||

nt|roswolf: this contract is off on top tricks|pg||
nt|bjacobs: When you lead a top club here, see @CJxx in dummy, what are the odds of declarer having @CA?  In my experience, it's a total certainty|pg||

nt|josj: as declarer did not want to take the @C finesse, he accepted one down right from the start...|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: I'd be passing with south's hand...|pg||
nt|xenya: the range doesn't matter i think -- E has a 3-card fit and a nice side suit -- a clear raise  |pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: yes, should be|pg||
nt|josj: apparently NS play Strong Club|pg||

mb|p|nt|mrace: yes u dont have QX in @H Karen :)|pg||
nt|ritong: no way brad passes, i think|pg||
nt|kit: 2@S looks a lot more descriptive than pass to me, but to each his own.|pg||
nt|josj: I think NS play weak NT|pg||
mb|1D|nt|xenya: 2N?|pg||
nt|xenya: better|pg||
nt|josj: 4@H might be dicciult on a @C lead|pg||
nt|josj: difficult|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: 3@H may be somewhat conservative -- but East will probably bid game anyway.|pg||
nt|xenya: but even this might not make|pg||
nt|jaapfr: in open lead was @S so 4@H had a good chance|pg||
nt|josj: but not in an occasional partnership :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kareno: Well, I hate to bid a jack-high suit first or second seat.  Too often it seduces partner into leading from honor-x to the detriment of the defense.|pg||
nt|ritong: he had a tough decision, with this scoring|pg||
nt|josj: it's a difficult word, even to type|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: I'll worry about that when the bidding is over|pg||
nt|ritong: no doubt he would not think twice playing imps|pg||
mb|2S|nt|xenya: well the lead helps a lot|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: this looks like a very strange aution|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: If South bids out his shape here, North may make the winning decision to play 4@S|pg||
nt|kit: Well, he got the disaster lead -- and won the board!|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, IMPs is a different reward system :)|pg||
nt|ritong: but kit is right, jeff hand is a conservative player in general|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: But instead North unnecessarily rushed to 3NT|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he didn't get the chance, which is a bit odd|pg||
nt|me argent: EW play polish@C so that probably influenced their choice of bids on 13|pg||
pc|dK|nt|me argent: and 14 for that matter|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, sure - in Polish Club that sequence is automatci|pg||
nt|me argent: sorry cant keep my directions streight this is my first job|pg||
nt|kit: declarer will probably duck first heart, win second, and go after clubs|pg||
nt|josj: if W leads a @D this will be a quick -1|pg||
pc|d3|nt|josj: it still needs a @D guess|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kit: I don't see that much difference between IMPs and matchpoints on East hand -- you bid game if you think it is a favorite, not otherwise, at both games.|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|kit: Note that after the initial pass at other table they had no difficulty getting to game|pg||
nt|josj: @H now|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jaapfr: chance bigger N not @CKQJ and @DA? in review of the pass?|pg||
nt|xenya: not really -- N is unlikely to have A and KQ on this auction|pg||
nt|xenya: so S is marked with the @DA|pg||
pc|d4|nt|frankaus: and a strange result as well|pg||

nt|Walddk6: Declarer is home now because the defence can't switch to diamonds and spades at the same time|pg||
nt|Walddk6: So he has time to set up his 5th club|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, the only requirement is that, if West switches to a diamond, declarer hops ace|pg||
nt|vugraphzbp: thinking...........|pg||
nt|roswolf: not sure what about - he only has 1 practical line|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Even if clubs are 5-1, he has certain chances with spades|pg||
nt|Walddk6: So first he must test clubs|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I suppose he could aim to set up the 5th spade rather than 5th club?|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|nt|bjacobs: The question is - can he combine both chances?|pg||

nt|mrace: i am bidding it in both...4 trumps and an Ace is too much to pass to a pd who overcalled at 3 level....just the @H support may make pd's hand a giant|pg||
nt|josj: yes...|pg||
nt|xenya: some hand|pg||
nt|josj: @C are 9-4-0-0...not an everyday sight|pg||
mb|1D|nt|jaapfr: new leader expected after this freak:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: hard to predict|pg||
nt|josj: EW here won't get as high as their OR counterparts|pg||
nt|josj: +1 looks huge..|pg||
mb|1S|nt|xenya: sorry i should have said "her ace" -- NS are women|pg||
nt|josj: for EW in OR the sky is the limit, as we saw just now|pg||
nt|xenya: -500 is good against -600|pg||
nt|jaapfr: IF you make 5@C|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, if|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 2 aces and @CJ not easy to get|pg||
nt|josj: what can E bid now to show his suits?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if bid 5@H?|pg||
nt|xenya: ah -- i didn't notice that Jxxx -- sorry|pg||
nt|jaapfr: we saw it before:)|pg||
nt|josj: looks like game for EW but 500 is better|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: in OR|pg||
mb|2C|nt|josj: do EW have a pen alty X available here???|pg||
nt|sybarra: tought to X seems not penalty dbls anymore|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Now the old choice -- 3NT or 4@H?|pg||
mb|2H|an|forc|nt|josj: well, Shirley, you see now what that costs|pg||
nt|josj: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: just pointing out, that few X's at the lower level are for penalty |pg||
nt|josj: sure...|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: but if W showed @S and it was alerted, 2NT is not easy to understand|pg||
nt|frankaus: 4@S EW may be playable here|pg||
nt|josj: sure but makeable? try a @D lead|pg||
mb|2N|nt|xenya: this might not be an easy one -- i'm abit surprised E raised|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: North afraid to compete to 3@H, fearing his partner will play him for invite values|pg||
nt|kit: Doesn't seem to me that whether partner has 3 hearts or not should make much difference.|pg||
nt|kareno: 2@h is a bit of an underbid with that hand, no?|pg||
nt|mrace: too many QJs|pg||
nt|kareno: Any more and she would have a 1nt opener.  |pg||
nt|kit: I would have bid 3NT on East hand, right or wrong.|pg||
nt|mrace: after 1 nt ? |pg||
nt|mrace: or 2@H ? |pg||
nt|jaapfr: would you bid 5@H here?|pg||
nt|josj: remarkable pass but worth 12 imps, I think|pg||
nt|josj: @H mandatory now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i would bid 5@H|pg||
nt|xenya: spade will also do|pg||
nt|josj: removes the entry, yes|pg||
nt|xenya: removing the entry|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|me argent: but north did well to get his side out of nt|pg||
nt|josj: N should pass now but will he know that?|pg||
nt|josj: yes he did!|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: was just as well, as 3@H probably down 2 losing both club finesses|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: indeed -- i'm not even sure 3N can be made on good defence|pg||
nt|josj: @D lead ducked...|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kit: after 1NT|pg||
nt|kareno: This form of scoring that makes great sense, kit.|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: thinking|pg||
nt|josj: @S|pg||
nt|otoj: I don't think a good idea to continue club if declarer ducks .. since you know declarer has a long clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|dburn: indeed he did - that was a pretty good view|pg||
nt|ritong: agree, kit|pg||
nt|frankaus: this is likely to make|pg||
pc|c5|nt|josj: :)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|me argent: south playing 1nt in OR on a @D lead|pg||
nt|josj: Parpar will be very disappointed now|pg||
pc|c7|nt|kit: very unusual hand where at IMPs I'd tend toward 4@H, but at matchpoints 3NT -- it is usually the other way around.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|gowdy: good bid by E not 100% obvious|pg||
nt|xenya: 9 tricks now -- E's @CJ is a big card|pg||
pc|c3|nt|me argent: a triumph 4 Garbage Stayman|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|xenya: not clear whether N should have unblocked the @DK i think|pg||
nt|josj: it looks the better play but might give the show away|pg||
nt|jaapfr: then defense sees the @H return imo|pg||
nt|xenya: exactly|pg||
nt|josj: I am enjoying a Russian view out of my window|pg||
pc|sT|nt|josj: even more likely now :)|pg||
nt|josj: it's snowing and everything looks white|pg||
nt|xenya: so am i, Jos|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|gowdy: yep   that 2 is not 100%|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kit: making them all, but lose the board|pg||
pc|cT|pc|d4|nt|josj: maybe an overtrick now as the hearts go on the @S|pg||
nt|josj: I thought so,  Vladimir :)|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ritong: again|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|s7|pc|d5|pg||
nt|me argent: easts action irrelevant on this hand north won the bd with 2@Cs|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Next match Greenberg vs Kendrick|pg||
nt|gowdy: but he can only do what he can do|pg||
nt|dburn: if Kendrick still bids as he used to, should be an interesting match|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: There's a problem with bd 16, they're skipping to 17 and they'll get a substitute bd 16|pg||
nt|josj: no he played safe lready|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kit: at IMPs the major needs to take 2 extra tricks to be really better, so lean towards notrump if close.  At matchpoints, needs to take only 1 extra trick.|pg||
nt|josj: a|pg||
pc|s8|nt|josj: so a much needed swing to the ladies here|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|josj: should be just made I think|pg||
nt|josj: and that's what it says now|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: 4@c just made :)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|kit: Here, however, 4@H figures to be completely safe while 3NT might have  a hole, but on balance I would bet on same number of tricks.|pg||

nt|vugraphzbq: last board|pg||
nt|josj: so A did well to recover from a deficit that at one time stood at 0-34...|pg||
nt|sybarra: last hand coming up right?|pg||
nt|josj: I think so, last hand of the day in fact|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Riyadi,  our operator,  great job!|pg||
nt|josj: the finalists have been playing about 72 boards from 9 a.m. onwards|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx Jos great fun to comment with you as always |pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: thanks all @H@H see you tomorrow morning (here) :)|pg||
nt|josj: ty Shirley...;)|pg||
nt|josj: I will show up for the final 2 rounds, I think|pg||
nt|xenya: last board now|pg||
nt|otoj: last board in this tournament... |pg||
nt|josj: and Adi did it again :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: thank you all @H@H see you next tourney :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Vugraphu2: EW play 4-card majors and weak NT|pg||
nt|kareno: I think this will come back to west at a high level :)|pg||
nt|josj: very quick correction, Adi: wd :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i hope we get a @S lead here if in 4@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think I am scheduled also |pg||
nt|josj: yes very wd Adi, ty very much and cu next time|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kit: E-W have easy 4@S -- the question is how many clubs will North bid, and how many hearts will South bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: it is 9pm  for me |pg||
nt|sybarra: (toinight)|pg||
nt|josj: ty Vladimir and Joto too|pg||
nt|otoj: well done Adi.. ty Jos & Vladimir..|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: hello Mike|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am raising on the S hand not matter what system I play|pg||
nt|xenya: but there are 3 or 4 more boards to play in the OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Somehow, 2@C looks like an insufficient bid to me|pg||
nt|mrace: not much after 3@H i suppose |pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: I doubt if notrump looks right to East|pg||
nt|josj: 4@S unlucky to go down: @D 3-1 and @SQ wrong...|pg||
nt|josj: we will switch over shortly :) OR, here we come|pg||
pc|s5|nt|josj: here we have a very good Roland slam|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kareno: No doubt 3@c has some other meaning|pg||
nt|xenya: N can bid 1 or 2NT, depending on the range of S's 1@H|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|xenya: but not 3 i'm sure|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good morning all from a cold and snowy London|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mdgraham: my, 3NT is going it a bit|pg||
nt|xenya: i bet it's colder in Moscow, Mike |pg||
nt|xenya: where i am|pg||
pc|d6|nt|kit: could be swing on lead here -- your singleton or partner's?|pg||
nt|frankaus: need to drop stiff !K ( a rabbi play ) here|pg||
nt|josj: in fact, 6@D is a much better contract than 3NT|pg||
nt|josj: needs the same @D layout but brings a better score|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I won't argue|pg||
nt|josj: so another big swing for the ladies' team|pg||
pc|d2|nt|josj: 500 on a @H ruff should be easy enough|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|josj: @S now for the overtrick|pg||
pc|s6|nt|josj: proper contract would be 5@D|pg||
pc|sK|nt|josj: The seniors from Djarum Bhineka should feel relieved the match is over...72 boards a day is very, very many|pg||
