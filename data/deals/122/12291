nt|athene: if you finesse and it loses you go down to the second ruff |pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c6|nt|athene: but if you rise @DA you go down unnecessarily when north has the @DK|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: but finessing diamonds has to be the odds play - it is only wrong when the finesse loses AND you could have brought the hearts in for no losers|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|athene: notice how declarer does his best to make the lead look like a plausible non-singleton|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: dropping the jack from QJx means the lead could be from Qxx|pg||
nt|jbgood: after a ruff the odds for bringing in the trumps has increased|pg||
nt|athene: yes, sure|pg||
nt|athene: but i think finessing is still best|pg||
nt|jbgood: hi Jan|pg||
nt|jbgood: private, as you guess|pg||
nt|jcwla: Perhaps also a little hitch in N's giddyup there.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|athene: in the other room the lead was the same and declarer also dropped the @CJ but south bought it, switching to a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: so declarer didn't have many problems after that|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|h8|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h7|mc|10|nt|athene: once the diamond finesse works, of course, you refuse the heart finesse|pg||
nt|athene: if you crossed to the @SA and finessed hearts you might find north gives his partner a diamond ruff|pg||

nt|jcwla: Some choices here.|pg||
mb|3N!|an|12-15 pts, 3 spades, bal, NF|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Townsend got a heart, but since there are many other chances, he rose with the ace|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think this is known as a "pudding raise" in Britain|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Don't know where that term comes from|pg||
nt|jcwla: The 3 spades in this kind of raise often look like these.|pg||
nt|athene: i should have thought a passive lead was more normal against this auction|pg||
nt|athene: dummy hasn't got a side suit so why lead away from a king?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: especially since you are quite likely to have a trump stopper - there isn't any rush|pg||
nt|athene: the only makeable game is 4@S from east, isn't it? hard to get there :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I found the pudding ....|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgeguys.com/PGlossary/PuddingRaiseAcol.html|pg||
nt|vugraphzzg: need to be playing transfer major openings...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The 3NT Pudding Raise e.g. 1@S - 3NT is used to identify the strong even-distribution hand with support for partnerÂ’s suit. This means that a straight game raise is therefore only ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: used on a weaker distributional hand.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|jcwla: That shows 4-card support.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Not the case here.|pg||
nt|athene: as far as the name "pudding raise" goes, i assumed it was just a vaguely evoacative term to desribe something that's got soft values and not much shape :)|pg||

nt|jcwla: Last board of the segment here.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh, maybe because we just played it :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: and what a board|pg||
mb|1N!|an|12-14|mb|p|nt|athene: interesting bidding decision for west|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|athene: if you knew the state of the match you might try something wild like 6@C|pg||
nt|jbgood: i would think it was even for S|pg||
mb|2S!|an|!Cs, game invitational or stronger|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Many thanks to Jonathan, Jordan, Bill, Jon and Vladimir|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|jbgood: must admit I would have shown a 2-suiter|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@S probably showing clubs. 2NT: I don't like them much|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: now 3nt, 4@S, pass, perhaps|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|athene: if Gold in the other room opened that 1@C, Townsend might get excited :) but it's a 1@H opener for them isn't it?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h4|nt|jcwla: On 31, Townsend made 1NT in the CR and N/S made 2@H here, so 5 more to open up something of a gap.|pg||
nt|athene: well now we see Erichsen's "secret" - he just leads from Jxx as often as he can :)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|jbgood: N continues leading from a jack :)|pg||
nt|xenya: not the best choice this time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would set up my side suit first. Even if they can get a ruff, it is usually from trump length|pg||
nt|jcwla: And after some pause for thought over 5@D, Gold did not bid the @D slam on 32 so that will not change things much.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So a club would be my choice looking at the EW cards only|pg||
nt|athene: clearly, the game is cold unless there are very bad breaks|pg||
nt|athene: so declarer is just thinking about 4-0 clubs, 4-1 trumps, 5-0 trumps|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
nt|jcwla: Gold did not make the overtrick (nor would I have) so 1 IMP to Hillman on 32 as the CR waits for us to finish 29 I suppose.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They did not play 29 in the other room either|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|cA|pg||
nt|athene: cashing one trump might be right to avoid the disaster of someone getting a club ruff from a singleton trump|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Poor communication between the rooms, so this set will take a little longer|pg||
nt|vugraphzzg: we (open room) are playing it atm and closed room are waiting for it|pg||
nt|athene: of course, finding a defender with two black singletons is very unlikely, as roland said, but when that's the only risk to the contract, you try to cater for it|pg||
nt|jcwla: Thanks again to all - back in a flash for F5.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: West's pass missing|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: heart lead establishes four easy tricks for the defence|pg||

pc|d5|nt|athene: playing west for @DQ10 |pg||
nt|jbgood: has to play low now to make double dummy|pg||
nt|athene: not impossible, i think|pg||

mc|10|nt|jbgood: when S has all his points in spades, and N doesnt want to play NT, there is even a good shot to lead the heart jack - or king|pg||

mb|2H|an|!Ds and forcing|mb|4H|nt|athene: does he bid a lot of diamonds or does he make a forcing bid in diamonds, probably via unusual vs. unusual?|pg||
