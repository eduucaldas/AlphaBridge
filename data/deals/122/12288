mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sA|nt|Walddk2: Do they play 14-16, Steve, or did Irens upgrade?|pg||

nt|mdgraham: nice lead|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sK|nt|brolucius: South has false-carded to disguise East's 'reverse attitude' signal.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|roswolf: will they find the diamond switch?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|cuttysark: I think it's an upgrade|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South conceals the @S2 |pg||
nt|vugraphzzg: sorry 15-17|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now East unblocks the @S9 in case West has five spades and the suit might become blocked.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 15-17 it is, in theory|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not sure about this 9|pg||
nt|vugraphzzg: Just noticed the Man U score|pg||

nt|mdgraham: which is?|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am recorging it.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Please do not spoil it.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Would he lead the ace from AKxxx? Does the ace not ask for an attitude sigal?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzg: Of course not David|pg||

pc|h4|pc|sJ|pc|s8|pg||
pc|s7|pc|d4|pc|s5|pc|d2|pg||
nt|brolucius: West played the @S4 before the @S5, which might be thought to ask for a club.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: not looking at that dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Clubs out of the question with that dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So must be for diamonds|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, I see, the lower of the red suits.|pg||
nt|vugraphzzg: so it should br between D and hearts|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
nt|cuttysark: He doesn't know what to signal for! Looks obvious to try a diamond from here|pg||
nt|roswolf: well done|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if West plays a diamond it should be the jack |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Perhaps - but declarer has discarded diamonds from both hands, so no need|pg||
nt|brolucius: Unusually, there were three suits to choose between. So suit preference must apply to the two remaining suits, once clubs could be ruled out by dummy's holding.|pg||
nt|vugraphzzg: needs to cash now, to keep the loss down i think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Declarer can go 5 down if he tries to steal a club|pg||
nt|cuttysark: he may try to sneal a club - should not succeed|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|h8|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|cuttysark: sneal = steal + sneak, rather a good word I ahve coined|pg||

nt|brolucius: Bennett's 4@H was pushing it, but he was unlucky to find such a trump stack over him.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@D, in the third seat NV, is totally obvious.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Even if you play a natural and weak 2@D. |pg||
nt|mdgraham: or 1NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2D|an|weak|nt|brolucius: Yes, 'weak' indeed!|pg||
mb|d|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Law 27 (5): "A decision Not out by one umpire shall not prevent the other umpire from giving a decision"|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@H by West was possible, agreeing diamonds and suggesting a lead.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one would think that two Test umpires, plus the referral umpire and match referee, would have known that |pg||
nt|roswolf: hmmm |pg||
nt|brolucius: It would have required a TV replay, because the foot was raised only momentarily.|pg||
mb|p|pc|sK|nt|brolucius: South at the other table bid too much, as I see it. South here bid too little.|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|pc|s3|pg||
nt|roswolf: another exercise in cashing out|pg||
nt|mdgraham: interesting. I'm sure Prior would have appealed for the stumping |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|nt|cuttysark: This will go badly though - about 8 imps to Townsend|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as a wicketkeeper, stumpings are far more pleasurable than a simple catch |pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sT|pc|s6|pc|s7|pg||
nt|cuttysark: All down to the failure to open 3@D|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|c7|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, and South's raise to 4@H at the other table.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: OK, not the best defence...|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|hT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: mind you, if they don't appeal for a stumping, the square leg umpire should not interfere |pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pc|c9|nt|cuttysark: Always difficult to signal an entry in trump|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|pc|dQ|pc|d8|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Some of the bidding in the previous session was reminiscent of a 3am student game. We are hoping for better stuff in this session. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nothing much to this hand|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Well ....|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: provided they stop soon!|pg||
nt|vugraphzzg: Not the worst slam in the world|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Many would drive to slam with the East cards oce partner opens|pg||
nt|vugraphzzg: only a bit poor|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Once|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not the best, either |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|brolucius: An admirable sequence from Hillman. We all know players who would blast 6NT on the East cards.|pg||
nt|vugraphzzg: I suppose that the entries are a problem|pg||
nt|Walddk2: On this layout you can't make more than 11 I think|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Good deceptive lead - he should play hearts but no worried about diaond losers|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Diamonds are friendly, the majors are not|pg||
nt|cuttysark: now!|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer can give up two hearts as the cards lie.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|d4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think Erichsen's lead is good. He can't take any tricks, so he is hoping to find partner with some  ... and often with diamond length too. The queen could well be a good card to ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: lead through at your only opportunity|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|roswolf: looks like 11 tricks|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dT|pc|d2|nt|cuttysark: Hope he was watchin the pips - with the 8 gone he has nothing to fear|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|cuttysark: He wasn't :(|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but they are 3-3 anyway|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes, but it takes longer this way :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed they are, but it would have been easier to win the king and knock out the 9|pg||
nt|brolucius: It will be a reassuring start for E/W to stop in 4NT and make it, on the first board.|pg||
nt|vugraphzzg: a club now will make him a little nervous though|pg||
nt|brolucius: One of Garozzo's most famous defences involved a club switch when declarer had this sort of club holding.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Could have been in jeopardy with @DA offside, but not as it is|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Winning this final will be worth more to Hillman than to Townsend, since Townsend/Gold would be participants in the Lederer Trophy anyway.|pg||
