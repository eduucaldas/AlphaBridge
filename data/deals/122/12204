nt|calabres: schedule of these broadcasts on BBO Vugraph. A warm welcome too to my fellow commentators. Ty all.|pg||
nt|daman: but he has to duck the @Hs twice|pg||
nt|xenya: no i think |pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: but these bids always seem on dubious grounds theoretically|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to go down  |pg||
nt|xenya: at least legitimately|pg||
nt|gambit: 4 clubs, 3s, 2H , diamonds block ?|pg||
nt|xenya: needs some help from the defence|pg||
pc|d6|nt|xenya: @DJ beats it now -- well done|pg||
pc|d4|nt|haans: low in NT :)|pg||

pc|dA|nt|april7: -50 instead of +500|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ady: was easy to avoid A@H lead with ace and king of diamonds|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s2|nt|ady: yes Q@D makes the defence clear|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer could have tried to cash his club winners first -- but that doesn't help as the cards lie|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: now another club|pg||
nt|athene: just in case partner has something like @HQx remaining|pg||
pc|hA|nt|haans: some say high starting with QJ8|pg||
pc|h8|nt|april7: if its 4th he need not, but it could be a falsecarding|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|athene: actually a diamond might be preferable |pg||

nt|xenya: all quite normal so far|pg||
nt|april7: 8 tricks in NT also|pg||
nt|xenya: bur W might elect to bid 2@S now?|pg||
nt|april7: but 2NT would be for minors probably|pg||
nt|daman: what would we bid with the West hand?|pg||
nt|xenya: that's the question|pg||
nt|daman: not easy|pg||
nt|april7: 3@C or2NT for minors!|pg||
nt|xenya: on th eother hand, E rates to have 4@Ss?|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|april7: both contract work though @D and @C|pg||
nt|gambit: 11 easy tricks |pg||
nt|xenya: well this one is as cold as it can be|pg||
nt|gambit: colder than my ex-wife's heart (as someone once said) :) |pg||
nt|xenya: i take a short break -- will get coffee|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: maybe    if East was going to bid    he should have bid 2NT|pg||

nt|rodal f: Anyway it seems as some came a bit to high|pg||
nt|mmmakela: have u updated your months Frank?|pg||
nt|ady: getting too high here|pg||
nt|garnetts: Luckilly the cards will forgive this five level transgression|pg||
nt|garnetts: luckily even|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ady: I assume on n/s methods  north promised no more than he has     so south has taken the bidding too high|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mmmakela: not very exciting brb cig br|pg||
nt|gambit: hopefully Cap will play faster than Guerreiro leads |pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|pg||
nt|april7: now W has 10 tricks|pg||
nt|april7: 2 aces and a 5card suit!!!|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|garnetts: easier in the old days to bid 2@H and then 4@H to show a minimum jump shift and a solid suit|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rodal f: Each 4th in the month so I have forgotten. Sorry. My work:)|pg||

nt|haans: this deal is more fun|pg||
nt|rodal f: Some to come we all belive Hans:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: fun|pg||
nt|garnetts: don't bid if the response might get you too high|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: only the @SA@HA standing in the way of 6@D here|pg||
nt|mmmakela: ok now a grand|pg||
nt|tweety1: Actually, If there is no blood, It is a good match they say... Who care:)  Kibz want blood:)|pg||
nt|haans: we are here to see blood :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: hard to reach 7 clubs|pg||
nt|tweety1: hah|pg||
mb|2D|nt|athene: tricky hand for east after the 1nt opener|pg||
nt|sybarra: hopefully they will find out they are missing 2 aces |pg||
nt|april7: 3@S opening, hard to balance for EW vuln.and its ok anyway|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 7@h is a good grand |pg||
nt|mmmakela: 4 @H best here?|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  likely to get to 4@S      should be down 1|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm back now -- and just in time for a bit of fun it seems?|pg||
nt|gambit: good hand for negative free bids|pg||
mb|3C|nt|athene: to show a spade-diamond two-suiter he might have to transfer to spades first and then he never gets the suit lengths across|pg||
nt|sybarra: can transfer to spades, the bid @D over 2 @S andd3 !N |pg||
nt|tweety1: I thought I am the only Drakula|pg||
nt|haans: 6@C is hard|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: some people can transfer to diamonds then bid spades naturally|pg||
nt|sybarra: *then|pg||
nt|april7: let see whether they reach it|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now VERY hard|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@S should go one off unless west starts with the A@C |pg||
mb|3H|nt|sybarra: I can do that   and appears to be what he is doing |pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps 3@S is better than 2@S but still looks ugly to me|pg||
nt|tweety1: cant find 7|pg||
nt|hawe45:  What is 1 @D?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: missing the 9|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y. Same as 5@D. Need to find the Q@D|pg||
nt|gambit: 3 or 4 hearts?|pg||
mb|5D|nt|granguru:  Notice how important is the @DQ|pg||
nt|granguru:  Not easy to see it during the bidding in a nat system|pg||
nt|mmmakela: some dbl|pg||
nt|ady: un unlucky contract  ace of clubs wrong   and a definate trump loser|pg||
mb|5H|nt|athene: 3@D presumably shows enthusiasm for diamonds|pg||
nt|tweety1: I am open any bets|pg||
nt|mmmakela: bet no 6|pg||
nt|haans: some odds for 3nt|pg||
nt|mmmakela: being down|pg||
nt|hawe45:  You can only handle @D 4-1 with the length in North|pg||
nt|gambit: not a great contract, but perhaps inevitable after that neg doube...|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I would also know by my pard's bid whether pard has good @D's or not |pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: ruff, Kc trick 2? must get clubs going and with E having 4 hearts, chances are improving|pg||
nt|xenya: it's a disgrace to put down on the table KQJ1098xx -- this suit shoulf be TRUMPS|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: down 1 on normal defense|pg||
nt|april7: 6 they will reach|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Difficult to value after a checkback 2@c|pg||
nt|rodal f: Right u are|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sybarra: my pard and I use the "relay" suit for good @D's but all what the understandings are|pg||
nt|haans: again odds on 3nt|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 5 clubs it will be my bet|pg||
nt|garnetts: David would you double 1@S with the east hand?  I admit I might |pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: this could get murky; which suit does 4@C agree?|pg||
nt|sybarra: @D |pg||
nt|daman: now another @H|pg||
nt|gambit: Was it Al Roth who said that? |pg||
pc|d5|nt|haans: overcalls have no definite values|pg||
nt|mmmakela: but if W opens 1 @D as I would've then diff story|pg||
nt|haans: as it is not MP bidding clubs seems most logical|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: the XX is first round control |pg||
nt|athene: we can see it agrees diamonds but east might not be in on the joke :)|pg||
nt|chemical_b: hi Shirley, hi all :)|pg||
nt|granguru:  redouble shows @SA|pg||
nt|april7: XX = ace|pg||
nt|mmmakela: must respect playing strength|pg||
nt|haans: well done|pg||
nt|ady: not vul against not|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|xenya: i'm not sure -- but whoever it was he certainly had a valid point|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: now down 2|pg||
nt|xenya: note that 6@C only can be beaten by a @H lead|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: 4nt rkcb doesn't work very well for minor suits|pg||
nt|hagz: Maybe West guess that 3 @s is cuebid?|pg||
nt|athene: you tend to get too high|pg||
nt|mmmakela: i won!!!!!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|haans: :(|pg||
pc|d2|nt|xenya: 2 off now|pg||
nt|tweety1: Actually I open 2nt with E's hand  so tell all:)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: right - as i suspected east thought 4@C agreed spades|pg||
nt|xenya: not very likely|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|hagz: WOW|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: these "two suiter" auctions are real deathtraps without a lot of discussion|pg||
nt|granguru:  As said ..a tough hand to bid|pg||
nt|granguru:  to try with your favorite partner|pg||
nt|april7: if E had only 2 @S cards, then S goes down!|pg||
nt|april7: I mean in 7|pg||
nt|granguru:  2@S and 3@H|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so for the perfectionists: is 10 the right card to play? what u want to find out /deceive/? opposed to playing Q/J?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|athene: after 3@S, a simple way to play is that 4@D = good for diamonds, 4@C/@H = good for spades|pg||
nt|athene: it doesn't really matter how you play as long as you agree SOMETHING|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Did 2@H really go 2 down on board 2?|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's close to impossible|pg||
nt|athene: but cue-bids when it's not clear what trumps are cause so many disasters all the time|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 2@H went down on the defensive crossruff|pg||
nt|athene: declarer tried to get pitches on spades so south got a ruff and then an overruff with the @H9 too|pg||
nt|april7: best lead for EW ofcourse, ducking is best and finding J of @C S would succeed, if not ....but now S played himself down 2|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: i think north could have doubled 7@D there personally :)|pg||
nt|athene: imagine if your teammates have a disaster and go -1 in 6@D...it's nice to bring back +500 and 9 imps in|pg||
nt|ady: if you double with west hand and you find a worthwhile contract ok    but if opps eventually play you have given them a hint of the distribution which may be fatal|pg||
nt|garnetts: I thought that lead might cost and it has |pg||
pc|s5|nt|daman: yes    cannot get to dummy|pg||

nt|rodal f: Belive E will show his @S. If so there are chance for 11 tricks|pg||
nt|garnetts: Taking a leaf from the late Joe Amsbury's book|pg||
nt|ady: north elected to show diamonds first   poor suit|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2@D is dreadful |pg||

mb|d|nt|tweety1: sure 6 @s if no @d lead|pg||

mb|p|nt|tweety1: but these Portugeese are not brave as Vasgo de Gama:)|pg||

nt|haans: do they know what bids mean?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|april7: its a very conservative 4@H though imo!!!|pg||
nt|ady: at last the spades hve arrived|pg||
nt|ady: now e/w need to save|pg||
nt|garnetts: This is a forcing pass situation |pg||
nt|garnetts: west should bid 5@C I think--his defensive tricks are in his sides suits --and the K@D seems wrong |pg||
nt|garnetts: pass is not an option but I bet he wishes he had passed instead of opening |pg||
nt|gambit: this will be a quick claim |pg||
nt|gambit: well, would you believe a slow calim? |pg||

nt|ady: -200 was the cheapest at this stage|pg||
nt|garnetts: well at least the defense is easy--but maybe South has not finished yet |pg||
nt|gambit: trying to see if there is a scissors coup, like spade trick 2 , but that invites disaster |pg||

nt|ady: obvious swing on hand 2  when 6@H was reached at this table|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south might just put this one in game - if it's a weak-only Multi, he might go 4@C asking for transfer|pg||

mb|1C|nt|athene: east might do something first though|pg||

nt|mmmakela: 6nt hanging on same play|pg||
nt|ady: quieter hand here   partial in hearts e/w|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: if double shows a strongish balanced hand, that might kill east's @SJ|pg||
nt|april7: either 2@C nonforc. or 1NT, then revers might lead to 3NT|pg||

nt|rodal f: Y. But if @S4-1?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  6 NT yes, but 7 @S is unlucky|pg||
nt|garnetts: potential to overbid this and it will not pay this time around |pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: 2@H is an odd bid unless it shows hearts and clubs|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|athene: 3@S shows a minimum weak-2@S, we assume (hope :))|pg||
nt|athene: north looks fairly minimum for these colours|pg||
nt|granguru:  3N should be -1|pg||
mb|2S|nt|april7: good 8 points with 6card suit, S should bid game|pg||
nt|xenya: very lucky bid|pg||
nt|haans: 4th @D = 1 clubs loser|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: whether N is strong enough for the 2N rebid is questionable|pg||
nt|april7: y|pg||
nt|granguru:  except on a @C lead|pg||
nt|april7: even more if W triesto make it|pg||
nt|granguru:  which might give time to develop 4@H 3@c AND 2 ACES|pg||
nt|april7: 2@C only|pg||
nt|granguru:  ooops sorry for the capitals|pg||
mb|4S|nt|granguru:  8.25 tricks now|pg||
nt|rodal f:  3@H can be a invit by choose ure major pard and invit. Then they're on there road|pg||
nt|ady: west  might make 3NT on a spade lead|pg||
nt|xenya: whta about 6@S here? |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: club switch is pretty obvious with that dummy, and would kill 4@S for sure|pg||
nt|athene: the defence might have a tougher time if south were declarer, though|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Belive it can become a lucky contract for NS|pg||
nt|mmmakela: against random "good" opponents do u want to be in 6/7  spades|pg||
nt|ady: 3@H  in jeopardy  |pg||
nt|garnetts: this will likely be beaten on a spade lead |pg||
nt|garnetts: No reason to get the clubs right |pg||
nt|ady: will need to guess the club position|pg||
nt|garnetts: suppose South might lead a club :( |pg||
nt|ady: assume 2@S  a game try in hearts   and 3 diamonds some further try|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: most top pairs these days try to put the weak-2 as dummy|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Take @S Ace-Queen, ruff a @D - and it brings 12easy tricks|pg||
nt|garnetts: later in the play a club to the Q guards against 4-1 clubs whereas a club to the King needs a 3-2 break most of the time|pg||

nt|ady: n/s  can make 4@H in spite of 4-1 split    |pg||
nt|garnetts: awkward for NS if west opens 2@S --they need to get to 4@H not 3NT --not easy |pg||
nt|ady: ace of spade right  and diamonds 3-3 helps|pg||
nt|xenya: losing a @H and a @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: but no 6 NT|pg||
mb|1S|nt|granguru:  or 5@H if you wish|pg||
nt|hawe45:  E/W can make 3 @H - so they will bid 4...|pg||

nt|garnetts: It hardly ever gets punished and is pretty disruptive|pg||

pc|s2|nt|ady: south decided if north could not break to call it a day    not unreasonable  4@H is fortunate as it is  and the hearts couid have been facing a doubleton |pg||

nt|tweety1: part score battle|pg||
nt|hawe45:  To me, South has a 15-17 NY|pg||
nt|rodal f: I agree with u Markku. E don't want to play 3NT normaly. But if W had his max(17) and @H support. Could have been the @CQ and not the J|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so -5 in red in vol 3 nt without opps bidding and no freak hands|pg||
nt|garnetts: yes they will not have figured on that I suppose |pg||
nt|gambit: hmmmm|pg||
nt|xenya: all i can say is that i would have certainly got a minus on the last hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: thats true too|pg||
nt|ralfwil: another slam in @h but only on N(!) (@s ruff)|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|athene: north might open 1@D, hoping for 1@D - 1@H - 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: but what he might get is the dummy in 1@D|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now intersting maybe|pg||
nt|rodal f: A hand for Roland again. 20-20|pg||
nt|ady: e/w likely to make 3NT    but will they get there?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|ralfwil: and with this bidding sequence they are on the right way|pg||
nt|haans: 4@H possible|pg||
nt|mmmakela:  4 @H ?|pg||
nt|ady: fortunate diamond position for e/w  south unable to stop the run of the suit|pg||
nt|garnetts: The dreaded lehbensol--I am afraid I would just have bid 3NT as east and hoped for the best |pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: bet he's lurking around somewhere..|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: of course, no-one ever passing 1minor openers these days|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @D? |pg||
nt|haans: opps do help  NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i think 3@D would be a huge underbid|pg||
nt|athene: 3NT gets the hand across|pg||
nt|sybarra: that works also |pg||
mb|3S|nt|ralfwil: ??? 6@s ???|pg||
nt|tweety1: not on @c lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: 14-16 or upgraded to 15 by the middlecards?|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think South is wonerinf if he can jsutify a 3@S bid--and I am not convinced North can justify 2@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: wondering even|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: top club, @C9, spade switch maybe|pg||
nt|haans: Nortyh pass i did not undersand|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|nt|mmmakela: i'd upgrade|pg||
nt|rodal f: Me to:)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: looks like 16 to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: what about 7 @S now???5NT would be Josephine for @H and then one might be able to bid 7|pg||
nt|rodal f: I'll check|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: hmmm...not sure i like the @C4, whatever their methods...doesn't west want to play either a BIG one (@C9) or a SMALL one (@C2)?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: I'd never give up as south here|pg||
nt|ady: J@H switch might beat this|pg||
nt|garnetts: This an occasion where 3@D needed to be played by west--but East can play to drop the K@D as South needs it to justify not just an opening but a think too lol|pg||
nt|ady: will need to avoid the diamond finesse   so that might provoke an overtrick|pg||
nt|gambit: wading into treacherous waters |pg||
nt|xenya: all invitations from E will be firmly turned down by W -- but...|pg||
pc|d2|nt|haans: the more spades you have the less partner have|pg||
nt|mmmakela: the program doesn't see the merits of dias suit|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pc|d8|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: now declarer has to decide whether to cash out for one down or try and sneak a trick through|pg||

nt|rodal f: 15 flat at S hand: http://www.jeffgoldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=KJ10+K2+10987+AK95|pg||
nt|gambit: no invite, not a sound countract and the card Gods, extremely unkind to EW on this one|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mmmakela: automatic 2nd dbl|pg||
pc|hA|nt|garnetts: East should drop it now |pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes  think I would run off a bunch of @D's first |pg||
nt|sybarra: tried to sneak a @s|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|cK|pg||
nt|april7: a very unfortunate decision by S|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps some misunderstanding here -- i mean the 4@S bid|pg||
nt|xenya: no doubt W meant is as a bare minimum, but E might have had other ideas?|pg||
nt|xenya: the good thing (for EW) is that even 4@S might not make here|pg||
nt|vugraphzaq: S is thinking|pg||
nt|gambit: 3@H probably help suit, 4@S acceptance, then perhaps a cue bid allowing room for cooperation|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|athene: if you run diamonds then they know they can't let you have a spade because that gives you nine|pg||
nt|garnetts: well done can claim now |pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|nt|sybarra: true|pg||
nt|april7: E  showed both minor suits so W is likely to have a lot of @S cards|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sybarra: didnt he lead the K?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: what shd N bid Hans ?|pg||
nt|haans: North more likely to have KJx inn spades|pg||
pc|d5|pc|sA|nt|athene: yup|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe low better?|pg||
nt|haans: he have cards to 3@H|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|athene: well, he was trying to look like a man trying to build an entry to dummy, maybe|pg||
nt|haans: or 2nt leb|pg||
nt|mmmakela: NOOOO with 3|pg||
nt|ady: one of the occasions when a 4-1 split is better than 3-2|pg||
pc|c6|nt|haans: you 3@H to make them bid 3@S going down|pg||
nt|mmmakela: One day I promise I'll write a book about appreciating playing strength as opposed to traditional point count even in 1 NT openings......|pg||
nt|rodal f: A spec asked me if Nunes is Claudio. Some who know?|pg||

nt|athene: it's not as though west has @DKx, when he might well duck the @SK|pg||
nt|xenya: another solid game|pg||
nt|april7: lucky stop, because if @S are 3-2 slam is a very good one|pg||
nt|mmmakela: it's south who must act period|pg||
nt|tweety1: action?|pg||
nt|ady: good morning Victor|pg||
nt|garnetts: Good morning Victor|pg||
nt|odysseus69: as I arrive so does a slam|pg||
nt|garnetts: reasonable heart slam |pg||
nt|ady: 6@H  a make for e/w|pg||
nt|odysseus69: good morning David squared|pg||
nt|garnetts: west might open with 1NT which would not make so attractive a proposition |pg||
mb|1N!|nt|athene: declarer was pretty sure where the @SA was|pg||
nt|athene: he could have tried a diamond to the @D10 and a small spade, but when the @D10 holds that's pretty revealing|pg||
nt|april7: another 3NT but going down on very bad breaks everywhere|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i bet they get there|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: basically the defence have to be very sleepy to let that one through|pg||
nt|athene: after the heart switch at trick 2|pg||
nt|april7: another unfortunate 4 @H contract|pg||
nt|mmmakela: anybody upgrading now|pg||
nt|xenya: not another spade slam i hope|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|mmmakela: he did!|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this new 2C convention may work|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: @h is a polular suit to play. now only 3@h on EW|pg||
nt|hawe45:  North - without any reason|pg||
nt|garnetts: Hard to be critical of that as a 1@S rsponse would make a rebid awkward|pg||
nt|gambit: deja vu - all over again?|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|athene: wow, almost a repeat performance here!|pg||
nt|athene: a monster with diamonds facing not very much with @HJ10xxx :)|pg||
nt|april7: exchange NS hand and you have 10 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: not my cup of tea|pg||
nt|rodal f: As hard as EW have bidded before I precume NS to end in 3NT:) A nice contract|pg||
nt|ady: seems to be fashionable to open 1NT on 5-4-2-2 shapes|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but this time game will make|pg||
nt|athene: now east isn't sure whether to show the fifth heart or the spade stop, maybe|pg||
nt|ralfwil: popular..|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i like to play that 3H is now forcing|pg||
mb|4S|nt|daman: East will invite|pg||
nt|odysseus69: however most play as invitational|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: on their way|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: 12-14? And Santos gave up by the 10|pg||
nt|ady: forced now as 5@S will come|pg||
nt|xenya: 25%?|pg||
nt|gambit: good pass by East, though tough not to be tempted |pg||
nt|xenya: slam i meant|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: I had doubled on S in this sequence|pg||
nt|haans: and we see The LAW in action|pg||
nt|garnetts: You and Chris Dixon play all such raises as forcing and have done for years --and I adopted it too--it is an excellent idea--|pg||
pc|dT|nt|hawe45:  9 easy tricks here|pg||
pc|d2|nt|daman: good auction|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mmmakela: the destructing value of 1 NT is underapreciated, IMHO any excuse to open 1 NT is a good one!|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|athene: this is interesting for north actually|pg||
nt|athene: if he puts declarer with the @SK, he might try and play against dummy|pg||
nt|athene: giving declarer the @SK is his ninth trick|pg||
pc|sK|nt|april7: take K and finesse in @C!!!|pg||
nt|daman: impossible for this to make|pg||
nt|april7: but its a good try|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: he might play his partner for the @HK and @CQ and exit a diamond|pg||
nt|daman: maybe if S blocks the @Hs|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think you play 1@H 2@D 2@H 3@H as forcing too |pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: admittedly that gives declarer very little for his negative double|pg||
nt|haans:  some blood|pg||
nt|odysseus69: chris likes the Dixon game try - with the invitational hands just bid game|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|daman: I would have played the @H Jack|pg||
nt|gambit: easy elimination and favourable lie mean 11 tricks |pg||
pc|s8|nt|april7: N will not lead ace after @C Q, but still not possible to make|pg||
pc|d5|nt|xenya: well having walked under the ladder...|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: but sometimes your only chance to beat a contract is to play declarer for not having his bid :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Specs might can tell if NS use 12-14 at non vul.|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|april7: S can't make a mistake!!!|pg||
nt|april7: the last hand was ofcourse very unlucky but selfinflicted !!!|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|nt|haans: some reasons to play @HA|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|odysseus69: yes we do|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|xenya: S should unblock as a matter of course -- but that doesn't make much difference on this layout|pg||
nt|xenya: she prefers to keep quiet -- well done|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|nt|gambit: any black cats around? No four leaf clovers or hoeseshoes so far |pg||
pc|dA|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, the J looks more natural|pg||
nt|april7: even  now not possible to make, butthe chance was there|pg||
nt|april7: defence was trying to help but at no avail|pg||
nt|odysseus69: however we do not play 2/1 |pg||
nt|Walddk4: You can get both, the American way|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1NT  2@C  ;  2@H   3@S   balanced slam try with heart support|pg||
nt|Walddk4: same applies over 2@S response. The opposite major is a slam try|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Then you still have the natural invites|pg||
nt|garnetts: another adjunct to that is 1H  2@C 2@D  2@H should always show two--that was a method I also though very useful |pg||
nt|odysseus69: I like the jumps as splinters- chacun....|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||

nt|mmmakela: brb, cigarrette and Koskenkorva|pg||
nt|rodal f: Better keep for the lungh torpedo:) A small ....... are also ok|pg||

mb|1C|nt|athene: 1@S - 1NT; 2@D - 2@S; and north will make another try, surely|pg||
nt|mmmakela: only 2 aces missing|pg||
nt|haans: he did know as we did HE did not like it|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: I agree--another hand type I do not like--after say 1@D 1@H waht is the best rebid with the South hand?  |pg||
nt|ady: if Q@D  had not dropped   might have finessed 10@C   and plaayed to ruff 2 spades|pg||
nt|xenya: interestingly, 6@S was also bid on 7 in the OR... -- perhaps there is more to the hand than meets the eye?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: perhaps just a gentle 3@D |pg||
nt|haans: 6@S or 6@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: now south will probably just pass it|pg||
nt|april7: 4@S 1 down and 5@D at least 1 down|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sybarra2: and e/w have wrong colors to come in |pg||
nt|xenya: now do you double or bid 2@D as W?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the hearts are a worry for 3nt when partner has ten cards in the pointed suits|pg||
nt|april7: N should bid 3 @S not 2|pg||
nt|mmmakela: time to take an sight check Hans|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|xenya: S will do it for him|pg||
nt|haans: right u are 5@S max|pg||
nt|ady: might get to 4@H here    going down|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: no..|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2NT is showing the hand type and point count--but if you feel you must support hearts how many?  |pg||
nt|gambit: 2 balanced hands over-stretching, and maybe the state of the match |pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|april7: 2@D is a better bid and later X of 2 @S showinf preference for other szuits|pg||
nt|april7: most of zthe times 6-3-3-1|pg||
nt|april7: because with5-4-3-1 X is best|pg||
nt|april7: only @C lead kills the contract of 4@S,@H lead gives S the time to set up the J of @D|pg||

nt|garnetts: Likely to arrive even if you rebid 2NT--fell obliged to remove 3NT to 4@H |pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|athene: wow|pg||
nt|athene: south likes his @SQ and @CA|pg||
nt|athene: but then we saw on board 4 that south doesn't underbid :)|pg||
nt|sybarra2: abd @S are 3/3  can N handle it?|pg||
nt|sybarra2: *and|pg||
nt|ralfwil: discard a @h instead|pg||
nt|ady: passive club best|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 4 top losers|pg||
nt|athene: @DA, @HA, two trumps|pg||
nt|athene: now the @HQ goes away on a club - he might make it|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y. No squize on here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: any chance of dropping heart king?|pg||
nt|garnetts: that trump lead makes matters interesting--|pg||
nt|garnetts: Would east lead from Kxx--maybe we all might fancy that lead |pg||
nt|ady: possible to get heart right|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the failure to return a heart may tip declarer|pg||
nt|ady: with this in north hand and playa diamond seems best|pg||
nt|garnetts: possibly but hard to explain if the were 3-2 with split honours |pg||
nt|ady: win|pg||
nt|ady: 10@C  played now would give extra entry|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra2: cant he get the @H queen away?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mmmakela: can E pull in these zones|pg||
pc|d7|nt|garnetts: that failure to return a heart would be suspicious if he had won with the K--not so much with the Q as he will know partner has the king |pg||
pc|d2|nt|haans: and NS win|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|haans: he did see clubs losers|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|pc|h8|pc|hA|pg||
nt|sybarra2: its his only chance |pg||
nt|athene: when you know declarer has 5-5 in spades and diamonds, perhaps you should lay down the @HA on opening lead|pg||
nt|mmmakela: N's bidding maybe shd tip off to pull, I don't know|pg||
pc|s3|nt|odysseus69: if he won with the king declarer would be sure to drop the Q|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: but of course there are many layouts where that would be catastrophic - @HKx with declarer, or ruff and @HKQ set up in dummy for club pitches, maybe|pg||
nt|athene: opening leads are basically just evil|pg||
nt|mmmakela: the worst leads in general:Jxx Jxxx 10xx Jx against any contract|pg||

nt|xenya: another freak|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|april7: 5@D by W beacuse |pg||
nt|xenya: not that, for some reason he elected to play E for @CA... |pg||
nt|rodal f: 19HP at NS but best spot on|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|april7: @C void|pg||
nt|xenya: all he had to do was place W with both @HA and Q -- very likely on the auction|pg||
nt|daman: exactly|pg||
nt|mmmakela: must have a very strong argument to lead from 1 of those|pg||
mb|d|nt|april7: W will probably X, which is wrong imo|pg||
nt|ady: Sofia got 11 imps on board 7    3NT was bid and made with the AJ10XXX diamonds   3 diamonds played here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this one looks like 1NT but maybe they play weak nt|pg||
nt|garnetts: If they play 15-17 no trump 1@S is surely not best|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra2: N finding the opening bid "interesting"|pg||
nt|daman: they can make 5@D  EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: EW might end up in 4@SX|pg||
nt|daman: but    NS have the @S suit|pg||
nt|daman: and will push the envelope|pg||
nt|xenya: S should invite now i think|pg||
nt|daman: for sure|pg||
nt|xenya: if 2@D shows the majors, it should keep NS out of trouble|pg||
mb|2H|nt|daman: some would bid 4@D|pg||
nt|xenya: with 2@C or something|pg||
nt|april7: 10 tricks in @S also except on @C lead and @H back and so on |pg||
nt|rodal f: If 2@D was inv. min E realy would have had a problem|pg||
mb|d|nt|mmmakela: now 3 nt from S?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now 2@H surely|pg||
nt|gambit: 2@S could be brutal, E too quick to bid 3@C |pg||
mb|2S|nt|xenya: i don't like to splinter with only 3 trumps|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a silly D from W with 4333 and a partners pass|pg||
mb|3C|nt|daman: neither do I but it's common in the USA to do that|pg||
nt|april7: its no asplinter its agood @S raise|pg||
nt|mmmakela: no just 2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @D Acw on-side - so only 200|pg||
nt|garnetts: must admit I would have passed 1@S as north too|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: each to his own of vourse|pg||
nt|xenya: *course|pg||
nt|xenya: slow, accurate auction...|pg||
nt|rodal f: And a coffe breake by 8, normaly 9 tricks NS|pg||
nt|xenya: well passing with a 7-carder is just not done|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sybarra2: got them where he wants them,  skip the X |pg||
nt|athene: wow, gib thinks he can make this|pg||
nt|daman: I definitely would have tried 3@D afain|pg||
nt|odysseus69: very friendly e-w|pg||
nt|gambit: not so sure, perhaps E might have opened 3@C if so ashamed of the defensive prospects (not that I advocate such) with that texture and outside A |pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: again*|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: he has such a great hand    2@S was weak|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra2: hmmmm|pg||
nt|athene: how ya gonna make it, gibby, you have four trump losers!|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ady: a great lay of the trumps  in spade contract     could even make 10 tricks guessing diamond jack|pg||
nt|garnetts: strange hand because 1NT would have ended it and so in my view should 1@S but they get to a dodgy 3 level--but great like of the cards|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i thot that playing forcing nt South had a clear pass over 2S - however the sun is shining for 4S|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sybarra2: pitch to clubs on the hts |pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|athene: south is SO balanced, maybe you can eventually trump endplay him|pg||
nt|sybarra2: *two|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|nt|xenya: not even a faint hope here i think -- but what could EW do?|pg||
nt|gambit: where are 9 tricks going to come from? |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mmmakela: you guys agree? |pg||
nt|gambit: play 2S* |pg||
pc|dQ|pg||

pc|cK|nt|sybarra2: that didnt matter either |pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|pc|c6|pg||

pc|s4|pc|h5|pc|c4|pg||
nt|athene: and then exit a small spade at the end and force him to lead into the trumps|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mmmakela: I have a good theory about prebalances; ask me at mmmakela@@yahoo.com|pg||
pc|h6|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
nt|athene: when you have a big trump holding but no shortage, it's often bad news in defence|pg||
nt|athene: because declarer if he reads the position can cash lots of side-suit winners and you end up with nothing but trumps|pg||
nt|athene: these clever sort of plays abound in textbooks|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: perhaps if south had doubled, it might have tipped declarer off to the trump break (what else can south hand?)|pg||
pc|c8|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|hT|nt|april7: in all those cases trump play is most efective, so S should have switched to trump second trick|pg||

nt|odysseus69: 2NT now|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: And copied the OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: on club lead - not now - |pg||
pc|cA|nt|odysseus69: presumably East would discourage with AQ of clubs|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: north isn't too happy but neither is west!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Fast board|pg||
nt|mmmakela: S irritated now|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mmmakela: NEXT|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|athene: his 2@S in a forcing auction, not giving partner a chance to double 2@D, did show a weak hand|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@H is a good stop i think, even though 10 tricks can be made|pg||
nt|april7: E should go 1 down on good defence, that means N should play the 9, because S has a natural trump trick anywaybut E must play trumps carefully, not Q or J at first round|pg||

nt|odysseus69: these days with many playing transfer responses to 1C you get a lot of swings caused by declaring from different side|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Here we might have our fun|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y. Some nice thing can be on, but bid it|pg||
nt|ady: slam time|pg||
nt|ady: will certainly be easy if south opens|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this is a good one|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra2: a long set to go but hate to leave first set down 37 or so |pg||
nt|mmmakela: 6 dias by south seems ok|pg||
nt|odysseus69: weak 2H not for me|pg||
nt|xenya: second game in a row missed -- assuming game could be made on the previous hand |pg||
mb|1D|nt|tweety1: 2@d=?  multi?|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 2@S invite if hearts|pg||
nt|tweety1: if so?  too good hand to bid 2 @d|pg||
nt|odysseus69: easy now|pg||
nt|ady: best  played by north    if c lub finesse is wrong but they are 3-3 then spade finess not required|pg||
mb|2N|nt|haans: yes seems to be multi|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: yes max hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  1 @H - when @s-suit is better|pg||
nt|mmmakela: that damn partner blew that chance.....|pg||
mb|3N|nt|xenya: he has a third ear for those F*** and G*** words|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: 3NT is very unfortunate to find 5 @D to the 10 in one opponent hand|pg||
nt|mmmakela: agree clear 1 @S opening|pg||
nt|rodal f: 13,75 for S opening: http://www.jeffgoldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=KJ85++1097+AQ5432|pg||
nt|gambit: Thanks to Vlad and our fabulous operator and attentive audience, Sadly, I must depart, congrats to the players too for a hard fought, entertaining match, gl to all |pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Will EW need to pay by Leal's 1@H?|pg||
nt|xenya: thank you, Cam -- bye |pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  After 1 @H in East, can you really expect a !@S-lead?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or will W X for asking an other color? If 6@D|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|april7: nice bidding,whatever it means|pg||
nt|daman: Canelas got a little back on 11|pg||
nt|hawe45:  A question is - for East: Who shall I trust?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: played the right way up|pg||
nt|ady: east might lead J@C|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ady: Q@D  also a decent lead|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|april7: W is thinking of bidding 4@H with 2 weak suits though, nothingwrong with Dx|pg||
nt|mmmakela: aces don't seem so important, just bid 6 and see if they find spade lead|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ralfwil: S had a 5-4 in majors, so after 2@d he should bid 2@h and partner will correct or pass with 3-2 in majors|pg||
pc|s2|nt|april7: I didn't think of this contract at all|pg||
nt|xenya: i wish i knew what all that bidding is about|pg||
nt|rodal f: If a @H NS still only have 11 tricks or?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But something is blocking - one down!|pg||
pc|s7|nt|rodal f: A hook can be made in @C|pg||
nt|mmmakela: if they are both offside|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Please giv me a wake-up call, if this will make...?|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|haans: do not understand 3@S still a weak 2?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: if a weak 2 in nv/v can be that good I change pd sry|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|nt|mmmakela: it will|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Communication is too bad - one down even double-dummy, I dare say|pg||
nt|xenya: that was a classic auction -- but it does look like 8 tricks is not the limit here|pg||
pc|dK|nt|granguru: declarer could try to endplay S with @H waiting for him to lead from @SK ..not the case here|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h3|nt|granguru: defense can now run only 3@Hs|pg||
pc|h5|nt|tweety1: 3@s =  II am regretfull :)|pg||

pc|c5|nt|granguru: small @s from both hands is a winning line|pg||

nt|ady: 2@H opening from Santos could be painful|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and another|pg||
nt|xenya: still two more boards to play?|pg||
nt|vugraphzaq: sorry 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: not very interesting!!|pg||
nt|ady: slam for e/w here   6NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|athene: 6nt is best here, but no-one can be criticized for ending in 6@H, i guess|pg||
nt|sybarra2: not easy to land in 6 nt |pg||
nt|athene: well, east does have a lot of hcp|pg||
nt|xenya: and one of them is certainly not without interest|pg||
nt|vugraphzaq: 15 and 16 to play here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: on board 10 -800 in 1@sX|pg||
nt|ady: Santos did not open |pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|sybarra2: its not matchpoints |pg||
nt|rodal f: And a coffe board|pg||
mb|r|nt|sybarra2: sp likely E will prefer @H's|pg||
nt|xenya: in the OR, EW got a tad too high, but declarer managed to make |pg||
mb|5C|mb|5D|nt|haans: more misdefense now when they never stop in partscore :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: a somewhat surprising (to me) push on 12 -- NS in the OR also stopped in 1@S making 4|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|athene: interesting that both Easts started the same way - transfer to hearts, then 3@C|pg||
nt|ady: assoon as a heart is played  there should be a quick declaration|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i wonder if it's some artificial scheme?|pg||
nt|xenya: should be flat|pg||
nt|rodal f: Resault after 4 round: http://www.freewebs.com/fpbridge/CNEO_Final_2009_R4.pdf|pg||
mb|p|pc|c2|nt|athene: more likely they had to invent a club suit as otherwise it's hard to develop the bidding|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra2: 3 nt not worst contract in the world either |pg||
nt|mmmakela: seems this needs THE lead to beat it|pg||

nt|ritong: i would, in any case|pg||
mb|3C|nt|xenya: this might be interesting|pg||

mb|4D|nt|ritong: yes, i m a kind of wired guy|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But a @C-shift would be interesting|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: 4@H no make with @CA lead |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: sorry overruff|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: 4@H can probably come to 11 tricks for a flat board|pg||
nt|granguru:  last hand of the 3/7 set|pg||
nt|vugraphzaq: last hand here, we´ll come back at 5.30pm|pg||
nt|vugraphzaq: ty all|pg||
nt|ritong: declarer should draw three @hs, in case someone shows out|pg||
nt|ritong: that would severely impact the @s break odds|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: i assume in 3nt it was a spade lead and declarer cleared clubs and NS continued spades rather than taking the @DAK to hold it to ten|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hT|pc|h9|nt|athene: declarer will play diamonds here for a pitch of the @C10, maybe|pg||

nt|ady: e/w have done well      west seems to have bid very carefully here  may get a swing   may be in game going down in OR|pg||
pc|s5|nt|xenya: prudent pass by S -- couldn't N have something like AQxx in @Hs? |pg||
pc|s2|nt|xenya: the lead also helped i think|pg||
nt|granguru:  bye friends|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ritong: since declarer evidently would have finessed to south, because if he finds another @d contract is safe|pg||
