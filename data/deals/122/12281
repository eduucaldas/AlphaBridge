mb|p|mb|2D|nt|othered1: Why 1@D?|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure it matters who plays it |pg||
nt|Walddk4: I am sorry to say that the team names are reversed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Funnily enough the Herbst brothers play for Herbst|pg||
nt|othered1: do they respond only in 4-card majors or might 1@D have been a transfer response?|pg||
nt|vugraphzbs: i have no clue, and i cant ask for alerts verbaly|pg||

nt|vugraphzbs: explaning silently|pg||
nt|sybarra: as they always do |pg||
nt|sybarra: or write verrrrrrrrrrry small |pg||
nt|vugraphzbs: 1c-1x = transfer i was told|pg||
nt|april7: actually no problem in this contract, whoever plays it, but the bidding was funny|pg||
nt|april7: nowadays there is alot transferbidding going on|pg||
nt|vugraphzbs: 1cl-1nt=game forcing with diamonds|pg||
nt|othered1: Yes and 2@D might not be everyone's choice on south's hand|pg||

nt|april7: E might be squeezed |pg||
nt|othered1: It's cash out now or lose an extra overtrick|pg||
nt|sybarra: cash it or you dont get it |pg||
nt|april7: caing 3@S and 5 @C E is squeezed|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry Ed, you were faster than I was |pg||
nt|othered1: south did reverse, so east has some clues that cashing could be right.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Barel-Zack in the Israeli open team for the Europeans in June in Belgium|pg||
nt|daman: a slam to start?|pg||
nt|roswolf: 6@D perhaps?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Dream on, gents|pg||
nt|hedyg: i have a CC for Bareket but with another pd : http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008Pau-european/OpenTeams/Israel/Bareket-Roll.pdf|pg||
nt|henryb: Another case of SDAM (six diamonds always makes!)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: First, they are off two keycards for diamonds|pg||
nt|roswolf: after a strong NT they might well have a sniff at the slam|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The worst thing about this is that the team names are reversed on the scoreboard|pg||
nt|henryb: still, Roland, when you have an 11 card fit the trump K is not always relevant|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2D|nt|Walddk2: Itamar?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We have the wrong home team|pg||
nt|hedyg: we cannot change that now, can now?|pg||
nt|roswolf: now south may be able to get his hand pattern over cheaply|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not unless the operators shut down|pg||
mb|3S|nt|roswolf: so Herbst is leading?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: But funnily enough Bareket plays for Bareket|pg||
nt|roswolf: ahhhhhhhh|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: diamonds may be never mentioned as a real suit|pg||
nt|hedyg: anybody bid @ds first?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|henryb: and I suppose you will tell me that both Herbst's play for Herbst|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: may well be played in 4/6@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: Lengy needed a !@d cuebid|pg||
pc|dK|nt|roswolf: only 4|pg||
nt|daman: nah      a screeching halt     South didn't think he had enough soldiers|pg||
nt|hedyg: not without a @d cuebid|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb: 5-6 with a five card major and a 6 card minor is always difficult to convey|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: north opens - i agree for what it is worth|pg||
nt|hedyg: i believe in raising with 4 cards even with a passed pd|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|henryb: three aces? how could you not|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Absolutely, pass should show three|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|hedyg: now pull the brakes|pg||
nt|roswolf: well there is a fallacy about 15 spade points |pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|hedyg: that is oldfashioned :)|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|daman: can smell burning rubber the brakes are pushed so hard|pg||
nt|henryb: that's a matchpoint foible|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: I wonder if 3@C was forced|pg||
pc|hA|nt|henryb: besides three aces are worth about 13 1/2 points, so the N hand is 15 1/2 Pearson points|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe it shows a minimum hand..|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|h4|pg||
nt|henryb: 3@c showed a minimum|pg||
nt|hedyg: no alerts|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Itamar will shut down after this hand to get the team names right|pg||
