nt|ritong: brad vs mom|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2H|nt|me argent: alot of Y K and Zs at this table|pg||
nt|kit: South will compete to 3@H with 6 hearts and stiff club, and that should end it.|pg||
nt|kareno: I concur.|pg||
mb|2N|mb|d|nt|kit: not sure I see motivation behin this call -- it should be a game try, and he just isn't worth it.|pg||
nt|frankaus: both red i dont expect any heroics|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: What's the purpose of that 3@d bid?  invitation?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Vugraphu2: and one of them isn't even polish|pg||
nt|mrace: must be |pg||
nt|josj: hi Frank|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day Jos Jacobs welcome|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: hi all and selamat siang|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d3|nt|kareno: We're on a wavelength, Kit.|pg||
nt|kareno: And it has given west too much information.  |pg||
nt|kit: no reason for West to lead anything but a trump with everything under control.|pg||
nt|josj: this can go down on a club ruff but it probably won't|pg||
pc|dA|nt|dburn: odd sort of bidding, this, especially at BAM|pg||
nt|dburn: but West seemed unwilling to open or to rebid 1NT|pg||
nt|mrace: he heard ya |pg||
nt|ritong: she|pg||
nt|mrace: sry she|pg||
nt|ritong: gail greenberg|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer will lead club up immediately, and make with club ace on and hearts 2-2 -- can eventually ruff third diamond in dummy.|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, it gives up a spade trick, that is a reason not to lead trumps |pg||
nt|kit: Normal result, and that was achieved in other room.|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|kit: West had has awkward rebid -- hate to bid 2@D, but weak to reverse for most|pg||
nt|dburn: and did not consider he had enough for 2@h|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|nt|me argent: i like 2@Cs|pg||
nt|gowdy: I admit I would have pushed with 2 H's|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@c certainly possible, but only if 2@h-3@h is natural after it|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|kit: some would solve problem by opening 1NT, but that has obvious flaws also|pg||
nt|josj: well it still can...|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kit: will win in dummy, pitch spade on king of clubs, and diamond to king.|pg||
nt|kareno: I am not fond of trump leads|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|nt|xenya: the question is whether EW can make 8 tricks in 1N -- on the surface, they can't|pg||
nt|kareno: They give up tempo and if you need to get your suits going, tempo matters a lot!|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kit: might not be fond of them, but on this hand was clear (although it turned out badly this time)|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c5|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|nt|me argent: i played with kokish much too long to ever consider bidding 2@Hs|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, West has bought pretty well for his actual sequence - he isn't going lots down in a 5-1 or 5-0 fit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: After 4 rounds: 1. Nickell 2.Delmonte  3.Kendrick 4. Polowan 5.Shugart 6.Kwiecien  7. Spector 8.Becker  9.Greenberg 10.Diamond |pg||
nt|gowdy: no  the question is how could they ever find 1NT|pg||
nt|xenya: 1@D -- 1@S -- 1N?|pg||
nt|me argent: opening 1nt?|pg||
nt|dburn: well, if you are not prepared to open it, maybe you ought to be prepared to rebid it|pg||
nt|gowdy: transfer then Joey|pg||
nt|xenya: then E might transfer|pg||
nt|me argent: i must admit i open 1@D and rebid 2@Cs|pg||
nt|gowdy: playing weak NT then perhaps|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: I wonder why W isn't claiming?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
nt|me argent: not close 4 moi|pg||
nt|dburn: still, the reverse at the other table got a minus score, so this is a win for Spector|pg||

nt|josj: as declarer did not want to take the @C finesse, he accepted one down right from the start...|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: I'd be passing with south's hand...|pg||
mb|1C|nt|josj: yes, should be|pg||
nt|josj: apparently NS play Strong Club|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mrace: yes u dont have QX in @H Karen :)|pg||
nt|ritong: no way brad passes, i think|pg||
nt|kit: 2@S looks a lot more descriptive than pass to me, but to each his own.|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|kit: 3@H may be somewhat conservative -- but East will probably bid game anyway.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kareno: Well, I hate to bid a jack-high suit first or second seat.  Too often it seduces partner into leading from honor-x to the detriment of the defense.|pg||
nt|ritong: he had a tough decision, with this scoring|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: I'll worry about that when the bidding is over|pg||
nt|ritong: no doubt he would not think twice playing imps|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|frankaus: this looks like a very strange aution|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kit: If South bids out his shape here, North may make the winning decision to play 4@S|pg||
nt|kit: Well, he got the disaster lead -- and won the board!|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, IMPs is a different reward system :)|pg||
nt|ritong: but kit is right, jeff hand is a conservative player in general|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kit: But instead North unnecessarily rushed to 3NT|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he didn't get the chance, which is a bit odd|pg||
nt|me argent: EW play polish@C so that probably influenced their choice of bids on 13|pg||
pc|sK|nt|me argent: and 14 for that matter|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, sure - in Polish Club that sequence is automatci|pg||
nt|me argent: sorry cant keep my directions streight this is my first job|pg||
nt|kit: declarer will probably duck first heart, win second, and go after clubs|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kit: I don't see that much difference between IMPs and matchpoints on East hand -- you bid game if you think it is a favorite, not otherwise, at both games.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|kit: Note that after the initial pass at other table they had no difficulty getting to game|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|pg||

nt|mrace: i am bidding it in both...4 trumps and an Ace is too much to pass to a pd who overcalled at 3 level....just the @H support may make pd's hand a giant|pg||
nt|josj: yes...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|kit: Now the old choice -- 3NT or 4@H?|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2S|nt|josj: but if W showed @S and it was alerted, 2NT is not easy to understand|pg||
nt|frankaus: 4@S EW may be playable here|pg||
nt|josj: sure but makeable? try a @D lead|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|kit: North afraid to compete to 3@H, fearing his partner will play him for invite values|pg||
nt|kit: Doesn't seem to me that whether partner has 3 hearts or not should make much difference.|pg||
nt|kareno: 2@h is a bit of an underbid with that hand, no?|pg||
nt|mrace: too many QJs|pg||
nt|kareno: Any more and she would have a 1nt opener.  |pg||
nt|kit: I would have bid 3NT on East hand, right or wrong.|pg||
nt|mrace: after 1 nt ? |pg||
nt|mrace: or 2@H ? |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|me argent: but north did well to get his side out of nt|pg||
nt|josj: N should pass now but will he know that?|pg||
nt|josj: yes he did!|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kit: was just as well, as 3@H probably down 2 losing both club finesses|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|nt|kit: after 1NT|pg||
nt|kareno: This form of scoring that makes great sense, kit.|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed he did - that was a pretty good view|pg||
nt|ritong: agree, kit|pg||
nt|frankaus: this is likely to make|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|nt|me argent: south playing 1nt in OR on a @D lead|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kit: very unusual hand where at IMPs I'd tend toward 4@H, but at matchpoints 3NT -- it is usually the other way around.|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|gowdy: good bid by E not 100% obvious|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|me argent: a triumph 4 Garbage Stayman|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|nt|josj: even more likely now :)|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|cA|nt|gowdy: yep   that 2 is not 100%|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|nt|kit: making them all, but lose the board|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|d4|nt|josj: maybe an overtrick now as the hearts go on the @S|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ritong: again|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d3|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h2|nt|me argent: easts action irrelevant on this hand north won the bd with 2@Cs|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Next match Greenberg vs Kendrick|pg||
nt|gowdy: but he can only do what he can do|pg||
nt|dburn: if Kendrick still bids as he used to, should be an interesting match|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: There's a problem with bd 16, they're skipping to 17 and they'll get a substitute bd 16|pg||
nt|josj: no he played safe lready|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kit: at IMPs the major needs to take 2 extra tricks to be really better, so lean towards notrump if close.  At matchpoints, needs to take only 1 extra trick.|pg||
nt|josj: a|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||

mb|p|nt|kit: E-W have easy 4@S -- the question is how many clubs will North bid, and how many hearts will South bid|pg||

nt|josj: taking the ace and returning a @C also does not help NS|pg||
pc|dA|nt|me argent: 4@Ss final contract OR|pg||
nt|dburn: meanwhile, at this table East is battling to take as many overtricks as he can in 3NT|pg||
nt|kit: declarer will probably persist with diamonds -- works very well, but only 11 tricks as North guards hearts and South spades|pg||
nt|dburn: two will do, since 4@s at the other table will not make more than 10 tricks|pg||

mb|p|nt|frankaus: how many @H will be bid ? - & how many will they make?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|kareno: Now I would overcall with that north hand.|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|nt|kit: overcall on North hand marginal|pg||
nt|kareno: 1@s just loses the heart suit forever.|pg||
nt|kit: North will be back in with 2@H -- this time.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: South had other options -- I don't know what is best|pg||
nt|me argent: do everybody agree with norths final pass?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|gowdy: not me !|pg||
nt|Walddk4: After 6: 1. Delmonte 14.95 2. Nickell 13.05 3. Kwiecien  12.00 4. Kendrick 11.61 5. Polowan 9.88 6. Shugart 9.2 7. Becker 8. Spector 9.Greenberg  10.Diamond |pg||
nt|kit: definitely agree -- North "has his bids" -- nothing extra.  North is expected to hold 6 points when they preempt.|pg||
nt|me argent: even with adverse ruff and @HK offside NS make 10 tricks in @Hs|pg||
nt|kit: lif is like that -- South could be a LOT weaker for the 3@H call|pg||
nt|gowdy: ok I relent pass is best|pg||
nt|dburn: sure - pass of 3@H close to obvious at BAM, even close to normal at IMPs|pg||
nt|me argent: unless east quacks the opening @S lead|pg||
nt|gowdy: so my answer is i'm happy to be here and not there|pg||
nt|kit: and not even clear that 4@H will make -- there is that 4th round of clubs, you know|pg||
nt|mrace: he doesnt need to |pg||
nt|kareno: Kwiecien treating his hand like 5-4|pg||
nt|josj: good question|pg||

nt|ritong: effortless|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|kit: 2@H overcall clear in my book opposite passed hand -- partner can't have enough to bury you by bidding 3NT or something like that|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|dA|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s6|pc|sK|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kit: play will go quickly here, with ace of spades still an entry.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kareno: His partner is moving to slam missing KQ of his suit.|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|sA|nt|dburn: well, it depends on the extent to which 1@d shows diamonds, perhaps|pg||
nt|dburn: five-card majors, and all...|pg||
nt|dburn: still, I'd have opened the bidding|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Next up: Becker vs Diamond|pg||
nt|gowdy: well it does not deny @D|pg||
nt|kit: If East hadn't returned a spade, declarer might well have gone wrong -- taking diamond finesse instead of spade finesse, for example.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Roland will post standings when they're available|pg||
nt|gowdy: true  give e aq @S and ak of @C  then  @D q is on side with the bidding|pg||
nt|kit: of course if East didn't have queen of diamonds, he might just cash ace of spades fearing declarer could take 7 hearts and 5 diamonds|pg||
nt|xenya: even holding the @DQ, he might fear declarer can take 12 tricks|pg||
nt|gowdy: and then why did w lead a club  must have a @s card|pg||
nt|kit: from QJ10 of clubs, club lead would be pretty clear -- no inference there I don't think|pg||
nt|kit: Holding guarded queen of diamonds East doesn't need to cash -- how can declarer take 12 tricks?|pg||

mb|p|nt|frankaus: saying it will make usually invokes the commetators curse :(|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|d9|nt|gowdy: cute splinter in P suit  well bid|pg||
nt|kit: thoughtful 4@H splinter -- in case North has slam possibilities|pg||
nt|kit: missed 4-4 club fit, but this probably plays as well |pg||
nt|kareno: And in the OR, South is playing 4@s.  That will be down several I think, and vulnerable no less.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: N to E: We haven't discussed this auction.|pg||
nt|kit: However, the splinter will keep East away from heart lead|pg||

nt|kit: and he will probably lead a low trump|pg||
nt|josj: and he's right provided S wins and plays a @C|pg||
