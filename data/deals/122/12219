mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ritong: wow|pg||
nt|ritong: jan is not determined to let this board go|pg||
nt|reisig: Not 3@H by Jansma ?   :) :)|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|me argent: 8@Ss played by EW final contract OR|pg||
nt|kit: normal 4@H contract, but it may matter where declarer first plays the hearts from if a spade lead, as there is danger of the 10 of hearts scoring on  promotion|pg||
nt|ritong: was a decision:)|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|xenya: 4@H 1 down, so is 3@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: slam as cards lie with hts btreaking 3/3 but not a good slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: 3@H looks very conservative -- was devaluing his spade and diamond holdings -- but that can be overdone|pg||
mb|4C|nt|kareno: Hello from not-so-sunny Las Vegas :)|pg||
nt|ritong: hi|pg||
nt|kit: The 3@D call got the diamond lead, and now declarer can't have any problems as the cards lie|pg||

nt|kareno: Henri :)  Kit :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Richie @h@h@h|pg||
nt|kit: hi|pg||
nt|ritong: from his point of view, this is a singleton|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|xenya: sorry 3@S 2 off|pg||
nt|lestergold: North has a move on south's bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: think south a little timid here|pg||
nt|me argent: i like double over 3@Ss|pg||
nt|xenya: and 4@H makes -- doubly sorry|pg||
nt|me argent: after all partner came in vul at 3 level|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: declarer may have found an unexpected way to lose a third heart trick|pg||
pc|cA|nt|me argent: a point 4 nickel team|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|nt|ritong: no.|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|lestergold: well North's pass conservative unless Ive misunderstood south's bidding|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mdgraham: NS strong club, so 3@D doesn't carry the same "extra values" overtones as in a natiral system|pg||
pc|s6|nt|gowdy: no way|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: 3@D = @S raise with @D|pg||
nt|reisig: BAM is brutal at times|pg||
nt|kit: if he things the lead is a singleton, he could easily get this wrong|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|ritong: no|pg||
nt|gowdy: whew|pg||
nt|kareno: Surviving that hurdle.|pg||
nt|ritong: because west would have hopped trump ace to give the ruff|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d8|pc|dA|nt|lestergold: sure but 4c cue is pretty encouraging and north holds the dim control the nut cards in the majors - worth a move surely?|pg||

nt|me argent: 6nt or 6@Cs?|pg||
nt|barnets: top spot 6N|pg||
nt|barnets: by west|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Not so good played by East but it would make|pg||
mb|2S|mb|d|nt|dburn: well, West has laid claim to 6@c already|pg||
mb|3S|mb|4H|nt|dburn: and will lay claim to notrump in a minute|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulhac:  True|pg||
nt|dburn: East will move - in fact, he might just bid a slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|dburn: but 4@c is the technical route|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Sensible giving all the options in slam choice|pg||
nt|me argent: keeping 7 in the picture|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|me argent: east will now sign of in 6|pg||
nt|paulhac:  West does not like his doubleton club despite having top cards|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Hampson had the pass card out, but is thinking some more|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: pass seems a bit pessimistic, but it's true that if West had a stiff club, slam might not be so great|pg||
mb|p|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s3|pg||
pc|d2|nt|paulhac:  Could easily be off 2 top cards and as they have only 29 between them|pg||
nt|dburn: and I guess West could be weaker than he is, but even so...|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||
nt|barnets: looks like both e and w undervalued their hands here to miss the cold slam|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: I think we will have Becker vs Polowan next round, but some of the team numbers changed between sessions and I'm not certain I have them right now. |pg||
nt|dburn: sure - neither did anything really stupid, but both conservative at the same time|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: 6 minutes to go in the round|pg||
nt|barnets: i think shugart will push this round with a win on his board|pg||
nt|me argent: think east more than west but difficult to say since they know their system better than we do|pg||
nt|barnets: h did not bid his 9 high  heart suit|pg||
nt|dburn: trouble was, East could not really do anything without leaving what might be a safe haven in 4NT|pg||
nt|paulhac:  I think it was tough again its easy for us |pg||
nt|me argent: robsons bid of 2@Hs screwed up their auction so credit 2 him|pg||
nt|barnets: in other room north passed not a big surprise|pg||
nt|barnets: that was fred|pg||
nt|dburn: was he dealing with a strong club also?|pg||
nt|barnets: and they reached the top spot of 6N by W|pg||
nt|me argent: oui|pg||
nt|barnets: yes but I dont blame him|pg||
nt|barnets: he is a disciplined player|pg||
nt|me argent: nor do i blame robson|pg||
nt|dburn: after pass - strong club at these colors, I would blame anyone who failed to overcall on a six-card suit, but...|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Its right to intervene in case you can bounce them before they know any fit they have|pg||
nt|barnets: but you give away any trump guess|pg||
nt|paulhac:  But also it might give the distribution away|pg||
nt|paulhac:  As both David and Barnet state there are + and -|pg||
nt|barnets: also perhaps there may be a difference between imps and match point scoring|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Kit Woolsey|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Kit|pg||
nt|ritong: so, he could get this wrong, but not easily:)|pg||
nt|gowdy: no the key was not losing to k 10|pg||
nt|lestergold: but it was on and it may well be bid in the open room|pg||
nt|josj: easy to get a little too high and worthwhile too|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: so East should have won first round of hearts with, ace, not king, then.|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: a question of which pair gets into trouble here|pg||
nt|kareno: mmm club slam I see|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, absolutely so|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|lestergold: looks like a reasonable 3N contract here for E/W|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|kit: 6NT clearly optimal here, not 6@C|pg||
nt|kareno: 6nt definitely safer.|pg||
nt|lestergold: quite easy to make no defence|pg||
nt|josj: rather a coffee hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|me argent: i like cleeffs 3@D bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|lestergold: indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: and, in a sort of bonus, system right handed no trumps, so they will get there i guess|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|kit: hard to fault the 3NT call, but it works out very badly|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: ecco|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Good auction and it is, as Henri points out, right-sided.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ritong: ugly board for greco hampson, although robson did not leave them alone|pg||
nt|kit: pretty hard to imagine wrong-siding it|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pc|s3|pg||
nt|me argent: this will be very tough to make a defensive revoke would help|pg||
nt|xenya: put EW on the spot -- a point for AC|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|kit: in other room North bid only 2@D, and that gave E-W a chance to escape|pg||
nt|me argent: so cleefs approach helped win the board 4 NS|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ritong: right sided means " i am declarer" for jansma:)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kareno: lol|pg||
nt|kit: I think opposite a strong 1@C opening the East hand should just drive it to slam|pg||
nt|ritong: who, by the way, is a super nice guy and does not deserve dubious jokes like that one  sorry, jan|pg||
nt|kareno: I agree, Kit - I think Greco dogged it.|pg||
nt|kareno: Do we have any update on positions?  |pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Next up is Becker vs Polowan|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Standings are posted 1 round behind, so nothing since the 1st session|pg||
nt|kareno: I believe standings after the half would be posted at www.acbl.org, no?|pg||
nt|kareno: Also specs asking for any updates on the NA Swiss.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s6|nt|Vugraphu2: Jan says hello to all his friends out there :)|pg||
nt|me argent: personally i also would have bid 3nt on this auction with mecks hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Meant Jan Van Cleef. Jan Martel is operating VG in the OR|pg||
nt|me argent: give jon @H@H from me|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: We aren't displaying team names because the match-ups change every 3 boards|pg||

nt|dburn: at any rate, West may feel he has some catching up to do|pg||
nt|me argent: rightfully so david|pg||
nt|paulhac:  But what can he bid? good hand for Asptro|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Sorry - I couldn't read the note on the NE side, but S gave me the right point count - both wrote either bal, or 5332 or 5422 or 4441, but not enough room for me to write that|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphu1: I think that Morgan said 2@c is Majors|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s5|nt|barnets: looks like e/w may be in trouble|pg||
pc|s2|nt|barnets: start x|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Nunes asked about 2@s & 3@c and Polowan shrugged - I think he thought 2@c was hearts and a minor|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Some play 2@C as a passed hand to show clubs and a major|pg||
nt|me argent: opening the bidding might well have been safer|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Or maybe @CS + Major, I don't know|pg||
nt|barnets: south will x this|pg||
nt|dburn: well, if East thinks West has majors, East-West are indeed in depp trouble|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: East definitely took the spade & heart cards out of his bidding box and showed them to N, so I'm pretty sure he thinks it's Majors|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Are they not already there David?|pg||
nt|dburn: not altogether clear what West is doing, though - maybe he is playing Astro, where 2@c is hearts and another|pg||
nt|dburn: but I would not expect Polowan to be playing that|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: East asking to look at NS's convention card.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|dburn: perhaps 2@c is supposed to be DONT - clubs and another|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h2|nt|barnets: perhaps they play2 systems|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|me argent: dont think EW a partnership of long standing so lots of room for error|pg||
nt|dburn: but no, East still thinks it is the majors|pg||
nt|paulhac:  When I played with michael 2@C by a passed hand was clubs and a major|pg||
nt|barnets: 1 over wk nt and 1 over strong|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: I can now see Polowan's note about 2@c - clubs + Major|pg||
nt|me argent: morgan obviously doesnt agree|pg||
nt|barnets: west is plying meckwell as a passed hand|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|s3|nt|barnets: had he not passed 2C would be majors|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Polowan: "sorry, I thought we used our strong NT defense by a passed hand"|pg||
nt|me argent: in CR NS playing 2@Ss|pg||
pc|s6|nt|paulhac:  Either he forgot West was a passed hand or they have a disagreement about whether 14-16 is weak or strong|pg||
nt|barnets: anyway not much of a success|pg||
nt|me argent: not doubled|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s7|pg||
nt|dburn: I still don't believe that 1NT was 14-16 - that would mean a complete rewrite of "standard Fantunes"|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Joey South doubled!|pg||
nt|sybarra: not easy for sure|pg||
nt|dburn: not in the closed room, he didn't|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry |pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|nt|kit: 7NT quite reasonable, but on lie of cards (spade hook off, squeeze not working) it goes down|pg||
nt|me argent: this hand should test EWs bidding methods|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3C|nt|kit: they might play limit raise or better for the 2NT call|pg||

mb|p|nt|kit: anybody have any idea what the rules are here|pg||

nt|Vugraphu2: Q is led card, 2 is penalty, must be played at 1st legal opportunity.|pg||

nt|Vugraphu2: W is thinking....|pg||

nt|lestergold: I would be standing on the chair doubling|pg||
nt|josj: only 50 p. extra :)|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|nt|Vugraphu2: declarer wasn't given options, card that's supposed to be led is the led card.|pg||

nt|kit: very heavy 3@S opening -- may lead to missed game|pg||

mb|3N|nt|xenya: it's just their style it seems|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: apparently East can expect that strong a preempt, since he bid the game|pg||
nt|me argent: so it seems because one cannot argue with the final contract|pg||
nt|xenya: considering E had no difficulty raising to 4|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: I raised my pd to 4 with a void a couple of nights ago.  But I had 19 HCP!|pg||
nt|kit: effective lead by North, setting up quick heart trick and giving declarer a problem -- should he use his entry for a spade play, or should he go after clubs?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: I think he will go after clubs, although on the lie of the cards a spade play is more successful|pg||
nt|kareno: Certainly a reasonable bid.  Six makes with the club position AND the heart finesse.|pg||
nt|kit: 4@S not such a bad opening bid IMO -- even if you have a good slam, will you really be able to find it?|pg||
nt|josj: longest & strongest or else...|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm 3N shouldnt make dim lead kills it immediately for exampkle|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||

nt|josj: definitely|pg||
mc|7|nt|kit: not 100% clear, but yes, odds are North has king of clubs from South's silence -- still, what bid could South have made?|pg||

mb|2H|an|!H +minor|nt|dburn: at least, if he is aware of it then 1@h is truly bizarre|pg||
nt|paulhac:  So East may think its a takeout of hearts|pg||
nt|barnets: and east found a club lead V 3n in replay great lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: S's alert was very clear|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: OK - then West bid hearts, South's suit, in the face of a partner who could not bid over 1@c|pg||
nt|dburn: vulnerable against not, noch zu|pg||
nt|dburn: still, so one can ever double anyone for penalty any more|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: I think that playing the 1@h bid as natural is the least common method I've seen - most play DBL to show @ds and 1@h as T/O. Some play DBL as T/o of @hs and 1@h as Michaels. A few ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: play 1@h as natural|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h2|pc|hT|nt|dburn: so you can bid what you like, and maybe the opponents will believe you even when partner doesn't|pg||
nt|barnets: right sided this|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|hK|pg||
pc|d7|nt|dburn: East's redouble may have been of the Rosenkrantz variety - Hx in hearts|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|barnets: the club lead from west put the contract down 2 in other room|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: Swiss:  lall 85.46; lynch 82.3; agica 78.97|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|lestergold: N/S have an opportunity to overbid here to a less than 50% spade game which here is zero percent due to the 4/1 break|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|ahri: is there a link to standings, please, karen?|pg||
nt|kit: South invites, and North will certainly bid game with the good 5-card suit|pg||
nt|josj: plus a chance of gettign X'ed|pg||
nt|lestergold: no danger of that|pg||
nt|mdgraham: what's wrong with 2@S from North?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: three trumps to the ace and a side doubleton|pg||
nt|josj: good question|pg||
nt|lestergold: i know that north cant envisage a game but are they not playing 5 card majors in which case a defensive raise to 2S would be mandatory|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s3|nt|josj: they are but 1@S is limited |pg||
pc|s4|nt|josj: which is of relative relevance only|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kit: some kind of artificiality there -- maybe 2@S was a size ask and 3@C showed a maximum?|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm not aware if there is unless it is on ACBL's home page www.acbl.org  I'm getting updates from specs.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: 2@S and 3@C were alerted|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|kit: 3NT a fair contract, but will not make on lie of cards -- would have stopped with 15-17 1NT opening|pg||
nt|me argent: south opened 1nt in OR and is playing there|pg||
nt|kit: Club lead seems pretty normal from East hand -- don't want to lead from any other holding.  And quite effective here.|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, it is their best.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mdgraham: NS are strong club - not sure about 5cM, but it is usual to do that in a strong club system|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|nt|kit: Declarer will play low in case East has led from QJ|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|josj: sure 5cM|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kit: due to limited entries to dummy, declarer will have to give up on diamond finesse I think|pg||
nt|kit: declarer ducked heart, playing West for QJ9xx -- would have been wrong if West had ace of hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: so north should have raised to 2S - they shouldnt be defending 1N whichshould be ioff but has been let thru|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@S makes the opponents come in at the three level if they wish to compete|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s2|nt|kit: now declarer knows hearts likely 4-4|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kit: and will duck in hand, as he wants to win club in dummy for diamond finesse|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|nt|ritong: so this board, which likely will be played in 3 NT both rooms, unless south passes 1 NT, is a matter of undertricks|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|nt|kit: this is not clear play, particularly since now he has to make uncomfortable discard|pg||
nt|josj: that's the obvious reason to raise anyway|pg||
pc|h2|nt|gowdy: or if garbage stayman  2 @S|pg||
nt|josj: even more so at this vul.|pg||
nt|lestergold: North not in aqgain to lead club thru so declarer has time to establish heart or bve given 7th trick in clubs|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|lestergold: North seems a little timid she failed to double the horrific 4H bid earlier on and now she has passed when she was dealt a raise|pg||
nt|josj: at least she's acting consequently|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|pc|hJ|nt|kit: will put in queen of clubs, so if finesse loses at least he has a second dummy entry|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lestergold: do you mean consistently Jos?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kit: Good card reading by East -- he wants his partner to win the 4th round of clubs, and knows if he leads the 4 his parter may play the queen|pg||
pc|h6|pc|c3|pg||
nt|josj: yes I do sry|pg||
pc|d8|nt|xenya: this can't be real|pg||
nt|kit: I'm sure he won jack of clubs and took diamond finesse|pg||
nt|xenya: incidentally, hardly mattered as far as the score is concerned|pg||
nt|kit: actually, I like declarer's line of play upon reconsideration|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|nt|kit: 4th round of clubs looks pretty clear I think -- make declarer discard|pg||
nt|ritong: no|pg||
nt|ritong: he wonders why @c |pg||
nt|ritong: Q|pg||
nt|ritong: and might deduce @s A|pg||
nt|kit: ace of spades won't run away -- he does own king of hearts|pg||
nt|ritong: since both @cs were equivalent|pg||
nt|ritong: there must be some SF in @c Q|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|hT|pc|cT|nt|kareno: Squeezes declarer's hand - he can't pitch a heart.  He actually sort of needs to pitch the spade ten.|pg||
nt|ritong: SP|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kit: but your point is well-taken -- West probably erred playing queen of clubs|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: next up: Becker vs Nickell|pg||
nt|gowdy: west got busy in the open room and overcalled 1@H  the @H lead let NS make 3nt|pg||
nt|gowdy: :)  or 1 less down trick I guess|pg||
nt|ritong: well, at least it loses a (fatal) trick|pg||
nt|kareno: That overcall reeks, especially vul.|pg||

nt|mdgraham: I must admit that I don't blame him at all|pg||
mb|1N|an|!c|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: he has what looks like four tricks facing an opening bid|pg||
mb|2C|mb|d|nt|kit: avoiding the ever-popular 1NT opening with a 5-card major|pg||
nt|kareno: If Hamman finds a takeout double, Zia will bid a lot.|pg||
nt|lestergold: yep I think im with you Mike hard to believe that xmas hasnt come unfortunately it was xmas for n/s|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: for EW it's just next week :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and once you have doubled 2@C for penalty, it's kind of heard not to double 3@C  |pg||
nt|josj: as N introduced the @C first, things may well change|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u im notm con vinced 3C should have made here|pg||
nt|josj: if E returns a trump at any time, 3@C is certainly off|pg||
nt|lestergold: rofl|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, but there isa problem with that|pg||
nt|lestergold: i wonder what that is Mike|pg||
nt|josj: for W it's not so easy to defeat it on  his(her) own|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, me too :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphu2: yes, I got the last few tricks wrong, but result is correct|pg||
nt|kit: 6@S is reasonable here, but the bad splits will doom it|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Now we have Shugart vs Diamond, Robson-Shugart NS Greco-Hampson EW|pg||
nt|kit: This gives South a problem -- bid 2NT with xxx of clubs, bid that weak heart suit again, or raise 2nd suit on 3?|pg||
nt|kit: or bid 3@C, saying none of the above|pg||
nt|ritong: he does not need that:)|pg||
nt|gowdy: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well at kleast 2C doubled doesnt give game!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's often the case, though - partner is dying for you to lead a trump, and you can't|pg||
pc|hK|nt|me argent: i dislike least 3@Hs|pg||
nt|kit: I would bid 3@C -- don't tell a lie if you don't have to|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Standings: Nickell 8.55, Delmonte 8.45, Kwiecen 6.00 Spector 5.70 Kendrick 5.61, Polowan 5.38|pg||
nt|kit: the 3@S call will definitely get them to slam -- here comes RKC|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Shugart 5.27, Becker 4.68, Greenberg 4.61, Diamond 2.02|pg||
nt|xenya: i think 6@S is a bit of a stretch as you apart from @S 3-2 you also need some luck in the reds|pg||
nt|kit: Hamman passes so South can declare I think|pg||
nt|kareno: Obviously.  Hamman lurking in the bushes with his diamonds :)|pg||
nt|josj: so a very good X by Giovani then :)|pg||
nt|po-s: I suppose there must be a limit to trust|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h7|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kit: Well he was right -- maybe he didn't think his partner had 4 spades|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kit: now the tough decision -- and he chose well to sell out|pg||
nt|josj: E apparently thought p held S's trumps as well|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|kareno: Backward heart finesse needed to make this.|pg||
nt|kit: this will be a costly lead if declarer guesses the hearts -- and declarer might -- has to guess whether to play South for Qx or 10x.|pg||
nt|kit: South will be marked with doubleton heart on the auction.|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d4|nt|gowdy: or stiff|pg||
nt|kit: And since South didn't open, I think declarer will get it right.|pg||
nt|mrace: makes 11 tricks if guesses @H now |pg||
nt|ritong: not my point to cantradict big bob, but suspecting zia to overcall on @d xxxxx is not er...reasonable|pg||
nt|ritong: so he must have some other good reason not to lead @d ace|pg||
nt|kit: I really think North should have led a minor -- Qxx of hearts when partner has the minors means cashout time to me.|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dT|pg||
nt|josj: defending doubled partscores with no trumps does not appeal to me|pg||

nt|kit: what????|pg||
pc|sT|nt|me argent: north did well 2 avoid slam on this auction|pg||
nt|kit: opening lead was costly -- lets declarer just draw trump, pitch the club on ace of hearts, and make 6|pg||
nt|mrace: interesting|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kareno: I hear you Kit and I agree.  But now they should cash and tuck west in with his club queen for no decision... yet.|pg||
nt|kit: this is just a bad play -- there is no end-play possible, so what can he hope to gain?|pg||
nt|ahri: i guess he believes that making it willl be sufficient, and if south has quite many honors he'll play north for queen of hearts|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|xenya: of course, once EW have failed to cash their ace slam becomes a fair proposition |pg||

nt|me argent: think he needs at least the @HK well placed for 6|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: I think all the bidding since 3NT is cues - not sure what 3NT was|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|hT|pg||
nt|paulhac:  He has to finesse the club|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: I'm told that 3NT showed a minimum |pg||
nt|me argent: there is 1 loser in 6 but i dont c 12 winners|pg||
nt|barnets: he needs 6 heart tricks|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Double dummy its easy but.....|pg||
nt|me argent: i doubt he will make this|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he won't if he doesn't play a card|pg||
nt|barnets: perhaps a trump lead seeing the hands would be best bur dec has a lot of work to do|pg||
nt|barnets: Zia playing 4@H|pg||
nt|me argent: playing @Ss 43 and @HK onside seems reasonable|pg||

mb|p|mb|5S|nt|me argent: pass by SOUTH A TAD CONERVATIVE AFTER NOT OPENING THE BIDDING|pg||
nt|me argent: sorry|pg||
nt|kit: yes, trump lead, and apparently declrarer just went right in hearts.|pg||
nt|josj: this may end up in 7 now...|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: conservative whether passed hand or not|pg||
nt|kit: not my idea of how to win at BAM (or any other form of scoring)|pg||
mb|7H|nt|ritong: good hand for a gazzilli|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|josj: E expecting at least 7 hearts|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ritong: not really needed here since south has a lot|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4H in some ways too'good to bid in front of pard very heavy in 'controls- somewhat off centre|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh|pg||
nt|josj: a possibly revealing lead...|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ritong: gazzilli is a 2@c rebid by opener indicating a good hand|pg||
nt|kit: pretty easy to get to 4@H with any sensible methods -- now the question is how many tricks can he take|pg||
nt|kit: With the strong hearts in North hand, the natural play appears to be to set up the spades immediately|pg||
nt|kareno: Setting up declarer'|pg||
pc|d2|nt|me argent: since NS in OR playing 3@Ss @D team should win the bd|pg||
nt|kit: tough problem for declarer here -- would North underlead ace of spades with club danger staring him in face|pg||
nt|kareno: declarer's hand looks right but won't work this time.|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ritong: why?|pg||
nt|kareno: In the open room they are in six.|pg||
nt|josj: @D ruff now....|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|lestergold: well makeable maybe double dummy|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h7|pc|hA|nt|ritong: the long @s will not be good, but he can ruff some of them nonetheless|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|kit: now trick comes back -- if declarer believes king of clubs was honest -- I think he will|pg||
nt|lestergold: but why should declarer prefer spade finesse to club finesse|pg||
nt|po-s: dummy squeezed|pg||
nt|lestergold: certainly whatever result i withdraw remark about flat board|pg||
nt|po-s: should perhaps have stayed in dummy and ruffed AKx in pades|pg||
nt|po-s: now it seems D discards are best|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kareno: Once spades don't work, cross ruff will prove good as long as declarer gets diamonds cashed before east can pitch two of them.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|kit: he can ruff a lot of them -- if he times it right, might come to 12 tricks|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|c2|nt|mrace: can actually take a lot by xruff , with @ds behaving |pg||
nt|po-s: good|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|kit: if East pitches diamond, will be key for declarer to cash diamond before trying to ruff another spade|pg||
nt|ritong: he knows @d are 4/3|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk4:  Nickell 8.55 Delmonte 8.45 Kweicen 6 Spector 5.7 Kendrick 5.61|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|me argent: west blew a trick on hand11 but won the bd|pg||
nt|mrace: E refused to ruff @Ss, he is more likely to have K rather than J, no ? |pg||
nt|kareno: That's why I suggested ruffing with the ace.|pg||
nt|josj: end of the day's play. ty Adi for yet another very competent job and cu tomorrow...|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2H|nt|kareno: Board 6 is a late play, folks, we can't show a score for it.|pg||
nt|kit: West properly accepts the transfer|pg||
nt|mrace: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: so does north|pg||
nt|kit: A bit too much at this vulnerability, as it turns out|pg||
mb|p|pc|c6|nt|lestergold: bye for now thx operator and exc fellow commentators|pg||
nt|josj: tahnks also to GABSI to make these broadcasts possible|pg||
pc|c7|nt|kit: Assuming West sits, and I can't see why he wouldn't|pg||
nt|ritong: lindqvist has an opinion to propose|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, no reason for west to remove the double.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mdgraham: South has lots of entries to give North club ruffs |pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|xenya: all very reasonable but 9 tricks are available here|pg||
nt|ritong: a classical " periscope" lead|pg||
nt|kareno: Good lead by Brogeland just in case his partner needs him to shift.|pg||
nt|lestergold: I have to go cu all soon|pg||
nt|mdgraham: bye Mike|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s5|nt|me argent: same auction in OR sorta|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: thanks all @H@H :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kit: pretty lucky lie of cards, to put it mildly|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|josj: tomorrow's starting time is 9.00 WIB which is 2 am GMT|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|kareno: Lindqvist calls for a diamond.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|dburn: true, but it's not obvious to play for the singleton king of spades|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|kit: not at all -- but what else might she do?|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|kit: yes -- normal in this sort of situation|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pc|h2|pc|cT|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mdgraham: I've heard of 2 am|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|ritong: push|pg||
nt|kareno: Both north/south pairs will think they've lost that board :)|pg||
nt|ritong: they at least suppose they did not win it|pg||
nt|kareno: In that they are both correct :)|pg||
nt|kit: they sure were off by quite a bit -- 4@S isn't close|pg||
nt|mrace: i watched Hamman and Zia practicing BAM in bbo previous recent weeks, they are too agressive at low level and tend to leave opponents after first shock...not at his board.|pg||
nt|kareno: I assume we still do not have any running scores, do we?|pg||
nt|kit: I don't like the 5@H call -- he has a lot of trumps, but so what?|pg||
nt|kareno: Too many losers.  Caught up in the heat of the auction.|pg||
nt|ritong: what would you pick at barbu with zia shand, kit?|pg||
nt|kareno: I pick last 2 tricks :)|pg||
nt|ritong: pff:) small player:)|pg||
nt|mrace: haha|pg||
nt|mrace: i wld go for trumps :) |pg||
nt|kareno: By the way, Henri, I am the one who actually brought Barbu to the US after my year and a half playing it in Paris :)|pg||
nt|kit: anything which I thought I could get doubled in Henri|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|kareno: That was in 1965!!|pg||
nt|ritong: that s why it is a tuff hand imo|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: next up: Greenberg vs Diamond|pg||
nt|kareno: Barbu is a fine card game :)|pg||
nt|ritong: i should have precised: first hand|pg||
nt|ritong: oh yeah!|pg||
nt|ritong: it is marvellous|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: After 9 bds, Nickell leading Delmonte by 1.6 boards|pg||
nt|kit: and probably more after last round|pg||
nt|kareno: Did you know it was played at the Club Elysee in Paris, Henri?  |pg||
nt|mrace: we call it "KING" in Turkey , and "Bloody King " where u pick b4 u see ur hand |pg||
nt|ritong: yes, naturally:)|pg||
nt|kareno: And for stakes :)|pg||
nt|ritong: although i mostly was in BCP or albarran clubs|pg||
nt|ritong: bcp = bridge club de paris|pg||
nt|kareno: Somehow I landed at Elysee early and there I played the whole year and a half I lived in Paris.|pg||
nt|ritong: french mecque of bridge, sort of|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|josj: right|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Walddk4: Next round we'll have Spector vs Delmonte|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|s8|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|nt|kit: and now  ton of tricks|pg||
pc|dT|pc|h5|pg||
nt|josj: I will be sleeping by then|pg||
pc|d2|nt|xenya: typo, Kit -- ten, not ton|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|kit: East likely to have ace of hearts from opening bid, so can cash 10 of spades and lead heart up, making 10 tricks|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h6|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|pc|h9|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|me argent: have we played 12 bds all ready? how time flys|pg||
nt|kit: made 10 tricks I believe, but won't matter|pg||
nt|gowdy: east was a bit quick winning the @D   ducking would have saved a trick or 2|pg||
nt|kit: yes, but far from obvious from his point of view|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: NS Bathurst-Zagorin vs EW Tuszynski-Kowalski|pg||
mc|7|nt|mdgraham: thanks all, thanks Riyadi|pg||
nt|josj: 2 more rounds of Swiss and then Super Eight, RR of 7x16 boards!|pg||
nt|josj: 3 on Sat. and 4 on Sun.|pg||
nt|josj: will be 22-8 in VP so far|pg||
