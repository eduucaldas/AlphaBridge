nt|dburn: wow - that is a heavy pre-empt|pg||
nt|kit: this one looks really flat|pg||
nt|kareno: Wow!!  That's quite a 2@s bid|pg||
mb|1C|mb|2C|nt|josj: another 6@D this time for NS|pg||
mb|d|nt|mdgraham: Good hand for Stayman/Smolen - well, it was until North bid 2@D|pg||
mb|3C|nt|me argent: east worth a double here?|pg||
nt|dburn: well, what can he do?|pg||
nt|kit: I can't believe West didn't compete to 4@S|pg||
nt|dburn: true - whichever minor partner had, you'd have some cards for him|pg||
nt|me argent: it does say something about their 2 bids|pg||
nt|dburn: on the other hand, if partner was clowning around with a couple of jack-fifths, you'd go down about 800|pg||
nt|me argent: and why it was WRONG for east 2 open 2@Ss|pg||
nt|josj: I think X shows the blackies v. Strong Club|pg||
nt|xenya: on 13, the ladies in the other bid to the correct 5@C contract and NS took a save in 5@H -- -500 and 12 imps to Djarum ladies |pg||
mb|3D|nt|kit: extra spade -- but didn't matter here.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: re|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: a hand which shows, once again, that nine-card suits are meant to be trumps|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|frankaus: the SP cost the contract - loose lips !!!!!!! - N showed @S A @C KJ  did not overcall so E "knew" N does not have @D K|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c2|nt|xenya: i wonder what 2@D shows|pg||
nt|mdgraham: what on earth....?|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: re hi @H@H|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mdgraham: South thinks 2@D is major, methinks. A bad time to have a system forget|pg||
nt|xenya: but whatever it might be, obviously NS were not on the same wavelength|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kit: still looks clear to accept the "transfer" -- somebody bids 4@H, so you bid 4@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: director called after E's double, didn't hear the conversation.|pg||
nt|dburn: well, everyone has a good hand for their bid|pg||
nt|ritong: arare case of early claim|pg||
nt|kit: I would have opened 3@S as they did in other room, but matter of style I guess.|pg||
nt|ritong: absolutely nothing could happen|pg||
nt|josj: unlucky lead but only for an overtrick|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|pc|dK|nt|me argent: west was rgt that south could not make 5@Hs|pg||
pc|d2|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|d9|pg||
pc|d8|pc|c5|nt|xenya: the mix-up is going to be costly|pg||
pc|h3|nt|dburn: well, he could worry about it - he knows that if partner's second suit is diamonds, he probably did the wrong thing|pg||
nt|me argent: anyhow after opening 1@S EW playing 6@Ss in OR|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s3|pc|h8|nt|dburn: the odds are that it's clubs, of course, so hard to blame West|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|d5|pc|c7|pc|h7|pc|h9|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s6|pc|c3|nt|dburn: as to blaming East - well, if that's his style, that's his style|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|nt|me argent: wests pass shows that 2@Ss was the WRONGbid|pg||
nt|dburn: having said all of that, 6@s at the other table was... well, it made|pg||
nt|dburn: could have lost a diamond ruff, could have lost a couple of clubs on the go|pg||
nt|xenya: well it says 2@S is 5-11 -- quite a wide range -- was tough for  W to make an intelligent decision|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Board 16 will be replaced by a board we can't show|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Accidentally, a player saw board 16 at the previous table|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: result on 17 was 5@HX+1, pending director decision about whether the double was based on long hesitation by E before his X|pg||
nt|dburn: well, the result is probably not 5@h doubled *plus* one whatever East or West di|pg||
nt|me argent: that east hand is not a 5 to 11 points|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: sorry, it was -1 ,will correct movie|pg||
nt|me argent: as marty bergen says points shmoints|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: doesn't change the bam result|pg||
nt|kit: I can't see what the problem is -- West certainly would never sell to 5@H undoubled after his partner's double of 4@H|pg||
nt|me argent: indeed|pg||
nt|dburn: if West was slow over 4@h, East's double might be cancelled|pg||
nt|dburn: not that any of it will matter, since whether NS were -100 in 5@h doubled or plus 420 in 4@h is irrelevant|pg||
nt|kit: oh come on -- no way East would ever sell to 4@H with that hand after having misdescribed with the 2@S opening|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: maybe that was it, I didn't catch all the td discussion|pg||
nt|xenya: that's true|pg||
nt|xenya: sorry, private|pg||
nt|dburn: I agree with you entirely, Kit, but appeals committees have been known to do some odd things|pg||
nt|kit: huddles or not, one should still be allowed to play bridge|pg||
nt|dburn: again, I am in total agreement with you|pg||
nt|gowdy: I don't care about tempo here E has a clear call  and pass is not an option  EVER|pg||
nt|me argent: moi aussi|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Scores after 5: 1. Delmonte 12.45 2. Nickell 11.05 3. Kwiecien  11.00 4. Kendrick 9.61 5.Shugart 8.27 6. Polowan 7.84 7. Spector 7.20 8.Becker 7.18 9.Greenberg 5.61 10.Diamond 5.52|pg||

mb|4D|mb|p|nt|josj: and so does even 5@D|pg||

nt|jaapfr: ok 10 then|pg||
nt|alunand7: hi japp :)@H|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi harry re|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: simply too weak for 1@S, and pass isn't part of my vocabulary with a 7-card spade suit.|pg||
nt|mrace: well...most people treat a side A as if it is a crime to open weak 2, most of the top players opens it almost always  as far as i see in BBO vugraphs|pg||
nt|kareno: Not a decent one like that.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Zia has a kibbitzer who operates the BridgeMate for him.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|xenya: some might open with the S hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: precision style, I assume|pg||
nt|alunand7: maybe 3NT or 5@D by N-S |pg||
nt|jaapfr: also here 6@D too thin and likely to fall so better 3nt again|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: but if you don't, it's a nice feeling when LHO opens in your longest suit |pg||
mb|p|nt|gowdy: x = blackwood|pg||
nt|xenya: no huddle this time? :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: I should have used the substitute bd 16 as my "hospitality" break.  TMI?|pg||
nt|kit: 4NT call very risky here -- only at these colors, and only at BAM or matchpoints might it be right|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, we all know the feeling|pg||
nt|alunand7: good shot japp :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jaapfr: lasut did better:)|pg||
nt|alunand7: lasut heared your said|pg||
nt|jaapfr: played against them 30 years ago in Jakarta:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: sorry, Website can't update now :) because no data  from scoring room|pg||
nt|alunand7: oww...|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|josj: N has an unpleasant lead|pg||
nt|frankaus: this wont trouble the declarer|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|xenya: however, had S opened, they might have reached a decent 2@S contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: they are very busy|pg||
nt|alunand7: good feeling = good result happened at this table |pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|cJ|nt|kit: big swing on auction -- in other room, 1NT opening, and 2@C stayman bid was doubled -- good double!|pg||
nt|josj: he does not know a @D is best and now declarer's job is easy|pg||
nt|josj: for +1|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|kit: Fate of 5@D doubled depends on how declarer handles the heart suit maybe|pg||
nt|kareno: It's nice to have good servants :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: there are a number of kibbitzers in the room.  Zia has 3 men following him, 2 women behind Hamman|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: And plenty following Meckwell|pg||
nt|kit: Nothing here -- with diamonds splitting, 12 tricks and a swing on the double of 2@C.  Many would be afraid to make it.  I think it is clear.|pg||
nt|kareno: You really can't stand any other lead.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: mungkin lebih baik kalau kami berbicara BI sebab banyak kibs mengerti itu lebih baik:)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mrace: true|pg||
pc|s2|nt|dburn: well, the defence got there first, but...|pg||

nt|vugraphzbq: I agree with you Jaap, Your Indonesian is good|pg||
nt|jaapfr: meanwhile dummy lost his entry|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|josj: even +2...|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|kit: sure, every now and then they will redouble and wrap it around your neck -- but the gains outweigh the losses IMO.|pg||
nt|ritong: especially when the size of the loss does not matter|pg||
nt|kit: I would double at IMP also without hesitation.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but lucky @C mite help|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|dburn: ...that was not their best shot, as it happens|pg||
pc|cT|nt|dburn: wonder if Shane Blanchard is a fan of James Thurber|pg||
pc|c5|nt|alunand7: no jab...10@C was goo entry|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|pg||
nt|kit: will get heart ruff now -- but declarer can set up 9 of clubs if judges to lead club to 10|pg||

nt|frankaus: the pace of play seems to be increasing - in the bridge that i see|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: But one of those plays easier to find in the post-mortem than at the table|pg||
nt|alunand7: big swing previous board.. i am sure about it...|pg||
mb|1D|nt|jaapfr: anyway 3nt was doomed with @H lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: ty Adi :)|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|dburn: dull hand, this - except in the Reisinger, where an overtrick matters|pg||
nt|xenya: reasonable slam here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mdgraham: en route to 3N here|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|Vugraphu2: after 6 rds in swiss Lynch 101, Dawson 93.35, Agica 92.97, Lall 91.46, cooper 86.75|pg||
nt|kit: going to be difficult for E-W to stop after the light opening bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: duck second @H and good quessing would bring it home|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: although 6@D is reasonable - difficult to bid perhaps|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: 6@D or 6N|pg||
pc|cT|nt|xenya: 6@D is better|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jaapfr: duck 2nd @H @SK @CA @DQ x@C and so it made but not likely in other room would be played like that|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kit: don't know if this is forcing or not in their methods -- we will soon find out|pg||
nt|josj: very light overcall by E but EW landed on their feet|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kit: not necessarily so dull -- East may be thinking slam|pg||
nt|kareno: West may not care :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|josj: what would have happened if N does not X 4@D?|pg||
nt|frankaus: this will set it |pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he can get his hand shown and still stop in 3NT|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe they won't be able to do that so easily at the other table, it's true|pg||
nt|dburn: except that if this is the Kwiecien team, it will also play Polish Club|pg||
pc|hT|nt|gowdy: passive @C here  best |pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: On VG here is Pollack-Spector NS vs Tuszynkski-Kowalski EW|pg||
nt|me argent: carefull and lucky play should produce 11tricks|pg||
nt|kit: I think declarer will go after diamonds first, but not totally clear|pg||

nt|gowdy: my guess is @H|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s3|pc|hJ|pg||

pc|c9|pc|c4|pg||
nt|kit: you lose, Bruce -- it seems|pg||
nt|dburn: spies inform me that East-West at the other table are higher than 3NT already|pg||
nt|kit: now heart finesse for sure|pg||
nt|dburn: the same spies inform me that you might make six diamonds. Yes, I suppose you might.|pg||
nt|me argent: looks like the board was won when EW stopped in 3NT|pg||
nt|xenya: as on some layouts it can be made on a trump coup if S has Hxxx in @Ds|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|pc|d5|pc|d8|pg||
pc|sT|nt|me argent: it wont be played in 6@Ds i am willing 2 bet|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|kit: declarer taking 2 spade ruffs -- not totally clear to me that this is best approach|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c5|pc|h5|nt|josj: well, unless N ducks...|pg||
nt|josj: taking the ace and returning a @C also does not help NS|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|me argent: 4@Ss final contract OR|pg||
nt|dburn: meanwhile, at this table East is battling to take as many overtricks as he can in 3NT|pg||
nt|kit: declarer will probably persist with diamonds -- works very well, but only 11 tricks as North guards hearts and South spades|pg||
nt|dburn: two will do, since 4@s at the other table will not make more than 10 tricks|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kareno: Two spade ruffing finesses?|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|nt|kareno: Better?|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|dA|nt|dburn: actually, I suppose it might make 11 - is a 10-point difference a win or a push in this event?|pg||

nt|josj: 4@H goes here with a friendly layout|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|kit: it is a win|pg||
nt|dburn: I should think so too|pg||
mb|d|nt|frankaus: how many @H will be bid ? - & how many will they make?|pg||
mb|r|nt|kareno: Now I would overcall with that north hand.|pg||
nt|kit: I would make takeout double with Sout hand -- both majors|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, that too.|pg||
nt|xenya: but a chance for Djarum ladies to make up for the disastrous board 17|pg||
nt|alunand7: look likes play in 2@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|kit: overcall on North hand marginal|pg||
nt|kareno: 1@s just loses the heart suit forever.|pg||
nt|kit: North will be back in with 2@H -- this time.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: South had other options -- I don't know what is best|pg||
nt|me argent: do everybody agree with norths final pass?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|gowdy: not me !|pg||
nt|Walddk4: After 6: 1. Delmonte 14.95 2. Nickell 13.05 3. Kwiecien  12.00 4. Kendrick 11.61 5. Polowan 9.88 6. Shugart 9.2 7. Becker 8. Spector 9.Greenberg  10.Diamond |pg||
nt|kit: definitely agree -- North "has his bids" -- nothing extra.  North is expected to hold 6 points when they preempt.|pg||
nt|me argent: even with adverse ruff and @HK offside NS make 10 tricks in @Hs|pg||
nt|kit: lif is like that -- South could be a LOT weaker for the 3@H call|pg||
nt|gowdy: ok I relent pass is best|pg||
nt|dburn: sure - pass of 3@H close to obvious at BAM, even close to normal at IMPs|pg||
nt|me argent: unless east quacks the opening @S lead|pg||
nt|gowdy: so my answer is i'm happy to be here and not there|pg||
nt|kit: and not even clear that 4@H will make -- there is that 4th round of clubs, you know|pg||
nt|mrace: he doesnt need to |pg||
nt|kareno: Kwiecien treating his hand like 5-4|pg||
nt|josj: good question|pg||
nt|jaapfr: -1 or -2?|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: there they go|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: South is bidding a LOT.|pg||

nt|jaapfr: which:)???????|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: effortless|pg||
nt|kit: Well, they got it right -- this time.  But much easier if either one of them bids their hand properly the first time.|pg||
nt|kareno: No way to go wrong.|pg||

nt|mrace: it has been a challenge to me to remember to spell his name|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a lot depends on your overcall range - North is close to an invite opposite 16-18, but opposite 15-17 you can understand the pass|pg||
nt|alunand7: Slam Zone now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a very light 6@S which makes|pg||
mb|1N|nt|xenya: "only" 8 imps for AIC on 17 -- EW bid and made 4@H in the OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|gowdy: pass ?|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|nt|kit: North's pass is dealer is quite surprising|pg||

nt|jaapfr: bets on will they play slam or not  (my vote is no slam)?|pg||
nt|ritong: bet would be will he try?|pg||
nt|alunand7: i beat slam!!|pg||
nt|ritong: hi there|pg||
nt|caruga: mine is yes|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi henri welcome too Bandung|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|kit: this is difficult bidding hand -- slam is reasonable|pg||
nt|ritong: you get it|pg||
nt|josj: all of them|pg||
nt|alunand7: hi henri and fabio..welcome|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: no shrinking violet, West|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: indeed|pg||
nt|kit: Opposite the strong jump shift, I don't think East will quit with the good 8-bagger|pg||
nt|caruga: hi all|pg||
nt|ritong: no, he does not try  reasonable|pg||
nt|alunand7: you won jaap :)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kit: 2@H overcall clear in my book opposite passed hand -- partner can't have enough to bury you by bidding 3NT or something like that|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Spector: Splinter? Just kidding.  Pollack: Lead-directing.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this should be regarded as protective as there was no double of the 2@H transfer |pg||
nt|jaapfr: after 1nt one must have a lot of imagination as S to see a slam:)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|me argent: but from what i have seen over past 2 bds pollack likes to pass|pg||
nt|kareno: especially once he gets raised.|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Which world championship?|pg||
nt|kit: This will get them to the good 6@D contract|pg||
nt|ritong: pairs|pg||
nt|josj: 3@H worked well as it pushed the opps too high|pg||
nt|xenya: i think W must balance non-vulnerable|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mdgraham: totally agree|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kit: When your entire hand is in one suit, it is a good idea to bid that suit|pg||
nt|alunand7: manappo did not try it....:(|pg||
nt|ritong: however, there is an interesting proceeding to suggest slam without getting too involved|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
nt|ritong: it is " other major"|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kit: West will like his hand a lot -- the question is whether or not he should bid more then just jumping to 6@D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: opposite the wrong hand, you could go for a penalty, but if you don't lose 500 once in a while you are not bidding enough - you will lose part-score swings   |pg||
pc|s9|pc|s4|pc|s6|pg||
nt|ritong: here, 3@h|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kit: play will go quickly here, with ace of spades still an entry.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kareno: His partner is moving to slam missing KQ of his suit.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|dburn: well, it depends on the extent to which 1@d shows diamonds, perhaps|pg||
nt|dburn: five-card majors, and all...|pg||
nt|dburn: still, I'd have opened the bidding|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Next up: Becker vs Diamond|pg||
nt|gowdy: well it does not deny @D|pg||
nt|kit: If East hadn't returned a spade, declarer might well have gone wrong -- taking diamond finesse instead of spade finesse, for example.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Roland will post standings when they're available|pg||
nt|gowdy: true  give e aq @S and ak of @C  then  @D q is on side with the bidding|pg||
nt|kit: of course if East didn't have queen of diamonds, he might just cash ace of spades fearing declarer could take 7 hearts and 5 diamonds|pg||
nt|xenya: even holding the @DQ, he might fear declarer can take 12 tricks|pg||
nt|gowdy: and then why did w lead a club  must have a @s card|pg||
nt|kit: from QJ10 of clubs, club lead would be pretty clear -- no inference there I don't think|pg||
nt|kit: Holding guarded queen of diamonds East doesn't need to cash -- how can declarer take 12 tricks?|pg||
mc|12|nt|ritong: meaning " i like my hand  do you too?"|pg||
nt|alunand7: bid 3@H better|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|xenya: when you have an 8-card fit in a major|pg||
pc|c8|nt|me argent: its my bid|pg||

nt|ritong: curiouser and curiouser|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mdgraham: this might end in 6@H|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kareno: n/s apparently landed in 3@c open room in the end.|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|xenya: which will probably fail|pg||

nt|josj: 6@H is the better scoring slam, even more so for NS|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mdgraham: this will go two off I reckon - East will probably try a heart to the queen, hoping for 3-2 hearts with the king in the South hand |pg||
pc|cT|nt|Walddk4: Why would he think that, Kit, after North supported over the double?|pg||
nt|me argent: will the auction tell declarer how to play trumps?|pg||

mb|p|mb|3D|nt|Vugraphu2: N to E: We haven't discussed this auction.|pg||

mb|p|nt|me argent: people who play the un q bid are more likely to discuss these type of auctions than those who dont|pg||
