mb|1C|mb|1H|nt|bjacobs: 3@H seems beatable|pg||
nt|psridhar: thx Roland; we tried to extend the principle ( lower vs lower) vs any 2 suitor o/c; ran into complications -for eg u open 1nt lho overcalls 2c -landy now?|pg||
nt|psridhar: if u must open 2nt on a 19 counter make sure u hv a decent 5 card suit !|pg||
mb|d|mb|r|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|psridhar: it certainly works well over unusual 2nt showing minors |pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: You could play 2@H as showing the minors, with clubs equal or greater than diamonds; 2@S shows longer diamonds (after the Landy bid)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H heart stop, no spade stop. 2@S spade stop, no heart stop. NT stops in both majors. That's one way of playing it|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: i hear that slam on bd 27 made because when a dia was played off the tbl S played 2 cards -the ACE and 9 of dia- the 9 was visible so diro ruled it in|pg||
nt|psridhar: i thk NS hv enough grounds to contest that decision on appeal|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: they won't need to|pg||
nt|psridhar: 1. Dia ace was the setting trcik|pg||
