nt|vugraphzwu: player at south not in seat.....waiting|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A simple enough slam here - extra credit for playing it safely in clubs|pg||
nt|psridhar: hi all welcome to the 2nd segment of the QF|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello everyone and welcome back to Bengaluru (Bangalore)|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi everyone, |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Commentators are Raija Davis and Padmanaban Sridhar|pg||
nt|psridhar: going by the trend in 1st segment NS may well crack a grand on this|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Our operator is Ruzbeh Raja|pg||
nt|psridhar: i hv seen the bidding go 1s-4h( splinter)-4s( wasted h kqj of h pd ! )-all pass|pg||
nt|peachy: another slam in this board. not sure what is going on, |pg||
nt|peachy: but we will surely get going soon:)|pg||
nt|psridhar: EW are indian railways and NS are Mango's team|pg||
nt|peachy: can you tell me (and kibs maybe) what systems these pairs use|pg||
nt|psridhar: both pairs use natural methods |pg||
nt|psridhar: 5 card Maj, strong NT|pg||
nt|peachy: thank you|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: error with duplication of open room set|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: closed room will continue as normal|pg||
nt|psridhar: hi all -welcome to the final segment of the QF|pg||
nt|psridhar: the site for results http://indianbridgepages.appspot.com/ Winter_Nationals/2009/Results.el|pg||
nt|patricck: The Semi-Final is 36 boards in 3 segments of 12?|pg||
nt|psridhar: i am not very familiar about the NS pair- but CV RAO is a well known indian team having won several national titles|pg||
nt|Walddk6: A spectator suggests that this is the other semi-final|pg||
nt|Walddk6: CABAL vs Dhampur|pg||
nt|psridhar: something wrong -the EW pair plays for dhampur i am certain|pg||
nt|psridhar: hi all welcome to the 2nd segment of semifinals|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: Welcome back to all|pg||
nt|psridhar: hi all welcome to the 2nd edition of this needle match|pg||
mb|1N|nt|psridhar: hi all welcome to the Ruia gold cup finals between Dhampur and railways|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: Hi Good morning all|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzwu: welcome back to the last leg of this final|pg||
mb|p|nt|drkvas: hi guys|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: N hand ideal for a short suit trial bid|pg||
nt|psridhar: kind of splinter game try|pg||
nt|drkvas: u think ok with 3 trumps ps?|pg||
nt|psridhar: N hand doc|pg||
nt|drkvas: ok r|pg||
nt|drkvas: but i think 2@s is misclick|pg||
nt|psridhar: yeah too strong for a simple raise|pg||
nt|patricck: welcome everyone|pg||
nt|patricck: Are NS playing inverted major raises?|pg||
nt|patricck: It appears the other table has been renamed, do we do the same here?|pg||
nt|patricck: Welcome Sunil|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|psridhar: i have played against Ashok goel and kamal mukh all my life :)  they belong to dhampur|pg||
nt|Walddk6: This is more like it|pg||
nt|patricck: 4 sets of 16 boards, a 64 board Final|pg||
pc|h3|nt|patricck: that makes more sense :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: correction - 2nd last leg|pg||
pc|h7|nt|drkvas: 1INDIAN RAILWAYS - A  15212ARUN JAIN,   132|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Operator, please shut down and reconnect to the other room|pg||
nt|Walddk6: The other operator realised the error and has opened a new broadcast|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: this is the final of the Ruia trophy... the symbol of supremacy in Indian bridge|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Hello Patrick|pg||
nt|psridhar: if he had overcalled 2c instead of 1nt Sumit might hv raised with ACE and 4 trumps-then 3nt easy|pg||
nt|rv: Hi all wlc back for this 3rd segment of finals for Ruia trophy|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk6: Best to do it now|pg||
nt|psridhar: i think this match is Dhampur Vs cabal|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bjacobs: The challenge is to stay out of the poor grand slam - even though it happens to make|pg||
nt|Walddk6: but ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: in the other match cabal leads dhampur by 10 IMP's|pg||
pc|d8|nt|psridhar: yes it is dhampur vs cabal|pg||
nt|Walddk6: The team names are now reversed :(|pg||
nt|panja: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Hi Panja|pg||
nt|psridhar: cabal is a team from Mumbai|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Rehi all|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Welcome to Carl Mathiesen from Norway|pg||
nt|psridhar: hi Sunil|pg||
pc|cA|nt|panja: Good Morning Roland, hi all|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, Dhampur is the EW pair, they should be in mauve|pg||
nt|patricck: South will have no trouble finding the right lead if EW get overboard, but I don't anticipate that|pg||
pc|c4|nt|patricck: the defence will need to be careful here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Hi Sridhar|pg||
nt|psridhar: 7 card suit with 6 controls...i dont think 1Nt did justice to that holding|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c7|nt|psridhar: touch and go.. d1 at most|pg||
nt|panja: it is good to see Sanjay Damle playing in semis...(South)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i dont think they will overreach as they lck the @H control|pg||
nt|rv: Rail playing pairs in rotation, Sumit-Laltu sitting out this set|pg||
pc|c6|nt|psridhar: key point of partnership understdg here is - what is diff between direct 3s over 2s and 3s via 2nt-since 2s is 6 cards 99% of the time|pg||
pc|cT|nt|sharkey: Good afternoon|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|drkvas: yes now the ball is rolling nicely|pg||
nt|psridhar: 4H is pushy with the 'wasted' dia queen ...but i guess the stiff H makes up for it|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: error corrected|pg||
nt|patricck: 4@H would have been a splinter, enabled North to assess correctly to drive to slam|pg||
nt|psridhar: i hear other room also in 6s|pg||
nt|rv: DSM playing same pairs as last set, Kushari-Bhabesh and Kamal-Ashok|pg||
nt|rv: Souren and Uttam not playing much|pg||
pc|d6|nt|drkvas: u have sharp ears ps|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Hi Sridhar|pg||
nt|psridhar: i thk via 2nt shd suggest 3nt and 4s while direct 3s shd actively propel towards a spd contract|pg||
nt|psridhar: hi Sunil |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i think u thk right Sridhar :)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|nt|psridhar: gud lead-makes life tough for declarer-other room led dia ACE|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|r_tibre: DSM in 3D in the CR|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bjacobs: No justice|pg||
nt|psridhar: i hv placed an agent there doc :)|pg||
nt|panja: he trained a lot of young people in 70's and 80's, under United Bridge Association|pg||
nt|psridhar: if declarer had played a LOW club W might hv ducked and entry to dummy to play dia|pg||

pc|h6|pc|d4|pg||
pc|h9|nt|panja: a few years ago, he was very unwell, but has now recovered...|pg||
nt|psridhar: in other words one can raise 2s to 3s even on a doubleton if he has a SUIT ORIENTED hand-say KX,XX,AXXX,KQXXX|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|sharkey: Is this the last 12 boards of this match?|pg||
nt|patricck: rehi everyone, got distracted there, hope I haven't missed much|pg||

nt|psridhar: wd banerjee|pg||
nt|psridhar: declarer might hv played dia b4 h ruff since he was planning to ruff only one h|pg||
nt|Walddk6: This is better|pg||
nt|psridhar: it was the first deal Pat didnt miss any :)|pg||
nt|rv: defense was less than perfect, it was better for Kushari to overtake @hQ and concede a trick to Manas's @HJ|pg||
nt|rv: Bhabesh's lead of @HQ asked partner to unblock or show count|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: hi all|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: E/W may bid to 3 nt and go down here|pg||
mb|1N|nt|patricck: that would be a better line|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: thanks for the heads up|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello to P Sridhar and David Bird|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Hi to the kibitzers!|pg||
nt|brolucius: Holding the spades, North may risk an opening in the 4th seat.|pg||
nt|psridhar: THAT is a tough decision in 4th seat|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@D, to put up some sort of barrier.|pg||
nt|psridhar: 14 spear points|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, a question of whether West bids game or invites|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: talk of controls... Laltu seems to be getting a load of them|pg||
mb|2C|nt|psridhar: i guess i will cash it|pg||
nt|brolucius: One of the less memorable auctions of the match.|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: 6s is a reasonable contract but fails on the 4-1 trump break|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|patricck: 4-3-3-3 and poor intermediate cards, I invite|pg||
nt|rv: Manas will Invite|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sharkey: Don't know if NS can find 6@C here - moste likely 3 NT|pg||
nt|psridhar: If S leads a club Kushari may swing it in|pg||
nt|psridhar: this time he shows his appreciation of the controls by a gf leap to 3c -quite right|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: well stopped|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sunsamvar: they decide not to stretch for the nonvul game|pg||
nt|psridhar: here 4D over 3s -slam try in spd- is in order yes i agree with him|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: even 2NT is not certain|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: 3 aces to lose and 4-1 trump to handle ...but i expect he will make it|pg||
nt|patricck: 4@H could have been beaten with a @S ruff, but I don't think 4@S can be beaten|pg||
nt|patricck: that solves the problem for declarer in the @C suit|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: is it a good idea to cuebid shortness in ptners main suit ?|pg||
nt|psridhar: gud pt sunil but he has no other safe way to suggest slam|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: true|pg||
nt|psridhar: it cd well be last train|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: 6@C can make, but not a very good contract|pg||
nt|sharkey: 6@C hinges on finding the @DQ|pg||
nt|psridhar: this will result in 3nt -but say South has AXX,XX,AJXX,AQXX -how will the bidding go? will he raise 3d to 4d?|pg||
nt|r_tibre: cards lying well for the aggression|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|psridhar: he has 2 more jacks to guess|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree - and probably almost unbiddable|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, but needs a reasonable trump break before you get to that point|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes Patrick|pg||
pc|h6|nt|patricck: a heart lead would have been best, but West made a reasonable choice on opening lead|pg||
nt|rv: all these players are regulars on BBO, their Ids are manas555 (Manas Mukherjee), banerjee (Amarnath Banerjee), Kushari (Pritish Kushari) and bhabesh (Bhabesh Saha)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
nt|bjacobs: threatening lead|pg||
nt|psridhar: Perfect !  i admire this auction|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: well he cud hv confirmed the trump !Q|pg||
nt|rodal f: U mean: The operation was sucsessful, but the pasient died?|pg||
nt|psridhar: :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Hi Rodal|pg||
nt|rodal f: Just a visit. Sr.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: tough lead for north|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: what will you lead Sridhar and why ?|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|psridhar: play to 2nt on h lead is similar to 3nt on cl lead :)|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sunsamvar: a spec tells me " Sumit and laltu are two of the best student of Kushari "|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|h9|pg||
nt|psridhar: there must be a way to diagnose that stiff facing AXX or AKX in the auction|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|psridhar: after spd misguess E cd hv arranged a dia ruff for himself for d1|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d4|pg||
nt|rv: Manas is postponing the inevitable decision to finesse in trumps|pg||
nt|r_tibre: it pays to be aggressive opp std nt, when opps are playing str @C|pg||
nt|rv: he won't/can't postpone any further by playing a 3rd @d|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sunsamvar: MAYBE HE CAN ENDPLAY sUMIT|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|psridhar: other room in 4H and defense as suggested by Patrick is on right track|pg||
nt|psridhar: looks like early take off for railways !|pg||
nt|patricck: a @D back would have beaten it for sure with a @D ruff, but now declarer might make by guessing J@D|pg||
nt|psridhar: last dia squeezes S|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Sry for caps|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sunsamvar: and so it may not be the same Sridhar|pg||
nt|patricck: two OF the best?  he has other students good enough to play in the Cup Final? :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: now spd ACE and h will endplay S|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Kushari is a Dada in Indian bridge Patrick|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|pc|d9|pg||
nt|rv: strange line|pg||
nt|r_tibre: he played for @STx|pg||

nt|psridhar: Roland -about 5 to 6 teams are sponsored regularly; and about 10 to 12 are regular professionals |pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: IR v. Mango|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: Arun Jain v. Dhampur|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: Cabal v. indian Blue|pg||
nt|psridhar: but very little sponsorship and participation in international tourneys sadly|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: CV Rao v. Sunil Machhar|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: coming up in a min.|pg||
nt|psridhar: I have seen Laria/versace diagnose such holdings marvelously but thru artifical bids that r diff to understand|pg||
nt|psridhar: and give up 140 for fear i will be minus 100|pg||
nt|psridhar: in 4s|pg||
nt|roswolf: more action likely here|pg||
nt|r_tibre: are there whispering birds in the sky at the venue, rv?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: Indian Railways have a phenominal record in the Ruia and have won the event many times in the past 10 years with more or less the same team.|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: that south hand is 1d opening for me|pg||
nt|brolucius: South judges his hand not worth a reverse (after a 1@D opening) and so shows his strength with a strong 1NT.  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: N-S have all the high cards, but E-W can make many spades|pg||
nt|patricck: too hard for Kushari to guess the winning play without any opposition bidding to guide him, so 1 down|pg||
nt|tcpant: Total Anti % play|pg||
nt|rv: I am sure Manas wouldn't be amused by the play and he would be glaring at Amarnath|pg||
mb|1D|nt|roswolf: i agree especially with that shape|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: precision 2@C opening|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@H Majors I assume - DONT?|pg||
nt|rv: Manas Mukherjee is an excellent playing captain for Indian Rail|pg||
nt|tcpant: Or it will be reverse... Amarnath glaring at Manas|pg||
mb|1N|nt|patricck: the NS hands fit nicely, can they bid the good game? it looks like it|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes ..leading to a precarious 4-2 fit|pg||
nt|patricck: reopening double?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Sumit and Laltu are comparitively recent additions to this consistent team|pg||
nt|rv: good afternoon Pantji|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: Sumit has done well to pass -many wd open 1s there|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How can East pass if 2@C shows the majors?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|patricck: seems like a routine @S game...yes 6@S can be made, but not a good contract and won't be bid anyway|pg||
nt|psridhar: 6s off trump ace and queen is dicey|pg||
nt|psridhar: other room heading towards slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: again i agree|pg||
nt|brolucius: If you are playing Lebensohl, 3NT denies a spade stopper in one version. (You would travel via 2NT with a stopper).|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe 2@C was Astro-like, promising hearts and another, and then I can understand East's pass|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then he will think partner has hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Just goes to show that Astro is hopeless|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: really, the winning play in trumps is possible, exciting stuff if they bid and make it|pg||
nt|psridhar: that 2nt bid has missed the spd fit|pg||
nt|patricck: no......2NT not an enquiry then?|pg||
nt|panja: and 2N won't make|pg||
nt|psridhar: Sanajy has gone for quanti auction in pref to the spd fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: if it went 2@C-2@D-2@H...I guess 2N would have been forcing....|pg||
nt|panja: so the structure forced him to guess the best response?|pg||
nt|patricck: how could it be by a passed hand?|pg||
nt|psridhar: i wonder what was 3C ..with  a doubleton h ..some misunderstdg i guess|pg||
nt|patricck: As long as NS lead spades sometime 4@H seems doomed|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: was 3@C a super acceptance showing short @C ?... can he do it with doubleton trumps ?|pg||
nt|patricck: 5@D might well make tho|pg||
nt|psridhar: from West's perspective his pd cd well hv held a weak hand with H..so crossing 2h without a fit seems unwise|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: with 5 spades he must have shown that suit as well - otherwise his defence to 1nt is wanting|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A defence to 1NT that does not have 2@C as *both* majors is not worth playing, full stop.|pg||
nt|psridhar: Or did he momentarily (mis) registered 2D as dia ..and ...?|pg||
nt|tcpant: Good Afternoon Venky.... |pg||
nt|r_tibre: keeps the match close, and the players awake :)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Walddk6: How can anything be forcing by a passed hand?|pg||
nt|psridhar: i think he did well to pass..a reopg X might hv given W a chance to smoke out 2s|pg||
nt|patricck: surely not|pg||
nt|tcpant: May be lunch effect for Manas|pg||
nt|rv: even with right @d guess, declarer has only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|rv: Pant saab, I think Amarnath played last 4@s|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|nt|psridhar: sound conservative auction may earn them 13 if other room fails in slam|pg||
nt|sharkey: Same contract where NS would have landed if W passed....|pg||
nt|psridhar: if W had passed NS might hv declared 2H vul|pg||
nt|patricck: not the best lead from North, I wouldn't have thought there was a need to be that active on the lead|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|brolucius: The club discard from dummy is puzzling. What use are the diamonds?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphzwu: yes|pg||
pc|d4|nt|panja: oh y, passed hand, true|pg||
nt|Walddk6: So if he wants to bid, 2@D must be it|pg||
nt|panja: or, then, 2@D might be passable here for them? passed hand?|pg||
nt|psridhar: u only need yr pd not to screw up|pg||
nt|psridhar: sorry prvt|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If the @H9 and @H10 were swapped - that was what North was hoping|pg||
pc|dK|nt|patricck: normally the right play with this holding is to run the 10@S, but it is quite a close call. If you can only lead once because you only have one entry then the correct play is small ...|pg||
nt|patricck: to the K@S|pg||
nt|psridhar: even 3s is conservative in my opinion ...he just needs QJXXX in spd and out for game to make|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: this shd produce the first swing of the match...|pg||
pc|d3|nt|psridhar: the std auction in other room will locate the spd fit at 1 lev and dhampur shd gain a partial here|pg||
nt|brolucius: East not only bid 4@S (over 3NT) at the other table, but persisted to 5@S.|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h2|pg||
nt|panja: they played in 2@S|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Nice and simple|pg||
nt|r_tibre: declarer can always hope for defenders to return the favor|pg||
nt|r_tibre: but will be tough on this deal|pg||
nt|rv: no chance for this contract|pg||
pc|dT|nt|drkvas: hi all this is a test run for the feast tommorow|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|sharkey: S elected to open 1 NT with his semi balanced hand and looks like he's be reaping the benefits|pg||
nt|sharkey: Unless W can make 4 @H tricks|pg||
nt|psridhar: he can i thk|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - think so|pg||
nt|psridhar: the h length in N is a liability|pg||
nt|patricck: North gets endplayed twice|pg||

pc|c5|nt|psridhar: he now needs h to be 3-3 and they r not|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: play out of turn - will claim at the end and update score|pg||
nt|psridhar: or 4 card h to hold 3 dia with dia king in finesse--that also is not the case|pg||
nt|patricck: when South wins 3rd heart, must switch to a club after cashing 1@S to get 2 down.... difficult, but worth an extra imp|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk6: I am not impressed with the way they played the hearts|pg||
nt|psridhar: is this real?|pg||
nt|patricck: declarer is perhaps lucky that the J@D is onside so still only down 1....I would have been tempted to cash for 6 tricks when the Q@C took a trick|pg||
nt|Walddk6: And I don't know how many tricks they missed now|pg||
nt|Walddk6: About 1 million|pg||
nt|patricck: wow|pg||
nt|psridhar: lol|pg||
pc|c9|nt|psridhar: 6s d1 other room so this match is all but over|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|patricck: e.g. with singleton opposite KJ10xxxxx the right play once the first player has played small is King because that works with Ax or Axx onside, whereas small to the Jack only wins ...|pg||
nt|patricck: with Qx onside|pg||

nt|sharkey: NS has an excellent sac in @H|pg||
nt|psridhar: but getting there is the fun|pg||
nt|brolucius: No. He had three diamonds, three clubs (with two finesses) two hearts and the @SA.|pg||
nt|psridhar: what shd S bid over the 3rd seat 1D here? i vote for a take out X|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: it seems the 7 pack sold ot to the 7 carder :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rv: he didn't seem very happy when he was chatting with me last nite, not sure of internal team dynamics|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: hi drvas|pg||
nt|panja: on @D lead A and ruff and @HA and @D?|pg||
nt|patricck: yes par appears to be 500 to EW from 6@H doubled|pg||
nt|sharkey: EW playing Standard or strong @C?|pg||
nt|psridhar: std|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: pause in play.....players updating scorecard|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: in the other room|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes cruel indeed-to open 1C and watch oppo bid and make 2D |pg||
nt|tcpant: Yes I have heard good response in BAM also with 66 Teams|pg||
mb|4N|nt|patricck: can ruff with J@S|pg||

mb|p|nt|patricck: :(|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: i wd bid 1@H|pg||
mb|5C|nt|panja: if E has @ST, decl must ruff with 9|pg||
nt|sharkey: I like 4@H with North's hand - jam the bidding|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: here west managed to get his @C suit in|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: same mistake I made....North is short of diamonds, not South|pg||
nt|Walddk6: I like to double with the South cards and play ELC. 2@D overcall could well have lost spades|pg||
nt|panja: y|pg||
nt|psridhar: E has to read this 4d as natural and support clubs|pg||
nt|tcpant: 204 Pairs in IMP pairs was very encouraging also|pg||
mb|6S|nt|psridhar: Passing 1S on that N hand doesnt seem dafe to me|pg||
nt|psridhar: 1h will work when there is h fit ...but here it loses spds|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 6@S make too?|pg||
nt|psridhar: safe |pg||
nt|brolucius: Was that 'daft' or 'safe'?|pg||
nt|psridhar: sry|pg||
nt|psridhar: safe |pg||
nt|psridhar: 2nd seat preempt on a weak suit ( for 4 level), what was the objective there?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk6: ELC = Equal Level Conversion|pg||
nt|psridhar: even 2c may go down|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: Mango had their share of slam luck in first session when they landed a grand dropping doubleton Q of trumps in an 8 card fit|pg||
nt|psridhar: i was abt to say that Roland-2D on that moth eaten suit opp a passed hand is not my fav-the take out X is more flex and brings spd into pic|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, I like double rather than 2@D as well, but close decision, would not criticise 2@D|pg||
nt|panja: better still, why not overcall 1@S?|pg||
nt|psridhar: gud judgement at both tbls|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 2@S wud have gone down a packet|pg||
nt|psridhar: operator pl post results of bds 18 and 19|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk6: http://www.bridgeguys.com/EGlossary/EqualLevelConversion.html|pg||
nt|panja: with a structure to handle 4-card overcalls..of course|pg||
nt|sharkey: No - @D breaking bad and communications problem|pg||
nt|psridhar: i expect 6s will go down|pg||
nt|psridhar: h lead taps dummy|pg||
nt|panja: hi all|pg||
nt|panja: 6@C might have been better, I guess|pg||
nt|patricck: definitely|pg||
nt|rv: maybe it has to do with style, Kushari and Bhabesh probably gel better together since they are from same Kolkatta school|pg||
nt|r_tibre: perhaps it wasnt an objective, and the reason lies in the past|pg||
pc|cA|nt|patricck: 1@S is ok when you find a spde fit, but it makes some auctions very awkward later|pg||
nt|sharkey: I'm not sure I agree with 4@S - 5 points and 6 card suit.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|psridhar: 3H is probably Kushari's last game try|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i suppose Sridhar that you are treating the weak @H suit as a 4 carder and the @S suit as a 4 carder :)|pg||
nt|patricck: that is true, double is tempting, but nothing really wrong with 1@H either... because of the @H987 I go with the 1@H call but double very close 2nd choice|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sunsamvar: South will be sqeezed on the play of @D and this cud make|pg||
pc|s2|nt|psridhar: other room ahs saved in 5c --500?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: squeezed|pg||
nt|psridhar: when pd has a weak hand as here it doesnt matter...but if he has values to compete for part score the X will enable him in my opinion|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rv: playing @sk is better since you can cash !qxxx only with West|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|patricck: on this lead South might just continue spades anyway|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sharkey: With @D 3-3 and trumps 3-2 this wud make|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: conn. recovered. will update scores after claim|pg||
nt|psridhar: ty|pg||
pc|h2|pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|Walddk6: ELC solves all probs. If partner responds diamonds or spades, all is fine, and if you get (the more likely) 2@C, you convert to 2@D to show diamonds and spades|pg||
nt|psridhar: nice 9 of spd by decl|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|pc|d5|pc|c4|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|psridhar: perhaps a consolation 2 imp to mango here..but Railways are taking all big swings|pg||
nt|patricck: If you overcall 1@S and partner bids 2@C what do you do? Bid 2@D and see partner bid 2@S with a doubleton?|pg||
nt|panja: not all, some, perhaps, many|pg||
nt|panja: for one, if W bids 2@h or 3@H, with Club length....what shd partner do?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|brolucius: Ten easy tricks, once the club lead saves any problem in that suit.|pg||
nt|patricck: but a suspicious @S9 given South knows that partner has a 5 card suit|pg||
nt|psridhar: 9 tricks and wd|pg||
pc|sT|nt|panja: it solves problems if W passes, most of them, let us say|pg||
nt|rv: marginally better since you also cater to stiff @sq in other hand|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sunsamvar: i suppose a @H was led in the closed room to take 3 nt down|pg||
nt|psridhar: having decided not to lead Pd's suit , N might hv considered leading clubs|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: true Sridhar|pg||
nt|psridhar: both black suits need help from pd-clubs need much less|pg||
nt|psridhar: 6c might hv played better...another reason why u shdn open 4s there|pg||

nt|sharkey: W places pd with a GOOD 6 card suit here and jumps to 6@S - dont think W at fault here|pg||
nt|panja: y, more interesting question is, how can E show @CQ to 3, and @SK to 6?|pg||
nt|psridhar: If E had passed 4H as he should..how would the auction proceed? W to bal with 4NT?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Mind you, with declarer playing the @CQ from dummy (which was not at all a good idea), he might still have lost two club tricks.|pg||
nt|psridhar: the theory of leading long suits is based on defense gaining tempo 3 times so that u can set up your long suit; but when declarer threatens to run a long suit of his own defense ...|pg||
nt|psridhar: has to look for QUICK tricks|pg||
nt|tcpant: In CR 6S will make as SK was played|pg||
mb|1C|nt|psridhar: this one is a lock :)|pg||
nt|panja: South is Sanjay Damle, N is Raju Gulavani, W is Kamal Mukherjee...|pg||
mb|d|nt|patricck: any 5-1 @H break except singleton Ace would have beaten it|pg||
nt|psridhar: the stiff h is the ace so...|pg||
mb|1S|nt|patricck: Nice distributional 4@S contract, makes even with a spade misguess|pg||
nt|roswolf: west needs to restrain himself|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: like here East shd lead a @S even if he had 1 less @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: hard for EW to bid 6@C against this start|pg||
nt|psridhar: over 1h W found a fitshowing jump to 2s in other room-it was easy to reach 4s thereafter|pg||
nt|sharkey: not sure - if E passes W wud bid 5@D and E wud prefer to 6@C?|pg||
nt|psridhar: or 5d emphasising minor 2 suitor? 6-5|pg||
nt|patricck: avoiding 5@D is the thing here|pg||
nt|psridhar: so the railways lead was short lived|pg||
mb|1N|nt|psridhar: true ..a typical alok sadhu 1H has EW in totters..|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Looks like 6@H doesn't quite fetch|pg||
nt|panja: 9-card fit on both sides......9=19 tricks though, 1 extra|pg||
nt|rv: Hi all|pg||
nt|tcpant: So DSM in lead again  ... gaining 29-6 in 4 boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: wait ..but his pd has taken him seriously giving EW another bite at the cherry|pg||
nt|brolucius: I was reading some 1955 US bridge magazines while on holiday. They would not have agreed with South's 'free bid' of 1@S on such limited values. Of course we know better nowadays.|pg||
nt|psridhar: 8 card suits are difficult to restrain :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: this time 6 controls...hmm... laltu is getting poorer by the deal :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: more 6 packs for Laltu Sridhar|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: a preemptive 3h instead of 2h might hv quietened E|pg||
nt|psridhar: a bid of 5D will commit to slam almost|pg||

pc|h6|nt|patricck: trump lead is best|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The defence needs to be a little careful|pg||
nt|patricck: vg, 3NT is no trouble|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: how to best play the @D suit here ?|pg||
nt|patricck: best not to play @D|pg||
nt|patricck: needing 3 extra tricks, you need the clubs anyway|pg||
nt|psridhar: declarer will first test clubs and lose an entry to dummy in the process|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|psridhar: it must be frustrating to be not able to bid that club suit :)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|nt|panja: fit-showing?|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|panja: a first time 3@H by N might have solved this problem...|pg||

pc|c7|nt|patricck: A@D lead would be a disaster|pg||
nt|rv: is it really a good slam even with benign breaks, not very sure about that|pg||
nt|psridhar: Laltu gets all controls; EW slams go down on bad breaks..Kushari keeps getting diamonds...i dare say the dealing m/c is consistent :)|pg||
nt|rv: does Sumit's 4@c show not too much extras, some play 3n from his hand as non-serious slam try|pg||
pc|cT|nt|panja: y, this has some chances...|pg||
nt|psridhar: this NS auction sounds confused..and early in the match it will encourage opponents|pg||
nt|panja: even @CA now by E might be bad for EW|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bjacobs: Presumably, N/S are concerned about a hesitation, but it's not going to matter to them in the end|pg||
nt|patricck: when partner opened 1NT and you are sitting over the dimaond bidder with Kxx?|pg||
nt|panja: not a good beginning at trick two, I guess @S would have been better|pg||
nt|Walddk2: done|pg||
nt|psridhar: 6C may make -but EW here are on to 6H|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|patricck: too late|pg||
nt|brolucius: South defends well, taking N/S's heart trick before it vanishes on the @SK.|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes declarer will feel aggrieved|pg||
nt|rv: this is the 6th day of this gruelling team where 2 teams are left standing from original 150 teams|pg||
pc|d4|nt|patricck: escapes for 1 down this time, but that is when partner had a signleton diamond|pg||
nt|psridhar: true|pg||
nt|sharkey: think you shud Dbl when you're reasonably sure of -2; here 1 down wud mean +50 points - making -380|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes 6@C has chances|pg||
nt|rv: in any GF auction, it is important for both sides of partnership to know if they have extras to cross 4M level with confidence|pg||
nt|psridhar: i hear 6c d3 in other room|pg||
pc|d3|nt|nezihk: saat kaç|pg||
pc|dA|nt|patricck: -500 is surely some imps for Mango, maybe a lot if they can bid slam in the CR|pg||
nt|psridhar: only 300 Pat?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: wasn't a safety play in @C better ?|pg||
nt|psridhar: he needed 4 cl tricks sunil|pg||
nt|psridhar: 5 sry|pg||
nt|rv: intial field of 150 was reduced to 32 after 2.5 days of intial swiss leage in 2 groups|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|psridhar: he had to lead a trump to beat it 500|pg||
nt|psridhar: +100 to NS ..somehow i get the feeling it is not enuf|pg||
pc|s4|nt|patricck: yes, that would have been bad too, would need K@D, Q@D overtaken with A@D and a ruff to beat it if east had played A@C|pg||
nt|rv: all slams are poor in my opinion and possibly Laltu should have passed 4@h if Sumit's 4@c showed only courtsey cue|pg||
pc|s5|nt|panja: now @S ruffa....and trumps, and a Club off|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: oh that is right|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sunsamvar: however when both have primary major suits as majors it is tough to finalize a 4-4 minor fit|pg||

nt|sharkey: On the previous borad E didnt bid and NS ended in 5@H Dbl|pg||
nt|patricck: but when partner opens 1NT in 3rd seat should you be worried about him taking liberties?|pg||
nt|psridhar: now this south is all hearts ...i wonder if sumit will be tempted to open 1N|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the controls have moved to west|pg||
nt|rv: biggest upset was co-favorites Formidables (along with Indian Rail) not qualifying to QFs from super-swiss|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: 4@S is a bit high.....it should end in partial in this room|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: It wasn't a terrible contract tho, needed a club honour onside, and perhaps a 3-2 trump break|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: 14 imps then....some light at the end of the tunnel for Mango, but is there a train coming? :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes 4-4-41 hands dont play well -though they hv huge defense potential ...in general|pg||
nt|panja: there, the liberty was with distribution...|pg||
nt|psridhar: he is lucky his pd is abt to bid H |pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|psridhar: no Pat they hv saved 6D-result depends on lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: Would S bid 4@H if N Dbl 4@D?|pg||
nt|patricck: perhaps we should call 15-17 with anything even close to balanced the Indian No Trump?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but again the slam likely to fail|pg||
nt|rv: Kushari is in a belligerent mood against his students and partners:)|pg||
nt|rv: all the top Indian teams with the exception of Texan Aces participated in this most prestigious event of Indian bridge calendar|pg||
mb|3N|nt|bjacobs: West would like to give 2@D the treatment, but maybe double is not for penalties|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: indeed there was a liberty being taken, but should the possibility affect North's decision when it was a 1NT opener?|pg||
nt|panja: not perhaps, but if E held singleton, 4@D might make..|pg||
nt|roswolf: well the fit is found|pg||
nt|roswolf: surely north will desist from bidding on|pg||
nt|brolucius: Standard bidding is unsatisfactory here. South can force with 3@H when he is really strong but then North does not know whether his partner has 4 or 5 hearts. Some players use 2@C ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: as artificial facing the 1NT response.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk6: 2@D is probably a sound heart raise, although I don't think he has one. 2@H is enough|pg||
nt|Walddk6: 9 count  4333|pg||
nt|rv: I think Laltu's pass shows semi positive hand (GF)|pg||
nt|psridhar: rv - bhabesh sd know that |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: it pays to interfere over 2@C esp at this vul|pg||
nt|rv: this is an easy way to make a living for Rail:)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: laltu with his 6-5 has not got a bid in yet|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: but double digit swing yes|pg||
nt|patricck: agreed|pg||
nt|psridhar: over the X they play 2h as bad raise and 2d as normal raise...but i agree it can be construed as bad raise|pg||
nt|panja: five honour cards in 9 HCP....not all useful for a @H contract...but here, because @CA is with South, most cards will pull their full weight|pg||
nt|panja: @S singleton, that is|pg||
nt|rv: here Sumit's pass clearly shows preference to defend since EW are in forcing pass situation|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes but his pd has expressed an opinion|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bjacobs: East certainly thinks it's not for penalties.  And I agree|pg||
nt|psridhar: 11 imp|pg||
nt|psridhar: so make that 30 imp to get in 5 bds|pg||
nt|psridhar: plus KQ doubleton falling|pg||
nt|psridhar: diamonds|pg||
nt|sharkey: No liberties taken at this board - yet...|pg||
nt|panja: 3Nt on finesse|pg||
nt|psridhar: wd laltu|pg||
nt|rv: well judged by Laltu|pg||
nt|psridhar: direct 3nt on 9 hcp and 4-3-3-3 seems pushy|pg||
pc|s5|nt|panja: y|pg||
nt|patricck: If east had a singleton spade then South would have AKxx, which would be difficult to ruff out completely|pg||
nt|panja: AKxx or AQxx..|pg||
nt|psridhar: 1H-4d-4h wd hv been easy-now 1nt opg may well propel them higher|pg||
nt|psridhar: but Sumit's sensible 2H will help|pg||
nt|patricck: Although I have no disagreement with this hand we have seen some very odd 1NT's in this competition|pg||
nt|psridhar: 1100|pg||
nt|mackulky: best done would go for 1100|pg||
nt|rv: most play double in a forcing pass situation as preference to defend, except for Meckwell and a few others who play reverse of meaning of double and pass in a forcing pass ...|pg||
nt|rv: situation|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sT|pg||
nt|Walddk6: I can understand Sanjay's 4@S. He is hoping for a double fit|pg||
nt|psridhar: as it happens opener wd hv accepted the invitn..so no damage|pg||
nt|rv: some of the members of Texan Aces played for other teams though|pg||
nt|rv: Manas and Amarnath would know that their lead would have wiped out after 4@s and 6@s hands|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: n thinking hard with eyes closed|pg||
nt|rv: match on surely and I have a sneaky gut feeling that DSM might actually win this match|pg||
pc|d8|nt|Walddk6: But as they play Precision, he can get something like this|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, Kxxx of the opponents suit is a disappointment|pg||
nt|psridhar: but i guess their 1D does not promise dia Roland|pg||
nt|panja: the 1@D is amorphous, must not count it as showing @D length|pg||
nt|Walddk6: read above|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bjacobs: Amazing what chaos resulted from that little 2@D bid|pg||
nt|psridhar: this flat 3nt wont do the Magoes any good in their 30 imp pursuit|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|Walddk6: "hoping" not "counting"|pg||
nt|panja: instead of the 4@S jump, a 3@H bid would have been better....|pg||
nt|panja: y, Roland, noticed the hope word now...|pg||
nt|panja: N could well have @CK instead of @HK, or, perhaps, some other minor honours...that would be good for 4@S|pg||
nt|panja: but there often is more of totalitarian bridge, rather than egalitarian...as I like to put it|pg||
pc|s8|nt|patricck: very true, still about 30 imps, but only 4 boards|pg||
nt|panja: or, in worst case, KQxx|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|rv: correct safety play in @ds to protect @cK|pg||

pc|d2|nt|sunsamvar: what is the advantage of reversing it rv ?|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|nt|bjacobs: Of course the 2@D bid has worked both ways.  In fact what normally looks like a cold 4@H is somewhat less cold when North shows the diamonds|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rv: eventually I expect Manas to take @h finesse after cashing his 7 tricks|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|psridhar: the sharp young Sumit will swing an overtrick imp or two here|pg||
nt|psridhar: Panja-are u suggesting you shd X 4d only when u see 4 tricks for sure?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|psridhar: experts open 1N on unbal hands when they see a rebid problem if they open 1 of a suit Sunil- i thk Pat is referring to several 1nt opg yday when that was not the case|pg||
pc|h6|nt|psridhar: add an ace to that N hand and he wd be doubling 2D !!|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: what is the rebid for South on the previos hand ?|pg||
nt|rv: most of us play pass as neutral, they play double as neutral|pg||

nt|psridhar: we can expect further bidding from South on that starwberry field ..notwithstanding the 2nt o/c|pg||
nt|brolucius: Few adjectives would do justice to West's 2@C overcall.|pg||
nt|psridhar: prev hand 1nt opg is fine...but if he chose to open 1H he can easily rebid 2D over the forcing 1nt response|pg||
nt|tcpant: No the auction was 1D by N, 1NT by S and 3NT by N in CR|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: I would not open 1N with singleton @D..so I don't really know whether N was right to P or dbl|pg||

nt|psridhar: third 7 card suit for laltu this set|pg||
nt|tcpant: Closed room is playing in 5@C|pg||
nt|psridhar: in 8 bds|pg||
mb|1S|nt|panja: 4@S for NS, but a good sac for EW, too|pg||
nt|psridhar: 5bds and 27 imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: sry Arun Jain Vs dhampur -not shree cements i stand crrected|pg||
nt|psridhar: we guess slam made on a revoke -i do not see any other possibility|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sharkey: 1 NT I assume |pg||
nt|psridhar: barring bd no 36, all bds this set hv been balanced hands|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|Walddk2: Unusual over Unusual. 3@D forcing with spade support|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Looks like 3@D showed some sort of spade hand - "unusual over unusual"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@C would have shown hearts|pg||
nt|psridhar: 3nt vs 4s on bal hands is a perennial issue-here 3nt scores|pg||
nt|patricck: 3NT might have some chances here, but difficult to bid after the 4 card @H ovecall|pg||
nt|tcpant: Yes the Dealing Program is favouring East or as Sridhar informs ... It is the Program Trend which can be exploited in short game|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: At the other table North went four down vulnerable in 3NT (after a very strange auction) on the deal where we saw West goings one down in 3@D on his eight-card suit.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: This way you can bid non-forcing 3@H and 3@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: 3C= nf in H as opposed to direct 3h which wd be F perhaps|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's anyone's guess why West passed that hand in 1st seat|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It looks like West is wondering about that as well ...|pg||
nt|psridhar: 5nt possibly is pick a slam including 6nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Mr Chotan certainly not scared|pg||
nt|rv: it looks like Rail not fielding Subir and DSM not fielding Souren/Uttam in too many rounds|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: this shd go down|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: wow.. grat bid by Sumit|pg||
nt|rv: trump lead might test declarer here|pg||
pc|d3|nt|panja: absolutely...|pg||
nt|patricck: 2@S has worked quite well here, but that doesn't mean I agree with it|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: great|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Wlc Pant ji|pg||
pc|d2|nt|panja: any reason to pull the first tump from a particular side here?|pg||
nt|sharkey: When I try 2@S on such cards it usually means +800|pg||
nt|sharkey: to opps...|pg||
pc|dK|nt|psridhar: but the Laltu conversion will lead to a flat bd|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|brolucius: West might have rebid 3@D instead on the basis that diamonds would still play well if partner had club support.|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@H non forcing - very strange|pg||
nt|psridhar: Sumit is a Superb card player but even he will find it impossible here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: superb and very fast|pg||
nt|tcpant: Hi Sunil|pg||
nt|psridhar: whats that 3D ? DAB? i prefer 3H |pg||
nt|rv: Rail originally started the tourney with 2 trios (Rana, Manas and Subir) and (Sumit, Laltu and Amarnath), but they have subsequently changed|pg||
nt|tcpant: But 1st Set Rana played with Subir|pg||
nt|rv: DSM originally started the event with 3 fixed partnerships, Ashok-Kamal, Bhabesh-Uttam and Kushari-Souren|pg||
nt|psridhar: cant be 4th suit- 3d over 2h is 4th suit not now|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|nt|rv: double dummy defense of cashing 3 @s tricks and @CA before exiting in a @h from North hand might have beaten this|pg||
pc|cK|nt|panja: I would need a bulletproof jacket before I even think of 2@S|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|psridhar: Carl- all the bds this segment - the bidding has one underlying assumption " they wont X for cash" - the point that Pat was making|pg||
nt|brolucius: Can it be forcing when East passed originally?|pg||
nt|rv: I presume Laltu's 3@c showed min reverse|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sharkey: Certainly got EW off to the best lead|pg||
nt|psridhar: if east has spds yes|pg||
nt|brolucius: It was a poor bid because West would have doubled if he had three hearts in addition to both minors.|pg||
nt|psridhar: see the danger of 3D... a bid of 3H wd hv definitely led to 5C - at least it helps E to assess 3nt vs 5c|pg||
pc|h2|nt|drkvas: it is not upto date|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|rv: Sumit's 2@s should be natural 5+Cards, F1|pg||
pc|hK|nt|panja: wonder why S bid on|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree Padmanabban |pg||
nt|patricck: I thought 2NT was for the minors|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|nt|tcpant: This is not good for Railways.... Max 8 tricks if played perfect|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: he shd be named the Lightning Kid :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: Laltu will have figured out oppo hv 4-4 H ( the 3c bid) but admittedly he has a suit oriented hand ..diff decn|pg||
pc|h3|nt|drkvas: bye all gtg to clinic see u tom|pg||
nt|sharkey: think it implies monors - else Dbl wud be t/o with @H|pg||
nt|panja: what is E doing ducking?|pg||
nt|brolucius: It was obvious that West held at most two hearts and East should therefore have bid only 3@D, as I see it.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s2|nt|psridhar: this year the Ruia Gold field has reduced to an overwhelming presence of players from Mumbai and kolkatta...used be so long ago till formidables changed that pattern in the last ...|pg||

nt|Walddk2: moderate hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: well if he had a real suit with no hcp he would have given preference - would he not |pg||
nt|rv: Manas's led a low @d like most of us would do|pg||
nt|r_tibre: def got a second chance|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: play out of turn....tricks missed - will update score after claiming|pg||
nt|r_tibre: the second chance was taken in CR|pg||
nt|r_tibre: but def slipped again in CR|pg||
mc|10|nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgeguys.com/UGlossary/GlossU.html|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: if he did figure out the 4-4 fit, then he shd have respected his partners chioce of 3 nt |pg||
nt|psridhar: Kushari will discard his dia Jack on 2nd/3rd club to make life easy for his pd- dia 9 shd be 0 or 2 higher|pg||

nt|panja: B21, 4@S or 3Nt for EW on @H finesse and @S break|pg||

nt|vugraphzwu: break in play|pg||

nt|vugraphzwu: players will be back shortly|pg||

nt|brolucius: An excellent auction. Well bid,|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: water break for n|pg||
nt|psridhar: so it was not a decision-Sumit merely said he has spds and gf values-it is Laltu who has to decide !|pg||
nt|tcpant: Operator can you please arrange for updating the scores of both rooms|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: will attempt tp do so asap|pg||
nt|tcpant: So after 40 bords scores are tied.... |pg||
nt|rv: Manas Mukherjee, Subir Majumdar and Rana Roy of Indian Railways play for Sree Cement in all other prize-money events|pg||
nt|psridhar: great match|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: 3@H seems beatable|pg||
nt|psridhar: thx Roland; we tried to extend the principle ( lower vs lower) vs any 2 suitor o/c; ran into complications -for eg u open 1nt lho overcalls 2c -landy now?|pg||
nt|psridhar: if u must open 2nt on a 19 counter make sure u hv a decent 5 card suit !|pg||
nt|psridhar: but the bidding may well die at 1s Panja|pg||

nt|rv: Sumit Mukherjee and Laltu (Debrata Majumder) play for DSM in other events|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|nt|patricck: good slam in either @S or @D here|pg||
nt|patricck: I wouldn't think EW would venture to game here, despite the excellent @S suit|pg||
nt|sharkey: @C lead will set 4@S|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|psridhar: 15 imps and 4 bds exciting match|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: no 1 nt opening here Patrick :)|pg||
nt|rv: it is a roller-coaster, misses, hits, spills and thrills all the way through|pg||
mb|3N|nt|psridhar: it certainly works well over unusual 2nt showing minors |pg||
nt|roswolf: 15 imps in 4 bds is not insurmountable|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: You could play 2@H as showing the minors, with clubs equal or greater than diamonds; 2@S shows longer diamonds (after the Landy bid)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H heart stop, no spade stop. 2@S spade stop, no heart stop. NT stops in both majors. That's one way of playing it|pg||
nt|rv: 3n would have been interesting contract, it might make on @s lead by West|pg||
nt|rv: I suppose you can expect this when all players know each other so well and end of 6th day of continuos bridge|pg||
mb|4H|an| |nt|psridhar: i hear that slam on bd 27 made because when a dia was played off the tbl S played 2 cards -the ACE and 9 of dia- the 9 was visible so diro ruled it in|pg||
nt|psridhar: i thk NS hv enough grounds to contest that decision on appeal|pg||
nt|psridhar: anybody's match from here|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i favour railways because of their lead|pg||
nt|rv: what would the panel open with South hand, I might fancy 1n|pg||
nt|tcpant: Railways bid & made 3NT in closed room so 6 IMPs may go|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: they won't need to|pg||
nt|psridhar: 1. Dia ace was the setting trcik|pg||
nt|panja: @D better..with the 54 fit....easier to remove trumps and take your discards...|pg||
nt|patricck: indeed, I was looking at that, but perhaps the strong intermediate cards and 5 card @D make it too good for 1NT :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: 2nt is certainly ambitious pushing for a NV game|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: coming to Bd 19 and N's controvertial 1D response...other room got to 3nt EW-let us see if it is a success|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w on the way|pg||
nt|psridhar: w is worth a 3d here|pg||
nt|brolucius: West should not go too high now. His partner is a passed hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: This is the same position as the CR.  They took their spade ruff, but failed to cash the diamond tricks|pg||
nt|panja: but 2 IMP difference for a @S contract|pg||
nt|psridhar: he will survive if he gets dia rt|pg||
nt|rv: Manas's 2N was Jordan showing limit raise or better in @hs|pg||
pc|cA|nt|roswolf: at the score a strange decision by west|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes |pg||
nt|brolucius: A minor-suit game, on a 4-4 fit, needs good values. I think West's pass was correct.|pg||
nt|psridhar: it just may be the winning decn|pg||
nt|brolucius: East might have had more of his values in spades, where they would not have been productive.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|psridhar: 4s fast arrival showing poor hand but cant stop N from slam|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Yes RV but it must be right sided... best if South opened a NT|pg||
nt|psridhar: shd score an overtrick in comfort|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c7|pg||
nt|patricck: and indeed Sumit agrees with me on the valuation, hence the 2NT rebid|pg||
nt|psridhar: 1nt is attractive RV no doubt...but how about N bid over 1d? being a passed hand wont 2c be a picture bid? enables rt siding nt if it is rt|pg||
nt|tcpant: Yes that will mean 7|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bjacobs: They didn't get to first base in this room!|pg||
nt|psridhar: doesnt 4s make?|pg||
nt|psridhar: how do u defeat 4s?|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|nt|sharkey: Think W shud Dbl 2nd time and correct 2@H to 2@S |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|panja: Aces ask that does not tell much here|pg||
nt|panja: once N opens, the ! for finesse goes down...but is W right to bid so conservatively? is there an option? say a dbl of 1@D?|pg||
nt|brolucius: A trump back is best now, because West has a bundle of cards to ruff in the East hand. Yes, he has found the trump return.|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: play out of turn.....will update scores on claiming|pg||
nt|rv: excellent start to defense by Sumit-Laltu, ducking @c not so great by Laltu|pg||
nt|rv: yes time for afternoon cuppa for those in India to keep ourselves awake on a Sun afternoon:)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|psridhar: defense has essentially done the same mistake here too|pg||
nt|psridhar: the diro should keep in mind that the expert defender is on play with setting trick vs a slam -bd 27|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I'm fairly sympathetic to this particular mistake|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Aloke probably felt that he didn't need to give partner a spade ruff|pg||
nt|psridhar: perhaps Dia king lead and THEN spd shift wd hv achieved|pg||
nt|psridhar: why Panja? he used ace ask as route to discover his pd's trump Q|pg||
nt|panja: well...the ace answer did not tell much..|pg||
nt|panja: I am trying to make out the meaning of further bids..|pg||
nt|panja: 5@D, what was it?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bjacobs: Yes, the diamond lead makes it all so much simpler|pg||
nt|psridhar: not very tough as pd has shown dia as one of his suits |pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|psridhar: yes 5d asked abt trump q|pg||
nt|psridhar: i am told other room in 3d as NS-so the trailers CVR may gain|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|panja: and 5@S shows trump Q?|pg||
nt|psridhar: 2nd step yes|pg||

pc|c5|nt|bjacobs: It's still very tough to expect him to pass this|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: and gain imps here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i would not bid 3@D pAT|pg||

nt|patricck: just imagine how ugly 3@D would have been if North was the other way around in the minors|pg||

nt|rv: maybe Bhabesh should have bid 3@d instead of 3@h as a good raise, surely Kushari would have bid game|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bjacobs: Indeed|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Pity about the two grand slams in this set, but this board produced excellent bridge|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks all, back in 15 mins or so with segment 2|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h4|nt|psridhar: yes i prefer 1h to be raised to 2h on that N hand|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: These 2 teams have come thrugh a gruelling 5 days of league and knock out matches to get to the finals|pg||
mc|10|nt|panja: best way to play is, @HKA at T23, and if two honours don't drop, finesse @D|pg||
nt|rv: in my opinion it is more of Bhabesh's fault|pg||

pc|c5|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|panja: so he is looking at 5 potential losers, a Club, a !M, @SK, and @HKQ...for the dbl...W should cover 2..so 4@H bid is in order|pg||

nt|vugraphzwu: gr8|pg||
nt|panja: the problem...is..their 1@H rebid is artificial..as in last hand|pg||
nt|panja: therefore, with 16 and @H suit, they would often prefer to open 1@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: that settles it with game making n the other room|pg||
nt|tcpant: So 6 IMPs to DSM|pg||

nt|vugraphzwu: for this room|pg||

mb|3C|nt|panja: last hand, I mean, B9, where they bid a @S slam|pg||

mb|p|nt|psridhar: i do not have scores of other semifinal sorry|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: multiple conn. failure to server|pg||

mb|3D|nt|brolucius: Declarer was marked with the @DK by the @DQ lead and the game was cold if he also held the @HA, so South had a 100% switch to hearts.|pg||

mb|p|nt|panja: will 4@S make here on @D lead? B23|pg||

nt|panja: aceless NS hands, they have already bid enough...|pg||
nt|psridhar: CVR has tried a naughty take out X and will pay for it|pg||
nt|rv: Banerjee would settle for 10 tricks here|pg||
pc|s4|nt|psridhar: now coming to rolands ELC, this east hand has similar shape except it is clubs and not dia -so cant apply that ELC take out X|pg||
nt|patricck: correct|pg||
nt|panja: true...so the idea does not have that essential symmetry|pg||
nt|panja: will have to finesse @H and discard two Clubs|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sharkey: 2@C 1@S and @D ruff?|pg||

mb|d|nt|panja: no....provide for a 4-card overcall|pg||
mb|3D|mb|4C|nt|panja: so..don't correct from a minor suit|pg||
nt|patricck: but then if partner overcalls 4 carders that regularly that I am altering my bidding then maybe the 1@S is alertable so that the opponents are given full information as well|pg||
nt|brolucius: Despite the success of his previous 2@S overcall, Banerjee cannot risk it again on that hand when vulnerable.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: Whisky time for you Patrick ?|pg||

mb|p|nt|psridhar: wd laltu|pg||
nt|rv: well judged by Laltu, 5 level was not very safe on combined hands of EW|pg||

nt|rv: what would be the panel's choice of lead?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|drkvas: @cj|pg||
nt|rv: anyone for @cj ?|pg||
nt|psridhar: in the face of pd's pass of 3c, the cJ looks like a MP lead|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rv: this lead gives Laltu a fighting chance|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h8|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|nt|psridhar: and a 3rd Rwy lead this match|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|r_tibre: very strange auction in the other room though... 1@H-2@D-x-p!-3c-p-p-3@D-4@c-p-5@C!!!|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rv: actually more than a fighting chance, he should make it now|pg||
nt|tcpant: In CR, contract 2NT by East making 3|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bigtrain: the law always needs adjusted for minor honor subtractions (cards that a side holds that don't contribute to the offense) - on this hand there are ALOT|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|rv: Sumit clearly has 1 or both majors, but Bhabesh has all the values and entries, so tough choice I would guess|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|rv: looks like all players are tiring|pg||
nt|vugraphzwu: play out of turn. will claim missed tricks at the end.|pg||

nt|panja: partner could hv @HJTx....for @H to work...not unreasonable expectation|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: now the lead down to 5 imps|pg||
nt|psridhar: Docvas- in Std 3c can be 5-4 with 12 hcp OR 5-5 with 14 hcp in that auction, so rana shd hv passed 3d and hoped his pd wd compete to 4c|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: pass for me with Laltu's hand|pg||
nt|psridhar: right Panja, when u hv no clear lead u hv to hope for spots with pd on the suit u lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: still i agree that 5c in that auction is over optimistc|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: why did North not balance with 1@D ?|pg||

mb|p|nt|panja: but..it can be defeated|pg||
nt|drkvas: old malani school says once no game no game.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: 4@h makes as cards are|pg||
pc|c8|nt|rv: if Sumit had Xed, Bhabesh might have run out to 4@d:)|pg||
nt|panja: declarer needs entry to Dummy to cash @D..so has to play a small @C off..upon which EW can cash 3 Spades|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|nt|drkvas: so either pt with shape can compete with out fear of the hangmans knot|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|psridhar: they can beat 1C ...but it is tempting to balance on that red suit holding|pg||
nt|patricck: i vote for 1@D|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes - Bhabesh shd hv done more than 2H-on that hand|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sA|nt|rv: I expect Sumit and Laltu to find the defense to beat this|pg||
