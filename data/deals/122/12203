nt|jcwla: Rehi Bill and Tony.|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: the best players of the weekend(my opinion) in front of us now|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: pressure 4@H, hoping to induce an incorrect 4@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@H wide-ranging in a strong club system|pg||
nt|jcwla: The best feature IMHO of such a system.|pg||
nt|athene: no problems bringing this home|pg||
nt|athene: losing just one trick in each side-suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, but if Allfrey bids again, it will cost 800|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: or 590|pg||
pc|dA|nt|wilkinsona: well, he may x and get a pass|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|pc|d9|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: still a low point count game..|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the other room Forrester opened a two-suited 2@H and was raised to game over East's double|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so no swing|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dT|pc|d5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 19 IMPs, 7 boards|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s5|pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||

nt|yo_yo: good morning from Manchester|pg||
nt|justin c: forrester-bakhshi system is more natural|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: Welcome to the Gold Cup final|pg||
nt|justin c: and excellent players all|pg||
nt|athene: hi good morning everyone :)|pg||
nt|justin c: welcome back all|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello again Justin  and everyone from Manchester|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and everyone else too :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2 sets to go|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 16 boards|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Can Collins overtake the superstars?|pg||
nt|justin c: i thought there were 24 more|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 24 is correct|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3 x 8|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah yes i cant count    3 more including this|pg||
nt|justin c: plenty of time for collins to get back 30 odd imps|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well i dont think Allfrey's team will sit back and let them do that  but who knows|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: plenty system/defence discussion going on...|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I wonder if Patrick Collins has his usual pint of beer next to him?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: will get going in a minute|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: currently sipping a glass of water...|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|justin c: hi Bill, Kath|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hi |pg||
nt|justin c: hope the players are feeling more wide awake than I am|pg||
nt|athene: you might bid 2@C on that south hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is that a 14-16 NT?|pg||
nt|lestergold: Well re hi folks this should be pretty nailbiting 8 boards and 19 imps the difference anything cna happen|pg||
nt|tweety1: rehi all|pg||
mb|d|nt|jwit: Good morning everyone'|pg||
nt|lestergold: re hi Veysel|pg||
mb|4H|nt|yo_yo: is that asptro in action ?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcwla: Hi, Jon.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jwit: Hi Jordan|pg||
nt|othered1: Rehi, everyone!|pg||
pc|dA|nt|yo_yo: pity no cc  on offer so we have to guess|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D spades+another, and 2NT showing both minors i guess|pg||
nt|athene: now west knows his hearts are facing a singleton or void, which isn't great news|pg||
nt|tweety1: will probably make|pg||
pc|d4|nt|yo_yo: goodness, he's taking it very seriously|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hi ed|pg||
nt|justin c: hi|pg||
nt|lestergold: well N/S have bid cold ghame on combined 19 so no gain here likely for Collins|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lestergold: well half way thru and they are neck and neck 7 imps only one part score swing apart|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@C looks ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: Welcome back to Stanza 5 of the gold Cup final|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Kath.  Hi, Justin and Stephen.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well that with me would show a 6 card @S suit|pg||
nt|justin c: think i saw forrester rebid 2@C on a previous hand as a transfer to diamonds (which would explain this 2@S rebid)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that explains it then|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 2@S is @S and @C|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|justin c: every card marked for declarer by the opening bid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Leading from Jxxx  is usually not recommended |pg||
nt|justin c: needs tricks from everywhere, with only limited entries to W|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is this a sort of double-bluff lead|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi Christine|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: Hi Everyone|pg||
nt|lestergold: this perfect fit but not easy to reach the only playable game of 5C|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Christine|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 5C weants to be bid here only one off|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: Welcome back to the penultimate stanza of the gold cup final|pg||
nt|lestergold: lucky to find they were dealt a 30 point pack in effect|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|nt|jallerton: Hi all, takes a @c switch to beat 4@h|pg||
pc|c4|nt|justin c: fourth highest of yr longest & strongest :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes we were all taught that one|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|athene: leading declarer's known short suit is almost always safe|pg||
nt|lestergold: This may even be a good result because 3N only needs the dim finesse which happens to be wrong |pg||
nt|lestergold: 4h would make in practice by safety play of cashing spade ace|pg||
nt|othered1: rehi, everyone!|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Ed|pg||
pc|hK|nt|tweety1: rehi every1|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jallerton: @d7 is a wishy washy card|pg||
nt|jwit: Robson will find the switch|pg||
nt|jallerton: @dA asked for (reverse) attitude|pg||
nt|jallerton: He might even underlead in @d - only one lower pip missing|pg||
nt|jallerton: so Q(9)(8)7 looks likely holding in partner|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I agree but in case W DBLs 2@H, it would be easier for E to bid @C|pg||
nt|yo_yo: thanks Stephen, keep us informed|pg||
nt|tweety1: Hello every1|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hi |pg||
nt|justin c: 4@H would have made|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/W have made right decision here so we await comparison with interest|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|pg||
pc|h2|nt|yo_yo: that @C109  is like gold dust|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Last time i was in Forrester was playing with Bakhski|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jallerton: well donw|pg||
pc|hA|nt|justin c: y|pg||
nt|justin c: unpleasant choice for Bakhshi here|pg||
nt|athene: endplayed in four suits :)|pg||
nt|athene: that's usually the way when your partner brings so little to the party|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he has to work out which is the least of all eveils|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|athene: a diamond looks normal|pg||
nt|lestergold: east of course had to take insurance as it was unlikelt that 4H was going off|pg||
nt|justin c: can eliminate minors before running a @S|pg||
nt|lestergold: simple safety play makes 4H in any case|pg||
nt|justin c: y, was thinking about @SKJx in west|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lestergold: well defence did declarer's work for him but wouldnt have made a difference|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h9|pc|d2|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c3|nt|yo_yo: Now Bakshi is playing with Andrew Robson|pg||
nt|tweety1: Bakshish:)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: very flexible obviously|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|tweety1: do you know what bakshis mean?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's a difficult hame :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no, is it polite?|pg||
nt|tweety1: lol|pg||
nt|tweety1: Its an English word|pg||
nt|tweety1: == tip|pg||
nt|yo_yo: equals?|pg||
nt|justin c: @C ruff is eventually going to be the 8th trick|pg||
nt|tweety1: =tip|pg||
nt|lestergold: For benefit of non british specs, the Gold Cup is an annual knockout teams played over a long period with the final rounds played in public- winning this event is considered a ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: presigious achievment|pg||
pc|c7|nt|yo_yo: no i give in|pg||
nt|tweety1: Its one of the english words taken from Turkish|pg||
nt|tweety1: so back to bridge|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i got it, a tip you would give to a waiter|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jwit: He probably shifted to the club at trick two fearing declarer had Qxx or QJx for 3NT bid|pg||
pc|d7|nt|yo_yo: i see an endplay looming |pg||
nt|athene: now he can throw north in with the diamond to lead into the clubs, if he reads the position|pg||
nt|justin c: hi all|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Justin|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|h8|nt|lestergold: prestigious|pg||

nt|athene: hearts vs. diamonds...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@D is top spot|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: d game swing Roland?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|Walddk2: But 1@D has little to do with diamonds so you never know|pg||
nt|jcwla: Allfrey's in the top spot then in the CR.|pg||
nt|athene: NS may be hampered by the nebulous 1@D opener|pg||
nt|athene: they might not find the fit|pg||
nt|athene: 1@H X 4@H for instance|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Walddk2: Maybe they will end up in the doomed 3NT|pg||
mb|d|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Allfrey will not give them a losing option|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|athene: 2@H interesting...is that intermediate systemically, or he just decided to bid it anyway even if "weak"|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: well needed to bid..|pg||
nt|athene: this is where you pay the bills for playing strong club and 5-card majors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There you go, no-one knew they had a diamond fit|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: 1@D very weak tactically|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is of course wash&go, and the match is virtually over|pg||
nt|athene: specs who wanted a close match will be disappointed|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|nt|wilkinsona: why not though, partner is short of hearts, to bid 5 D is clear Im afraid|pg||
nt|athene: well, north could just be 4-2-2-5 with lots of cards for X then X|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Highly unlikely that E-W don't have 10 hearts between them|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 1 dont buy that, the oppo rates to have 10 hearts|pg||
nt|athene: south might take that view, but it's hardly clearcut|pg||
nt|athene: once you start bidding at the 5-level on the fit the opps are supposed to have, you will find yourself getting pushed around an awful lot|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|nt|Walddk2: But the trouble is that North can't support diamonds|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: exactly|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last time Stuart opened 1@D he had Kx|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: the double should be primarily take out than and I have a 6 card suit|pg||
nt|jcwla: So we've seen the best and worst of the system in two hands.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|nt|Walddk2: Let's face it, Tony, diamonds are often lost in a strong club system|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s7|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, in my system 1 d natural 1st & 2nd|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Some even play that it can be zero. 4405|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: thats to shelve the 4414 2 bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A spec says that in his system 1@D shows 4+ in 1st, 2nd, 3rd and even 4th!  |pg||
pc|d5|pc|h3|pc|d4|pc|d9|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, he doesn't play Acol. 5-card majors rather, 1@C 2+, so 1@D is almost always 5+|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: sorry should keep quiet perhaps I have seen some fantastic plays by the Tredenecks this weekend.. sorry to be critacal of one bid|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: so, both rooms missed game|pg||
nt|lestergold: easy for N/S to get too high here|pg||

mb|3H!|nt|wilkinsona: 4-4 spade fir for EW, but not a nice break|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@h = 4+@s|pg||
nt|athene: proof how much it's good to bid aggressively after a 1NT opener from opps|pg||
nt|lestergold: but 6 sensible to bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5D making on position o club ace|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lestergold: could be a swing here|pg||
mb|5D|nt|justin c: 6@S here|pg||
nt|othered1: let's see h ow easy it is without opponents getting focus on @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  hello, guys, hi to kibs|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 3N by N/S looks like a trick short|pg||
nt|lestergold: coming in at these colors difficult for N/S|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind you i would have bid 2H with north|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: Peter Crouch was part of the winning Premier League team here a few weeks ago|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear Collins needed to save|pg||
nt|tweety1: good 1 @d open here by S|pg||
pc|h6|nt|justin c: this is going to struggle|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I havent seen him  play with Forrester before  |pg||
nt|lestergold: shape is the influencingfactor|pg||
nt|justin c: I have to go - enjoy the rest of the match all :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Sveta!|pg||
nt|tweety1: hi Sveta|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think the fat lady is getting out of her limo|pg||
nt|lestergold: the wind seems to be behind the Allfrey sails|pg||
nt|lestergold: I expect that Forrester must have a few gold cup wins under his belt|pg||
nt|tweety1: He is assumed the best of UK I heard or?|pg||
nt|lestergold: the Alfrey team having two of our greatest players in it Robson and Forrester world class|pg||
nt|lestergold: well I am biassed there are new boys on the block but Forrester's record is very distinguished|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  luck is a feature of the really decent player, so  finding 2 aces onsite must indicate NS as the winners (of this board, as it is)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: grand slam here is a little better than the diamond finesse, but not much better|pg||
nt|justin c: or 6NT|pg||
nt|justin c: bye|pg||
nt|tweety1: this brd can be a dfraw|pg||
nt|lestergold: i am reliably informed that Robosn and Bakhshi are three time winners Allfrey twice and Forrester countless|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: and it does fail to @SJxxx offside, so i doubt anyone is going to be bidding it|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2 Kings and 3 card support  is good|pg||
nt|justin c: chances for a 13th in both minors|pg||
nt|lestergold: but it could be a push at 3N-1 in both rooms|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|lestergold: unopposed this reg partnership should reach the slam|pg||
nt|tweety1: draw|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jallerton: 4th highest of longest and strongest!|pg||
nt|athene: this all looks like an old-fashioned precision auction|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt natural GF; 2@S natural; 2NT minimum without @SHxx or better|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh on this lead i forgot|pg||
nt|lestergold: N/S should have tried to take up some space in tghis auction at least a barrage to 4H|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jcwla: Hi, Tony.  Well, 4@H came home in the CR, so 10 to Allfrey and Waterlow can't take any more hits like that.|pg||
nt|athene: 3@C improvising; now 3@S shows support|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jallerton: probably 3@h showed a minisplinter in @d and West tried 4@S knowing the EW hands to be fiting well|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 3@H showed a shortage 'somewhere'|pg||
nt|justin c: not an easy hand to bid|pg||
nt|tweety1: To me as a foreigner, Forrester  team members are rather more popular than Collins'.|pg||
nt|justin c: two diamonds, two clubs, two hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: Im not sure about the others but they are all prominent players|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: if auction had gone 2H by n 2s by east 4H by south west would now be pretty fixed|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jallerton: OK, thanks Stephen|pg||
nt|lestergold: could be a swing because west's hand is not a mandatory overcall|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @C and possible 9|pg||
nt|lestergold: Patterson and tred twins won it twice|pg||
mc|11|nt|athene: west might just bash the grand slam in when he finds his partner with the red kings|pg||
nt|justin c: a Q in east rather than those jacks would be 13 on top|pg||
nt|lestergold: ht lead created 9th trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: so certainly all worthy finalists|pg||

nt|lestergold: Roland says it was too good fro him|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 1nt from south|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|rnmalik: DBL the other two suits or what|pg||
mb|p|nt|tweety1: Roland wld play it 8|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|lestergold: For benefit of non British specs, the GoldCup is an annual knockout teams and a Gold Cup in is extremely prestigious and much ought after on a player's CV|pg||
nt|dburn:  takeout, denies four spades|pg||
nt|justin c: guess x denies @S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: ok|pg||
nt|othered1: Nobody passes 1 bids non-vul any more|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this is not making it easy for e/w to enter and bid their frigid game|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Deep position here by W.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|justin c: 3@C some sort of 'mixed' raise|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and if he had 4@S then|pg||
nt|lestergold: in open 2H overcall a little unsound but it brought home the baconm so a swing back to Allfrey|pg||
nt|othered1: And most of the grand slam pick-up goes back.|pg||
nt|tweety1: oh mky|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: A textbook 26-HCP 3NT here.|pg||
nt|jallerton: nasty lead for North to have to make|pg||
nt|jallerton: He was half right - partner does have a 5-card major!|pg||
nt|jcwla: On 26, while Robson was down 2 in 4@SX here, Forrester was down 2 in 5@DX in the CR -- a gain of 14 to Waterlow to within 8.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i see Forrester doesnt mind a 5422 hand to open 1NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: Forrester finds a third in hand effort|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: north can't bid stayman because 1NT - 2@C; 2@D - 2@S isn't that hand for them|pg||
mb|p|nt|tweety1: seems a draw|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn:  3@c mixed raise, 3@d "last train" game try|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: this has losers everywhere|pg||
nt|dburn:  then he would bid spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: its only fifties|pg||
nt|tweety1: NS are good at stealing the contract cheap..|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w may have made a struggling 2 H|pg||
pc|h7|nt|justin c: 10 tricks for EW in @C, but not easy to balance here|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4 card too|pg||
nt|tweety1: 2 @c check back|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|dburn:  a radical approach, perhaps, but it has some technical merit|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this is an extrwemely over fed chicken that wont begin to fight|pg||
nt|justin c: :)|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|lestergold: habnds of course are very duplicated|pg||
nt|lestergold: but 1n does not look all chopped liver|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  tiny board - achiving 7 tricks needs a lot of work|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think it needs more than work it needs defensive help|pg||
pc|h9|nt|justin c: looks natural to me|pg||
nt|justin c: maybe a puppet to 2@D|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well collings didnt show @H|pg||
nt|tweety1: if natural why 2 @d?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 2@C checkback with 1NT rebid being wide-ranging|pg||
nt|justin c: ty|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and 2@D stephen?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 1@D promises at least 1 4c Major|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 2@D was minimum|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|nt|jcwla: Down four to tie it up.|pg||
nt|lestergold: I tink the overcall was justified by the spade holding over the spade opener altho my normal reqwuirements would be for a sixth heart|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  it happens - as we see |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: if north had started with 2@C, east could have doubled, and then west would have an easy 3@C bid|pg||
nt|justin c: the partner of a 1NT hand can be just short of a game try, when your balancing bid gets crushed|pg||
nt|othered1: North will take his 3 and run|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c3|nt|yo_yo: well it appears Robson is indeed in 7@S on the last|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|justin c: y, much easier if north bids 2@C|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|athene: i'm told robson is indeed in 7@S in the other room|pg||
nt|lestergold: as we see the danger of NOT overcalling is this resuklt here|pg||

nt|athene: now @CA, @DAK, and a diamond ruff just to rub salt in the wound|pg||

mb|p|nt|justin c: the 3nt here that got a @H lead was worth 11|pg||

nt|justin c: other table in 1nt the other way, oddly|pg||

mb|2D|nt|justin c: 4@H for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: right that dfidnt surprise me as i said i didnt thibnk it would make without it|pg||
nt|lestergold: it took them 11 bids to reach it as well and unopposwed|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I like N's hand - the only problem is- what a game to play.|pg||
mb|3C|nt|justin c: 4@S EW beatable if NS can find their @C ruffs|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|yo_yo: is that Truscott in action from Bakhshi?  I thought only I played that|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Everyone scorns it |pg||
nt|athene: if the play record is to be believed, Robson took an interesting line in 7@S|pg||
nt|athene: he gave up on dropping the @CQ, throwing a club from dummy early|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 1NT = 1major + 1 minor|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C is Stayman, then :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: Passive lead! I confess I would have led @sQ|pg||
nt|tweety1: They will find the grand|pg||
mb|4C|nt|jcwla: Long auction to a hopeless contract.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|athene: it can be hard to express a strong hand after opps open 1@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this is a nicetame copntract that will play ityself|pg||
nt|justin c: 3NT unbeatable with @D 4-4|pg||
nt|yo_yo: normal to play in the 4- 4 major fit|pg||
nt|othered1: Any idea where the OR auction went off the rails into that silly slam?|pg||
nt|lestergold: and it took N/S here 4 quick bids to not even begin to cobnsider it|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: and a normal lead dont you think?|pg||
nt|lestergold: it will be a push ive no doubt|pg||
nt|lestergold: right to play in no trumops in case of any bad breaks in a chosen trump suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: but academic here as no bad breaks anywhere|pg||
nt|tweety1: N thinking how to show his void maybe.|pg||
nt|tweety1: together with his key cards sure:)|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|nt|lestergold: Crouch will surely bid the one more now|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  is now @c a trump? i suppose |pg||
nt|tweety1: so 6 @h = 2 KCs + a void or 3 KCs?|pg||
mb|7S|nt|jallerton: depending on their agreements, West might have implied a doubleton spade|pg||
nt|jcwla: 2NT-swish in the CR.|pg||
nt|jallerton: 19-21 range played by Hackett/Waterlow.  20-21(22) here|pg||
nt|jallerton: Hence the deicisions of the respective Easts|pg||
nt|jallerton: Spec asks: So why would Victor not rise with the ace of diamonds to play on spades|pg||
nt|jallerton: answer: there's probably no hurry when he holds @ha as well|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: 12 imps to the good guys or the bad guys according to your preference|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: i believe Bakhshi has shown a strong hand when he bids again|pg||
nt|athene: if you overcall on rubbish, some people play you have to *pass* with a good hand, and come in later|pg||
nt|athene: forrester bid 4@H hoping opps would bid 4@S over it|pg||
nt|lestergold: second best spot reached very reasonable|pg||
nt|tweety1: no sðace for caos|pg||
nt|tweety1: space|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: no flat boards here folks every hand a coconut!!|pg||
nt|tweety1: @hj|pg||
pc|hA|nt|yo_yo: a sort of "come into my parlour" bid|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c2|pg||
nt|justin c: lol|pg||
nt|athene: the only problem with these bids is when west bids 4@S over it and partner bids 5@H over that :)|pg||
nt|justin c: forrester's parlour are where minus 500s happen|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes tell me about it!|pg||
nt|athene: west's double is a bit weird|pg||
nt|athene: it looks more normal to pass until opps get into hearts, and then double|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|tweety1: a swing|pg||
nt|justin c: not too easy to guess to lead a @D - looks likely to blow a trick|pg||
nt|tweety1: to my team:)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: gosh does Forrester play mckenny signals?|pg||
nt|othered1: If the @SQ were the @HQ, slam would be good, but you really should have a method to determine trump quality|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jallerton: @sA would have been a great play holding @sA|pg||
nt|tweety1: to the bad guys and good players:)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Are you saying we've got a lovely bunch of coconuts?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well if 11 unopposed bids get you to a hopless slam you need a system review|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  free finess )))|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jallerton: @s8 would have been a great play holding @sA|pg||
nt|jallerton: Robson read the situation correctly and had the courage to not play @sK, his only legitimate chance|pg||
nt|yo_yo: mckenny  same as lavinthal  |pg||
pc|sJ|mc|13|nt|lestergold: so no opportunity here|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|athene: east knows his partner will have a sound opener (4th chair without four spades) but passing is still quite possible|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, 25 was flat game on a 19 count, shows the standard|pg||
nt|athene: very difficult; you hate to miss a vul game but singleton club is horrible|pg||

nt|dburn:  he did not clearly misplay|pg||
nt|dburn:  at least, not as clearly as you are misanalysing|pg||
nt|lestergold: why not run the dim round to his hand discar a heart from dummy|pg||
nt|othered1: this has tightened up considerably|pg||
nt|jcwla: make it 13|pg||
nt|tweety1: too many dollars NS had|pg||
nt|lestergold: well e/w can steal a miracle 3N here but i doubt it will happen|pg||
nt|tweety1: so my last here|pg||
nt|tweety1: thanks all|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: I'd start with the 1@S bid but maybe there is more to it than meets the eye.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: that would have given him most chances|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes, more interesting now :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: slam here should theoretically go off with spade wrong but on KD lead the dims get established to sluff the spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: i expect that happened in open room to make 12 tricks|pg||
nt|othered1: And here's a h and on a straight finesse that they didn't approach.  Double by east would put finesse off anyway.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|dburn:  because if South ruffed with the jack of spades and endplayed dummy with a club, he would go down|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm the splinter might encourage Alfrey with no wasted in clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: and three bullets to boot|pg||
nt|othered1: South can envision hands where north can make slam easily, mostly with stiff @D|pg||
nt|lestergold: 37 imps 4 boards fat lady is knocking at door |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: it looked natural to attack declarer's trump holding by giving the ruff/discard in hearts, but it allowed the extra elopement with the small spade in west's hand|pg||
nt|justin c: y, i think that @h play was a mistake, but not easy for him|pg||
nt|lestergold: on aspeciic layout yes|pg||
mb|2N|nt|othered1: some might consider a number of @H on west's hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: 4@h, dbl?|pg||
nt|tweety1: 4 @h EW on @d lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Patterson judges he is too good for  4@H overcall|pg||
nt|othered1: Both w ests in this match doubled.|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree.  What about 1@H?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lestergold: but how can he justify burning a high card such as QS when the KJ( are all ouitstanding|pg||
nt|jcwla: wow|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well im surprised that Allfrey signed off|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: KJ and 9!|pg||
nt|lestergold: tyes theyve bid it!!|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hm - not so bad for start|pg||
pc|dT|nt|yo_yo: it's awful when it's passed out though|pg||
nt|justin c: X then @H looks normal|pg||
nt|lestergold: be inmterestinmg to see if Alfrey makes 12 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: and itsb a horrible contract and it cant be beaten|pg||
nt|lestergold: trouble kis they need 4 boards like this|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  let's see - @c position is really marvelous for declarer |pg||
nt|tweety1: Bye Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: the contract is sick|pg||
nt|tweety1: all|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jallerton: a well judged 3@H bid, I suppose @sK rates to be sitting over|pg||
nt|tweety1: 1 wld bid 4 @h instead of dbl here|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|yo_yo: anyone explain the bidding?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: it all looked normal until 3@S|pg||
nt|justin c: dont know the details of the bidding system, but 4@S is where you want to be|pg||
nt|dburn:  the queen would be the right play unless South had either the singleton king or a void, and was probably declarer's percentage shot|pg||
pc|cT|nt|othered1: With the relatively flat hand, I'd bid 1@H -- in the minority but likely not alone|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well I wouldnt like to argue with Robson or Patterson|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: sure Ed but when yourn partner spliters ui.e. makes a slam suggestion and you have no wasteds and three bullets dont twell me that u sign off|pg||
nt|jcwla: Getting there or not is one thing -- but partner could have a much different hand for 4@C and still feel they'd given it their best shot.|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|3C|nt|dburn:  wonder if Roland regards 7@d as a good contract?|pg||
nt|lestergold: interesting hand here communicationms very difficult for 3N on a heart lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: dim game looks much better|pg||
nt|othered1: or Suction?|pg||
nt|lestergold: they shouldnt get there but north shoulod make one try|pg||
nt|jcwla: Anybody for an opening other than 1@H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: Was about to be the same auction as the CR|pg||
nt|justin c: @D ruff|pg||
nt|athene: west has quite a bit of stuff|pg||
nt|tweety1: 1nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: that was quite a weak T/O double by Forrester|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh Roland would bid slam of course|pg||
mb|3D|nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|jallerton: may lead @d9 expecting his partner to hold that suit for the pass then double|pg||
mb|p|nt|tweety1: Moziah fit 4-3|pg||
nt|lestergold: 1N no doubt showing spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: in fact at least 5|pg||
nt|lestergold: so no swings here|pg||
nt|jcwla: Here's our honorary Rodal coffee break board.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lestergold: 5D a sane spot lots of work to o cards v favouravle of  course|pg||
nt|lestergold: Crouch off to the most challenging lead|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I hope he does not think of cross ruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: East has to deal with his spade losers one way or another|pg||
nt|lestergold: not at all obvious how to set about the hand- double dummy is one thing|pg||
nt|dburn:  indeed - easier to play seven than five|pg||
nt|lestergold: How would you play this hand David?|pg||
nt|dburn:  not clear - would win this, play a spade to the ace and lead the queen of clubs|pg||
nt|dburn:  but even Crouch would know not to cover that (assuming Forrester gives count in hearts) so would have to guess|pg||
nt|lestergold: well that would ceertsinly achieve success here but is that line obvious single dummy|pg||
nt|dburn:  it's as good as anything else to start with - I don't say I would run the queen of clubs, only that I would play it|pg||
nt|justin c: imagined this would end up in 5@C|pg||
nt|othered1: He'll score this|pg||
nt|tweety1: There was Captain Swing and Rodi|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 4s even|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: South has an awkward lead back now|pg||
nt|justin c: y, looks like it will do very well|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: wel a lost opportunity i think this is forrester's tenth win|pg||
pc|c4|nt|yo_yo: i wouldnt like to lead to that dummy|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s2|pg||
nt|jcwla: From E in OR got @D lead hence 5 w/o a sweat|pg||
pc|s4|nt|justin c: the short trump hand taking any @D force|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|yo_yo: west signalling for a @H return |pg||
pc|c6|nt|justin c: will probably get the @S right here|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c3|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h9|pc|dK|nt|lestergold: spec says that you need to play for one of the two minor suit Ks to be right|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|nt|lestergold: deep breath and phew|pg||
nt|dburn:  he may in fact put the ace on this, just in case Forrester had ducked from @dKxx Or even Kx)|pg||
nt|justin c: could always try for three @S ruffs in dummy instead of playing on @C|pg||
pc|d3|nt|justin c: robson doubled this in the other room|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so,EW missed their chance to win tiny game... |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|justin c: doesnt seem like the worst idea|pg||
nt|rnmalik: would make 5 with A and 6 with Q|pg||
pc|dT|nt|justin c: could ruff the second @S high|pg||
nt|justin c: @C before @H might have been better|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: was a btter game than the ropey 3n they bid|pg||

nt|jcwla: There _is_ room for an 11-IMP Waterlow gain on 32...fasten your seat belts...|pg||
nt|justin c: aggressive x|pg||
nt|dburn:  you could, but in order to get back to hand to ruff three spades, you would need to ruff clubs|pg||
nt|othered1: south didn't unblock @CK, a possible play|pg||
nt|yo_yo: phew|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Patterson thought then played it in double quick time|pg||
nt|jcwla: OR is finished - welcome to all who've joined us from in there.|pg||
nt|tweety1: uh|pg||
nt|lestergold: 20/20 hcp division here|pg||
nt|lestergold: often leadstlo swings|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: this looks as though it will be flat|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but NS have spades (7 vs 6) :-)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|jallerton: or maybe not with West in the auction|pg||
nt|Walddk6: 8 extra boards in the event of a tie (I think)|pg||
nt|lestergold: on another day the cross ruff would have been then only viable play|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|lestergold: i assume 2N promises zilch|pg||
nt|justin c: this is looking ominous|pg||
nt|lestergold: trouble is it raises the auction to the three level|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jallerton: East quite likely to save now I would think|pg||
nt|tweety1: 1@c alerted?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: no one can make much here|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn:  well, East does not intend to sit for 2@s in any case|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: yes|pg||
nt|othered1: you don't really want to get much higher|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like a niother few imps to Allfrey hwere|pg||
nt|tweety1: EW doesnt like bidding @hs|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w cannot get at their 7 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: robson will make this comfortably with 4 clubs and AK A in the major|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 2NT=both minors|pg||
nt|othered1: well they could maneuver the @D to get two @S leads in before declarer can drive the @C|pg||
nt|lestergold: well kib has suggested ten dims to K spade switch that might dfo it|pg||
nt|lestergold: but tjis wont|pg||
pc|c2|nt|dburn:  so at some point he will have to go to the three lvel|pg||
nt|dburn:  but West might barely have passed 2NT, I suppose|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Crouch does|pg||
nt|lestergold: whoever declares likely to be neghative|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  each plus score counts -NS is near to score+50|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: needs immediate spade switch|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think AF will be up to it|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk6: What was 4@C all about?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: we don't know|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: much amusement here...|pg||
nt|othered1: sure, I was remarking about the actual cards and 3 will be OK, I think|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3H look slike it was let thru in open|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 10 tricks with a @D ruff   |pg||
nt|justin c: would the @HA lead have beaten this?|pg||
nt|lestergold: unless declarer took a gfirst round finesse of 9H - not unreasonable actually|pg||
nt|lestergold: ht lead well|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lestergold: well had he passed then i do not think 2S would have been doubled and probably one off only|pg||
nt|lestergold: still net result is a double part score swing here and another 6 imps to allfrey|pg||
nt|lestergold: on eoff no joy for collins yet again|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rnmalik: or E could pass RDBL to enable W to bid 2@S|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jallerton: Even if they find the @c ruff (not at all easy) it's only 500|pg||
nt|jallerton: @C2 _should_ be suit preference.  I suppose S might play A and another expecting partner to ruff|pg||
nt|othered1: @CA lead might be enough to let declarer squeek by|pg||
nt|lestergold: a widening lead with not that many oards to play|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the other table in 3@H|pg||
nt|tweety1: very brave 4 @s|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I wouldnt like to accuse Peter Crouch of overbidding but....|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|justin c: pass means he wants to defend, does it not?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i dont know their system but i do know i want to stay low very low with east's de factoYarborough|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: Declarer not happy with his dummy!|pg||
nt|lestergold: really what a surprise|pg||
nt|lestergold: m,ind you i see dummies like that all the time so i wouldnt flinch|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: He called it 'disgusting'|pg||
nt|rnmalik: only|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3H also defeated by dim ruff as specs observantly point out|pg||
nt|othered1: 20 imps in 9 boards doesn't require all that much, just hands that give you a chance.|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c5|nt|yo_yo: West cant get in to lead another trumps , so no|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|justin c: sry, u are right.  had a blind spot|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this result will be pretty disgusting especuially when they are already trailing 27 imps on the second half of this final|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c9|pc|s6|nt|tweety1: so -1|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but kibs arent so polite :)|pg||
nt|tweety1: imps to my team|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and mine|pg||
nt|lestergold: well has been good and bad play on both sides during this matchg i think we can afford to congratulate the Allfrey team and praise the Collin steam for putting up a spirited fight|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|othered1: It's not that overbidding to a vul game is a crime|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|hJ|nt|Walddk4: What's the problem?|pg||
nt|lestergold: the problem is that you arent in the team Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That's definitely a handicap ... for someone|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u they bid a grand basically on less than 50% still oo good fro u tho|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I was here|pg||
nt|jcwla: Time appears to have stopped -- I hope that doesn't bother anyone.|pg||
nt|lestergold: lurking and keeping a beady eye on all of us eh?|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  interestng position - if N plays spade...|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  oh-no|pg||

nt|yo_yo: 8 imps to our team feysel :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: er what happened|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  no show ))|pg||
nt|lestergold: after trump spade to cash|pg||
nt|lestergold: so this is the finmal board|pg||
nt|lestergold: i assume|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jcwla: 6NT here would have been 11.|pg||
nt|jallerton: This is the last board.  Many thanks to our operator in Peebles.  64 boards is a lot!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now we might get a swing|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk6: Can't gain 14 IMPs even if they bid a slam|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Unless they get doubled and redouble|pg||
nt|jallerton: 14 is the swing for grand vs game NV|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: Thankyou Goodnight all Christine|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Veysel |pg||
nt|lestergold: great slam here for u Roland pity about the position of the club K|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: but @cA can't run away|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Walddk6: Well done, Christine! Please pass that on to all operators. They have been great!|pg||
nt|jcwla: Barring something outre, it's Allfrey and Collins in tomorrow's final.  Thanks to Roland, Stephen, Jeffrey, all other commentators and all specs.  So long for now.|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S is NF here in standard Precision Club|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: 4@c shows @c + @h, but South has a lot more values than he has promised|pg||
nt|Walddk6: But 4@C should be forcing|pg||
nt|othered1: Things could get ugly for a strong NT openingh on west's hand.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Last board of this set, due to restart very shortly, big thanks to Roland, Stephen, Ed, Mike, Veysel, Justin, and all specs.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|justin c: with @C 3/3 can pitch two @D from E|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk6: Isn't it for you, Jeffrey?|pg||
nt|jallerton: Yes, but he has to guess whether he has sufficient extras for slam|pg||
nt|me argent: 5@Cs not the bravest of bids|pg||
nt|jallerton: I play 4D agrees @H, 4@S agrees @s here|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Right, me too, hence 5@C shows a bad hand|pg||
nt|jallerton: so I would have bid 4@s on North hand|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Dixon's is much better than bad|pg||
mb|3N|nt|yo_yo: isnt the west hand a bit good for a precision 2@C opener?|pg||
nt|justin c: maybe he could have bid 4@H over 2@S|pg||
nt|justin c: (not sure what else it could really mean)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: sorry 4@S agrees @c|pg||
nt|athene: yes, but he doesn't envisage a slam facing a non-forcing bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: Stuart Tred would go for slam I bet facing a strong @C opener|pg||
nt|athene: west is max for 2@C but not worth 1@C, in my opinion - with a sixth club it would be closer|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if a small diamond were a small club, then he might well have opened 1@C|pg||
nt|athene: thanks all|pg||
nt|yo_yo: thanks everyone   bye for now|pg||
nt|justin c: see you later|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: Back shortly|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hard toimagine 28 imps swing -so, we should congratulate Allfrey team |pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: The match has been played by both teams in a friendly and gentlemanly manner.|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|nt|jallerton: so the final margin will be 16 imps|pg||
nt|tweety1: Tx every1|pg||
nt|tweety1: see you soon|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: Thank you all back very soon Christine|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pg||
nt|othered1: Why would east consider not leading a @D from that holding?|pg||
nt|justin c: this looks very close|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 1@D may be as short as zero |pg||
nt|othered1: with 5 or 6-card majors and bid like that?  The auction says he doesn't have many @C at all|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: it simply promises less than 16 pts and at least one 4c major|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Gib says to duck but will he?|pg||
nt|tweety1: so a chance for swing for Collins here|pg||
nt|lestergold: 20 imps over8 boards looks like the name of the game do not miss the last 8 folks|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I don't think so|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The swing I mean|pg||
nt|lestergold: u think they gonna bid the slam Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No|pg||
nt|dburn: worse contracts than 6@c have made before|pg||
nt|lestergold: Robson hand is a bit threadbare other thanm nice shape and bullets|pg||
nt|dburn: you don't need a lot more than the club finesse, after all|pg||
nt|lestergold: well ommnetator's curse will strike at least one of us|pg||
nt|lestergold: Well a big thanku to operator , BBO, Roland excellent fellow commentators bringing this exciting final to us|pg||

pc|s2|nt|Walddk4: Should be an easy hand to play at IMPs|pg||
