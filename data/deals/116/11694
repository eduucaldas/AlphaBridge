nt|sharkey: think strong view W Dbl penalty|pg||
mb|3H|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: West's heart soars (with 3@H) and sinks (with 5@C)|pg||
nt|sharkey: s(t)inks....?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is Dorfan thinking of  bidding 5@H? |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Some would say that even thinking is an overbid|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sharkey: lol|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Unless he was thinking of doubling, which seems wrong as well|pg||
nt|sharkey: frustration perhaps|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|pc|d5|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In theory, this lead gives the contract, but declarer needs to guess brilliantly which finesses are working and which aren't|pg||
nt|sharkey: that make a difference - right finesse and it makes|pg||
nt|sharkey: 50/50|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|d8|pc|h7|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, there was also the guess of the two discards - for example, you could pitch both spades|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||

nt|haans: that 3@D did prempt|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|chthonic: East was a bit light to make a takeout double, but it would have resulted in a heart contract. making four, it appears|pg||
nt|xenya: so that was an Acol 2@C opening by E?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|haans: think not :)|pg||
nt|haans: we do not have any system cards|pg||
nt|xenya: maybe it was -- after all he has 8 playing tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: either strong or a 8 trick playing hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: strong bal|pg||
nt|xenya: so an ideal hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|chthonic: West was too balanced and light to act|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Well, I think you should always pass in this situation with any balanced hand, even a balanced 0 count|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cQ|nt|sharkey: not sure after Dbl of Weak NT which promises about 14+|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In theory, 3@D should go down - and if North makes my recommended pass, he either defends 1NT successfully, or if East runs, N/S can play 2@D successfully|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|nt|bjacobs: It's still right to pass.  Removing on a balanced 0 count just gets you into worse trouble|pg||

nt|sharkey: ODI  - something for cricket lovers?|pg||

nt|vugraphzzd: back on track|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|newmoon: OR started with bds 27-28, so we now have comparisons|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|nt|lestergold: is 2D meant to be weak intermediate or strong?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: intermediate|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|lestergold: on normal methods North has a good one diamond overcall much too good for a weak|pg||
nt|rodal f: And a push to come|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|newmoon: 4@C pre-accept,  now 4@H = retransfer|pg||
nt|petergill: Weide chose the old-fashioned style of doubling first; the other East followed the more modern tendency to overcall one's long suit first with about 16 points|pg||
mb|2N|nt|rnmalik: agree|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4H depends on spade K onside plus only one heart loser a bit less than 50% and today its sadly zero percent|pg||
nt|rodal f: Again I will follow ORDER. 3@S. What if W was by 0 honors. 4@C????|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|lestergold: not unreasonable to bid i think quite normal the clubs and diamonds well duiplicated here|pg||
nt|newmoon: or pass = re-transfer|pg||
nt|haans: maybe spades are spades :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: weak hand for 4@C|pg||
nt|haans: in love|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: The more modern style is intended to cope better with those modern opponents who sometimes preempt you if you double |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: yes not fair|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|pc|hJ|nt|jcwla: Well, opposite passed partner, there is something to be said for 2@D.  Makes opps' auctions more difficult -- though all roads lead to 4@H here.|pg||
nt|haans: right|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|rodal f: Full speed. No first controll in @C but have @D que pard:)|pg||
nt|petergill: If @HK is played here, a club switch is needed|pg||
nt|petergill: I meant "if @HA at Trick"|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|haans: got that|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|petergill: NS give count  usually|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|jcwla: Right, I agree and would bid 1@D in std methods.|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c5|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes its a standard tactic but North's hand is the kind which can make game opposite  a passed partner- look how little ios needed|pg||
nt|haans: sloppy|pg||
nt|petergill: so North thinks South has 3 or 5 @Ds|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
nt|lestergold: i mean Ks q dim to three or fourand a stiff club for example|pg||
nt|jcwla: A third overtrick in 3NT (not 6@D) on 25 means 1 to Western Province to within 8 with 3 comparisons to come.|pg||

nt|rodal f: A puppet would have been good to have for EW now, but they don't use it|pg||
nt|haans: not that easy to bid|pg||
nt|newmoon: tough one to get to tho.   will East start with 2@C or 4NT?|pg||
