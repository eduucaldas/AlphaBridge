mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|vugraphzzh: 10 tricks on last board|pg||
nt|athene: Reasonable to open a strong club on that East hand, as in the closed room.|pg||
mb|4N|nt|athene: 4@S made?  I guess on the diamond duck, then.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 10 tricks? something must have happened, then|pg||
nt|jallerton: Yes, if partner passes your 2@c opener, there will be an anxious wait before dummy appears|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: http://www.ycbc.co.uk/lederer2009results.htm for current standings|pg||
nt|ady: easy 3NT     |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: Ireland should win the board  making 430   or 460    agains 400 in closed room|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mdgraham: the scoring in this event is slightly odd. 36 VP on the IMP difference, and 24 more on point-a-board (or, more accurately, two points a board) |pg||
nt|mdgraham: a 0-10 difference counts as a tie.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so a maximum win is 60-0. Very rare.|pg||
nt|jallerton: sohttp://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2009/systems/garvey-carroll.pdf for EW CC|pg||
nt|athene: More than rare, to date, I think - non-existent isn't it?|pg||
nt|jallerton: http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2009/systems/garvey-carroll.pdf|pg||

pc|d2|nt|ady: 10 tricks|pg||
nt|jallerton: will not risk the @h finesse!|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d9|pc|dK|pg||
nt|athene: This was a slightly odd way to play - now the diamonds get cleared and he can't knock out the @SA or finesse hearts.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mdgraham: @SA lead against 6@C would not be best - might happen |pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|ady: what way would you suggest?|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c9|pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: Win first trick in dummy and lead a heart to the @HQ looked more natural?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|h2|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: If it loses, the diamonds are protected; if North rises @HA to play diamond through, you have a lot more heart tricks.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mdgraham: could have led @SK as well|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s2|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d3|pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|jallerton: he was probably hoping for @hK to win so he could try a @s next|pg||
mc|11|nt|ady: heart to the queen seems ok    but K@S does not seem right   |pg||
nt|jallerton: that way he makes 11 whenever @hA is with South|pg||
nt|jallerton: how many tricks? 10 or 11?|pg||

nt|lestergold: both strong pairs and regular partnerships here|pg||
nt|cameron_1:  Hi good afternoon|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Hi Cameron|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|lestergold: Cook and garvie have doen very well recently including winning the Camrose annual comp between all th component nations of the British Isles and ireland|pg||
mb|1N!|mb|d|nt|haans: Hi Frederike|pg||
nt|lestergold: Cook a very thoughtful an imaghinative playe Garvie an enormous talent in the game who sometimes plays off centre  a very fast player|pg||
nt|cameron_1:  i guess 1n was a non touchign two suiter|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|haans: i guess 1@C is BC|pg||
nt|lestergold: Fitz can afford to try 3H because he has spade support if necessary|pg||
nt|haans: but can Garver pass?|pg||
nt|cameron_1:  yes since has had either @c@h or @d@s|pg||
mb|5C|nt|lestergold: Garvey will not want to prevent his pard playing in 3N that is the problem fo him|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Quite funny. Garvey has a Nepal flag, Cooke United Nations|pg||
nt|Walddk7: I believe West's name is spelt Cooke with an  e|pg||
nt|cameron_1:  y|pg||
nt|haans: Garvey the preventor!|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: 1N explained as @S & @D or @H  @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: but no he has not taken the chance and hopes that partne has the neceesary heart fragment|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: good afternoon all|pg||
mb|p|pc|h9|nt|viren169: Hi David|pg||
nt|cameron_1:  interestign a @h make the contract|pg||
nt|cameron_1:  since ruffs the looser|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ady: around 9 or 10 tricks in d iamonds for e/w|pg||
pc|hA|nt|viren169: Looks like all the specs have gone to the YC and watch it live!|pg||
nt|ady: Hi Gad|pg||
nt|ady: club lead will  beat 4@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: it looks ironic that a heart (or spade for that matter) gives contract|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ady: and found|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Cameron!!|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|nt|viren169: No fireworks on the 1st hand...|pg||

pc|h3|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: can hardly blame mesbur|pg||
nt|cameron_1:  so i guess would have gone off on a minor lead|pg||
nt|haans: no just np|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: ok here|pg||
nt|lestergold: it looked like 3 inescapable losers|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: will likely go 2 down   take diamond finesse to try and make|pg||
mc|11|nt|cameron_1:  might loose on the point a board thou|pg||
nt|cameron_1:  sadly|pg||
nt|haans: :) yes very :) 1p just gone|pg||
nt|cameron_1:  i should say i am rooting for one side here (my side - the cooke,garvey,osborne,hinden team)|pg||
nt|lestergold: Your in this time CVameron sitting out for a round/|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|pc|h7|nt|mdgraham: odd that both Easts are called Garvey.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jallerton: Both teams have a Garvey sitting East.  On this occasion Tommy was more aggressive than Martin|pg||

pc|hA|pc|hJ|pc|h8|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h5|pc|c2|pc|h2|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|jallerton: Martin does not pass very often so it's interesting that he failed to act here|pg||
nt|ady: I am not in favour of this kind of take out double  especially from a minimum hand   seems 2@H was going down and now n/s are in danger of a minus score|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|jallerton: draw trumps finessing against West and play 3 rounds of @c would have endplayed W|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|nt|jallerton: but this line works with @s 3-3|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: a bit hard for Cameron to have no bias|pg||
nt|cameron_1:  no i was playign yesterday i am at home now|pg||
mb|1N|nt|viren169: All the way to 4H by Victor?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: another heart contract for n/s    defence should be able to take 4 trick|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|viren169: Maybe not...|pg||
nt|viren169: a few undos!|pg||
nt|viren169: I cant believe Chris/Victor are playing a complicated system... so early on in the day!|pg||
nt|vugraphzzg: lots of Q s from Carroll|pg||
nt|ady: 4@C and 4@D  may hav e been some sort of cu bids    perhaps the opening could be stronger than it is|pg||
nt|viren169: Carroll is just waiting to see where they end up before trying 4@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: I tyhink we should give caCameron a little slack as it is disclosed|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ady: this  a pre-empt I think in either major|pg||
nt|viren169: This cant be happening!|pg||
nt|cameron_1:  unusual for mg to not protect, at mp he would|pg||
nt|haans: it mp opened 2@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: I was thinking that he was going to protect here at these colours he is not agreat lover of the pass card|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|nt|cameron_1:  i think u shd protect at the colour and the 40%mp/60% imps for of scoring|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|cT|nt|viren169: couldnt wait to find out!|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cQ|nt|viren169: 5@S is a lucky make...|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S  can make as they lay   but not more  because of the force in hearts and 4 trumps in one hand|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
nt|viren169: true...|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d9|nt|viren169: Is it an automatic @H lead?|pg||
nt|ady: must now lose 1 spade and 1 diamond|pg||
pc|d7|nt|haans: just playing to J and a delay from the Q|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|pg||
nt|lestergold: the only explanation is that Garvey hoped that his heart suit would help defeat 1N|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|nt|viren169: either way... par result!|pg||
nt|ady: Bakjshi was agressive |pg||

nt|haans: opps doing well|pg||
pc|dT|pc|h6|pc|c2|nt|cameron_1:  mind you 2@h would have been 2 off so his judgement has been vindicated|pg||
nt|lestergold: at this form of scoring would declarer try the seond spade finesse?|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|haans: NOOOOOO|pg||
nt|cameron_1:  no it smells of KQx otherwise he wd not have risen missign the T@s|pg||
nt|haans: he can count|pg||
nt|lestergold: well someone is thinking about something|pg||
nt|haans: claiming?|pg||
nt|lestergold: watch out for commentator's curse folks|pg||
nt|haans: all shall we say endplay|pg||
nt|cameron_1:  isnt KQ tight the only play? in a 2434|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|nt|dburn: he ought to have been aggressive sooner|pg||
nt|dburn: if he had bid 4@h over 1@s, there would have been considerable pressure on West to bid 4@s|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h8|pg||
nt|cameron_1:  oh my word|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|nt|jallerton: Lively auction in closed room|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|jallerton: North's options are 1NT (6-10), inverted raise, 3@d (7-10)|pg||
nt|athene: South 1NT opener would be weak in this position?|pg||
nt|jallerton: Upgraded because of the 10s although the 4333 shape is not so inviting|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1NT = (14)15-17 throughout NS|pg||
mb|d|mb|3D|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: playing strong NT, many people would respond 1NT with the north cards|pg||
nt|jallerton: Frances might have tried 3NT here|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: double @s stop and likely 6@d in partner's hand|pg||
nt|jallerton: though I suppose he might have been 5332|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d7|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S only down 1 in closed room    seems should have been down 2|pg||
nt|athene: Is the @D9 lead for count or to deny an honour?|pg||
nt|jallerton: reverse attitude (unless she thinks obvious situation and Mckenny is indicated)|pg||
nt|athene: Normal meaning would be the latter, I guess.|pg||
nt|jallerton: K lead would ask for count|pg||
nt|athene: When you are marked with length in a suit (e.g. raising partner) it's often a good idea to lead a big one to deny an honour.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|c2|nt|jallerton: Oh, sorry, I am asleep.  @d9 was the opening lead.  Yes, that was count|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ady: spec just correctly pointed out  3 spades is a make  4@S  should be down 1  so Irish should do well here|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|nt|athene: yes, 6 imps and a win on the board|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Note the double of 3NT in the other room. Only an 11-count, but goodish shape, and at this vulnerability the opposition may be messing about |pg||
nt|jallerton: double in this position should be take-out of the suit they opened|pg||
nt|athene: yes, (3something) - (3nt) X is t/o of the something|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|sT|pc|h3|nt|mdgraham: but, a Simon Cope says, they may not be, and you will go for a packet. Place your bets...  |pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|jallerton: It was right for EW in CR to defend 4@dx, but not easy to judge how shapely oppo are on this auction|pg||

nt|dburn: as it was, by fiddling around with some "mixed raise" or other, he gave both opponents a chance to describe their hands better|pg||
nt|lestergold: well maybe if west had doubleton honour it would have cost|pg||
nt|cameron_1:  i guess u will always get the A@S|pg||
nt|cameron_1:  true|pg||
mb|3D|nt|dburn: and decide to defend|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|d|nt|haans: that was a strong Prempt|pg||
nt|cameron_1:  take out of @d the way we play|pg||
mb|r|nt|viren169: p/s hand now... agressive 3@D by Carroll|pg||
nt|ady: I think a heart lead indicated Gas  if 3NT shows a solid major and opps are playing spades|pg||
nt|haans: i assume N sseen it before|pg||
mb|p|nt|cameron_1:  4@d i think for jc|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|dburn: 2@d bad weak two in a major|pg||

pc|d4|nt|lestergold: Martin feels that the penalty will not compensate for the vul game......if the vul game  can make ......|pg||

nt|viren169: Gas... Gad... God... anything u like!|pg||

pc|d8|nt|cameron_1:  indeed|pg||

mb|1S|mb|d|nt|athene: all the honours outside spades mean it's only about a 3-card raise, offensively|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|athene: No such reticence this time, though :)|pg||
nt|jallerton: 3@h= would win the board for NS, but East raising to 3@s|pg||
mb|d|nt|jallerton: this X should be t/o of spades|pg||
nt|ady: n/s need to play in hearts to win this board   seems 4@H has a play|pg||
mb|3S|nt|jallerton: Frances will probably try 4@h now|pg||
nt|athene: yes, she can see 1-3-5-4 opposite, quite likely, which meshes very well with her hand|pg||
nt|athene: the only problem is, when you bid on the basis of partner having shortage, opps all too often turn up with less of a fit than they promised|pg||
nt|jallerton: his double of 2NT implied shortage|pg||
nt|jallerton: should be able to trust partner, even if you can't always trust opponents!|pg||
nt|athene: yes, it's hard to construct a hand for south with a doubleton spade|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s7|pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|athene: north could have led a club, going for the club ruff|pg||

nt|athene: He shouldn't misguess the clubs - no way North is switching to @CJx there|pg||
nt|athene: and stiff @CJ she would surely have led originally|pg||
nt|jallerton: declarer might have covered, playing the switcher to hold @cJx(x) - may need to get busy if @C discard or 3rd @h |pg||

pc|dQ|nt|ady: Hi Andrei|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|ady: needs to play hearts anti percentage to make|pg||
pc|c3|nt|aupillon: Hi David|pg||
pc|c4|nt|viren169: West may reject the diamond hook... for only 9 tricks!|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ady: looks like 12 tricks|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: well TGR 's raltively tame interference has eliminated game aspirations in harts|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|nt|viren169: 12 now...|pg||
pc|d8|pg||

nt|cameron_1:  4@h is certainally a nic spot|pg||
nt|cameron_1:  i woudl be disapoint nto to be in it|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d9|nt|athene: Slightly more revealing auction in the other room but still not enough to reveal the spade lead.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|mdgraham: bet Garvey plays a spade|pg||
nt|jallerton: E does not need to find the @s switch - another heart is OK as long as he splits in @d|pg||
nt|athene: the defence in the other room was very interesting|pg||
nt|ady: even without a spade switch   only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: east led heart and declarer won @HQ, ran clubs, then played diamond ace, diamond|pg||
nt|athene: East switched to a SMALL spade from @SKx|pg||
nt|athene: trying to get off the endplay|pg||
nt|athene: but his partner returned a spade|pg||
nt|athene: and now he cashed the diamond rather than exiting the heart in 3-card ending|pg||
nt|athene: so declarer got the last two rather than east getting the last two|pg||
nt|jallerton: defenders should have had a count after the discards on the @c|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: an area of defensive carding which most pairs don't discuss anything like enough - when declarer runs a suit early, exactly what do all the various sequences of discards mean?|pg||
nt|ady: anyone know who are the leaders ?|pg||
nt|jallerton: Premier League winners|pg||

nt|aupillon: some 4 @s but with some trobles. Play has to be very accurate|pg||
nt|ady: this might be another good result for YC|pg||
nt|dburn: because he had shown 4+ spades with his negative double, and he had six of them|pg||
nt|cameron_1:  2s askign for shape wd be the normal route|pg||
nt|haans: and raise on 3 rare today|pg||
nt|haans: but ok if pass partner = slam out of the question|pg||
nt|lestergold: a trappy hand for N/S combined 26 count with 3 wasted points in spades and diamonds spitting at them|pg||
nt|cameron_1:  1n-3n?|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|lestergold: no play whatsoever|pg||

mb|p|nt|cameron_1:  yes|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: absolutely|pg||
nt|aupillon: the only way to defeat this is a diamond ruff|pg||

pc|h4|nt|haans: was looking for five hearts|pg||

nt|haans: two spade :)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|aupillon: this is the point. Now|pg||
nt|viren169: now a switch must be called for...|pg||
nt|aupillon: The Queen was a good card played, to make East return @h|pg||
nt|ady: only making game here is 3NT    not so easy to bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: as long a he guards his three Ks hes ok|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|pg||
nt|cameron_1:  well he will soon know he p has 4@h so v easy|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|ady: well done    |pg||
nt|ady: possible swing here for the holders     they need it at this juncture|pg||

pc|c9|nt|ady: Victor could see the K@D switch unlikely to cost  and main reap the reward it has|pg||
pc|s7|pc|cQ|pc|dJ|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: Fun auction in the other room.  West wasn't stopping after he heard a strong club from his partner.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|jallerton: sensational auction in closed room|pg||
nt|athene: Of course, whether East really has a strong club opener is another issue.|pg||
nt|jallerton: 4NT now|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|jallerton: 2 suits|pg||
mb|5C|mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: Clearly 1@C opener in the other room was semi-psychic - actually these bids can work well.|pg||
nt|jallerton: annoying for S, doesn't know partner's suits|pg||
nt|ady: needs 2 diamond tricks and a club ruff to beat this     difficult to find|pg||
mb|6C|nt|athene: If opps bid very aggressively and destructively against your strong 1@C opener, you can get some equity back sometimes by talking them out of things.|pg||
mb|d|mb|6D|mb|p|nt|athene: You open 1@C when it's actually their hand but they don't believe it is.|pg||
nt|jallerton: Carroll's 5@s bid was better than double in that respect|pg||
mb|6H|mb|d|nt|mdgraham: 4@D=strong 4@S opening. No mention of whether it is a solid suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: TGR have something to play with to win this board   7@H doubled in CR|pg||

mb|p|nt|viren169: 3@D some sort of GT|pg||

nt|cameron_1:  jc means this a pick a slam - not a hard choice|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear Cameron I bet your regretting joining this party!|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: can hold to 8 tricks|pg||

nt|viren169: Tough to find from Qx|pg||
nt|dburn: why not lead a singleton in partner's suit, like a normal person?|pg||
mb|6S|mb|d|nt|cameron_1:  sadly the 6@h bid might have just lost the board|pg||
nt|cameron_1:  no chance on a @h lead now|pg||

nt|jallerton: When declarer does not play on @d then either they are already running or dec has no interest in suit|pg||
