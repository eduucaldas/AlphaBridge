nt|benjent: Cope has gone wrong in 2 awkward positions in the first 3 hands. Somebody get that man a refreshing drink!|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|1H!|an|4+!s|nt|finch: There's free tea and coffee at the break.  Does that count?|pg||
nt|jallerton: natural or 11-13/17-20 bal|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@h = 4+@s|pg||
nt|finch: Common defence to the transfer response here is x = hearts, 1@S = takeout of hearts, 2@S = natural|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N!|an|17-20|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|finch: 1NT rebid strong balanced. 1@S would show the weak NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: I prefer X=takeout, 1@s=natural, 2@h=natural, 2@s=@h+minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I don't like a 17-20 range; too wide imo|pg||
nt|jallerton: at least it's only at the 1-level, Roland|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: The idea of the wide range is that you show it at the 1-level, rather than the clumsy 2NT opening|pg||
nt|finch: real system freaks play transfers over this as well by responder|pg||
nt|jallerton: but yes it can be awkard when partner has not fot a major and has to respond 1@s/1NT|pg||
nt|jallerton: *got|pg||
pc|cT|nt|benjent: The problem is - do you bid on with 5-6, and maybe play 2NT+ with a poorly fitting 22-23 count, or do you pass 1NT and miss game with 25-26?|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|c6|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|pc|s4|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s2|nt|finch: yes, that's the problem... but the idea is that you are better off than the alternative which is to open or rebid 2NT|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s7|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h8|pc|h6|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk2: In Roman Club (no-one plays that any more), 1NT opening is 17-20. Since Belladonna was involved (with Alvarelli) they must have thought it was a good idea|pg||
pc|hK|pc|d6|nt|jallerton: On South's actual hand he would expect game to be reached in other room if partner has 20|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|benjent: I agree with Roland - having 4 points in your NT range loses imps. But it tends to lose on occasional part-scores, so the proponents find it easy to ignore|pg||
nt|jallerton: .. but there must be a reason why no-one plays it anymore, Roland!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|c8|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|pc|d4|pc|s6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: One of the flaws was the canapé where you could open a 3-card suit rather than a 5-card suit|pg||
mc|8|nt|benjent: The 17-20 type range usually comes about because somebody perpetually cribs on the original 18-20 range|pg||

mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|3H!|nt|benjent: East finally gets some points, and EW have the majority ... let's see how they handle it|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|finch: North took a slightly more pessimistic view of his hand than he did at the other table (or they are playing a different range)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@H pre-emptive, pass or correct if you have spades. Cope knew that would not be the case|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jallerton: 2@d Multi, 3@H pre-emptive in partner's major.  SHould East bid 3NT?|pg||
nt|finch: 2@D multi, showing a weak two in either major (possibly with some strong options that never come up)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|finch: I can't see many Easts bidding 3NT here. RHO is known to have long spades|pg||
nt|jallerton: but you could miss a cold vuln game by passing|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: multi was weak only|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d4|pc|h5|nt|finch: You need quite a lot from partner for 3NT to be making|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|finch: What he has plus the king of diamonds|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|pc|c5|pc|c7|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|nt|benjent: Think about it another way - looking only at the East hand, you need partner to have an average hand from the remainder to make 3NT|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h7|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|nt|jallerton: It's reasonable to assume that partner will have 1/3 of the remaining assets|pg||
pc|s3|pc|hT|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c9|pc|c2|pg||
nt|benjent: On the auction, it looks like South has an average to average-minus hand and North an average to average-plus hand|pg||

pc|sK|pc|c8|pc|cT|pc|s6|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
nt|benjent: On balance, partner is reasonably likely to have the average hand you need for game ... but that @s shortage is what would scare me, and I'm sure scared Eginton|pg||
mc|9|nt|jallerton: "I think he was probably expecting a converion to 3@s then he would double" David Greenwood points out|pg||
nt|benjent: Good point, David Greenwood|pg||
nt|finch: but it's not just an 8(+) count he needs, it's the right 8-count. Axxx x Axxx xxxx is two aces and game is poor|pg||

mb|2H!|nt|fabsayc: should finesse diamonds immediately|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|jbgood: that puts E in a fix|pg||
nt|jbgood: he cannot double in fear of 4 @s|pg||
nt|fabsayc: east has no bid, or rather his only bid is "no bid"|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agreeJon! and rather clear when partner has passed|pg||
nt|jbgood: the oldie "no bid" surely applies|pg||
nt|fabsayc: unless he has a "penalty double card"|pg||

nt|jallerton: North missed the inference that South had not bid on first round|pg||
nt|benjent: 4@s is indeed a maker - but NS in the CR had the chance to go -130 defending 2@d, so 500 was quite as cheap as it might have been :)|pg||

mc|10|nt|benjent: Well, a couple of 3-2 breaks - just short of 50% - and no getting shortened when the defence plays lots of @c's at you - maybe 50%. So call it a 25% game at the table.|pg||
