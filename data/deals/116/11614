nt|chessmaste: Its German|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Maybe even Forum D|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: In the CR on this deal, the weak 1NT had a typical effect - it prevented BOTH sides from reaching their correct contract|pg||
mb|3S|nt|chessmaste: I will send Jos Jacobs in search of systems|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzxr: hello everybody|pg||

nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|haans: http://eurobridge.org/competitions/09Paris/Paris.htm Semifinal 12 boards each session (SEMI 48 boards)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe E-W would appreciate to have Danish flags rather than German|pg||
nt|haans: hi Vladimir|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Haans|pg||
nt|Walddk4: besides, team names are reversed|pg||
nt|haans: RESULTS: http://eurobridge.org/competitions/09Paris/Results.htm|pg||

nt|mmmakela: hi all and welcome!|pg||
nt|andyv:  good morning everyone|pg||
nt|mmmakela: NS play strong club with lots of relays|pg||
nt|ralfwil: let us hope for interesting boards and Sweden has som IMPs to pickup|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello Andy and Markku|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Ralf and Markku|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 12 boards so 2,1 imps per boad needed|pg||
nt|andyv:  first board close to a Roland slam|pg||
nt|cuan: buongiorno a tutti|pg||
nt|effebi: squadra abitutata alle rarefatte atmosfere dell'alta classifica|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ralfwil: good afternoon from Sweden|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: Allegra Italy took 21 in last match but were still 4 p from a semi|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ybob: Hi all|pg||

nt|haans: may be what they need|pg||
nt|rcerreto: buongiorno a tutti|pg||
nt|gioffi: ciao a tutti|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|cuan: appunto|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome.|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Roberto|pg||
nt|dima:  And we have a big board to start the 2nd segment with|pg||
pc|cA|nt|po-s: close?|pg||
nt|andyv:  sure|pg||
nt|andyv:  only A@h being off stops it:)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hej PO!|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 6dias by N makeable double dummy|pg||
nt|rcerreto: in questa mano il SA debole con 5a nobile non è venuto bene|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello Vladimir|pg||
nt|jbgood: good evening|pg||
nt|xenya: a routine 4@S to warm up|pg||
nt|haans: mini NT is not rutine|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The player names are reversed|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like 11 tricks in @c after a @S lead, but more difficult or impossible after a @d singleton lead|pg||
nt|mmmakela: maybe even in practise|pg||
nt|effebi: le carte consentono fino ad 11 prese a fiori in E/O|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: on a diamond lead?|pg||
nt|andyv:  that's a Roland slam|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Po:)|pg||
nt|po-s: that´s what I meant - close means nearly - this one does make|pg||
nt|andyv:  true...I forgot N would be playing it:)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sunsamvar: actually i expected a minor suit bidding war here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Angelini-Versace do not play mini-NT. E-W do|pg||
nt|april7: Hello everybody and good afternoon|pg||
nt|dima:  Likely GromÃ¶ller-HÃ¤usler will get to Grand here - they were very efficient in the 1st segment|pg||
nt|andyv:  but this should be a huge pick up for NS|pg||
nt|cuan: brutta mano per sistema per i fantunes|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ralfwil: must win this trick and play @d|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|xenya: no but i xpect the contract to be reached in the OR as well -- probably on a different auction|pg||
nt|xenya: oh|pg||
nt|april7: S is looking for an adequate bid to find out about the K of @C to get to 7, he will find it I suppose|pg||
nt|dima:  Now (if they play sort of standard) South knows that North is 1=5=3=4 or actual shape so 13 tricks is matter of keycards|pg||
nt|sybarra: its not a game hand....3 nt is down on any lead |pg||
nt|mmmakela: can make a lot of tricks here,11 that is|pg||
pc|cT|nt|haans: this is not good for sweden|pg||
pc|hK|nt|haans: do look balanced but yes they may have changed|pg||
nt|haans: italy are playing game here|pg||
nt|sybarra: E bit "reluctantly"  and W found good discipline here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @s is the only suit E can establish an entry to clean trumps|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ritong: wow lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi all:)|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Frank|pg||
nt|april7: this bid doesn't help at all|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: sorry i was responding to a spec who suggested 3n|pg||
nt|dima:  OUCH !!! Serios misfired|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
nt|andyv:  and he should get the @ds right|pg||
nt|effebi: certo, il difficile può essere entrare (in orizzontale), ma se dovesse essere...|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mdgraham: Germany 77 Denmark 70 Italy Allegra 65|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone and welcome back to Paris for the 8th European Champions' Cup. Twelve teams divided into two groups. Matches of 20 boards in the round-robin. This is a round 2 match ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: from group A|pg||
nt|dima:  Well this start will make swedish fans sit up right :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: must because even if E had the Q clubs could be blocked as here|pg||
nt|rcerreto: la speranza è che, con il fit 4°, si spingano sino a 3@s|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like a cheap save in 4@s. Let´s see if the sacrifie had been correcy|pg||
nt|xenya: this rates to make after S has shown a black 2-suiter|pg||
nt|haans: names wrong|pg||
nt|april7: I'm very astount with 20 HP and 4 aces not to reach the slam, S figured N to have psyched perhaps|pg||
pc|dT|nt|Walddk4: North is  Magnusson|pg||
nt|ralfwil: that @h 10 also saves with a missguess in @d|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ritong: @c was 1310|pg||
nt|rcerreto: che, con un controgioco corretto, si battono|pg||
pc|d3|nt|xenya: declarer will know how to handle the diamonds|pg||
nt|rnmalik: depends entirely on @D play|pg||
nt|ybob: run trumps @S to K and @D to dummy = home|pg||
nt|jbgood: difficult not to end up in the favourite contract of them all - 3 NT - but 5@c seems to be better|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N makes for NS on a non -diamond lead... |pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|xenya: so Italy is EW, Denmark NS?|pg||
nt|gluckenval: un rapido ripasso del sistema dei Fantunes: le aperture a livello di 1 a colore sono tutte 14+ oppure buoni 12/13 e 5+ carte. 1@C è usato anche per le bilanciate da 15+. 1NT 11-14 ...|pg||
nt|gluckenval: bilanciata, con qualsiasi quinta. Le aperture a livello 2 sono 9-13 con 5+|pg||
nt|katar: avendo aperto di 1nt sono stati fuori dal parziale a @s ma si dovrebbe cadere di almeno una presa... mentre si fanno 2@s ma aprendo si 1@s se ne dovrebbero giocare almeno 3 per cui ...|pg||
nt|katar: potrebbe essere mano pari... speriamo :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kiwibridge: hello everyone|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: even on a heart lead a @D switch is obvious|pg||
nt|xenya: and that might well have been the scenario had they bid it|pg||
nt|rcerreto: entrare in EW pare comunque difficile|pg||
nt|cuan: intendo che l'apertura 1NT con quinta nobile trancia di netto un fit picche di nove carte|pg||
pc|d9|nt|effebi: incerti del sistema..|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rcerreto: è il motivo per cui a molti il SA con 5a nobile non piace|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: will make on the probable @S lead tho|pg||

nt|haans: but you wonder what did "reluctantly" mean?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|rcerreto: come sempre, è questione di gusti|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ralfwil: No @h8 is high enough|pg||
nt|xenya: draw trumkps, finesse the @DJ|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: E can draw trumps and finess in @d|pg||
nt|gioffi: secondo voi quanti riescono a giocarne solo 2 di @S in questa mano anche aprendo 1@S?|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h7|nt|po-s: tha club 8 is coming into work|pg||
nt|rcerreto: io no|pg||

mb|p|nt|ralfwil: hello Rashed|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@H for NS -- a sacrifice by EW might prove too expensive|pg||
nt|rnmalik: looks like 4@H for NS and good save in 4 @S by EW|pg||
nt|bessi2: hi all|pg||
nt|haans: have not seen that prempt before :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: wasted points in @S will doom this 3 nt|pg||
nt|lestergold: well an unlucky habd for N/S here no play 3N likely to be flat tho |pg||
nt|mdgraham: as you say, a killing lead|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|rcerreto: buona difesa in EW su 4@s di NS|pg||
nt|rcerreto: 5@s li batterebbe il taglio a @c, ma se li gioca N non c'è taglio|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|nt|xenya: of course nothing can make S to stop short of game|pg||
nt|ritong: 1410 points at stake|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ybob: now 4@H and W ?|pg||
nt|haans: But Multon has |pg||
nt|katar: intanto stiamo fuori da questo slam infattibile e magari anche da un avvicinamento a 5 che potrebbe costare il down con attacco fori da ovest (improbabile)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: ok 4@S X|pg||
nt|xenya: now you take the money|pg||
nt|haans: all bidding go to 4@H down|pg||
nt|vugraphzxq: DAILY BULLETIN IS FALSED I AM CORRECT|pg||
nt|dima:  I think there was misunderstanding - S meant that 3@h fixed trumps and 3NT was a gadget asking for Q|pg||
nt|ralfwil: can this help NS to a nice contract = 5@d?|pg||
nt|rcerreto: le 10 carte di fit a @h in EW per ora non si sono viste|pg||
nt|gluckenval: Entscho Wladow & Michael Elinescu giocano @C forte, 1@D nebbia, 1NT 15-17 in prima e seconda posizione, e 16-17 in terza/quarta, 1M 5+ carte. 2@C da precision, 2@D forte 18/19 ...|pg||
nt|gluckenval: (20/21 se in zona) 2M sottoaperture o 6 o 5 con 4a minore|pg||
nt|effebi: gluck, sei impagabile....|pg||
nt|gioffi: e perchè non ha aperto in prima posizione in prima contro zona e poi non ha fatto bicolore?|pg||
nt|effebi: e infatti non verrai pagato...|pg||
nt|gluckenval: no... vorrei essere pagato... ma mi sa che non funziona così :)|pg||
nt|rcerreto: bella domanda|pg||
nt|rcerreto: la mancata sottoapertura immagino derivi dal possibile appoggio a @s (J10x)|pg||
nt|rcerreto: poi, su 1@h, forse poteva fare qualcosa di diverso|pg||
mb|4S|nt|jbgood: hi Sigurbjørn|pg||
nt|gioffi: se 2@S da la bicolore nera le probabilità di trovare il singolo di @D sono alte|pg||
nt|effebi: sono solo le 10.15....|pg||
nt|figb_rama: breaking news...|pg||
mb|5D|nt|bessi2: this will drift -1 quietly |pg||

nt|lestergold: north will try a finesse against the ten of diamonds sadly not on today|pg||
nt|ritong: hi there|pg||
mb|5H|nt|dima:  Very unlikely to psych standing +28 on the first board of the segment|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yes Shirley - on W it looks like 5@c is easy|pg||
nt|rcerreto: la difesa l'hanno trovata|pg||
nt|rcerreto: non nel modo che pensavo :)|pg||

nt|figb_rama: i tempi di finale sono 4|pg||
nt|gluckenval: come avete visto, sull'apertura 1@C i nostri giocano 1@D per le @H e 1@H per le @S|pg||
nt|rcerreto: e 1@s ?|pg||
nt|figb_rama: i successivi a 13.00, 15.15 e 17.30|pg||
nt|figb_rama: 12x4 board in tutto|pg||
nt|gioffi: a proposito dell'apertura di 1sa con quinta nobile alla 1 abbiamo guadagnato 2|pg||
nt|gluckenval: si, ne hanno giocate 4 di @S|pg||
nt|rcerreto: parziale a @c per 11 prese?|pg||
nt|effebi: -2|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|nt|haans: 3nt a make|pg||
nt|haans: hearts good placed|pg||
nt|gluckenval: 1@C - 1@S = 0-11 senza 4 carte nobili|pg||
pc|sA|nt|xenya: N has 8 top tricks and little chance for a 9th -- so he will run the clubs first in the hope something good happens|pg||
nt|lestergold: he can only play 3 rounds now as he needs one for a second entry to repeat the diamond finesse|pg||
nt|haans: must be lavinthal to @D|pg||
nt|ritong: it is|pg||
nt|mmmakela: S limited to 16 points bec 1 @C 17+|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|effebi: ci sono tre prese da pagare, in questa difesa|pg||
nt|rcerreto: un modesto centino per NS|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|nt|xenya: on second thoughts, the save looks cheap enough|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree|pg||
pc|sK|nt|xenya: the@D return  is best i think|pg||
nt|ybob: 500 if play A @S first|pg||
nt|rnmalik: S has no choice|pg||
nt|xenya: now declarer might go wrong|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|rcerreto: da notare che qui le @s le avrebbe giocate Sud|pg||
nt|effebi: la parte pericolosa|pg||
nt|rcerreto: Est a 5@s avrebbe forse potuto contrare per ricevere l'attacco a @c|pg||
nt|katar: nn promette bene questo board per i colori romani|pg||
nt|rcerreto: molto *forse*|pg||
nt|effebi: tu dici?|pg||
nt|katar: ehehe spero di no ma....|pg||
nt|effebi: certo, ottima difesa|pg||
nt|figb_rama: stesso contratto in chiusa|pg||
nt|katar: wow|pg||
nt|effebi: ok:)|pg||
nt|katar: che tifo però eh?|pg||
nt|rcerreto: trovare la difesa non mi pareva impossibile|pg||
nt|katar: ci dovrebbero dare un premio per il supporter dell'anno|pg||
nt|effebi: con la stessa licita, immagino :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|dima:  Nice lead by Fredrik NystrÃ¶m|pg||
nt|figb_rama: però su 1@H di Lorenzo, Alfredo ne ha dette 4 al colpo...|pg||
nt|katar: precisa|pg||
nt|rcerreto: ecco, su questo ho qualche dubbio :)|pg||
nt|figb_rama: :)|pg||
nt|figb_rama: eh già|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: seond heart discard may have been dangerous on a different layout|pg||
nt|xenya: now he might take the @D finesse -- seeing E has pitched 2 hearts|pg||

nt|mmmakela: so back to 24 imp diff|pg||
nt|rialc2: avete bevuto? ... di prima mattina? ... neanche foste veneti ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: strange play by E|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this 4@H looks better|pg||
nt|cuan: i don't think so|pg||
nt|dima:  With a nothing hand and no move in a major from Partner he figures that partner has values in clubs. |pg||
nt|haans: OR open with som ekind of weak 2 and opps go on|pg||
mb|1H|nt|xenya: -3 instead of 2, still a good save|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@c is makeable on NS|pg||
nt|bessi2: sometimes one doesn't notice the plausible losing options seeing all 4 hands|pg||
nt|haans: may be go higher|pg||
nt|dima:  Though I think the result exceeded expectations|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ybob: only ! lead defeat 6@S|pg||
nt|ybob: @H|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Duck first @h and ruff it hign och the next round for discard of 2 @s|pg||
nt|sybarra: that is a "heavy"  1 nt imo |pg||
mb|p|nt|gluckenval: possibile 4@S per E/W che la divisione delle atout rende laborioso|pg||
mb|2S|nt|xenya: anyone knows NS's system?|pg||
nt|haans: but can take 5|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: may have too' :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: game for e/w either 3n or 4S |pg||

nt|haans: Antonio what does that mean?|pg||

nt|ralfwil: Do you know why S didn´t support @c PO?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: 3@C was a game bid|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Good evening to Sveta Bodrenkova|pg||
nt|lestergold: played by east preferbly|pg||
nt|haans: Suppose 2@C was a relay|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 1nt did show 15-17|pg||
nt|sybarra: but agree with  1 nt  as there is not good rebid |pg||
nt|sybarra: if you open 1 @C |pg||
nt|rialc2: si ma tutte le altre carte sono ben messe e le @H 3-3|pg||
pc|d5|nt|dima:  A couple of vulnerable undertricks here|pg||
nt|haans: BC|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Hans - for me W´s hand is at least 18|pg||
nt|sybarra: that was my point on "heavy"  1 nt |pg||
nt|haans: which mean flat board (good)|pg||
nt|sybarra: its an prime hand also |pg||
nt|sybarra: with the aces|pg||

pc|d2|nt|sfoxa: Hello to all, sorry for being late - rush hour in the rainy evening dosn't look good )))|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|xenya: W woild love to put in a word, but the vulnerability deters him|pg||
nt|ralfwil: without a @h lead 6@s is makeable|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 6@C is cold regardless of lead|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hearts are 3-3|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @H lead difficult |pg||
nt|Walddk4: In Minsk?|pg||
nt|haans: despite that it looks like the normal bidding|pg||
nt|ritong: looks natural to play his trump at that point|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|sfoxa: yes, here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 4@S is better as it does not need @Sk to be right|pg||
nt|lestergold: this should make tho|pg||
nt|haans: 5@C much better than 3nt :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: most NS sequences are just relays if they open bidding|pg||
nt|rialc2: l'attacco di K di @C avrebbe creato una situazione interessante ma per fortuna loro non vedono tutte le carte|pg||
nt|rcerreto: K@c e @c credo batta, ma è fantascienza pura|pg||
nt|rialc2: probabilmente giocherà il doppio a @S e, così facendo, si troverà fuori da tutti i problemi|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|bessi2: unlucky lead for south here |pg||
pc|sT|nt|ralfwil: only for 6@s a @h lead will defeat|pg||
nt|xenya: @H lead is not impossible to find |pg||
nt|rnmalik: tough decision for E|pg||
nt|xenya: actually it looks quite logical|pg||
nt|ybob: to me impossible|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and BC Quantum comes from?|pg||
nt|xenya: well E can count on his @SQ to win a trick -- N should have both A and K on the auction|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not necessarily best, as South needs exit cards outside the spade suit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and that removed one of them|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|xenya: and there it is|pg||
nt|ralfwil: he found it!|pg||
nt|rnmalik: well done|pg||
nt|xenya: so E should try to set up a trick ina side suit, and that can be only @Hs|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: tho there is the danger of @C ruff in 4@S|pg||
nt|haans: yep add 1p more for that|pg||
nt|katar: peril momento il gioco è andato uguale in aparte|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rcerreto: la caduta dell'8 aiuta un po'|pg||
nt|effebi: aiuta e insospettisce|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bessi2: but the contract is still doomed|pg||

nt|julia11: buongiorno :)|pg||
nt|rcerreto: e poi prendere le atout|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cJ|nt|lestergold: natural to play in 3n when all suits stopped and fits only a 7 carder|pg||
nt|haans: 3@C was not relay so natural|pg||
nt|rialc2: nord adesso deve regalare|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ralfwil: After teh @s support I prefer 6@c from N and S has to choose between @s or @c. What´s your opinion?|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: even a dim lead would not have beatn 3non this kind layout|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: what id @Sk and @Ca were exchanged|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: what if|pg||
nt|xenya: S can see his fate -- if he ducks, he will be endplayed eventually... |pg||
pc|c3|nt|haans: good play here|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mdgraham: @DJ|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but he can also see that the duck will disrupt declarer's communication|pg||
nt|xenya: now 11 tricks are available|pg||
nt|xenya: true Sunil|pg||
nt|dima:  Cullin - Upmark reached 7@c on N1 in the OR so sweidish team starts with a bang in this segment|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rnmalik: 6@S a better contract slight misdefend and home.|pg||
nt|ybob: i prefer play 6@S , without @H lead need 3/2 trump|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, the idea occurred to me during the bidding and i liked it|pg||
pc|hQ|mc|10|nt|ralfwil: But there must be some reason, even if it is relay. - showing his hand|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Actually, it's a very serious threat|pg||
mb|p|nt|doctorone: Indeed Bill... But it maybe difficult to find, now that S has bid 3@d|pg||
pc|c9|nt|Walddk2: 3NT is the inferior game, is it not? |pg||

nt|tjolpe:  nowhere|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In cyberspace|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  they got a club lead in 4S at the other table, and will make it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is 3@H a better bid than 3NT over 3@D, what do you think?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's rather hard to pinpoint where this auction went wrong ... perhaps it's a system thing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@S denied three, so perhaps one should bid 3@H with QJ next|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You might be on to something there Roland|pg||

nt|april7:  N will lead @S after the @D trick and the contract will be 1 off|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But without @hQ 6@s should be played on E|pg||

pc|c3|nt|sybarra: this helps declarer |pg||
nt|dima:  making sure that partner splits his honors (if he has them)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lestergold: well if N/S allow vulnerable interventions of south's type on a festering suit  in a fersteing hand, then north should have gone more cautiously|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|bjacobs: They'll be nervous, but this is their correct and winning auction|pg||

nt|Walddk2: So Swiss Acol it is, 5 spades, 4 hearts|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Agreed Bachar.  The vulnerability does point a little towards 1NT.  But he's followed the rules (10+ points = redouble) and it pays off|pg||
nt|doctorone: sure|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Just as well we have a Swiss among us with that system in action :)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|chessmaste: You can understand why North has switched to a trump, but I'm not sure it is best|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|tjolpe:  I think he should lead a trump at trick one|pg||
nt|chessmaste: A Swiss commentator called William could Tell us everything?|pg||
nt|doctorone: Trump lead was recommended maybe|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So 5443 for the Germans. 1@D is alsways 4+, 1@C only 3 if specifically 4333|pg||

nt|chessmaste: Don't worry - they will get it at least one down|pg||
nt|doctorone: This is exactly one of the reasons why I dont like defending 2@h doubled at imps. I find this decision by N/S more suitable in MP|pg||

nt|rialc2: allora ce ne vorrebbero almeno 100 per rifargli una siloutte presentabile |pg||

nt|mdgraham: That sort of thing |pg||
nt|cuan: duck is wrong, after elimination|pg||

nt|figb_rama: in questa Alf sta giocando 2@Hx da Ovest, attacco atout|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|cuan: 2@C = 6@C or 5@C+4@D 11-15|pg||
nt|dima:  It is the matter of bidding, Nystrom gives a lot of leeway, but still might be pushed into "sacrifice"|pg||
mb|2N|nt|sybarra: may "take" it early also |pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa: if NS reach 5@d, EW can sacrifice in 5@s|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: short suit try no doubt|pg||
nt|lestergold: and its cold on the 2/2 spade break|pg||
nt|dima:  So far nobody know who is in attack who is in defence|pg||
nt|sybarra: bet the pass by W shows the ace  |pg||
nt|dima:  Now West might figure that partner is void in hearts otherwise would vul opponents go to the 5 level with only 4-card support?|pg||

pc|d5|nt|sunsamvar: south may not be too happy with North's @h shortage|pg||

pc|dA|nt|Walddk4: It's nothing more than acceptable. Spades 2-2 or @CKQ onside if they are 3-1|pg||
nt|xenya: a @H lead might have given declarer some problem, but the contract should make anyway|pg||
nt|pelu: But I am just going for the CC - they are not partners this season - but played together for 2-3 years before|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra: and a claim  |pg||

nt|rcerreto: sul SA 12-14 non credo sia obbligatorio tentare manche con le carte di Sud|pg||

nt|haans: most bid 1nt with weaker hand but not Norway |pg||

pc|c2|nt|bessi2: for east to hold 3127 + not open with a club preempt nv vs vul,  well it was possible but the finesse was with the odds i believe|pg||

nt|marlowepi: double dummy there is an extra chance that the slam could also be made if the same hand holds 3 spades and four Ds and 3 clubs. so declarer might star: spade ace, club toward jack.|pg||

nt|dima:  So another couple of vulnerable undertricks|pg||
nt|stc: looks like -1|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s2|nt|xenya: 6@S might be tempting here |pg||
nt|jbgood: di after heart ace would suffice I think|pg||

pc|cT|pc|s5|nt|ralfwil: I think this is the limit. 4@s|pg||
nt|xenya: but it's a poor contract|pg||
nt|xenya: 6@S i mean|pg||
nt|xenya: so a nice stop|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If @h was not 5-1, 6@s had a chance|pg||
nt|marlowepi: big delay in my chat reaching the screen|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: @Cj to cater for West having 4 clubs|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mdgraham: on the last board, the @D8 return was for sure a heart signal - West led back the @H3 |pg||
nt|mdgraham: which East obviously took as a request for another diamond |pg||
nt|mdgraham: deep waters|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sybarra: http://eurobridge.org/competitions/09Paris/Paris.htm   are the results here? |pg||
pc|d3|nt|xenya: the finesse is on, @Ss are 3-2, but the @H split puts paid to the slam|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and also no double finess in @h|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|mdgraham: schamoly|pg||

pc|s9|nt|sfoxa: hm, I know few buddies willing to compete with 2@s with N's hand|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: is 3@C some kind of strong Bergen raise ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: a lot of players would have simply biod 4S |pg||
nt|stc: small @s ?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: best now is a @s towards the table|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Did they survive?|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: but not results wise|pg||

nt|haans: not to difficult from S|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ralfwil: This is a bad lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 11 tricks with @hJ10, so a ruff with @hQ will not cost|pg||
pc|s8|nt|Walddk4: Partner is a passed hand and you are vulnerable|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Poor old East. He has eight undertricks under his belt already, and this should be a couple more |pg||
pc|sA|nt|april7: very good defence!!|pg||
nt|po-s: it depends who has two spades|pg||
nt|stc: he plays E for Hx in @S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Now defence can take a lot of tricks|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|haans: many say 5nt is Pick a slam|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: N did bid very strongly|pg||
nt|haans: were did South had cards for that|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk4: LHO is unlimited|pg||
nt|haans: maybe x was not penalty|pg||
nt|ralfwil: One possibility is to play W to be short in @s because of the long @d|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ritong: 13 intense boards left|pg||

nt|dima:  Looks like Fredrik needed to duck @h K surely a bit easier for us all then at the table|pg||

nt|rialc2: le ha provate tutte, ma niente da fare: solo 10 prese|pg||

mb|1D|nt|sunsamvar: a spec says --maybe they play 2NT as a natural bid , so 3@C must become Jacoby 2NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a very lucky layout here for E/W probably will make 9 triks if East decides tooptimistically raise this|pg||
nt|lestergold: very borderline|pg||
nt|ahri: their CC says 3@c was 12-17 with fit|pg||
nt|april7: really better defence to play @D at third trick|pg||
nt|dima:  First soft result by Bertheau - NystrÃ¶m in this segment|pg||

nt|april7: ppX|pg||
nt|dima:  will become interesting :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: but as there arent the entries to play club finesses from dummy declarer is forced to bang down club ace and with ace hearts with north thats 9 tricks to b made|pg||
nt|xenya: true|pg||
nt|ahri: and for curious specs: 1M-2NT is not natural. they play it as 10-11 with 4card support or any 6-9 splinter.|pg||
nt|lestergold: spades cant be continued so defence cant do anythinmg|pg||
nt|ahri: to be more precise, it's over 1@S; over 1@H, they play it one step below.|pg||
nt|stc: I think 2@d is any game forcing|pg||

nt|rialc2: ahia|pg||
pc|h9|nt|marlowepi: not sure he is forced to do that. if heart ace or ten is doubleton he will have an entry to dummy and there are various club layouts he could play for to give him 4 tricks in the ...|pg||

nt|april7: with @C J appearing on second round|pg||
mb|2C|nt|lestergold: e/w with a comfortable part score in dimaonds|pg||

nt|marlowepi: backwash|pg||
nt|lestergold: in fact 3n by e/w is not without chances|pg||
nt|ritong: levy might go high here|pg||
nt|ritong: since 2@h probably shows @ss and @cs|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: another interesting hand...|pg||
nt|sfoxa: should this dbl have special meaning, or...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and as this is not a Gambling-3NT type auction, you cannot blame West for the lead. Against an opening 3NT, West would likely lead @SA and then switch to hearts, which would defeat ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3NT. But I would still open it in fourht seat.   |pg||
nt|haans: easy 2nt for me|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: France of course made 3N on 6 and are in it again on 7 to open up a decent lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this 2@h overcall is really scary - 1@S?|pg||
nt|dima:  not easy but as advanced sacrifice vs 4@s|pg||
nt|april7: W saved S probably!|pg||
nt|dima:  Not so easy to steal here though, now NystrÃ¶m will have a chance to bid 4@d ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: need to find the spell checker for commentators |pg||

nt|lestergold: cant actually see 3n going off but ill be surprised if they bid it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: looks like misunderstanding here about 2C|pg||
nt|ritong: pass over 6@s is " i have first round @s control"|pg||
nt|april7: tough bidding from both sides|pg||
nt|sybarra: now?|pg||
nt|dima:  Do we see lowly promotion here :)?|pg||
nt|dima:  that @s 6 is looking sweet but will not help|pg||
nt|april7: X or 5@D, but the vulnerability calls for X, except N could be very weak|pg||
nt|sybarra: seems to me bidding 5 @d over 4 would have been better so opps do not know their major suit |pg||
nt|dima:  And we have a new leader again|pg||
nt|sybarra: S now worried  N could hold xx in spades |pg||

nt|lestergold: well e/w are perhaps palu=ying in third bet dnomination at second best level|pg||

nt|rialc2: bravo claudio a dire solo 4@S, ovvero c'è qualcosa nella licita che ci sfugge|pg||
nt|rcerreto: che, a carte chiuse, non mi sembra ovvio|pg||
nt|rialc2: 4@H|pg||
mb|6H|nt|po-s: Pass is probably forcing  but Fredrik wants to pass|pg||
nt|dima:  Was pass forcing?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: true but that makes the defence tally 5 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: 5@C Turbo = odd no of keys = 3|pg||
nt|haans: big hearts = NO|pg||
nt|stc: 1H GF was already too much :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: hard to predict the outcome |pg||
nt|ybob: best lead to NS|pg||
nt|xenya: even with this @D distribution, the contract might have a play i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: N is going passive -- looks like the best he can do|pg||
nt|ybob: if W discard @D = no way to win by @D|pg||

nt|marlowepi: i wonder why S played the heart 4? 2 or 5 would seem normal according to methods. some sort of odd-even thing seems unlikely|pg||

nt|ralfwil: -1|pg||

nt|rcerreto: comunque vediamo|pg||
nt|gluckenval: vero... i resti 5/1 sono il 14,35%, tranne quando il colore è @D. In quel caso diventa circa il 16% :)|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|ybob: S shows 5@D now|pg||

nt|rcerreto: in aperta 4@h+1, questo board sposterà dei bei punti|pg||
pc|h7|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|dima:  Strong result for German team here coming|pg||

nt|haans: slam bidding much easier if 2@H promise 4 cards|pg||
nt|xenya: *short of 6@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: it was a courageous and imaginative defence in which he decided what to play his partner for and how to wrong foot declarer|pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Blind lead in the closed room, West went for length rather than strength|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but Fantoni had not revealed a heart suit|pg||
nt|doctorone: We have to notice that the auction in other room was more obscure for the leader N/S have directed the @s lead now... Had S rebid 1N (?) and N raised to 3, they may have got a @h ...|pg||
nt|doctorone: lead|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  Nunes opened 1NT of course|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's different here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: North is in a pickle here.  Is 2@S 4th suit - asking for a stopper?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 3@S, I mean|pg||
nt|Walddk2: should be|pg||
nt|doctorone: I like 2@s even by S, Bill, over 2@h...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why don't you like 2NT when you already showed your 4-card diamond support? Because NT could be wrong positionally?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Better played by partner if he has Qxx for example?|pg||
nt|doctorone: Exactly Roland|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Tricky stuff.  Better from the South hand if North has @SJ10x|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But if he has J10x the Ax hand should declare|pg||
nt|bjacobs: snap|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am all for 2NT|pg||
nt|doctorone: Maybe with that holdiog N bids 3@s and we are again from the right side?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Maybe, so could he please get on with it and do so?|pg||
nt|doctorone: holding|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: He really doesn't have any other bid, does he? Well, he thinks he has after the tank|pg||
nt|doctorone: Now, one point in these auction is also to keep them as simple and obscure as possible... So 2N has great merit for sure|pg||

nt|po-s: had he cashed a diamond first|pg||

mb|1N|nt|ritong: don t ask me why, i have no idea  i would have considered @h A first, içn case west holds Qxxx  i m so naive|pg||

nt|april7: if its 2 it doesn't matter, so cash only 1!!!|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is some special treatment of 2 @H |pg||
nt|dima:  Well if @d are 2-2 he is home dry since last spade is likely to be with East|pg||
nt|po-s: only one since if they are 2-2 it is ok -  but here was not easy.. they have a heart entry as well|pg||
nt|dima:  We all seem to agree :)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|pelu: 5 card @s|pg||

mb|3N|nt|sybarra: another option |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: N does not know if S has any clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: let us see if they can reach it after a strong 1@C from S and negative !1D from N |pg||

nt|april7: E should X not W!!!|pg||

nt|pelu: on a small !§S declayer have some problems|pg||
nt|pelu: after @s to 9 and 10 decl has to take 9 tricks - or there will be 5 for defense|pg||
nt|pelu: 25 to Italy after 2 not so good slams by the danish|pg||
nt|cuan: 3@S = strong twosuiter 5-5 heart+minor|pg||
pc|h9|nt|dima:  How can Bertheau find a @s shift now?|pg||
nt|sybarra: k of @C for spade shift |pg||
nt|dima:  I think it is matter of agreement - @c J might be asking for UNUSUAL shift|pg||
nt|sybarra: am told K only shows Q |pg||
nt|april7: thats true|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: then with club switch and D duck declarer has zip|pg||
pc|c9|nt|dima:  Now it is a crunch time as they say in USA|pg||
nt|april7: W can't imagine a 7-5 distribution, but the 6 @C bid!!!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I don´t know what´s happening at the table, but I don´t like N´s thinking in this situation and after that a pass!|pg||
nt|haans: folled them?|pg||
nt|rcerreto: adesso le farei anch'io|pg||
nt|gluckenval: preferite attaccare da una 5a brutta ma con 2 possibili rientri, o da una 4a onorata e più solida ?|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|nt|xenya: seems they are on their way?|pg||
nt|haans: what kind of bidding was that?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: board 9 was unlucky for Norway. One of those random swings which can go either way. |pg||
nt|marlowepi: after 3rd spade i mean|pg||
nt|Walddk5: One of the few good boards Denmark had against Angelini. 5@C+1 in one room, 6@SX= in the other. 17 IMPs|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|jbgood: 6 boards ahead of the OR :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@c?|pg||
nt|haans: some use 2nt lebensohl here|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|nt|rcerreto: very thin, but it makes|pg||
nt|haans: an easy make :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: any guesses on 3@S? Spade values?|pg||
nt|haans: you have a point there|pg||
nt|rcerreto: in funzione di cos'ha il compagno :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: of course 2N here could be too high spade lead and then dim switch and revert to spades looks lie would defeat 2n|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|dima:  Another doubled slam missing 3 keycards and a key King comes home|pg||
