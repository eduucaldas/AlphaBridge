mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: well this 4S shouldnt make|pg||
mb|1S|nt|aupillon: when younger i'd play 3NT|pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: but several comparisons to come|pg||
nt|ady: possible game swing here|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S make in OR|pg||
mb|2S|nt|lestergold: well i wonder how |pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|cameron_1:  sadly no play record in other room to protect the "innocent"|pg||
nt|lestergold: given that when north gets in with spade ace his only play is bound to be club and then over ruffs dummy on third round|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: last board was very good for the presidents|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: And here we are again. 5 minutes have gone. Entertaining show last session. But some may have stronger words for it . |pg||

mb|2S|nt|robbg: did 1@d = @h?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: no, 1@d negative|pg||
nt|jallerton: note Tom Townsend's pass on 1st round, keeping defending in the game|pg||
nt|jallerton: many would overcall 1NT|pg||
nt|robbg: 3@s would be in serious danger here, although with the favorable diamond layout they should survive. But would Gold pass 3@s?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|robbg: Discretion prevailed.|pg||

pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|pc|c5|nt|robbg: yes. So maybe 1NT wouldn't have been so bad. I doubt that he was considering 2NT over 2@s, though possible.|pg||

mb|1S!|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|jallerton: 1@s = t.o of spades|pg||
nt|robbg: Possible to bid game here after east's opening. 4! not a good contract (3NT better maybe?) but cards are very friendly.|pg||
mb|4S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|pc|d7|nt|jallerton: and the bidding will help West get the @s right|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: West likes to know the @SQ is onside|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: He just needs his partner to have a spade or two to take the finesse|pg||

pc|c2|nt|robbg: I think 1NT was a poor choice with such weak values.|pg||
nt|athene: Burn plays his diamonds up-the-line to tell his partner he can't help in hearts.|pg||

nt|vugraphzzh: 2S Weak|pg||
nt|jallerton: Interesting|pg||
pc|d3|nt|robbg: This should be really ugly. I guess Sandqvist took 3@h as asking for a partial stop.|pg||
nt|athene: Perhaps Burn thought that 2@S had to be a good hand at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|robbg: Lead is a small break for ns|pg||
nt|jallerton: Hard for David Gold to divine the actual @h layout|pg||
nt|robbg: true!|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|jallerton: @s blocked|pg||
nt|robbg: Sandqvist thinking "Thank goodness I am up to 8 tricks...Oops!"|pg||
nt|athene: what would it have meant if west had doubled 3@H?|pg||
nt|athene: would that perhaps have been t/o of spades?|pg||
nt|jallerton: take-out of spades I think|pg||
nt|athene: so east couldn't draw any conclusions as to whether west really wanted a heart lead or not|pg||
nt|athene: of course, some might say there was a hint about that on the first round of bidding :) but good players tend not to lead the "obvious" suit if it looks as though that is what opps ...|pg||
nt|athene: are prepared for|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|robbg: No - but I think he should lead a @h unless they are playing 4 card majors. Even if North has a stopper, it might be crucial to knock it out quickly.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|d4|pc|s4|pc|s5|pg||
pc|hT|nt|jallerton: they are playing 4-card majors with weak NT  type hands|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jallerton: so 1444 possible I think|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|pg||
nt|athene: i think west's known spade shortage meant he was very unlikely to have only 4 hearts - 1-4-4-4 specifically is about the only reasonable possibility|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|nt|robbg: running hearts would squeeze dummy, but Townsend might make the safe diamond return.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|2S|nt|mdgraham: ok Brian good luck|pg||
mb|d|mb|r|mb|3H|nt|jallerton: Yes, there is a point-a-board element to the scoring so diff between -50 and -100 may be more than just an imp or 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well I think Sandquist will run now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: do you play intemediate jump is GB?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I think NS play weak jump overcalls, even at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW have been known to open light on occasion|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|lestergold: the question is here whioch denomination they will play the slam in|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@h natural FG|pg||
pc|sK|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: hard to know who was saving ion last hand double not clear cut|pg||
nt|lestergold: it was a reasonable shot 3N but i think 5C is a rush of blood to the head|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lestergold: n/s were not necessarily bidding or making game hee|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||
nt|lestergold: am I seeing things here/|pg||
nt|lestergold: well in dims or spades 5 indeed the limit!|pg||
nt|jallerton: 6NT is where you want to be as chances in 3 suits|pg||
nt|lestergold: but you would have thought that with this degree of rock crushing strenth they may have finished in 6N|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course not a vey regular partnership here|pg||
nt|jallerton: Yes, one problem with 2/1 game forcing is getting over the extra values|pg||
nt|lestergold: he could have inolved his partner  in the decision making process after all Tosh has played before|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|haans: so game no make|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|pc|cK|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jallerton: West had more values than East was expecting|pg||
nt|lestergold: I would be surprised if Cope and Gold in open do not find  N altho they are not a regular partnership either Townsend being absent on paternity leave|pg||
nt|lestergold: so one flight of facny by Norway and the compliment repaid by one from Gold Cup|pg||

nt|athene: i think personally that hand was all about Burn expecting 2@S vul against not to be a real hand no matter whether they have "weak" written on their card or not|pg||
nt|vugraphzzh: Sandqvist away from table|pg||
nt|robbg: Especially after 3NT!|pg||
nt|vugraphzzh: Go get a cup of tea, we'll resume very soon|pg||
nt|jallerton: perhaps Burn was catering for a 6-5 hand opposite|pg||
nt|athene: Burn's hand was very slow for 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: he needs partner to have 6 spades, heart stop and side ace|pg||
nt|vugraphzzh: Back|pg||
nt|athene: even that might not be enough|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|athene: so basically he just isn't playing it for a weak 2@S|pg||

pc|hK|pc|d2|pc|h5|pc|h7|pg||
nt|jallerton: Gold has seen North's "stops" before so might get this right and play !K next|pg||

nt|vugraphzaf: North's bids were all asking|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: South has shown his shape & his controls|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what was 1@S?|pg||
nt|lestergold: to reach 8 card fit slams on a combined 28 count is not automatic and they arent always laydown|pg||
nt|andyv:  it didn't happen in the OR|pg||
nt|lestergold: so Gold Cup will do well to flatten this result in the open|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||

nt|yo_yo: it's certainly impressive to bid a cold slam with 27 combined points|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer will be thinking of the bestorder to play the cards here in case there are any nasty breaks but we can see he is safe whatever he does|pg||
nt|lestergold: like spade being overruffed or hearts being 4/1 etc|pg||
nt|andyv:  still has to contend with the 1@D overcall|pg||
nt|andyv:  but his options are limited|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes it will give him reason to tank but he has to play a card sooner or later and whatever he plays he makes|pg||
nt|andyv:  i agree Mike... that is a requirement... you have to eventually play a card!|pg||

nt|athene: or 7NT|pg||
nt|athene: was 2@D a multi?|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|robbg: assuming 2@d is positive and 2NT is unlimited, this should be an easy grand to bid. |pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|athene: if you play weak-only multi and pass it, opps are often in big trouble simply because they have no cue-bid available|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: ah right|pg||
nt|jallerton: and BBO software can't cope|pg||
nt|jallerton: but yes, 2@d was a bad weak two in a major|pg||
nt|athene: 4@C was transfer to diamonds?|pg||
nt|jallerton: It started 2@D-pass-1@h |pg||
nt|athene: or 3@S was showing a fit and they have now locked into spades|pg||
nt|athene: with only 2 spades west wld bid 3NT over the transfer|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|jallerton: Yes, I think so.  Makes sense when the auction is FG|pg||
nt|athene: i believe some french pairs have started doing this after a normal 2nt opener - give up on stopping in 3major to clarify the degree of fit right away|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|robbg: 5@h q ask, 6@c Q and @cK 6@d @d ask grand|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|nt|robbg: a variation|pg||
nt|robbg: maybe shows all kings BUT @h|pg||
nt|athene: yes, looks like exclusion spiral|pg||
nt|athene: with one king you show it; with two you bid the suit you haven't got the king in|pg||

nt|jallerton: don't understand that method|pg||
nt|robbg: good luck!|pg||
nt|jallerton: what would poor East assume here?|pg||

nt|lestergold: but its hard not to bid a game with 14 points whenyour partner opens|pg||
nt|jallerton: declarer hopes that South will not get in again|pg||
nt|jallerton: but his @d pips are too poor|pg||
nt|lestergold: and the 4/1 heart break means that any fantasies about discarding a spade on a lonmg diamond and uffing one are also doomed|pg||
nt|lestergold: and this only one off|pg||
nt|haans: Justin U think to much|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jallerton: Is there a case for suggesting 3NT on the West hand to protect @sK?|pg||
nt|lestergold: certainly is a case and i think many players would try it|pg||

nt|andyv:  you may be right about the one off, Mike|pg||
nt|andyv:  4-1 @d break makes this hand very awkward to handle|pg||

nt|robbg: good question|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C isn't such a bad shot|pg||
nt|jallerton: Still, as 2@s made, who can argue with success?|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|2N|nt|jallerton: 1@c Polish, 1@d negative|pg||
nt|athene: that's why most modern strong club pairs make 2@C 6+ clubs |pg||
nt|athene: at the expense of loosening up 1@D|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S is ambiguous here, normally, in polish club|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: might be just 4 spades in a weak NT or might be a strong (but not GF) hand|pg||

nt|dburn: West will do rather well to pass this out|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|haans: long way to 6@S now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North will be trying to decide who has got what - EW are well known to open light on occasion|pg||

pc|hT|pc|h2|nt|robbg: guessing at the auction - strong 1@c, limited 1@s, forcing 3@h|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: It's either strong club or Polish club but I don't know which|pg||
nt|jallerton: maybe Polish @c|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|athene: Sandqvist plays Polish club with other partners doesn't he|pg||
nt|robbg: maybe|pg||
nt|jallerton: Sandqvist plays that with one partner and Burn knows all systems|pg||
nt|athene: Wow, Burn ran the @H10|pg||
nt|jallerton: but this partnership was playing rubber bridge style back in January|pg||
nt|athene: i guess the diamond overcall might tip the balance|pg||
nt|robbg: clearly the odds-on play in the heart suit. Risk of course is a diamond ruff if it loses.|pg||
nt|athene: Burn knows that diamonds are 5-1 or 6-0 which means on vacant places Gold has a lot more room for hearts than his partner|pg||
nt|robbg: But Burn does not know that clubs are 3-3 so he might need 6 heart tricks.|pg||
nt|jallerton: might be a 5-1 break in trumps and 3-3 in @c|pg||
nt|robbg: also that|pg||

mb|3C!|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d8|nt|robbg: 2NT looks like a relay of some type. Not sure why it was necessary here.|pg||
nt|athene: No, I am not sure what the little 2NT - 3@C dance was all about|pg||
nt|jallerton: Maybe their way of bidding 5332 FGs|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
nt|robbg: It is popular to lead 2nd highest from small holdings vs NT.|pg||
nt|jallerton: perhaps 2NT forced 3@c to create more sequences|pg||
nt|athene: my guess is, with 5@S332 invitational hand, they use stayman then 2@S|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|pc|d9|pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: so transfer then 2NT is artificial|pg||
nt|vugraphzzh: 2N art GF|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|robbg: Yes, I understand why 2NT could be useful as artificial. I just don't understand why one would employ it with this particular hand.|pg||
nt|robbg: Unless 3NT is also artificial.|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 1NT - 2@H; 2@S - 3NT might be exclusion in hearts or something esoteric :) but this is a very bad idea unless your partner has a GOOD memory|pg||
nt|vugraphzzh: 3@C nat denies 3@S's|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2NT FG enquiry, 3@c natural. according to Simon Cope|pg||
nt|athene: a spec suggests that Gold might have been vaguely interested in a 5-3 heart fit|pg||
nt|jallerton: and non ashamed hand|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: that makes sense; maybe 2NT asks partner to bid a 5-card suit or show 3 spades or bid 3NT|pg||

pc|c8|pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|s2|pg||
pc|cT|nt|robbg: Anyway, this will be a fast nine now.|pg||
nt|jallerton: if that is true a direct 3NT would tend to imply 5233|pg||
nt|athene: yes, or a hand with strong doubleton(s) in minors|pg||
mc|10|nt|robbg: There is a BAM component here I believe, that slows play down here.|pg||
