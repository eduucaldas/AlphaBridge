pc|sK|nt|athene: i wonder why he didn't bid 1NT?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bjacobs: It seems like a matter of timing in 4@H - the key being not to play trumps too early|pg||
nt|Walddk3: With @DA onside you just need to ruff two clubs and you can do that in comfort|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Walddk3: 2@C is a sound heart raise|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: what north does now might depend on two "invisible" factors|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: a) how likely is north to have a singleton spade for 1NT?|pg||
nt|athene: sorry *south*|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: b) how likely is south to raise 1@S with 3-card support anyway?|pg||
nt|haans: do 2@S show better hand (invite)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bjacobs: Prefer 3NT to 5@C here|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Operators are getting paid (fair enough), but it's not a fortune, and perhaps it would have been wiser to cut down elsewhere. But that is easy for me to say|pg||
nt|jbgood: I am in total agreement, Roland|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pg||

mb|3D|mb|3H|nt|athene: i think 3@H as a stopper ask is more popular|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4C|nt|Walddk3: 2@D checkback. I think that's unwise with all those diamonds|pg||
nt|jbgood: or just rebid 1 N after a @d opening - like here|pg||
nt|Walddk3: There is great risk of diamond ruffs|pg||
nt|Walddk3: so even if you have a 5-3 heart fit, it's probably better to stay in notrumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: is 4@C forcing?|pg||
mb|4D|nt|jbgood: ww (wise words)|pg||

pc|h3|pc|d3|pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bjacobs: I'd say South has played a very loud Smith Echo here|pg||

pc|s5|nt|athene: tough defence to find|pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: it didn't look obvious from east's seat that diamonds were the declarer's weak spot|pg||

pc|d2|nt|bjacobs: Declarer will need to bang out the hearts from the top to make it?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Yes, but don't you think he will?|pg||
nt|haans: but he may look like a fool|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He will look foolish if East started with @HKxx and West has @DA|pg||

nt|jbgood: current score is 46-33 in favour of MR|pg||
mb|p|pc|cQ|nt|Walddk3: 4@D was tactical. He wanted a diamond lead if partner were to lead against a heart contract|pg||

pc|cK|nt|bjacobs: N/S seem quite imaginative ... have enjoyed watching their play, even though not everything has come off|pg||

nt|bjacobs: How annoying.  This really is a supremely educational hand|pg||
pc|c8|pg||

nt|athene: now on a club back you are likely to finesse, if you are in game?|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h5|nt|athene: play the lead for singleton or @CQx rather than @CQJ doubleton|pg||
mc|10|nt|athene: the alternative is rise @CA and hope the player with the trump has three diamonds so you can get the club away in time|pg||
