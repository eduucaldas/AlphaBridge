mb|p|nt|haans: most play drury-fit  now 2@C show support 2@S say NO|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and 2N is farcing?|pg||

nt|haans: lucky landing then|pg||

nt|marlowepi: extremely|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bjacobs: The question is - when a low heart is led from dummy, should West go in with @HQ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: would fit the hand better than whatever it does mean|pg||
nt|Walddk3: We had Bjørn Olav Ekren on vugraph in the previous match|pg||
nt|sharynr: now makes sense|pg||

nt|sharynr: once again Hoffa's double caused trouble, I think|pg||
nt|sharynr: no reason to bid over 2H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W had a difficult bid, esp if he was not sure what double was or if that call has to cover a lot of ground. though S showed majors, normally if one major is shorter you would ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: expect it to be spades, and at this vul S could have anything (as her actual hand proives). so not that unlikely that 4S is best game|pg||
pc|s2|pg||

mb|2D|mb|3H|nt|haans: 25% slam|pg||
nt|jbgood: too early in the day to be that desperate|pg||
nt|haans: drury?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Think it's a lot worse than 25%|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It may qualify as a Roland slam - but only Roland can rule on that|pg||
nt|haans: as always M easier to find|pg||
nt|marlowepi: heart lead compromises the trump suit in 6S|pg||
mb|p|nt|davpro: I've been in a lot worse slams then this though...:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West presumably shows some variant of majors, which rather knocks out 6@S as a final contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: It's better than my average|pg||
nt|sharynr: i would be happy to be in 5!|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|haans: but why drury?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Perhaps somewhere between 15-20%?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: someone must have misled W about the form of scoring|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: as so often hapopens, the busy bidders help the opponents|pg||
mb|4H|nt|rodal f: And a push to come|pg||
nt|marlowepi: much harder to reach 6D without the intervention|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: he needs @h QX and @s K on, at first glance|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: much harder to reach 5@D as well, it seems |pg||

nt|athene: suits which you want to pre-empt, as mentioned|pg||
nt|sharynr: but the suit only blocks if !KQ doubleton, or KQJ, and then K would be strange play?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if N has those holdings, a holdup might work too|pg||
nt|sharynr: even KQJ10 would block|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W could have defended 4D and instead permitted NS to get to slam. they sagely compromised however by settling for game|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: TTASL position - stop in part-score, oppo compete - bid game and make it|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharynr: yes holdup but would have to decide if 1 or 2 rounds|pg||
nt|haans: but why did Fuglestad pass 4@D?|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|Walddk3: 4@H should not go down. Declarer in the other room must have been a little careless|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This one looks to have swing potential|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry i guess i was not explicit enough--what i meant was how could it block when S leads the three (assuming they lead 2nd from bad suits as most norwegians do i believe)|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|sharynr: stopping in 2@S on this hand would be tough normally|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there are almost as many "whys" in that auctio n as there are bids|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbgood: kibs ask about the info on movie, and my advice is to ignore it. Scores entered are NOT correct for this session|pg||
nt|athene: interesting choice of re-opening action here|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: i wonder why he didn't bid 1NT?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bjacobs: It seems like a matter of timing in 4@H - the key being not to play trumps too early|pg||
nt|Walddk3: With @DA onside you just need to ruff two clubs and you can do that in comfort|pg||
pc|d8|nt|Walddk3: 2@C is a sound heart raise|pg||
nt|haans: drury in defense new one|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think it's more of a "cue-raise"|pg||
nt|vugraphzyr: 2@c is a good raise in @h|pg||

nt|marlowepi: more like 3 over 1 :)|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|nt|sharynr: better spot than 2@S|pg||

nt|rodal f: Need to try a hook in @H before trying the @C cause of the bad layout there|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: N having clubs + hearts = their suits|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: no take out x|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2S|nt|athene: what north does now might depend on two "invisible" factors|pg||
nt|rodal f: A IMP or 2 to gain|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: a) how likely is north to have a singleton spade for 1NT?|pg||
nt|athene: sorry *south*|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: b) how likely is south to raise 1@S with 3-card support anyway?|pg||
nt|haans: do 2@S show better hand (invite)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|bjacobs: Prefer 3NT to 5@C here|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Operators are getting paid (fair enough), but it's not a fortune, and perhaps it would have been wiser to cut down elsewhere. But that is easy for me to say|pg||
nt|jbgood: I am in total agreement, Roland|pg||
nt|sharynr: 8 tricks (possibly 9 with dangerous @H guess)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: many would detest an overcall on such a horrible suit, but with 3 likely entries, S wants to make sure N leads a spade against NT which looks like a very likely strain from S hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2@H from N. Telling semi @S?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: if south had just *opened* 1nt, then everyone would transfer with the north cards and accept playing the 5-2 fit|pg||
nt|haans: does not pass say that?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: This looks like the perfect auction ... |pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s9|pc|s5|pc|sA|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|nt|athene: but on this auction people often pass with 5 in the major|pg||

nt|haans: a claim is a claim|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: A BIN-standard opening in the OR|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|d|nt|mdgraham: maybe East forgot what the contract was, as the end of the hand was so far from the beginning  |pg||
nt|marlowepi: good choice by N. opening weak suits in 3rd seat just because of the length is a dangerous practice|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mdgraham: for all specs: the "Passed Out"  in the other room is not the case; the operator is entering the results manually   |pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Personally, I would open that West hand with 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzyr: 6@h in CR is correct|pg||

nt|rodal f: BIN=Bridge in Norway made a system wich many players in Norway play. Based on 4 card openings|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: even if they had played 3N, they would have been OK on the layout (three spades and @CA to lose)|pg||
nt|athene: as long as declarer didn't make the mistake of ducking the first spade|pg||
pc|s6|nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|athene: if south led @S2 against 3N and declarer ducked, diamond switch is killing, but winning and playing clubs is happy|pg||
nt|athene: anyway, all irrelevant now|pg||
nt|rodal f: U can take a look at bin.no|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bjacobs: YES!|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Even 5@S would have been too high if Kvangraven finds the lead|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|d9|nt|athene: actually, he can go up with @DA on the @DJ switch|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bjacobs: Excellent bid by North, who can see that he can give partner a heart ruff in 6@S|pg||
nt|jbgood: Kvangraven knows the 6@s will also go down - on a heart ruff|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I was really hating this auction until North rescued it ...|pg||

nt|haans: spec say clubs lead|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Thats right. But I wrote after the 3NT bid:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: looks like trump beats it though|pg||
nt|sharynr: on @HJ lead, 5@D should make, doesn't it?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: odds at least 12-1 against that lead:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, if they NEVER do, then we are starting with an inflated conception of how well they might play. so if we adjust our expectations accordingly, then they will start to play ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: about as well as they might:)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|haans: 2 stoppers in spades|pg||
mb|d|nt|rodal f: More resaults have comed: http://www.bk2000.org/live/Teams.aspx|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jbgood: 2 @s is minor "stayman" |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, maybe a 3@C bid then.  Anyway, they've reached a perfectly good contract|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Which would have made if hearts had not been 4-1|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Høyem thinking about bidding again. It does not seem right at these colours. He must have some hope of defeating 4@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|athene: yes, we might see a spade intra-finesse here|pg||
nt|sharynr: otherwise would have to "pin" the @HJ himself :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: I like the way S bid her hand, anticipating E would bid diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: slight danger of diamond overruffs|pg||
nt|athene: e.g. @D lead, south ducks might cause some headaches for declarer|pg||
nt|athene: he would have to cash @HAK and throw a diamond from dummy, perhaps|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: this is a tricky contract|pg||
nt|rodal f: A spec pointed out that 5@D also makes, but will be hard to take the @HQ from table|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not afterthis auction|pg||
nt|sharynr: yes the 2@H opening has really given the hand away|pg||
pc|s5|nt|haans: are Hayem happy?|pg||
nt|haans: cost very little|pg||
nt|haans: really need the intra here|pg||
nt|jbgood: transportation not good|pg||
nt|athene: small club now is possible|pg||
nt|athene: but you aren't happy playing a 4-3 fit with trumps out; easy to run into a ruff|pg||
pc|sA|nt|marlowepi: well, not just that--S has shown a ton of black cards|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can ruff 2 @Ss now for 11. @SA and @S, Q@H for KA and @S for ruff|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jbgood: then a heart overruff by S is possible|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h3|nt|haans: down is certain|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jbgood: another day 4@s would be cold, and 5@c a really cheap insurance|pg||
nt|athene: spade to the @SA is almost certain to lose @S@S@C@D|pg||
nt|athene: not sure what declarer was playing for|pg||
nt|haans: right|pg||
nt|jbgood: sometimes you play and pray for a miracle|pg||
nt|jbgood: like doubleton trumå honors|pg||
nt|jbgood: trump|pg||
nt|haans: precentage for intra-finesse = to little to count|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or a small @H for A make the same|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|h4|pg||
pc|dT|nt|bjacobs: I'm with Roland.  The heart singleton is a really attractive lead.  You have the majority of the points|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s7|pc|h8|pc|sK|pg||
nt|Walddk3: But only because West has five clubs, Jon. Høyem had no way of knowing that|pg||
pc|d9|nt|marlowepi: E had a tough opening lead. any of them four suits could be best (though probably trump is least likely to be so)|pg||

pc|cK|nt|haans: smal @S to 8 then the J |pg||

nt|haans: nonvul need 45-50%|pg||
nt|haans: can they stop |pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|Walddk3: Typical Kvangraven upgrade I suspect. That man never downgrades anything|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Must have been the same in CR|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Don't get me wrong, I don't think an upgrade is horrible|pg||
nt|athene: and south will bid game|pg||
nt|athene: ahhh ok|pg||

mb|p|nt|jbgood: a cheap escape at the other table|pg||

nt|athene: wow|pg||
nt|vugraphzyr: yes, he did|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose he does have a maximum for a passed hand, but still :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Brekka counting his hand as an 18er by his middlecards|pg||

pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|nt|Walddk3: Declarer in the other room must be brilliant. Getting to 6 tricks is pure magic|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|pg||
nt|haans: yes that was what i thought|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dont like that lead at all. with many potential entries a spade is indicated. if you want to lead a club you should lead the queen for 2 reasons: (1) decpetive value  (2) more ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: importantly, even if leading low does fetch an honor from partner, retaining the queen make you even more endplayaba;e|pg||

nt|jbgood: a weak NT opener suggested|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|haans: msny bid 3@H = minors|pg||
nt|haans: leaping for M+m|pg||
nt|jbgood: difficult hand for S ..|pg||
nt|sharynr: another possible swing now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: er...how did 5@D go down?|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: chancy bidding but ok for me|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|athene: i think 3@H as a stopper ask is more popular|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Single?|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|marlowepi: you are going to bid 5D sooner or later, and 2 KC wont be enough for slam, so unless you think you will have a chance to minorwood the hand, 5D seems a practical underbid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ah. It didn't :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: 2@D checkback. I think that's unwise with all those diamonds|pg||
nt|jbgood: or just rebid 1 N after a @d opening - like here|pg||
nt|Walddk3: There is great risk of diamond ruffs|pg||
nt|Walddk3: so even if you have a 5-3 heart fit, it's probably better to stay in notrumps|pg||
mb|3H|nt|haans: is 4@C forcing?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: ww (wise words)|pg||
nt|sharynr: :)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|rodal f: Spec say Y|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south might try 4@S now but he won't think spades can provide a satisfactory trump suit if his partner can't open 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: bingo|pg||
nt|haans: well done|pg||
nt|jbgood: I was about to predict a spade lead - :)|pg||
nt|sharynr: now all he has to do is make it|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: do we like this double? seems like you dont have enough defense and you dont have enough offense|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jbgood: nice sequence|pg||
nt|athene: yes, reasonable enough|pg||
nt|athene: but one loser in each suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: could be right, guess youd need a simulation. seems against the odds to me|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: unless declarer can get the clubs going for a diamond pitch|pg||
nt|haans: just guessing i say|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: he might manage to do it all|pg||
nt|jbgood: need a di shift|pg||
nt|jbgood: for defense |pg||
nt|athene: diamond switch will put the defence ahead in the race|pg||
nt|athene: declarer has to lose a trump and a club along the way|pg||
nt|jbgood: but is needed - else it wins|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c6|nt|marlowepi: seems pretty easy to make|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sharynr: trump break bad, are there still 10 tricks?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bjacobs: I'd say South has played a very loud Smith Echo here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So loud, it can be heard throughout the world|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: tough defence to find|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: it didn't look obvious from east's seat that diamonds were the declarer's weak spot|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: D king|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|dQ|pc|d7|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|nt|Walddk3: Besides, declarer would have let it ride if he had the queen|pg||
pc|dK|nt|haans: feeling squeezed|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|nt|athene: actually as a spec points out it's more for entry considerations than timing, that the @D was necessary|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cT|pc|c9|nt|marlowepi: claim|pg||
mc|10|pg||
qx|o29|st||md|3ST95H85DAKJ65CJ96,S762HT42D974CAK42,SAQJ8HJ93D32CQT83,SK43HAKQ76DQT8C75|sv|b|nt|athene: there was an alternative line - cash another trump throwing the @DJ from dummy, coming down to @DAK / @Cxx in dummy, for a trump squeeze|pg||
nt|rodal f: Next set are to start in 18min |pg||
nt|marlowepi: challenge the champs -- NS 3N with 9 spades|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nowhere near 5@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but there isa tendency to double with a trick, hoping partner has two|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unfortunately here North only had one|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would not think i was a clearcut favoirite to have a trick on that auction|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ESPECIALLY if pd gets off to wrong lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: Resaults so fare: http://www.bk2000.org/live/Teams.aspx|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Standing so fare: http://www.bk2000.org/live/Teams.aspx|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: but i think declarer knew enough about the distribution not to be tempted by that :)|pg||
nt|sharynr: very difficult|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: a spec reminds me that the trump squeeze was his idea :)|pg||
nt|haans: 5@D is par|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sQ|pc|s3|nt|haans: big winner|pg||
nt|bjacobs: East is copying North with these @S10 leads ... and indeed, it's a threatening play|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s2|pg||
nt|haans: 2 clubs 1 spade|pg||
nt|haans: ok|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if S had a third D then maaaybeeeeeeee, but with a weak doubleton no way|pg||
nt|marlowepi: now cold|pg||
nt|rodal f: A normal one for a new push|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no, it is cold now|pg||
nt|sharynr: no partial strip and endplay?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: eliminate majors and exit D|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bjacobs: Declarer will need to bang out the hearts from the top to make it?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Yes, but don't you think he will?|pg||
nt|haans: but he may look like a fool|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He will look foolish if East started with @HKxx and West has @DA|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So, it doesn't look too clear to me to make this|pg||
nt|bjacobs: First, West has to find the spade return|pg||
nt|rodal f: It is. Sr|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dJ|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jbgood: there is no attractive alternative to another spade?|pg||
nt|sharynr: better to have saved that @DJ!|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bjacobs: NOW, refusing the finesse is probably|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sometimes i wonder if it would be best to play a 1N response forcing when vul & NF when NV. just an idea|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bjacobs: probable|pg||
nt|haans: yes 3@C was not a good bid prefer 4@C showing @D support|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|jbgood: well. there was ...|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y it was a key|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|pc|c3|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bjacobs: Of course, now he's scared of a diamond ruff, I suppose|pg||
nt|mdgraham: in a five-card major structure, 2@H is ok by West as well|pg||
pc|h2|nt|haans: i play semi forcing Still do not know if i am to alert that|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: chance of E underleading both honors was miniscule|pg||
pc|d5|pc|c2|pc|h9|pc|c7|pg||
pc|s9|nt|sharynr: ok folks, see you later :) been a pleasure commenting with you all, and good job operator!|pg||
pc|s6|nt|haans: all bids are semi-f :(|pg||
pc|sA|nt|marlowepi: thx sharyn see you|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nice to have u here Sharyn:)|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is tolerable, yes, but the LTC and shape are not great for it. with an AK it is ok but if we weken the W hand just a bit 2H could get you to a lot of games going down|pg||

nt|jbgood: an opportunity lost for M-T 2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I'd like to thank our excellent operator Liv Marit Grude for a fine job (also entering all those CR scores)|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|athene: the same as playing in 1nt or 3, never 2 |pg||
nt|rodal f: Ure a hard man Marshall:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyr: last board now, back 17.40|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however 1NT has gone down on a cunning lead by North|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: and thanks also to Roland, Jon and Hans for the commentary|pg||
nt|athene: passed out?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i prefer to think of myself as "frank" :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rodal f: 30 are the last board at this evening. The set's tomorrow will be at: 09.00 - 11.25 - 13.50. All CET Remember to correct ure clock 1 houre back|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bjacobs: Finally our appreciation to the NBF (Inger Hjellemarken) for putting on the show.  One table is a lot better than none!|pg||
nt|athene: at least three of the players have an opening bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzyr: still...the scores are wrong|pg||
nt|rodal f: 17.40CET or in 11 min|pg||
nt|marlowepi: just like you :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: According to my notes, the next set is due to start in 3 minutes, but somehow, I don't think it will|pg||
nt|haans: 4@D error?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Me????? Soft. The body I ment:)|pg||
nt|haans: all have fun today|pg||
mb|2N|nt|athene: now west really has to go 3@S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: frank|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry i mean 1N by N|pg||
nt|rodal f: Undo Liv Marit?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Thx:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: 23 minutes rather|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Bid it for the lead?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyr: no|pg||
nt|haans: ok|pg||
nt|jbgood: current score is 46-33 in favour of MR|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Are 3@D correct?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: interesting double by S, and interesting 2S by N|pg||
nt|mdgraham: really 3@D. Liv?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|Walddk3: 4@D was tactical. He wanted a diamond lead if partner were to lead against a heart contract|pg||
nt|athene: no-one did anything really silly here, but this should be 170|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would have bid clubs with both hands|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@D?|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2NT tell minors at N I presume|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: N/S seem quite imaginative ... have enjoyed watching their play, even though not everything has come off|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: but a backfire|pg||
nt|bjacobs: big-time|pg||
nt|Walddk3: But now it backfired. Kvangraven wasn't in for tactics|pg||
nt|haans: Voll must have a talk with p|pg||
nt|jbgood: sometimes being smart is too smart even for prd|pg||
nt|bjacobs: How annoying.  This really is a supremely educational hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: declarer might actually have a bit of a club guess|pg||
nt|haans: dummys cards all aces|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|nt|Walddk3: Should he not have guessed when Voll pulled to 5@C? I mean, he could have pulled to 5@D|pg||
pc|h5|nt|marlowepi: wrong playt by E and by S|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|jbgood: does your statement also include passing on the E hand in the CR?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bjacobs: I think he should indeed have worked it out|pg||
nt|haans: me 2|pg||
pc|h7|nt|marlowepi: E needs to attend to his side suit immediately, at trick 2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: clubs seem to have got lost a bit|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bjacobs: But it's easier to say this in my computer room, than at the table|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3D also mysterious. odd auction all around, though E was normal|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s4|pc|h8|pg||
nt|haans: i do assume that their was no passed out|pg||
nt|jbgood: ooops - that may be very true:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyr: the scores are WRONG|pg||
nt|marlowepi: had S covered spade king, which could not cost, contract sure to fail|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sorrely a window was open Mike. It fl....|pg||
pc|hT|pc|d9|pc|s9|pc|h9|pg||
nt|athene: now on a club back you are likely to finesse, if you are in game?|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|athene: play the lead for singleton or @CQx rather than @CQJ doubleton|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: the alternative is rise @CA and hope the player with the trump has three diamonds so you can get the club away in time|pg||
nt|athene: of course after north cashes the @HK there's also a ruffing finesse in hearts|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E lucky|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: objections to that |pg||
nt|bjacobs: North suddenly discovers, to his pleasure, that he has a good hand|pg||
nt|Walddk3: 3@D is a slight overbid opposite a balancing double|pg||
nt|Walddk3: which could we as little as 8 hcp|pg||

pc|s9|pc|s3|pg||
