mb|1D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: All teams in the Premier League are county teams. So this is a derby between two teams from Trøndelag|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jallerton: 1@d by North, that is a surprise.  I'd be concerned about opponents finding a major suit fit|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
nt|bobh1: in response to the takeout double he had to do something altho he surely considered 1n|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Mike Hi Bob|pg||
nt|jallerton: After the double, in standard methods, 1NT shows North's values, 1@d does not|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lindqvist-Brogeland, European Champions from Pau, France, 2008. Boye Brogeland also a World Champion|pg||

nt|haans: unlucky|pg||
nt|bobh1: 4@s is a bit of a stretch by my lights|pg||
nt|jallerton: needs to find @C lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: either 2@D or 3@D would classically show a spade raise|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: hard to bid spades|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: Liv Marit is a busy lady. She has to get results from the closed room herself|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1S = <= 3 spades, wants to compete|pg||
mb|d!|nt|jallerton: X would be 4!+ @S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: your opponents must be very respectful, Haans - mine have no problems bidding spades at all  |pg||

mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: Cokes are very expensive in Norway, Henri|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h3|pc|s4|pc|h9|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|dT|nt|bobh1: on the previous board a 1@s overcall would have been frivolous|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Would actually have been better for Brogeland to pitch clubs rather than spades|pg||
nt|jallerton: East had a marginal action, obviously.  Should West have bid differently?|pg||
nt|bobh1: so i guess if the downside is a partscore swing and the upside is 1100 this is a productive style|pg||

nt|haans: close to standard in Norway|pg||
