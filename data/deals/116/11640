nt|Walddk2: 31 and 32 in this room first, followed by comparisons from the closed room when we roll over to board 17|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello Cornelia and Sveta|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lindqvist-Brogeland reigning European Champions (France 2008). Brogeland also a World Champion. His partner then was Erik Sælensminde|pg||
nt|sfoxa: Hello Roland, hi kibs!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They split up (amicably) after the gold medal|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good time to stop, while you're on top of your game|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We are in Trondheim in the western part of Norway. Trondheim is a city and municipality in the county of Sør-Trøndelag and is the Norwegian center of education|pg||
nt|Walddk2: All teams in the Premier League are county teams, so this is a derby between two teams from Trøndelag|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am instructed that Trondheim is located in mid Norway rather than western|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Norway is a huge country with a small population, around 4.5 million|pg||

nt|cuttysark: I am a little confused as to why everybody is starting with boards 31 and 32 :)|pg||
