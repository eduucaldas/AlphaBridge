pc|d6|nt|rnmalik: Hi Shirley|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|sybarra: we begin with a fairly calm hand and can make 4 |pg||
nt|mmmakela: hard to bi d W being 4144|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now 5 @H? or |pg||
nt|lestergold: this normal contract does not however look like a making one|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi Geoff|pg||
pc|hK|nt|cindy:  N cant make a penalty double ?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|roswolf: lack of entries to dummy will become all too evident|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sfoxa: We are to follow Danish Club Teams Championship. Doesn it mean, there are Nationals as well, beside Clubs?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: for those who forgot to adjust their clocks we are NOT 1 hour late|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|monsted: East could have made a penalty dobl here i think|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome|pg||
nt|jcwla: E would probably double at matchpoints, but at IMPS penalty doubles into game should be made only if confident of setting the contract (some say by 2 tricks).|pg||
nt|snorris:  needs to raise @hs|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mmmakela: sry don't understand your question Sveta|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mmmakela: nowadays you tend to lose the minors|pg||
nt|mmmakela: depending what 2D-2 NT can have pretty lame|pg||
nt|ady: was going to be difficult to reach the slam    2 key cards in north hand    and still needs good fortune with the clubs|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: approve the 2D raise by S -- when opps rate to have spades, all the other suits are the same for us so bidding hearts would be misdirected and takes up no room|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ritong: hi|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi Shirley, Christina and Marshall|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|roswolf: -2 is predestined|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi rashed|pg||
pc|cK|nt|roswolf: yes it does look doomed|pg||
nt|lestergold: a bit unluky neither red suit behaves|pg||
nt|roswolf: life is like that|pg||
nt|lestergold: west of course doesnt know his partner has a second diamond winner|pg||
nt|lestergold: but he must play a low spade here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Board 1 will be cancelled I am told. One of the players in the closed room took somebody else's cards|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|jcwla: The OR is starting with 11 and 12 so we will be feeding them comparisons until we get that far.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|monsted: looks like down 2 or 3|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So this is just for fun|pg||
pc|c2|nt|marlowepi: another reason not to bid hearts, of course, is that E is likely to have a good holding in the suit but that is a tertiary reason|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rnmalik: I thought NS had good play for 4@S, 1@C+1@D+1@S=3|pg||
nt|lestergold: Good evening everyone Mike Gold here from England|pg||
nt|marlowepi: when does the fun start?|pg||

nt|cindy:  hi|pg||
nt|snorris:  hi Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Cindy!|pg||
nt|cindy:  :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: double seems to have a lot to recommend it, yes. they might run diamonds against you at 3N|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Snorri|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sfoxa: if this is Club teams, do they have another teams championship?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: W's second dbl didn't work out well|pg||
nt|lestergold: just as well as west has put paid to his side enjoying the 3 spade tricks they were dealt|pg||
pc|hT|nt|monsted: yes and showing 24 as NT is ok I think|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Marshall|pg||

nt|lestergold: and handed the contract to south on a plate|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah well at least we know it doesnt matter|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2D would be a lot to bid in most standard methods|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|lestergold: but 3n would still be reached|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|Walddk2: Not so easy for Bilde to pitch here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He doesn't know that spades don't come in|pg||
nt|pelu: easy for to see - but almost impossible at the table|pg||

nt|mmmakela: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub6/Turneringer/KampResultat638.html  for results and standings after round 6|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3 Nt by NS good spot|pg||
nt|sfoxa: with a lot of finesses, although )))|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Bridgewise, Denmark is divided into 11 districts. The district winners, and an extra team from the district with the holders (Copenhagen), compete for the honours|pg||
nt|mmmakela: slam is not great but could be laydown if N also held @C 10|pg||

nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub6/Turneringer/KampResultat635.html  for results and standings after round 3|pg||
nt|monsted: this is 4 spades - but with this weak opening they will go too high I think|pg||
nt|jcwla: A Rule of 20 opener here and this seems to be the rare right time for a trump lead.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Singleton trump lead that is.|pg||
nt|lestergold: work to deo to get at ten tricks but opps even with trump lead cannot get enough trump plays in|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
nt|cindy:  was it a risk   i guess i should have been paying attention :-)|pg||
nt|snorris:  I guess q of @s|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: 20 pts eac h this time|pg||
nt|Walddk4: OEJ are the holders|pg||
nt|mmmakela: by S  good|pg||
nt|lestergold: a bit of a misfit here|pg||
mb|2D|nt|rnmalik: will NS find it|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Yep|pg||
nt|snorris:  as if west MIGHT come in .|pg||
mb|p|nt|christinas: EW play weak NT|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S  looks a possibility   but with trumps 5-1 looks doomed  especiaally on a heart lead|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lestergold: 5 spades 2 dims a heart and two club ruffs is ten tricks what if south ducks a diamond lead towards dummy?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Wow.|pg||
nt|lestergold: At unfavourable vulnerability??|pg||
nt|lestergold: is south colour blind?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the Schaltz team name is also the title of an outstanding Western from late 50s or early 60s starring Marlon Brando and Karl Malden|pg||
nt|lestergold: E/W playing a weak no trump?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: no transfer, interesting  |pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  Youth displays courage|pg||
nt|lestergold: obviously|pg||
nt|snorris:  very popular in Denmark|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  Again: @cQ behind J for winning 3NT - so now it is proven 100%|pg||
mb|3C|nt|roswolf: 4@S IS AN INSPIRED CHOICE|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  ...and will become older|pg||
nt|lestergold: its youth|pg||
nt|lestergold: well doube dummy there are 9 tricks available in 3N |pg||
nt|mmmakela: good lead|pg||
nt|sfoxa: not so easy with this start |pg||
nt|mmmakela: 135 leads|pg||
nt|mmmakela: promising 2 or none higher|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: Japenese?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: W's t/o dbl is little weak to my taste|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah well 3nt is always forgiving|pg||
mb|3H|nt|rnmalik: true|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: not much chance of this making  |pg||
nt|lestergold: kamikaze trained|pg||
nt|mmmakela: for englishorientated audience EW team name is quite exotic|pg||
nt|ady: north might have reasoned south will be short in hearts    but has to be wary of at least 10 cards in the minors  so not likely to fit well in spades|pg||
nt|marlowepi: awkward bid for N but when you can overbid in a way that allows you to tell your whole story, it is generally a good idea, especially at IMPs|pg||
nt|roswolf: well discipline reigns|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@H seems a good spot for NS |pg||
mb|3S|nt|ady: club values bad for declarer|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  ...and richer|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh my west has let vul opps off hook|pg||
nt|monsted: Dennis is normaly very solid - despice of Junior|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: first board was a clue about north s style|pg||
nt|lestergold: and 11 tricks i think is a distance too far|pg||
nt|jcwla: This sure looks like the time for a double by W.  E appears to have wasted @C values and W has the reds locked up, no comprendo.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|christinas: unpleasant to balance for NS, but they can make 3@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: brutal.|pg||
nt|lestergold: on this defence a lot of tricks available |pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
nt|ady: likely 2 down|pg||
nt|lestergold: look at the mountain that south had offered|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: the children would have to be sent to bed early|pg||
nt|lestergold: and south was warned by the splinter that clubs were NOT breaking|pg||
nt|lestergold: well nmot the sharpestr defence ive ever seen |pg||
nt|lestergold: so far that is|pg||
nt|vugraphzyy: 4 cl = void|pg||
pc|c7|nt|rnmalik: Weak NT has its advantages aswell|pg||
nt|sybarra: just which 5/2 S should play and the breaks here are not good  |pg||
pc|cT|nt|pelu: 2@H = 4. suit - tto strong for direct 4@S - but 3@S is in my book and overbid - 4.suit + 4@S is the hand!|pg||
pc|cA|nt|roswolf: well with a bit of luck on their side they are formidable|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: given that you dont really want S on lead, i predict 4 club tricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: here thanks to system no need to do anything dramatic, though the N hand is suitable enough for a D contract that 2H is an underbid|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jcwla: If West's splinter showed the void -- then it's incomprehensible.  If not, then the Rule of 20 opener combined with W's feeling of still having hidden extra values and a possible ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: slam at least makes it comprehensible, though still not my choice...|pg||
pc|h3|nt|pelu: 4.suit + 4@s = mild slaminvit , 4.suit + 3@S = strong slam invit|pg||
nt|lestergold: boing void in pard's seond suit is a little bit of a dampener allowing a downgrade|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ady: +200 should be a useful score for e/w on a non event hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: then im afraid the men in white coats should be summoned|pg||
nt|lestergold: i meanm for south|pg||
nt|rnmalik: mine was an observation after seeing all 52 cards but tough for N to bid 4@H, |pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|dT|nt|snorris:  your cristalball is right|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sybarra: welcome Christina|pg||

nt|ady: yes|pg||
pc|sT|nt|rnmalik: Christina, sorry for spellings|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mmmakela: not J?|pg||
nt|lestergold: hard not to losee 3 clubs a heart and a dim in 3n|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: am i seeing things|pg||
nt|lestergold: how many tricks has south given away to declarer?|pg||
nt|jcwla: 6 to Blakset on 1, while their N/S failed by 2 in 3@C here, their E/W failed by 3 in 3NT in the OR.|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: probably too tough to reach 4H, and after all it could just as easily have been the hearts that broke badly with the spades behaving|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|mmmakela: needs good guessing now|pg||
pc|d5|nt|marlowepi: the issues in 3N seems to be more a matter of having no tricks|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|jcwla: Enough that this is now coming home.|pg||
nt|lestergold: in spite of south';s best efforts to give his oppos an early xmas one way or the other, declarer shgould still be left with an inescapable club loser|pg||
nt|jcwla: Disagree.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Next year I am sure they make it mandatory for the teams to deliver their CC's|pg||
nt|benno:  East must have thought of a bid instead of double|pg||
pc|h9|nt|benno:  nothing in @s and extremely good controls for slam|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||
nt|pelu: close to down 4 after the @S-lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: what do you suggest, Martin?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|h3|nt|benno:  also fav vul suggest a bid|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|chick: yes, I am surprised they chose to defend vul vs not|pg||
nt|thorvald: I quote: "Alle meldinger kan afvige i styrke og fordeling" that means: All bids can vary in strength and distribution from the definition :) |pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|pc|cJ|nt|Walddk2: She doesn't have anything sensible to bid as I see it, unless she wants to commit to slam (5@S)|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|thorvald: From the CC for hansen and Bilde|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|nt|benno:  what would 4N be?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Two places to play?|pg||

nt|rnmalik: true, if they do go overboard|pg||
nt|rnmalik: dont|pg||
nt|christinas: a little info about the tournament: All the contesting teams are regional champions, besides the copenhagen region who are represented by two teams because they are reigning ...|pg||
nt|christinas: champions|pg||
nt|roswolf: easy game|pg||
nt|roswolf: a hand of promise now|pg||
nt|ady: e/w may end in 4@s  going down|pg||
nt|jcwla: In the OR, E passed, S opened 1@D, and the contract is a quiet 4@S.|pg||
nt|pelu: No Martin is not - the team is from the Copenhagen Club One-Eyed Jacks - a club with 16 teams - only playing teams (and a few IMP-pair)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: strange play,but all well in the end|pg||
nt|ady: poor defence    trump should have beden played|pg||
nt|ady: been|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3 spades 2 hearts 3 dims and 2 clubsthere are tricks but unfortunatley there are more than four tricks for the defence|pg||
nt|roswolf: safely done|pg||
mb|2D|nt|monsted: yes this could give som action|pg||
nt|lestergold: and sharp defence could threaten 4S|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: an easy game|pg||
mb|3H|an|preempt|nt|nielsfoged:  6@c is ok|pg||
nt|sfoxa: hard to avoid 3 NT here as well|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 3 nt has a flaw here|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 3@S?|pg||
nt|snorris:  180 not 210 surely|pg||
mb|3S|nt|rnmalik: 3NT by EW on a @S lead, |pg||
nt|monsted: 3 clubs non vul is not much here|pg||
nt|ady: this will not be a success|pg||
nt|lestergold: 9 top tricks 3n|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  but somewhat Roland style|pg||
nt|jcwla: An overtrick IMP on 2 as 4@S made on the dot.|pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: but with such a thin spade guard may be difficult to bid now|pg||
nt|mmmakela: w might bid 3 nt now|pg||
nt|lestergold: potential here for e/w to get overboard|pg||
nt|ady: 5@D  looks on for n/s|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mmmakela: not any more lol|pg||
nt|rnmalik: No @C lead and made|pg||
nt|mmmakela: surely W can't find C K lead|pg||
nt|mmmakela: would've been spectacular|pg||
nt|christinas: 2@d multi|pg||
nt|sybarra: optimistic |pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting multi |pg||
nt|rnmalik: costly 4@S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this is worth noting about those 55 borderline openers, though--when you really would prefer playing in the lower suit if partner has equivalent holdings, you could pass hoping to ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: get to show your 2 suiter later. if the auction does allow you to do that, you will get to the right suit as with equal holding partner will bid hearts. with the actual hand, of ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: course, it is not clear you do want hearts if partner is equal in the suits|pg||
nt|sybarra: e/w make 4 hts |pg||
nt|christinas: I think it is down 3 for -500, and 4@h probably make|pg||
mb|d|nt|ritong: east took a risk doubling 1@s|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @S lead by N|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: he wanted to show his @h xxxx, we guess$|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 3NT after the 3@D bid optimistic|pg||
nt|lestergold: nothing of interest here|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@S emerged boldy dont see why at these colors|pg||
nt|lestergold: You wanna see what emerged form Bilde at these colours yesterday!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at these colors i am a bit surprised S did not double, but maybe that would have some special meaning in NS methods, such as "i have a trump stack"|pg||
nt|roswolf: well the neck was stretched out for axing|pg||
nt|sybarra: would have been an expensive axe !|pg||
nt|lestergold: It was Bilde who offered his non vul opps something like a 4 figure penalty but they went on to bid 5 which was easy to defeat then bilde carved up the defence so there was no ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: happy endiong|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: i might have called again as east|pg||
nt|monsted: pass in North ?? - should have bid 4 spades I think|pg||
nt|sfoxa: sometime you'll find @d 4-4 by opps|pg||
nt|christinas: so principally it is right to bid 4@s|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ady: looks down 4   -400|pg||
nt|mmmakela: u like Dorthe's bids Peter?|pg||
nt|lestergold: Bilde may be colour blind|pg||
nt|christinas: N knows they have at least 9 spades|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: best defence this is one off i fear|pg||
nt|lestergold: or Bild may be wild|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ritong: but the scenario was relatively predictable with his @s single|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  but in 6@c do not play on double finesse - which would be rather natural after the 2@s bid|pg||
nt|jcwla: I would also open 1@C with West but a minority of players might choose something else.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 4s lucky to go obly three off reverse the heart honours and its 4 off|pg||
nt|lestergold: I dont think in an imps game its good business to o for such a potentially expensive save- especially when the game doesnt always make|pg||
nt|lestergold: it does here and it would profit but nothing to write home about|pg||
nt|monsted: not a safe - but to make it difficult for EW to make the rigth decision|pg||
nt|snorris:  credit to east for threding carefully|pg||
nt|lestergold: but makes now on the lead|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|sybarra: and overboard they went |pg||
nt|cindy:  might not make 3@h even   oops  that lead helps the cause|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ritong: so, if the system allows it, i think that bidding @ds immediately is more sound|pg||
nt|ritong: and, if pard has @hs, it will be good for @d trump as well|pg||
nt|sybarra: or "c"  all of the above|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: n/s should get a plus if they dont  mangle the diamond suit|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: not an easy lead i must admit but my choice would have been a passive club when the bididnmg shows the contract is likely to be tight|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Thought so, Shirley:) 2@H and 3@C discouraging bids but even then|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hQ|nt|Walddk4: Did he really make 4 overtricks on board 2?|pg||
nt|lestergold: not possiblem Roland|pg||
nt|cindy:  think so|pg||
nt|lestergold: must have lost the AD at the end|pg||
nt|vugraphzyy: sr - no 10 tricks|pg||
nt|snorris:  must have been operators mistake|pg||
nt|lestergold: having already lost two hearts|pg||
nt|marlowepi: before we heap any more scorn on 3S, we should bear in mind that there is plenty of room in principle for his partner to hold useful values--S has opened at favorable and N has ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: announced 7-9. W could have up to  13 HCP, more than enough for EW game if they are nicely situated|pg||
pc|h8|nt|monsted: no 4 down - I would have bid 4 spades om E - strange not to|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|c6|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @S lead would be interesting|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: there is some equity in it but north apart form spade support has a working yarboroug in tnhe side suits|pg||
nt|cindy:  on the lead  there is a tiny inference that S might have doubled 2@d|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ady: even with diamonds 4-4 Sveta  still the A@S|pg||
nt|sfoxa: but EW have cool 5@c|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s6|pg||
nt|roswolf: funny but pard never has these goodies when i am so bold|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|nt|rnmalik: absolutely correct Henri bidding 2 @D would not hurt|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i think leading away from an unsupported Q is an unnecessary risk on this bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: and it cost as we have seen|pg||
nt|cindy:  yes  a negative inference|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  he hasn't won it yet|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk4: Good afternoon to Niels Foged|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|christinas: not very scientifically bid. NS are not in a regular partnership|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mmmakela: well 3nt could be based on 1suiter|pg||
nt|pelu: what could she do - 3@C is fair, and over 4@DX ir is hard to pass|pg||
nt|sybarra: me either, so I guess we need new pards|pg||
nt|roswolf: true|pg||
pc|c4|nt|monsted: Anyway East hand is no use - and 1 suiter somes not often in this auction|pg||

nt|roswolf: good point henri|pg||

nt|sfoxa: normal lead - and fast claim|pg||
nt|rnmalik: very difficult otherwise|pg||
nt|ady: since n/s haved 5@D   that was a good result for e/w|pg||
nt|mmmakela: but 4 @S is down|pg||
nt|marlowepi: leave us note that N is above his announced range--quite rare at these colors, and S has about 70% more values than he promised by opening 1H|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think pen dbls should be used when you have such a bols opp|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S lead far from unreasonable also|pg||
mb|p|nt|monsted: another strong hand for West|pg||

mb|1C|nt|ady: wet is picking  up so big hands|pg||

nt|marlowepi: the most good (i.e. in a suit where you have one too)?|pg||
mb|r|nt|monsted: no sorry 9 tricks on the god spade|pg||
nt|monsted: 2NT on 19 I dont understand|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT   can get home on favourable spade split|pg||
nt|monsted: 20|pg||
nt|monsted: maybe 2NT is forcing|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5d fine here just lose the two bullets|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|ady: seems not|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4N to play also a winning option in practice|pg||
nt|monsted: 4 spades if a litle strange here|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Part score here|pg||
mb|p|nt|monsted: nope must be a miscount ?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: how can u pass as E?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: what on earth is east up to why is he slamming with 1 flattish points hios pard has not promised extras|pg||
nt|pelu: very aggressiv X by West - spec with @CK in front of the @C-opening|pg||
nt|roswolf: 6@C by west might have some play on another day|pg||
nt|christinas: On board 1 One-eyed earned imps playing strong nt, because N opened a weak nt in stead of a @d and so S did not lead a @d|pg||
pc|hK|nt|cindy:  W isn't shy|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6N too|pg||
nt|lestergold: but neither sound to bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, quite generally on the weak-NT balance sheet that is a prominent negative|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ady: this may well be a swing against Blakset|pg||
nt|lestergold: 13|pg||
nt|ady: 4@C?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|nielsfoged:  optimal contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: well some excitement any way|pg||
nt|rnmalik: very strang last hand E had better @D and he DBLED and now he has better @H and bids 2@D|pg||
nt|mmmakela: if W promises his cards|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 1820|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Board is cancelled. One player, accidentally, saw a card belong to N and one belonging to E|pg||
nt|mmmakela: could even call it foolish|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Board 1 that is|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|lestergold: well sanity has crept back in here|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, E does have some extras, but predictably W's reasonable 4@D was based partially on distribution.  At some point they recognized this.|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes butnoslam going extras|pg||
nt|lestergold: enough to make 11 tricks a proposition|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1NT +2 in this room|pg||
nt|pelu: I agre Markku - I also hate specs with "no name"|pg||
nt|mmmakela: dias lead now?|pg||
nt|sfoxa: E would mind|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I might lead the J@C|pg||
nt|sfoxa: very tiny game, but possible with unaccurate defence|pg||
nt|mmmakela: last train type?|pg||
nt|ady: 6@H  a fair contract|pg||
nt|mmmakela: seems antiques both sides|pg||
nt|vugraphzyy: trelde |pg||
nt|marlowepi: or by E on another day. if it is another day, the heart king could be in the S hand|pg||
nt|christinas: so when pairs play different nt-openings, you are almost sure to have swings during a relatively long match|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jcwla: Well, I think E's sequence was reasonable, show some extras (slam is possible opp some 4@D hands there), then pull back.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I am all wrong It is N to lead|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: my principle against suit part scores where there is unlikely to be anything to spare is to not get busy |pg||
nt|snorris:  this should make|pg||
nt|lestergold: communications between the defnders are fotunately not too ood|pg||
nt|lestergold: good|pg||
nt|cindy:  would have been easy with a @d lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: somewhat odd silence on first round by N, who is usually a forward bidder|pg||
nt|snorris:  yes..a good 4 card suit|pg||
nt|snorris:  in @hs|pg||
nt|lestergold: i overcall a heart on first round in case my partner is on lead and other reasons|pg||
nt|cindy:  now will declarer think its possible for W to have singleton @d ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W bidding would be 100% for me if NV, but vul more questionable. could go for several hundred against nothing even undoubled, and possession of spades may buy you time--less urgent ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: to bid first round|pg||
nt|cindy:  he can always get rid of losing @d later but might not realize there is no hurry|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|lestergold: Hi olks sorry late |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm inconsistent|pg||
nt|lestergold: more reasonable than some weve seen today i agree|pg||
nt|ady: cards lay well   spade finesse on  Q10 hearts doubleton with north   and diamonds 3-3|pg||
nt|vugraphzyy: control in cl  - and two aces for hearts|pg||

nt|roswolf: c'est la vie|pg||

pc|d3|nt|ritong: i will spare you my usual titade about raptor:)|pg||

nt|lestergold: well here a dull ll tricks will be made |pg||

pc|dA|nt|lestergold: the risks of NOT biodding with north's hand are arguably much greater|pg||

pc|h4|nt|benno:  maybe he should have doubled and then bid 3@h over 3@d|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||

mc|10|nt|benno:  which is not a good contract by the way :)|pg||
nt|nielsbio: Appeal: The MI got NS to misread the distribution, and continue to 3S X, 3 down.|pg||

nt|ritong: yeah|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  avoid 3NT?|pg||
nt|roswolf: a potentially dangerous hand|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yep 5@D better contract|pg||
nt|ritong: 4@s has charm|pg||
nt|roswolf: also bidding a slam is all too possible|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 4 @S here brb cig br|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  3NT cold (if you know @d blocks)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well N/S likely to get overboard her|pg||
nt|ady: part score in spades for n/s here|pg||
nt|roswolf: and perhaps some fun here|pg||
nt|sybarra: yeah |pg||
mb|2D|nt|snorris:  looks like 3nt |pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 2 I was wondering if 3 nt made as it did in the other room |pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: yes even 6H has practical chances here:)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|rnmalik: good 4@H for EW|pg||
nt|lestergold: neither side can quite mak game here|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|cindy:  the other table has made one trick less on each hand played so far|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: doubt its easy to get there is it....W has to blast into it|pg||
nt|ady: e/w   should be in 4@S    likely 11 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and he did|pg||
nt|mmmakela: imaginative that 3 H|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N not a cake walk|pg||
nt|sfoxa: good stop - for "plus" record for NS|pg||
nt|lestergold: however anything could happen as defences may not be perfect|pg||
nt|vugraphzyy: just an ifo - board nr, 1 WILL count in this match !|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lestergold: I have to go sorry for brief visit but guests arrived early|pg||
nt|jcwla: 5@H not in the picture here, so double and pass the only choices and double it is -- though I wouldn't love being on lead.|pg||
nt|lestergold: bye all or now|pg||
nt|pelu: 2NT from DS = (15)16-18(19) :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jcwla: Bye for now Mike.|pg||

nt|roswolf: well west has 4@S in his locker surely|pg||
pc|d6|nt|nielsfoged:  @d8 a beauty|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|sybarra: again a black ace in a friendly place,  (@S this time)|pg||
nt|lestergold: Not a hand here to povide much work for three or so commentators|pg||
nt|marlowepi: EW make 4S if S cashes both clubs instead of leading small at trick 2|pg||
nt|lestergold: at these colours i do not see e/w risking defending|pg||
nt|roswolf: but bd 1 was flat!!:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 1 was thrown out |pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: without a heart lead  possible to make 13 tricks with ruffing diamond finesse|pg||
nt|monsted: King of dia whas the best lead - now it is agaion :)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|nielsfoged:  Money in the Bank?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: nooooooooooooo|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|rnmalik: This board will hurt|pg||
nt|monsted: lol no - looks like 11-13 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: and i dont think any risk whatsoever trying for it|pg||
nt|lestergold: kind of hand west has where he knows that two spades may stand up and his opartner may find his void but cannot be sure|pg||
pc|cK|nt|pelu: I donmt know what S had for dinner - but it most have bene very special :):)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: got the H shift N wanted|pg||
nt|snorris:  so 4. suit is gf|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  still mayb too long way to 9|pg||
nt|cindy:  lots of combined hcp but not so many tricks|pg||
nt|snorris:  well Boysen has a natural lead..|pg||
nt|lestergold: entry probs are such that declarer unlikely to have the luxury of playing the hearts for 4 tricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why not 3C by S instead of 2N?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|roswolf: west did well not to havehad a punt now|pg||
nt|cindy:  good question, marshall|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  would have better chances in N|pg||
nt|cindy:  why is that ?  isnt J of @d lead just as scary ?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 6 @C ?|pg||
nt|ady: could make 9 tricks   attack diamonds next   or hearts|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mmmakela: now only -1|pg||
nt|mmmakela: or 6 @D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: looks better for everyone in the Times if they can report that the result was based on the normal number of boards|pg||
nt|roswolf: west has a deathwish - his bidding is illogical|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: better lead small at trick 2|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont blame west has to take insurance|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at these colors I think S has a close decision as to whether or not to compete over 3C|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|nielsfoged:  yes, but @d block|pg||
nt|lestergold: but how is declafrer going to come to nine tricks?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sure, it isscary, but as it turns out it cant hurt you|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  not likely|pg||
nt|cindy:  scary for halloween|pg||
nt|marlowepi: "better chances in N" mention better chances to make, not to have a sacre-free ride:)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ritong: not very convincing, though|pg||
nt|roswolf: but east fell into the trap|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  I think most of us would have ended up this way?|pg||
nt|lestergold: hes already lost a spade cant develop hearts without losing 2 hearts and cant develop clubs without similar|pg||
pc|h2|nt|marlowepi: of course, even then S might find wrong shift, esp if N gives SP for D|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|sybarra: website I have:  http://www2.bridge.dk/Default.aspx?ID=409|pg||
nt|monsted: 12 tricks by ruffing out the diam|pg||
nt|cindy:  dress up like J of @d|pg||
nt|mmmakela: phone brb|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ritong: mm..|pg||
nt|lestergold: even if he double dummies the diamodn and why should he, i cant see 9 tricks|pg||
nt|snorris:  if south goes for @cs now he can win|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a one-eyed jack. film was directed by brando too, only one he ever directed i think|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|pc|d3|pg||
nt|monsted: and now 11|pg||
nt|lestergold: and as w e can see 4s may and WILL make now!!|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: not clear whether the successfrul line for 12 tricks was better odds here|pg||
nt|cindy:  you are having a groundhog moment, marshall|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the point is not about defending in 4S, it is about the way W got there|pg||
pc|d4|nt|pelu: here u see the problem with signals - if u signal distribution East no that there are no @C-ruff in Dummy - if u signal for high cards pd dont kniw the distribution|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mmmakela: or -2|pg||
nt|roswolf: west may now come up smelling of roses|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ritong: i would offer my @ds, and if opener is not interested, he falls back on 4 NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup dangerous for experienced bidders - novices would have done better on this hand|pg||
nt|mmmakela: think W has a clear @C 2 to play on the lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub6/Turneringer/KampResultat637.html  updated after round 5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for example, facing:  Qx   KQxxxx   Qx   xxx, which is a pretty grotty multi at these colors|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|nt|cindy:  there is that scary J !|pg||
nt|sfoxa: yes, hard for E to lead @c|pg||
pc|h8|nt|lestergold: he made the right bid geoff|pg||
nt|roswolf: cant argue with success|pg||
nt|lestergold: and defenders found the wrong defence|pg||
nt|sybarra: can declarer "see" it |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|sfoxa: 6 in minor looks good, definitely, but hard to reach. |pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, N can take comfort in the fact that S wasnt finding the winning shift anyway, and S can take comfort in the fact that game was cold after N failure to lead a small card for ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the ruff|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|pg||
nt|ady: anoeast needed to hold up A@D    now 10 tricks|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
mc|7|nt|pelu: 3@C would work here - but could also help opp to find the setting lead - so 2-way|pg||
nt|benno:  yes sure|pg||
nt|benno:  but if E has no clear lead in @c or @d she would often prefer to lead @h I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzyz: Peter was thrilled with the lead and Dorthe is telling Peter to remember this board next time she doesn't lead his suit.|pg||
nt|benno:  so yes it's a help, but I think it would help partner more than opponents|pg||
nt|pelu: IN CR both N and S had "bad" values @HK and @HQ - so both underbid a little|pg||
nt|benno:  haha|pg||

nt|roswolf: another hand full of possibilities|pg||
nt|rnmalik: another action board|pg||
nt|lestergold: a roland deal here|pg||

mb|p|nt|ritong: yes niels|pg||
nt|lestergold: wnow why did i say that?|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|nt|ritong: as said, 4 NT spot remains possible|pg||

nt|marlowepi: actually dont even need D ten|pg||
nt|cindy:  N will be in love with her hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: club or no trump partial for N/s|pg||
mb|1S|nt|roswolf: i would have bid 1@S as west i confess|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi nils|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|sybarra: results: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub6/KlubTurn.html|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: looks clearcut, for sevral reasons|pg||
nt|lestergold: Roland loves deals like this|pg||
nt|sfoxa: W knows partner's suit, will he lead it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: even without heart honor lead, could discard a D on 3rd heart|pg||
nt|ady: e/w  have a tight 4@H|pg||
nt|mmmakela: tough 4 H here|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: frigidon any reasonable line|pg||
pc|h8|nt|roswolf: WOW GOING FOR THE THROAT|pg||
nt|lestergold: the lead wont hurt|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ady: n/s can make 2/@H|pg||
pc|hT|nt|christinas: EW struggling to find the best place to play|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @S might have been best |pg||
nt|roswolf: south hoping pard has his bidding - which he does of course|pg||
nt|christinas: hm, this board looks dangerous. Both N and S have max for their bid. 4 spades always makes and shouldn't be difficult to bid|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|ritong: first reason, ofc, is that you can have a @s game or slam, even playing a strong @c system|pg||
nt|roswolf: north to bid again - surely not|pg||
nt|lestergold: anyone tell me free virtual Danish pastry  for first one to tell me|pg||
nt|mmmakela: might not be easy|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ady: 3 level looks 1 too high for both sides|pg||
nt|lestergold: and this is a typical outcome for a roland favourite hand type|pg||
nt|monsted: is nt this a winner|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|lestergold: no entrants to my comp?|pg||
nt|monsted: 2 loser in hearts 1 in dia and 1 in clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: high card points distributed 20/20|pg||
pc|s6|nt|christinas: this is trickt because of the @s split.|pg||
nt|sybarra: big card is 8 of spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: draw trumps play spade to K and run ten of spades defence gets a spade a club two hearts but NO diamonds|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1C-2D as a good club raise works pretty reasonably, but the flip side of the usual method is to use 1D-3C as an equivalent raise of 1D, and that is problematic due to the space ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: consumed. an interesting compromise is to play that 2D over EITHER minor is that kind of raise, but such an arrangement requires more detailed infrastructure|pg||
pc|sT|nt|christinas: You have to play A and small to the ten to avoid 3 @s losers|pg||
nt|roswolf: incroyable|pg||
nt|ritong: second reason is that you tend to obstruct the bidding when hand belongs to opponents if it does not cost you a penalty too often|pg||
pc|sK|nt|marlowepi: undoubtedly N would have liked to do more, but the cuebid already puts them at 4H so she made the practical underbid|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ady: can make with A@D right for a spde discard   and clubs 3-3|pg||
pc|s8|nt|rnmalik: Lead favourable|pg||
nt|sybarra: but you will lose 3 @S that way |pg||
nt|sybarra: need ot lead low from dummy I think |pg||
nt|sybarra: then towards the 10 |pg||
nt|christinas: nonsens, S of course always gets 3, sry|pg||
nt|sybarra: so 3 sp and a @H,  = -1 |pg||
nt|ady: alyes sorry  3@H a make|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|nielsfoged:  EW must be careful|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ady: yes|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Very aggressive invite by Kofoed at the other table, but it paid off|pg||

pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|c7|pg||
nt|thorvald: But this time I don't agree with the negative view, i think its worth 3@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The intermediates in clubs are valuable|pg||
nt|benno:  the problem with the East hand is the @s bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If West had  xxxx  in clubs, you would all say how great it was that they stopped short of game|pg||

nt|mmmakela: no!!!!|pg||

nt|snorris:  a rear convention|pg||
nt|cindy:  at all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he has 2 hearts, so very descriptive|pg||
nt|cindy:  lolol|pg||
nt|cindy:  sorry to be so blunt|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it might show 4 spades and longer minor rather than michaels|pg||
nt|sybarra: IF they get into the bidding |pg||
nt|roswolf: well they must bid now|pg||
nt|lestergold: well east shouldnt sell out to 2S|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind you not clear what action he should take|pg||

mb|3H|nt|nielsfoged:  Dbl 1st round anyone with W?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why wouldnt W bid directly over 1N?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3c a reasonable stab it will work cos pard wuill 'correct' to 3h|pg||
mb|p|nt|christinas: On the 6@s hand Århus got 3 imps - the contract was 5@sXX in the open room...|pg||

nt|cindy:  yeh well   i still wouldnt like it|pg||
nt|lestergold: blunt is good Cindy|pg||
nt|mmmakela: Dorthe's and Peter's son is in the audience, Hi Martin!|pg||
nt|sfoxa: or may be it's normal to open vulnerable Multi with 5 points only?|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 3 was a push in 4 @SX -500|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mmmakela: trouble ahead maybe|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: any chance for 3NT by EW has a play|pg||

nt|cindy:  u mean smoking a blunt ?|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  @ss are good enough for @c now|pg||

nt|lestergold: no being honest direct blunt etc is good i dont know about smoking i dont smoke|pg||
mb|p|nt|nielsfoged:  @sQ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: small slam on club position      cant go wrong with  QX onside|pg||
nt|ady: if diamond is not cashed there are 13 tricks here|pg||
nt|monsted: I dont understand Frederik - when 4 clubs he must follow with 4 NT - only when 3 clubs whitout the Q it is bad|pg||
nt|pelu: what is going on in S? - He could open 1Nt or bid 1NT in sekund round - but 2@C????|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i prefer double--or possibly1S==with W hand also, but maybe EW dont play equal level conversion|pg||
nt|rnmalik: another 3NT|pg||
pc|c5|nt|roswolf: i would have been tempted|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  me too|pg||

nt|ady: might make 4@S     |pg||
nt|sfoxa: yes, if E finds @d lead|pg||
nt|christinas: well, they play very aggressive overcalls, so N had a huge max for his 1@s bid. On the other hand it was difficult for him to see a S hand good enough to make game without showing ...|pg||
nt|christinas: a good @s raise by bidding 2@h instead of 2@s|pg||
pc|c2|nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well these two are obviously not pupils of Roland|pg||
nt|lestergold: he will be very disspointed|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|mmmakela: he always is......|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh why didnt someone tell me|pg||
nt|pelu: no but 2@c?|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  yes a foreseeable situation after the "expected" 1@s|pg||
nt|mmmakela: bad bidding got what it deserved imo|pg||
nt|pelu: even bigger problem if pd bid 1@H - now I dont like 1NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: well if 2s is defeated he will be vindicated for his conservatism|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe now |pg||
nt|sybarra: I assume 2 @d was game force |pg||
nt|rnmalik: have 12 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4th suit forcing |pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  how would you bid after 1NT-opening (15-17)?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|nt|rnmalik: 5@C+5@H+1@S+1@D=12|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe on their way,  but W have to be dragged along,  his spade suit is not "robust" |pg||
nt|jcwla: The double gained 2 IMPs for N/S on 5.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: you mean all these Waldks? they are all the one and only same person??|pg||
nt|rnmalik: strange first the 2@S and now 4@S|pg||
nt|mmmakela: guess 3 dias call indicated 5 spades|pg||
nt|sfoxa: that's more intersting contract than 3nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: nope he stayed at home - but 3@C on this hand was sounder than his 3@S call a few hands ago |pg||
nt|lestergold: and actually 2S looks like going one off here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E has good enough defense that it is far from obvious to enter with his hand--with his uglkyu shape he could easily be truning a plus into a minus. in contrasts, it is easy for W ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: to bid over 1N|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|christinas: i think it is a potential loss for one-eyed|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|nt|mmmakela: can still make after dias lead;3x hearts|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry about the typing. i need a secretary|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|nielsfoged:  expecting fit in at least 1 black suit|pg||
nt|pelu: better play 1D4 - now pd is endplayed|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sybarra: maybe west leading not being dragged |pg||
nt|ady: problem i is east can get a club ruff together with 2 trump tricks   and A@D|pg||
pc|cA|pc|hJ|nt|mmmakela: 1@D-2@D seems ok to me even with 16 points|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no offers from specs yet:(|pg||
nt|roswolf: unlucky:(|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|sybarra: 6 @C not a bad spot |pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  EW gained 5 imps for missing 3NT in  3!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We have results!   http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub6/Turneringer/Resultat633.html   All favourites won big in round 1|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  I think the 15 nice hcps can be used for opening 1@d and rebidding 3@d - but depends one style|pg||
mc|10|nt|sybarra: I was looking at nt also |pg||
nt|rnmalik: good slam, in duplicate|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1S|mb|3S|an|alerted|mb|4S|nt|benno:  again a passive decision in the other room by south|pg||

pc|sA|nt|pelu: u could also take the money against 4@S, X = 500|pg||

pc|c8|pc|s7|pc|s3|pg||

nt|nielsfoged:  3@d|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  but he is too old?|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i would too|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 4H|pg||
nt|lestergold: well altho 4h can bemade N/S i dont expect them, to be in it|pg||
nt|jcwla: The intermediates definitely came into play there.|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  maybe the bid is 1NT 2nd round even if it shows just 12-14?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: why not 2@D?|pg||
nt|sfoxa: but this time - 3nt for sure :-) |pg||
nt|rnmalik: 9 top as we count and see|pg||
nt|roswolf: another possible fun hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 4@S NS, interesting hand otherwise|pg||
nt|pelu: when u support on a singleton u can also open 1NT on a 6 card minor|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I once commentated in a 8 board match where all 8 deals were played in 3 nt|pg||
nt|ady: likely 3NT n/s|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5C needs accurate bidding tho|pg||
mb|1C|nt|nielsfoged:  sorry!|pg||
nt|lestergold: what about 4S?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2s and a dim and maybe no diamonds??|pg||
nt|lestergold: to lose depending|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  Easy 3NT NS LOL!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: one should prepare for best case scenarios too in the bidding, and usually best case scenario for overcall is partner has a fit. If N was not willing to show extra strength over a ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: spade raise, maybe she should have bid 1N instead of 1S|pg||
mb|1S|nt|christinas: N didn't bid 1nt - they might not get there now|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I will bid 2@S after forced pass by N|pg||
nt|sybarra: how many spades to you bid as S ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: is 2 @S strong or weak?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or just a good suit?|pg||
nt|monsted: how many clubs from East |pg||
nt|jcwla: Lots of possible contracts here, from 4@SX to a N/S (save?).|pg||
nt|lestergold: like for example n orth opening it?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not necessarily. i have seen people get to 5C in one bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: i beat u to it Marshall|pg||
nt|marlowepi: exactly mike|pg||
nt|roswolf: not the best time for this gadget|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there never is one|pg||
nt|sybarra: no likely to be played from S |pg||
nt|lestergold: souith will stand it!|pg||
nt|sybarra: *now|pg||
mb|d|nt|rnmalik: weak but good balancing|pg||
nt|ritong: not fair of you to remind geoff about his age|pg||
nt|roswolf: i am definitite old but not too old - and neither is he!|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|nielsfoged:  3@d keeps your skin smooth|pg||
nt|marlowepi: showing the 2 of clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: and east will lead hearts|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for me this and Muiderberg are tied  for silliest gadget in common use|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4th highest works|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: oh|pg||
nt|lestergold: and 5th best too|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok 3/5|pg||
mb|p|nt|nielsfoged:  if you open 1d with down to 10 and distribution, these 15 hcps seems to give a too wide interval|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well-reasoned lead|pg||
nt|ady: looks clear for south to bid 3NT|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ady: 4@S  not makable on a club lead and forces|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so then we all agree on 1 nt opening, case closed|pg||
nt|sfoxa: special deals? |pg||
nt|sfoxa: or nt-loving randomizer  )))|pg||
nt|mmmakela: even my grandma wd bid 3 nt as S|pg||
nt|ady: 11 tricks |pg||
nt|sybarra: I bid on as S |pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: I like direct 5|pg||
nt|sfoxa: how do you say? coffee-board?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not that 1N is a thing of beauty, but i like it better than 1S followed by pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: DBL only strong call as I play|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm well south likes his shapely 3 count|pg||
nt|monsted: 3 or 4 clubs from East would have been better|pg||
nt|lestergold: the ruff is in effect going to be with east's money|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: @D shift here.|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: might make 5 here|pg||
pc|sA|nt|christinas: this is in my opinion an example of why if ofgten doesn't pay not to bid in bridge. I had bid on both the N and S hand. None of them did, and now they missed not only a partscore, ...|pg||
nt|christinas: but a game|pg||
nt|ritong: is it undiscreet to ask you about yourse, niels?|pg||
nt|sybarra: but 4 should be easy |pg||
nt|christinas: very pessimistic bid - again|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ady: yes    this looks to be a make      fortunate diamond position|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mmmakela: dbl showing pos hand|pg||
nt|christinas: i don't understand how he could resist the temptation of bidding 5 @c|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|sybarra: as I had conversation with several specs,  this is all by agreement,   some play 2 @S stronger than this hand |pg||
nt|roswolf: making the position crystal clear|pg||
nt|marlowepi: unlucky--unlucky that a cow flew by when we were filling out our convention card|pg||
nt|lestergold: the convention is fine providing you stick to it north had one club too many|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes it is fine if you love playing 3N from the wrong side on a regular basis|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rnmalik: true|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: surely not?|pg||
nt|snorris:  good result for e-w as n-s have at least 4 @cs|pg||
nt|lestergold: is tis correct operator?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyy: yes|pg||
nt|ady: thats what usually happens to me   I lead something against 3NT and opps play is straight back|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|lestergold: a very lucky contract indeed with favourable red high card positions|pg||
nt|pelu: some would bid 2@h in East - (making)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub6/Turneringer/KampResultat638.html  for results and standings after round 6|pg||
nt|christinas: but he probably thinks his partner has a 12-14 nt - but still 5@c could easily be right|pg||
nt|marlowepi: personally i would bid 2S with S hand to show the club fit & offensive potential immediately. when opps have spades the other suits are the same, and when you have this hand & ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: auction goes 1C-1S partner almost always has real clubs|pg||
nt|christinas: 1@c opening can be only 3 card @c, so I would always show 4 @h by D|pg||
nt|sybarra: S tried to get the @H suit in play |pg||
nt|marlowepi: neg double is not as well-prepared as 2S. if LHO raises to 4S--hardly unforeseeable--S is poorly placed after a neg X|pg||
pc|s8|nt|nielsfoged:  too old to boogie- but would consider opening 3NT|pg||
nt|jcwla: E/W failed by one in 3NT in the OR on 7, so 12 back to Blakset to nose out in front 19-15.|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s6|nt|sfoxa: S succeded with lead-showing bid. how ofter would you lead Qx to strong hand?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: unluckily for no gain this time the way cards are|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|sfoxa: 12 tricks now|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sybarra: I agree Christna esp. in imps |pg||
nt|christinas: I think 2@s should be strong, there is no reason to preempt 2@s when you can just pass the hand out|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|nt|rnmalik: 1@S shows weak and 5 cards where as 2@S 6+|pg||
nt|lestergold: the bidding marking the diamonds of course|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry i made a mistake i se that the 2d bid was club support not a natural bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: however entries do not give declarer the option of doubnle diamond finesses|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s2|nt|mmmakela: Fully understand W's timeout, he can't see the cards as we do|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|s7|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|christinas: But he could also consider D the second time|pg||

nt|ady: n/s need to stay low with their 24 hcp and heart fit|pg||

nt|mmmakela: can they avoid 4 H here|pg||
nt|lestergold: cards are spitting here against E/W could get overboard|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry, crashed. probably best to play for 22 hearts by ruffing high & leading another high trump, as i think mike was implying|pg||
nt|marlowepi: to each his own. thought some of you folks had learned a bit of french since 1066:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: what does that mean? you are a gouty old fool?|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: and the hearts are so weak they are scarcely worth mentioning. they rank below spades anyway. and you have a good diamond suit which may provide heart discards if you play in ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: clubs, but if you are in hearts u r stuck with them|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mmmakela: wd|pg||
nt|ady: well stopped    |pg||
nt|ady: 3 hearts pushy|pg||
nt|roswolf: i once played a system where 3@C was used instead of 3nt and it did have its successes - 3@C - 7NT WAS ONE|pg||
nt|lestergold: I thought you lot had learned sometihng about an english sense of humour at some point|pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: well 9 card fit combined 24 hcp and they have chosen a good moment  to vote conservative|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa: and S has to accept - with points in @d|pg||
nt|ady: you were right Markku    too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: a misfit, W could pass 2@H|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  That could be a championships match - both sides combines bold attitudes with high skills|pg||
nt|lestergold: i was Marshall of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: many would invite w W hand|pg||
nt|pelu: 6@S down on a @C-lead|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  and also on a trump lead|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@H = 4. suit, 3@S = slaminvit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well that would get 7N played from the right side  :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: nah limeys dont have a sense of humour!?|pg||
nt|sybarra: taking advantage of vulnerability here maye to no avail |pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|nt|christinas: no, I think 3@h is too aggressive by W. He has a good hand, but he is vul, so if 2@d shows 5-5 he has already bid his hand once|pg||
nt|lestergold: well two 3 card qs to the umph needs circumspection/ devaluation milton opvervlaues these things|pg||
nt|pelu: West has some very good cards|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry East|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  but may win on a red lead even if trump shift when in on @dA|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Good pass by S and resultantly game missed by EW|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|marlowepi: not like you merely to imply:)|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|christinas: they bid the wrong games at this table, although this could be a fine contract if the @s were not badly placed. Not at all unreasonable|pg||
nt|christinas: Board 6 was a surprising gain for one-eyed. They missed 4@s but at the other table NS were in 3nt without a @d stopper|pg||
nt|sybarra: E is hoping pard brought a trick also |pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think i have been frozen for several minutes|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: defence has got off to a good lead     |pg||
nt|sfoxa: good start for defence|pg||
nt|ady: might try a diamond fineese in desperation|pg||
nt|mmmakela: if play strong club it's clear to bid 3 H in nat I'd just bid 2 H, if pd won't make a move then usually ok|pg||

mb|p|pc|hK|nt|benno:  I also prefer to start with a double|pg||
pc|h3|nt|thorvald: i would bid like Jørgen Hansen, but I'm old too|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The thing is that if you bid 4@S on your first turn, Dorthe would not be able to double for penalties|pg||
nt|chick: in this case, true, but in the long run, best?  |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|s3|nt|thorvald: yes, but we might find our club-fit by doubling|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d9|pc|d4|pc|sT|pg||
nt|thorvald: the double is just an imp (or is it 2?)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He is going 2 down now|pg||
nt|benno:  innja|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's very expensive|pg||
nt|benno:  ups|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|pc|h8|nt|benno:  he can squezze W|pg||
pc|d6|pg||

pc|dK|pc|dT|pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||
pc|h9|nt|Walddk2: Not if Dorthe continues diamonds|pg||
pc|s8|pc|hJ|pc|h7|pg||
pc|sK|nt|pelu: West will be squeezed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: She gave him the tempo for the squeeze|pg||

nt|nielsfoged:  It will be interesting to see the results from all matches of Board  5 - does anyone have the methods to avoid 3 NT and reach 5@d? - Most likely would be the strong 1@c pairs (even better Relay-Precision)|pg||
nt|lestergold: do not understand|pg||
nt|monsted: must be !! ??|pg||
nt|lestergold: two asafe ways to rry for an overtrick and instead tries for one offski and succeeds|pg||
nt|jcwla: W happy to defend 1NT and even happier to defend 3NT if it comes to that.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|pelu: the bidding ask for @S-lead, so N only lead @C if he has a good @C-lead|pg||
nt|mmmakela: but would he lead one from dbltn looking at S's hand|pg||
nt|murat: baþlýyo|pg||
nt|marlowepi: strange play and defense on Bioard 1 in other room. maybe that is why it will count--some sadist wants the details published:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: spades breaking badly makes this a challenge |pg||
nt|marlowepi: hard luck in 4S here|pg||
nt|christinas: some interesting hands here - 4@s is down because of the @s split|pg||
nt|sybarra: in 4 @S I mean |pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: did this really take place?|pg||
nt|monsted: looks like a big wictory for BK Nord|pg||
nt|vugraphzyy: he was playing 3 H !!|pg||
nt|sybarra: reminding you that bd 1 is thrown out |pg||
nt|sybarra: X looks like singlesuited bid |pg||
nt|rnmalik: I think we will some action in this board|pg||
nt|rnmalik: see|pg||
mb|p|an|forc RD|nt|marlowepi: presumably this shows a onesuiter|pg||
nt|christinas: no, it is penalty here against weak nt- then he will just bid @s the next round|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ritong: well we did suggest a possibility|pg||
nt|ritong: first, you give up on puppet stayman|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what if there IS no next round and declarer makes 580?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ah he is taking advantage of EW methods|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he is guaranteed a next round|pg||
nt|christinas: then it is bad luck, but as you can see his partner pulls - they D weak nts with 13+|pg||
mb|d|nt|marlowepi: VG operator said no|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ritong: second, you bid your suits|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  yes but none of the players heard that|pg||
nt|mmmakela: YES peter|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have 25 hcp  and east a good 6 card heart suit   but again likely to go down in game|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: simple bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: ah hah that explainis it oyall|pg||
nt|vugraphzyy: he thourght|pg||
nt|monsted: WAS plaing or ? |pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  2@h is probably showing @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: yeh sure we can se that|pg||
mb|d|nt|christinas: now they may avoid 4@s, that would be sensational to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: and third, if opener is not interested, he comes back to NT at the 4 level|pg||
mb|3H|nt|lestergold: weve all done it|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  may end in 4@H   which could be difficult     3NT  looks more likely to make|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Next match in 30 minutes: Blakset vs Århus BK|pg||
nt|ady: clb lead    cuts of trick supply|pg||
nt|marlowepi: probably showing a sounder raise to 2S than a dirct 2S|pg||
nt|lestergold: a very poor game|pg||
nt|lestergold: I thnk West may have downgraded his Qx of hearts on the aucion|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at these colors i would judge the E hand to be very marginal for that action in a 2-way structure, and W also has some soft bits|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  but neither action is a distortion|pg||
nt|marlowepi: where i come from that is a 1H opener. are NS using canape?|pg||
nt|lestergold: i do not follow the logic here why open the shorter suit when you can show the actual distribuition by reversing ith this strength|pg||
nt|christinas: oh my god...870 coming up...|pg||
mb|p|nt|christinas: It works fine in this case, but I would be worried about the 2 little clubs - if I had the same hand with 4333 it is another story|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Pure HCP points 15-17 + 10 and 2 Ts|pg||
nt|ritong: here, opener gladly accepts ( via 4@s) and 5@d is the final contract|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  problem is that most of us do not have a natural @d-bid after 2NT- or 2@c-openings|pg||
nt|rnmalik: so may finesses and 6 makes|pg||
nt|lestergold: but the lead couldnt be more helpful|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  No I just try to find explanation of why he didn't choose the (almost) obvious @c return|pg||
nt|pelu: keep looking :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: can they stay low here?|pg||
nt|christinas: no|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think that mainly in bridge--as in life--we make our own luck. i dont see the advantage of doubling on S hand. if spades are coming in they are running, and if not they could ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: make 2 redoubled overtricks|pg||
nt|christinas: 710?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: still may have difficult making|pg||
nt|sfoxa: looks like first imps for OEJ|pg||
nt|mmmakela: finally 2 imps to OEJ|pg||
nt|sfoxa: and what will N lead?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lestergold: i must admit wild horses would nt have ;produced this lead from me|pg||
mb|p|nt|monsted: another 12 imps to BK Nord in board 8 ! - 6 spades bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm didnt seem to work|pg||
nt|christinas: ok, now!|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa: little bit of help comes|pg||
nt|ady: lead ok for declarer|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now might make|pg||
nt|lestergold: i mean strong enough for a jump shift on second round then strong enuf for a reverse|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe S would need a 2-loser hand instead of 3-loser to do that|pg||
nt|sybarra: look like take out of 2 @s but now what?|pg||
nt|christinas: can he pass?|pg||
nt|christinas: now his partner must have shown a weak hand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|christinas: W has a huge hand, wonder why he wanted his partner to Rd?|pg||
nt|christinas: Why not bid 2@h?|pg||
nt|sybarra: might be system |pg||
nt|marlowepi: or at least bid 3H over 2S. unless pass-and-pull shows a stronger hand. but then in that case shouldnt the next pass be forcing??|pg||
nt|christinas: anyway, it is hard not to imagine this a good board dor one-eyed. 140 plus|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ritong: mind you, your question was " does anyone have methods..."|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am not sure about this line. if W feels like assuming from the lead that N does not have both top hearts (very reasonable but not guaranteed), then he will have all the rest of ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the artillery. and this lead is surely a singleton. so it seems right toi me to win the ace in dummy and lead a heart to the card of your choice. you cant ruff with spade ace and ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: also use it to draw a trump|pg||
nt|pelu: @cK in trick 2 work better|pg||
nt|christinas: yes, it is strange|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: a club return might have been stronger but the clubs can still be cut off|pg||
nt|ady: west must remove club when in with A@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: west cannot be bl;amed for playing pard for a stifff space|pg||
nt|lestergold: i mjean why on earth would he expect his pard to resolve a qx position against an opp'sbid suit|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  S in open room may not have agreed fully with his partners lead and continuation against 2@s (@cA and @h5 to @hT and @hQ)!|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mmmakela: good lead although not my choise|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes this board will be a success story. but sort of an embarrassing one i would think|pg||
nt|sybarra: highly likely the OR will be in 4 @S -1 or 2|pg||
nt|christinas: but of course he hasn't made it yet, the @c don't break|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would be proud to be in 4S down 1 on this hand|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|nt|ritong: i do, and i am not alone|pg||
nt|lestergold: here comes the club?|pg||
nt|roswolf: south needs to take care here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe S wanted to attract a spade lead in case the opps bought it for 3C or something|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: heart switch best|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: i think holding strong hand with two boss suirts more important to bid accurately|pg||
nt|lestergold: now declarer is going to get tapped|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lestergold: i mean he better not have any fantasies about promoting trump by playing a spade|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: sometimes i do too|pg||
nt|ady: still now a club after A@D ok|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh derar|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|sK|nt|nielsfoged:  yes an my bet is that at most 1-2 of the 12 pairs bidding  5 will have that capacity (I actrually expect 12/12 3NT-1)|pg||
nt|ady: squeeze on declarer|pg||
nt|marlowepi: club ace queen and small is marked|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d4|nt|jcwla: 9 a push at 2NT-2.|pg||
nt|mmmakela: how to get the 8th|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: before trumps i meant|pg||
nt|christinas: so unless the defence helps he3 might go down|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mmmakela: still needs to guess clubs I suppose|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d6|nt|rnmalik: +1|pg||
nt|sfoxa: now N has to give @h trick - other play is more costly|pg||
nt|mmmakela: surely H 10 now|pg||
nt|ady: might play club|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|lestergold: i can understand hiom not expecting partner to hopld six clubs which he might have led from in preference to Qx of spades|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  a 25 imp swing when not returning @c - the other table stayed in 4@s (13 tricks - @d duck to singleton K)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: cant go down with proper play|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|nt|ritong: admittedly, on bd 5 west has a decision to make on 3 NT|pg||
pc|d2|nt|roswolf: you might well be right|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|nt|jcwla: OR is finished.  Welcome to all who have joined us from in there.|pg||
nt|roswolf: south is in control|pg||
nt|lestergold: burn's law crollary- in the endgame it is better not have less trumops than the  opposition|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|pg||
mc|9|nt|mmmakela: S10 now|pg||
nt|christinas: great fun, now he has to play @h otherwise W will be squeezed!|pg||
nt|christinas: apparently he tried to cash the A of @d|pg||
nt|sybarra: the 4 @C on bd 8  another + score as the OR tried to play 6 @C|pg||
nt|vugraphzyy: no west disc a club !|pg||

nt|roswolf: hmm the 4-4 heart fit not mentioned in the other room|pg||
nt|lestergold: probably a premature attempt to cash clubs for some strange reason|pg||
nt|monsted: last chance for Blakset to get imps|pg||
nt|jcwla: The last two were @S partials in the OR, we'll see what unfolds here.|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  Good result for OEJ in Open|pg||
nt|mmmakela: and some more here?|pg||
nt|lestergold: lucky to get away with it on this particular hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: the ace of clubs in N (stopping clubs once) saved declarer |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: what a misfit here|pg||
nt|mmmakela: actually any card was fine|pg||
nt|pelu: so the champs only down 7 after a gift of 25 IMP :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not a big deal, N-S can make 4@C|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 35 to 2 in 10 boards, are outplayed|pg||
nt|mmmakela: meaning after the C K play|pg||
nt|ady: likely to reach 4@S as in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|nielsfoged:  4@h seems ok|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT or 4@H  both making games for n/s     west may get into some trouble in spades if bidding high|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  5@c|pg||
nt|sfoxa: uh-hu, i wonder, if 6@d bid as attack or defence?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|pelu: close to a flat board 100 or 130|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You sure?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: north wondering which major S holds|pg||
nt|roswolf: interesting result from the other rooom but no double no trouble|pg||
mb|d|nt|monsted: af in OR|pg||
nt|lestergold: well west has stuck neck out a little more conservatively here than in the open room|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I don't think you can make 5|pg||
mb|2H|nt|roswolf: at least north didnt open here|pg||
mb|3D|nt|nielsfoged:  no you are right|pg||
nt|lestergold: dont think you can get rid of two spades in south's hand|pg||
nt|pelu: tell us how u make 11 tricks, Niels?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: looks like 3 losers to me|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  sorry|pg||
nt|mmmakela: has pretty good support for both|pg||
nt|mmmakela: needs H lead to beat|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That is the easy part when partner has 5+ spades|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But he may fancy 5@S|pg||
nt|christinas: again a funny result from the other room - NS only bid 4 clubs, and at the other table they were in 6 down 1...|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 4333 8 count,  sort of funny |pg||
nt|christinas: so twice NS in open have been too aggressive, NS too passive - but lucky|pg||
nt|christinas: too slow i am|pg||
mb|3S|nt|rnmalik: NT opening with stiff @SK was the reason in the OR|pg||
nt|roswolf: the offcentre 1nt in the other room didnt work too well|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 43o or so will give 9 imps to Blakset|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Which major to lead against 3NT is the question|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  I will absolutely NOT :)|pg||
nt|pelu: no Niels - u are welcome - now we are the clever ones :):)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: i guess bidding went 1 NT 3NT or something like that|pg||
nt|ady: unusual opening  West|pg||
mb|3N|nt|marlowepi: 3N needs spade lead, good chances|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: do you think 3NT has a chance played by W|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy:  what was opening 2@c on 8    the hand was pretty similiar to this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: simple auction here|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and correct|pg||
nt|ritong: oh we have the two rooms today, so we have auctions|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: wd N|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S looks a long way away now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: cold|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yep|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|ady: maybe not|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rnmalik: marked difference in bidding as compared with OR|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 3 nt better than 4 S|pg||
nt|christinas: well done|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  No one took your bet on 1NT-3NT, Henry?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mmmakela: 1 more to go, ty all and hope see u tomorrow!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: an uncomfortable but logical 3N bid. partner has a very strong hand and very likely to catch a heart honor|pg||
nt|christinas: strange not to bid 2@dby W in the ogther room instead of supporting @s right away|pg||
nt|christinas: you have 7 of them|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|nt|ritong: we did not yesterday|pg||
nt|ritong: no:(|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  not so easy to get the tempo, maybe would have been best chance to let the @c go?|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  (looks easy from here|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ady: Jepson did not ruff 3rd spade high enough on hand 10    got overruffed and East played a club   hence the result of 2 down|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you mean you would show 7 decent diamonds before supporting on a small doubleton, christina? how retro of you:):)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mmmakela: this has straight 4 losers|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sfoxa: but anyway - 4 imps for OEJ|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good defense|pg||
nt|ady: North will cash the 2 aces|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  back in tempo now?|pg||
nt|ritong: but if @d AK are not with @c Q, defense can certainly establish a @c, so your option looks better|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 6 IMPs I think|pg||
nt|ady: sit back and wait for 2 trump tricks|pg||
pc|hK|nt|nielsfoged:  they go on stealing imps|pg||
nt|mmmakela: ok last 1 coming up|pg||
nt|christinas: I assume it is because Peter Schaltz knows his wife is a better declarer than himself|pg||
nt|christinas: the worst is that @h block, but W doesn't know that...|pg||
nt|christinas: so he probably ducks one time|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: this will play nicely |pg||
nt|sybarra: that lead didnt hurt |pg||
pc|h9|nt|mmmakela: and Dorthe can see it to cash HA|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||

pc|sT|pc|c3|pc|d4|nt|nielsfoged:  y|pg||

pc|s8|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|benno:  declarer might try 3 rounds of spades from start|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Do they often open with 11, Martin?|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|d6|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|benno:  this vul, yes|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h9|pc|s4|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dT|pc|d2|nt|thorvald: Yes, it looks like BK Nord at the moment, and with a win for Århus here (21-9), they can even ignore the last round by getting 21 against "Viborg Esserner"  |pg||
nt|benno:  dummys hearts are to high, so he will be endplayed there to lead away from clubs|pg||

nt|benno:  me to :-)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I thought you were brought up in Aalborg|pg||

nt|roswolf: Niels Aagaard) for ensuring that this fine event is brought to BBO vugraph. Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentators Henri, Niels, Rashed and Roland for their wit and ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: perceptive comments and to our specs whose contributions keep us on our toes!|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  too much work in 4@s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4H down 1 a good save against 3N making on wrong lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe they start that way with 18-19 bal|pg||
nt|cindy:  yeh but she opened 1@d on 11|pg||
nt|lestergold: another dull 3n|pg||
nt|sfoxa: yes, 6 - I was wrong with counting:- 200 - 50 (not 300 - as it is).|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 27 IMPs = 22-8 VPs|pg||
nt|mmmakela: thx to Tom our splendid operator, Sveta and Rashed and all u kibs!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub6/Turneringer/KampResultat638.html  for results and standings after round 6|pg||
nt|ady: next hand the last of the set     thx all thx kibs|pg||
nt|roswolf: pooor decision that|pg||
mb|1N|nt|roswolf: this hand was fun in the other room|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But 11 was not balanced|pg||
nt|roswolf: last board now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: last board thanks all, but more coming soon|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|pelu: 11 was 2-2 in major|pg||
mb|p|nt|nielsfoged:  always difficult to play in 4th suit|pg||
nt|ady: seems 3@H has a play    went down in OR|pg||
nt|mmmakela: ty Tom our splendid operator, David,Sveta,kibs!|pg||
nt|sfoxa: seems, they finish with quiet partscore, like in OR|pg||
nt|ady: likely to  be a similar contract as OR    looks like a narrow win for Storeslemmen|pg||
nt|sybarra: back in about 10 minutes or so |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: this is last board of this set '|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 27 IMPs = 22-8 VPs at this point. Last board of the match now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks to Tom Nørgaard, our splendid operator in Århus|pg||
nt|ady: 8 tricks looks ok in spades|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and to our commentators: David, Mike, Nils and Markku|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  actually I think Knut did well to be just 1 down in 3@h|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  and 3rd hand with 18 incl Qx|pg||
nt|sybarra: not easy to stay out of 4 @H here |pg||
nt|sybarra: no matter what method you ue|pg||
nt|sybarra: *use|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk4: Rømer is not giving up|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our last match in about 15 minutes: One-Eyed Jacks vs BK Nord, 2nd against 1st. You can't ask for better timing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would be wanting this played by W. if no transfers, i would bid stayman hoping to get lucky. worst case scenario bid 4H later|pg||
pc|sA|nt|christinas: I think a welldeserved victory to Århus|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  3NT?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3@S surely|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Thanks all, this should be a flat board.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Next match in 20 minutes: Storeslemmen vs One-Eyed Jacks|pg||
nt|mmmakela: this shd be flat|pg||
nt|roswolf: lots of tricks now|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: Many thanks, to our excellent operator Tom Nørgaard.   .A job well done!|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  ..to be honest I never actually succeeded in that|pg||
nt|sfoxa: hm...|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|christinas: the missed slam and game made the big difference|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks also to my co commentator Rashed and Christiana. We appreciate your time, your insights |pg||
nt|rnmalik: Board 7 and 8 damaging for NS|pg||
nt|sybarra: Our gratitude to the Danish Bridge Federation and Jeppe G. Knappe and Niels Aagaard for bringing this wonderful tourney to BBO.  Much appreciated by bridge fans all over the world|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks also to our specs who give us helpful comments and some humor!|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but maybe they can manage it|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  minors are too awful|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  ...for 4@s|pg||
nt|ritong: talking about that, the problem arises when opàener has a big hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think there is a case for passing here|pg||
nt|ritong: and can t raise @ss too high|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  that would be a well-deserved 13 imps|pg||
nt|ritong: because it is 4th suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: may try 2nt|pg||
nt|ritong: a possibility is he uses an " impossible" 3@h bid|pg||
nt|ritong: to show 4@s and strong|pg||
nt|cindy:  i guess there is 1 card diff|pg||
nt|mmmakela: bye all see ya in 20 mins|pg||
nt|mmmakela: btw Storeslemmen=grand slam in danish|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe E wanted to shut out spades, but the relevance of that is only hypothetical. the desirability of right-siding 4H is under your nose|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: PS   Special thanks to Roland for his tireless efforts organizing the vugraph!|pg||
nt|lestergold: the interesting point here is the issue of overtricks|pg||
nt|cindy:  you dont like my boring questions ?   :)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|roswolf: intersesting henri|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  a little easier to pass when non-vuln|pg||
nt|mmmakela: The play will resume 9.30 Danish time tomorrow(remember to adjust your clocks for winter time!)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, but we have one more match today, Markku|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In 20 minutes|pg||
nt|ady: north must have presumed 4 carfds in clubs for the 1NT response|pg||
pc|d7|nt|nielsfoged:  wd EW|pg||
nt|roswolf: but a good stop|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good a misfit and well assessed|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  good lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  could he be 1 down?|pg||
nt|monsted: 4 spades looks like a winner|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR @S from N - decl played 3x@s and was endplayed in dummy - @h's blocked|pg||
nt|christinas: this will make now - only 3 losers|pg||
nt|sybarra: may take the club hook now |pg||
nt|pelu: to make u have to play @C in trick 3 - and do right|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You assume he will guess clubs, Christina|pg||
nt|sybarra: I do  |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Pessimist :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sfoxa: and why not 5 in diamonds? with 5332 split? |pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|nt|jcwla: Well, as we approach the end of this segment, a big thank you to Roland Wald, to our excellent operator Tom, to Mike, Nils and all specs.  I'll be back with you in 22-1/2 hours for ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: the 11th RR segment.|pg||
nt|christinas: yes I do, because otherwise he has to hope @h are 2-2|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|lestergold: can west develop an overtrick in clubs safely?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: seems better to play queen and lead a club if it holds|pg||
nt|lestergold: double dummy eay|pg||
nt|lestergold: easy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No, he doesn't have the entries|pg||
nt|pelu: he can try - but after @Dagain - no chance|pg||
nt|ady: this might be a swing for east west|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk4: Rødovre vs One-Eyed Jacks|pg||
nt|mmmakela: oops some excitement after all|pg||
nt|sfoxa: no more - with this lead|pg||
nt|pelu: is D? Dorte or dennis?|pg||
nt|christinas: Dennis|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mmmakela: ok sry was concerned ab time change|pg||
pc|d3|nt|nielsfoged:  defense: like brothers in arms |pg||
nt|roswolf: i think an overtrick is more likely|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  at least 7 tricks, but...|pg||
nt|po-s: west might continue with diamonds|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He can advance @C9 now, but then he can't play on clubs any more|pg||
nt|pelu: but DD he can|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Anything is possible with all cards in view|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Dorthe was always going to make 5|pg||
pc|dT|nt|Walddk4: Don't worry, you can sleep one hour more :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|nielsfoged:  but OK those @c's are prettyu high|pg||
nt|ady: general opinion 3@H should go down    not an easy contract    but I think it is makable if going up with K@C first round|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|po-s: too late|pg||
nt|sfoxa: let's imagine, S doesn't play @c ace in the first round of suit|pg||
nt|sfoxa: yes,  they can get 2 ruffs now  |pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks likerun for home|pg||
nt|pelu: homerun or run for home :)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|h2|nt|cindy:  that's all folks|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk4: 6 IMPs to OEJ but 16-14 VPs to Åkirkeby|pg||
pc|c4|nt|nielsfoged:  ...tricky!|pg||
nt|roswolf: why not overuff|pg||
nt|ritong: operator s miss, clearly  lets wait for the claim|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks to Tom, Peter and Markku|pg||
pc|c9|nt|nielsfoged:  ty all|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 9 IMPs = 17-13 VPs|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks all and good night|pg||
nt|lestergold: good night all |pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|nt|nielsfoged:  Odense i the hometown of Hans Christian Andersen: fairy tales are what they like|pg||
nt|ritong: or not:)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|christinas: Good save here. that will add to Århus victory, but at least Storeslemmen avioded getting a blitz by making 2 imps on board 10|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He did|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  how do you avoid 2 @c loosers and 2@h loosers an 1 @s (at least)|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|hT|pc|s4|pg||
mc|10|nt|marlowepi: N shd play club Q under king i think, if he has the club count right|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks all, back soon|pg||
