nt|Walddk2: This will make with at least one overtrick|pg||

pc|s7|pc|sA|nt|hedyg: needs a @s now to hold to 9 tricks|pg||

nt|mdgraham: Good evening all|pg||
nt|haans: Allegra need an other bid win France have nothing to play for|pg||
nt|xenya: semifanals|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|haans: http://eurobridge.org/competitions/09Paris/Paris.htm Semifinal 12 boards each session (SEMI 48 boards)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe E-W would appreciate to have Danish flags rather than German|pg||
nt|haans: hi Vladimir|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Haans|pg||
nt|Walddk4: besides, team names are reversed|pg||
nt|haans: RESULTS: http://eurobridge.org/competitions/09Paris/Results.htm|pg||
nt|sybarra: e/w need to play in clubs.  otherwise no entry to E hand |pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello again|pg||
nt|mmmakela: hi all and welcome!|pg||
nt|andyv:  good morning everyone|pg||
nt|mmmakela: NS play strong club with lots of relays|pg||
nt|ralfwil: let us hope for interesting boards and Sweden has som IMPs to pickup|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello Andy and Markku|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Ralf and Markku|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 12 boards so 2,1 imps per boad needed|pg||
nt|andyv:  first board close to a Roland slam|pg||
nt|cuan: buongiorno a tutti|pg||
nt|effebi: squadra abitutata alle rarefatte atmosfere dell'alta classifica|pg||
nt|figb_rama: è vero Franco, avevo dimenticato che nel 2002 giocavano per Torino|pg||
nt|gluckenval: Probabilmente la coppa Gromoeller/Hausler dovrebbe giocare un sistema tipo swiss-acol, 1@S 5 1@H 4 1@D 4 e 1@C 3, 1NT debole 11-13. Però aspetto conferma ufficiale.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ralfwil: good afternoon from Sweden|pg||
nt|haans: Hi 'Mike|pg||
mb|1S|nt|haans: Allegra Italy took 21 in last match but were still 4 p from a semi|pg||
mb|d|nt|saverio: ciao a tuttj|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ybob: Hi all|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D 18-19 bal|pg||
nt|dima:  Good afternoon everyone - Swedish team has their work cut out for them|pg||
nt|haans: may be what they need|pg||
nt|rcerreto: buongiorno a tutti|pg||
nt|gioffi: ciao a tutti|pg||
nt|gluckenval: ciao|pg||
nt|gioffi: ciao|pg||
nt|effebi: gluck colpisce ancora|pg||
nt|gioffi: vediamo se sai questa|pg||
nt|gioffi: Hausler era il pt di Spletosser?|pg||
mb|d|nt|cuan: appunto|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome.|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Roberto|pg||
nt|dima:  And we have a big board to start the 2nd segment with|pg||
nt|effebi: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: close?|pg||
nt|andyv:  sure|pg||
nt|andyv:  only A@h being off stops it:)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hej PO!|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 6dias by N makeable double dummy|pg||
nt|rcerreto: in questa mano il SA debole con 5a nobile non è venuto bene|pg||
nt|gluckenval: mi sembra di si|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: Hello Vladimir|pg||
nt|jbgood: good evening|pg||
nt|xenya: a routine 4@S to warm up|pg||
nt|haans: mini NT is not rutine|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The player names are reversed|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like 11 tricks in @c after a @S lead, but more difficult or impossible after a @d singleton lead|pg||
nt|mmmakela: maybe even in practise|pg||
nt|effebi: le carte consentono fino ad 11 prese a fiori in E/O|pg||
nt|effebi: bei tempi Giuseppe|pg||
nt|gioffi: mec junior del 1978 e c'eri anche tu |pg||
pc|d6|nt|lestergold: on a diamond lead?|pg||
nt|andyv:  that's a Roland slam|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Po:)|pg||
nt|po-s: that´s what I meant - close means nearly - this one does make|pg||
nt|andyv:  true...I forgot N would be playing it:)|pg||
nt|effebi: yes|pg||
nt|effebi: sul podio:)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sunsamvar: actually i expected a minor suit bidding war here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Angelini-Versace do not play mini-NT. E-W do|pg||
nt|april7: Hello everybody and good afternoon|pg||
nt|dima:  Likely GromÃ¶ller-HÃ¤usler will get to Grand here - they were very efficient in the 1st segment|pg||
nt|andyv:  but this should be a huge pick up for NS|pg||
nt|cuan: brutta mano per sistema per i fantunes|pg||
nt|gluckenval: a beh... io non ero nato nel 1978...|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ralfwil: must win this trick and play @d|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|xenya: no but i xpect the contract to be reached in the OR as well -- probably on a different auction|pg||
nt|xenya: oh|pg||
nt|april7: S is looking for an adequate bid to find out about the K of @C to get to 7, he will find it I suppose|pg||
nt|dima:  Now (if they play sort of standard) South knows that North is 1=5=3=4 or actual shape so 13 tricks is matter of keycards|pg||
nt|sybarra: its not a game hand....3 nt is down on any lead |pg||
nt|mmmakela: can make a lot of tricks here,11 that is|pg||
nt|effebi: 1878|pg||
nt|gioffi: vedi...|pg||
pc|s9|nt|haans: this is not good for sweden|pg||
pc|s6|nt|haans: do look balanced but yes they may have changed|pg||
nt|haans: italy are playing game here|pg||
nt|sybarra: E bit "reluctantly"  and W found good discipline here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @s is the only suit E can establish an entry to clean trumps|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ritong: wow lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi all:)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Frank|pg||
nt|april7: this bid doesn't help at all|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: sorry i was responding to a spec who suggested 3n|pg||
nt|dima:  OUCH !!! Serios misfired|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
nt|andyv:  and he should get the @ds right|pg||
nt|effebi: certo, il difficile può essere entrare (in orizzontale), ma se dovesse essere...|pg||
nt|cuan: ciao|pg||
nt|rcerreto: ciao a tutti|pg||
nt|figb_rama: stiamo parlando del MEC junior di Salso?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mdgraham: Germany 77 Denmark 70 Italy Allegra 65|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone and welcome back to Paris for the 8th European Champions' Cup. Twelve teams divided into two groups. Matches of 20 boards in the round-robin. This is a round 2 match ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: from group A|pg||
nt|dima:  Well this start will make swedish fans sit up right :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: must because even if E had the Q clubs could be blocked as here|pg||
nt|rcerreto: la speranza è che, con il fit 4°, si spingano sino a 3@s|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like a cheap save in 4@s. Let´s see if the sacrifie had been correcy|pg||
nt|xenya: this rates to make after S has shown a black 2-suiter|pg||
nt|haans: names wrong|pg||
nt|april7: I'm very astount with 20 HP and 4 aces not to reach the slam, S figured N to have psyched perhaps|pg||
nt|gioffi: yes|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk4: North is  Magnusson|pg||
nt|ralfwil: that @h 10 also saves with a missguess in @d|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ritong: @c was 1310|pg||
nt|rcerreto: che, con un controgioco corretto, si battono|pg||
pc|d4|nt|xenya: declarer will know how to handle the diamonds|pg||
nt|rnmalik: depends entirely on @D play|pg||
nt|ybob: run trumps @S to K and @D to dummy = home|pg||
nt|jbgood: difficult not to end up in the favourite contract of them all - 3 NT - but 5@c seems to be better|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N makes for NS on a non -diamond lead... |pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|xenya: so Italy is EW, Denmark NS?|pg||
nt|gluckenval: un rapido ripasso del sistema dei Fantunes: le aperture a livello di 1 a colore sono tutte 14+ oppure buoni 12/13 e 5+ carte. 1@C è usato anche per le bilanciate da 15+. 1NT 11-14 ...|pg||
nt|gluckenval: bilanciata, con qualsiasi quinta. Le aperture a livello 2 sono 9-13 con 5+|pg||
nt|katar: avendo aperto di 1nt sono stati fuori dal parziale a @s ma si dovrebbe cadere di almeno una presa... mentre si fanno 2@s ma aprendo si 1@s se ne dovrebbero giocare almeno 3 per cui ...|pg||
nt|katar: potrebbe essere mano pari... speriamo :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kiwibridge: hello everyone|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: even on a heart lead a @D switch is obvious|pg||
nt|xenya: and that might well have been the scenario had they bid it|pg||
nt|rcerreto: entrare in EW pare comunque difficile|pg||
nt|cuan: intendo che l'apertura 1NT con quinta nobile trancia di netto un fit picche di nove carte|pg||
pc|s8|nt|effebi: incerti del sistema..|pg||
pc|sT|nt|rcerreto: è il motivo per cui a molti il SA con 5a nobile non piace|pg||
nt|gioffi: qui nel frattempo ci hanno regalata una presa|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: will make on the probable @S lead tho|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|Walddk2: But the Italian commentators in the closed room are twice as good as us. They have 1200 specs, we only 600|pg||
nt|ritong: probably because they move a lot|pg||
nt|ritong: their hands, for example|pg||
mb|2N!|an|8-11 + 4 trumps|nt|xenya: excellent 4@S for NS -- EW might sacrifice|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT is a constructive spade raise|pg||
mb|4H|mb|4S|nt|ritong: smirnov has every reason to bid 4@h|pg||
nt|ritong: and same goes for lauria|pg||
nt|ritong: difficult moment for piek now|pg||
nt|ritong: i d try 4 NT|pg||
nt|ritong: in case there were a better suit than @hs to play|pg||
nt|ritong: cannot be slam effort since he already single raised|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: as long as he does not double. then Smirnov may sit for it|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: He did well|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk2: 5@SX in the other room|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, all very reasonable|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Häusler bid one more over 5@H. Not a success|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The Italians virtually never bid 5-over-5|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s2|pc|s8|pg||
nt|hedyg: N in CR did not double 5@H, maybe his pd took his pass as forcing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not sure who said it first, Ed Manfield of USA or Ron Klinger, Australia: "The 5-level belongs to the opponents". Was probably Manfield|pg||
nt|hedyg: the 1 @d opening by E shows an unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|ritong: it is a good rule of thumb|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry can be balanced with 5 @ds i am told|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|s6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It costs 11 IMPs when your judgement is wrong|pg||

pc|h7|nt|hedyg: would you pass 4@s with the E hand?|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: wonder if the score will be right, if not, we'll have to adjust it accordingly|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 5 dias makes here|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ralfwil: hello Rashed|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@H for NS -- a sacrifice by EW might prove too expensive|pg||
nt|rnmalik: looks like 4@H for NS and good save in 4 @S by EW|pg||
nt|bessi2: hi all|pg||
nt|haans: have not seen that prempt before :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: wasted points in @S will doom this 3 nt|pg||
nt|lestergold: well an unlucky habd for N/S here no play 3N likely to be flat tho |pg||
nt|mdgraham: as you say, a killing lead|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|rcerreto: buona difesa in EW su 4@s di NS|pg||
nt|rcerreto: 5@s li batterebbe il taglio a @c, ma se li gioca N non c'è taglio|pg||
nt|rcerreto: le aperture a liv.2 dei fantunes alle volte sono molto efficaci|pg||
nt|rcerreto: ma qui l'apertura di 2@d è molto antiestetica|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3S|nt|xenya: of course nothing can make S to stop short of game|pg||
nt|ritong: 1410 points at stake|pg||
nt|rcerreto: con le @d anemiche e 2 belle 4e a lato|pg||
nt|cuan: bella o brutta il sistema la impone|pg||
nt|rcerreto: certo|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ybob: now 4@H and W ?|pg||
nt|haans: But Multon has |pg||
nt|katar: intanto stiamo fuori da questo slam infattibile e magari anche da un avvicinamento a 5 che potrebbe costare il down con attacco fori da ovest (improbabile)|pg||
nt|rcerreto: dico semplicemente che con quella mano mi piacerebbe giocare un altro sistema :)|pg||
mb|5H|nt|ybob: ok 4@S X|pg||
nt|xenya: now you take the money|pg||
nt|haans: all bidding go to 4@H down|pg||
nt|vugraphzxq: DAILY BULLETIN IS FALSED I AM CORRECT|pg||
nt|dima:  I think there was misunderstanding - S meant that 3@h fixed trumps and 3NT was a gadget asking for Q|pg||
nt|ralfwil: can this help NS to a nice contract = 5@d?|pg||
nt|rcerreto: le 10 carte di fit a @h in EW per ora non si sono viste|pg||
nt|gluckenval: Entscho Wladow & Michael Elinescu giocano @C forte, 1@D nebbia, 1NT 15-17 in prima e seconda posizione, e 16-17 in terza/quarta, 1M 5+ carte. 2@C da precision, 2@D forte 18/19 ...|pg||
nt|gluckenval: (20/21 se in zona) 2M sottoaperture o 6 o 5 con 4a minore|pg||
nt|effebi: gluck, sei impagabile....|pg||
nt|gioffi: e perchè non ha aperto in prima posizione in prima contro zona e poi non ha fatto bicolore?|pg||
nt|effebi: e infatti non verrai pagato...|pg||
nt|gluckenval: no... vorrei essere pagato... ma mi sa che non funziona così :)|pg||
nt|rcerreto: bella domanda|pg||
nt|rcerreto: la mancata sottoapertura immagino derivi dal possibile appoggio a @s (J10x)|pg||
nt|rcerreto: poi, su 1@h, forse poteva fare qualcosa di diverso|pg||
nt|rcerreto: difesa trovata|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: hi Sigurbjørn|pg||
nt|gioffi: se 2@S da la bicolore nera le probabilità di trovare il singolo di @D sono alte|pg||
nt|effebi: sono solo le 10.15....|pg||
nt|figb_rama: breaking news...|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: this will drift -1 quietly |pg||

nt|rcerreto: ??|pg||
nt|rcerreto: 5@d ??|pg||

mb|5S|nt|ralfwil: 4@h in the limit for NS|pg||
nt|lestergold: north will try a finesse against the ten of diamonds sadly not on today|pg||
nt|ritong: hi there|pg||
nt|gluckenval: 2@H relais inv+|pg||
mb|d|nt|dima:  Very unlikely to psych standing +28 on the first board of the segment|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yes Shirley - on W it looks like 5@c is easy|pg||
nt|rcerreto: la difesa l'hanno trovata|pg||
nt|rcerreto: non nel modo che pensavo :)|pg||
nt|katar: ha fatto la bicolore :) prima dbl a cuori e poi le quadri a livello alto|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: so it was a misunderstanding|pg||
nt|gioffi: in modo un po originale|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/2009Brazil/Systems/bermudabowl/germany/wladow-elinescu.pdf|pg||

mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Hello Ralf|pg||
nt|rcerreto: spingerli a 5 è buona cosa|pg||
nt|rcerreto: adesso bisogna vedere come va il controgioco|pg||
pc|hA|nt|xenya: please Elisabeth, tell us who is who|pg||
nt|effebi: bicolore a salire|pg||
nt|rcerreto: poco elegante ma efficace|pg||
nt|gioffi: no questo no almeno a scendere|pg||
nt|gioffi: lol|pg||
nt|figb_rama: i tempi di finale sono 4|pg||
nt|gluckenval: come avete visto, sull'apertura 1@C i nostri giocano 1@D per le @H e 1@H per le @S|pg||
nt|rcerreto: e 1@s ?|pg||
nt|figb_rama: i successivi a 13.00, 15.15 e 17.30|pg||
nt|figb_rama: 12x4 board in tutto|pg||
nt|gioffi: a proposito dell'apertura di 1sa con quinta nobile alla 1 abbiamo guadagnato 2|pg||
nt|gluckenval: si, ne hanno giocate 4 di @S|pg||
nt|rcerreto: parziale a @c per 11 prese?|pg||
nt|effebi: -2|pg||
nt|gluckenval: sembra prezioso l'8@S....|pg||
nt|rcerreto: molto :)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|haans: 3nt a make|pg||
nt|haans: hearts good placed|pg||
nt|gluckenval: 1@C - 1@S = 0-11 senza 4 carte nobili|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|xenya: N has 8 top tricks and little chance for a 9th -- so he will run the clubs first in the hope something good happens|pg||
nt|lestergold: he can only play 3 rounds now as he needs one for a second entry to repeat the diamond finesse|pg||
nt|haans: must be lavinthal to @D|pg||
nt|ritong: it is|pg||
nt|mmmakela: S limited to 16 points bec 1 @C 17+|pg||
nt|rcerreto: anche facendo l'impasse a @d non c'è modo di incartare Ovest per un ipotetico taglio e scarto|pg||
nt|rcerreto: il morto non avrebbe più atout|pg||
nt|rcerreto: mi pare quindi che il -1 sia ineluttabile|pg||
pc|hK|nt|effebi: ci sono tre prese da pagare, in questa difesa|pg||
nt|rcerreto: un modesto centino per NS|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|nt|xenya: on second thoughts, the save looks cheap enough|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|xenya: the@D return  is best i think|pg||

mb|p|nt|rnmalik: strange play by E|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this 4@H looks better|pg||
nt|cuan: i don't think so|pg||
nt|dima:  With a nothing hand and no move in a major from Partner he figures that partner has values in clubs. |pg||
nt|haans: OR open with som ekind of weak 2 and opps go on|pg||
mb|1C|nt|xenya: -3 instead of 2, still a good save|pg||

nt|ralfwil: Do you know why S didn´t support @c PO?|pg||

nt|haans: Suppose 2@C was a relay|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: 1nt did show 15-17|pg||

nt|sybarra: if you open 1 @C |pg||
nt|rialc2: si ma tutte le altre carte sono ben messe e le @H 3-3|pg||
mb|3N|nt|dima:  A couple of vulnerable undertricks here|pg||
nt|haans: BC|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Hans - for me W´s hand is at least 18|pg||
nt|sybarra: that was my point on "heavy"  1 nt |pg||
nt|haans: which mean flat board (good)|pg||
nt|sybarra: its an prime hand also |pg||
nt|sybarra: with the aces|pg||
nt|effebi: l'attacco non uccide|pg||

mb|p|nt|sfoxa: Hello to all, sorry for being late - rush hour in the rainy evening dosn't look good )))|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: W woild love to put in a word, but the vulnerability deters him|pg||
nt|ralfwil: without a @h lead 6@s is makeable|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 6@C is cold regardless of lead|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hearts are 3-3|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @H lead difficult |pg||
nt|Walddk4: In Minsk?|pg||
nt|haans: despite that it looks like the normal bidding|pg||
nt|ritong: looks natural to play his trump at that point|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa: yes, here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 4@S is better as it does not need @Sk to be right|pg||
nt|lestergold: this should make tho|pg||
nt|haans: 5@C much better than 3nt :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: most NS sequences are just relays if they open bidding|pg||
nt|rialc2: l'attacco di K di @C avrebbe creato una situazione interessante ma per fortuna loro non vedono tutte le carte|pg||
nt|rcerreto: K@c e @c credo batta, ma è fantascienza pura|pg||
nt|rialc2: probabilmente giocherà il doppio a @S e, così facendo, si troverà fuori da tutti i problemi|pg||
nt|cuan: da ovest sarebbero blindati. ma è pura casualità|pg||
nt|rcerreto: anche a 3SA, in verità|pg||
nt|rcerreto: ma sono 4-4|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rcerreto: vincerebbe a stare basso ma le chance sono per mettere la Q|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bessi2: unlucky lead for south here |pg||
pc|hK|nt|ralfwil: only for 6@s a @h lead will defeat|pg||
nt|xenya: @H lead is not impossible to find |pg||
nt|rnmalik: tough decision for E|pg||
nt|xenya: actually it looks quite logical|pg||
nt|ybob: to me impossible|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and BC Quantum comes from?|pg||
nt|xenya: well E can count on his @SQ to win a trick -- N should have both A and K on the auction|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not necessarily best, as South needs exit cards outside the spade suit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and that removed one of them|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|xenya: and there it is|pg||
nt|ralfwil: he found it!|pg||
nt|rnmalik: well done|pg||
nt|xenya: so E should try to set up a trick ina side suit, and that can be only @Hs|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: tho there is the danger of @C ruff in 4@S|pg||
nt|haans: yep add 1p more for that|pg||
nt|katar: peril momento il gioco è andato uguale in aparte|pg||
pc|h4|nt|rcerreto: la caduta dell'8 aiuta un po'|pg||
nt|effebi: aiuta e insospettisce|pg||

pc|h2|pc|c3|nt|lestergold: natural to play in 3n when all suits stopped and fits only a 7 carder|pg||
nt|haans: 3@C was not relay so natural|pg||
nt|rialc2: nord adesso deve regalare|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ralfwil: After teh @s support I prefer 6@c from N and S has to choose between @s or @c. What´s your opinion?|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|rcerreto: 4 e poi 5 di @h in nord spiega che il colore è diviso 4-4|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: even a dim lead would not have beatn 3non this kind layout|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: what id @Sk and @Ca were exchanged|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: what if|pg||

pc|d2|nt|haans: good play here|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mdgraham: @DJ|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but he can also see that the duck will disrupt declarer's communication|pg||
nt|xenya: now 11 tricks are available|pg||

nt|Walddk2: That is not going to be cheap|pg||
nt|hedyg: there was no way to stop N|pg||
pc|s8|nt|Walddk2: 2@C is safer but I don't think double is wrong|pg||

pc|c5|nt|Walddk2: Like  1NT  (2@H)  double  (negative)   then you should not be void in hearts, because partner will leave it in with four|pg||

nt|xenya: oh i missed that -- did he make?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but the question was 6@s or 6@c from N and hand over to S to decide|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, at 800, I am sure that he will be equable about it |pg||
nt|haans: often showing cards|pg||
nt|sybarra: ;hello  sorry I am late |pg||
nt|haans: i had a relay system once we did start to show short suits|pg||
nt|rcerreto: prende in mano, gioca la Q@s|pg||
nt|gioffi: R|pg||
nt|katar: la mano la fa sempre se gioca le picche giuste|pg||
nt|rcerreto: deve riuscire a fare il taglio a @d|pg||
nt|rcerreto: ma in cui si sarebbe probabilmente andati down|pg||
nt|rcerreto: anche se l'attacco da J10xx a slam non è del tutto ovvio|pg||
mb|2C|nt|dima:  Hello Shirley :)|pg||
nt|haans: good slam|pg||
nt|haans: easy to find|pg||
nt|sybarra: nt or @S?|pg||
nt|sybarra: either works |pg||
nt|gioffi: ora deve giocarsi le @H 3\3|pg||
nt|rcerreto: che mi sembra ci fosse :)|pg||
nt|gioffi: mi sembra complicare una mano semplice dopo l'8@S da Nord|pg||
nt|rcerreto: sì, concordo|pg||
mb|d|nt|gioffi: deve decidere quale colore rosso è 3\3|pg||
mb|r|nt|mdgraham: superficially, that is a bad result, but it would not be surprising if it was flat|pg||
nt|haans: semi are to be played 48 boards today|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 32 points and a 5-card suit on EW must be enough |pg||
nt|stc: hi everybody|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Interesting to see what happens if E does not show his @s|pg||
nt|haans: 6+4 por 7|pg||
nt|haans: or|pg||
nt|mmmakela: S will balance|pg||
nt|stc: ending in 4@s ?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: then this becomes interesting|pg||
nt|effebi: ho una notizia ufficiale: la mano si fa anche con l'attacco di Re di fiori|pg||
nt|rialc2: in questa quasi quasi sarebbe bene non entrare altrimenti si va a manche|pg||
nt|rcerreto: rientrando in mano a @h e giocando Q@s mi sembrava invece finita|pg||
nt|cuan: forse su 3@H un 4NT quantitativo si poteva dire, ma non avrebbe funzionato. lui sa che il compgno parte da 14 ...|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kiwibridge: and a routine 3N here|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Dima :)|pg||
nt|gioffi: sembrava anche a me|pg||
nt|rcerreto: su 3@d ovest non ha una decisione semplice|pg||
mb|3C|nt|sybarra: clubs also |pg||
nt|haans: 2@C 9-14|pg||
nt|rcerreto: AJ@d sono belli|pg||
nt|rcerreto: ma la mano è minimissima (dato il range dell'apertura)|pg||
nt|figb_rama: 6@D Est in chiusa|pg||
nt|figb_rama: aperta|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sfoxa: seems, 2NT as GF with fit becomes popular |pg||
nt|sybarra: but probably play nt?  no ruffs |pg||
nt|rcerreto: adesso dipende dall'attacco|pg||
mb|3N|nt|haans: Madala had no bid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: just the sort of dummy you want|pg||
nt|haans: only cards to 3@S i think?|pg||
nt|cuan: se attacca fante di cuori va down|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: unbelievable -- what made Zimmermann switch i wonder|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: wont get beaten in the trump suit, but I see some other losers |pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @C has to has to have some meaning,  like gerber (I may get booted for saying that) |pg||
nt|ralfwil: I prefer 6@s before any other slam. If @s are 4-1, @c must behave and the slam similar to 6nt|pg||
nt|haans: they may use reverse transfers|pg||
nt|sybarra: did 2 @C promise just clubs or a 4 card major also|pg||
nt|haans: loook like natural precision|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think you are right Shirley|pg||
nt|rcerreto: se è @h non credo possa farcela|pg||
nt|rcerreto: nel complesso è sopra al 50%, hanno fatto bene i tedeschi a chiamarlo|pg||
nt|rcerreto: adesso tocca ai nostri trovare l'attacco che batte|pg||
nt|figb_rama: attacco Fante di @H!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|rcerreto: congratulazioni :)|pg||
nt|cuan: grande come al solito alfredo|pg||
nt|rcerreto: o la licita lo "tirava", oppure era un attacco difficile|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sybarra: its not Wrang thinking I guarantee that |pg||
nt|mmmakela: yes, S could be weaker|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk4: We will not see much of Iceland on vugraph after Dec 31 when we enforce the rule that no player with a surname longer than 10 characters is allowed to appear|pg||
nt|stc: wladow doubled one trick to early but he will still collect a  lot|pg||
nt|haans: many assume partner has 5-6 p 8-9 if balancing|pg||
nt|rcerreto: fermarsi era difficile|pg||
nt|gioffi: taglia viene in mano con la @H e gioca @S al 10|pg||
nt|rialc2: le@H 3-3 (ancora!) consentono lo scarto della @C ma non basta|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: The Chinese are just smiling|pg||
nt|jbgood: some play it as invitational +, but "nobody" plays 2 NT as natural after a major opening any more|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Sveta can make it ... only just|pg||
nt|dima:  No avoidance play in @d suit for NystrÃ¶m here, likely to fail by a trick|pg||
nt|april7:  N will lead @S after the @D trick and the contract will be 1 off|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But without @hQ 6@s should be played on E|pg||
nt|sybarra: this will not do well for e/w |pg||
nt|ralfwil: a big mistake from EW....|pg||
nt|haans: may a swede say :)|pg||
nt|cuan: 24 punti in zona. manche normale|pg||
nt|gluckenval: su 2@S di apertura 3@C mostra 5+@H in mano almeno invitante, non so se lo giocano anche quando 2@S è in interferenza|pg||
nt|effebi: ahh...|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: this helps declarer |pg||
nt|dima:  making sure that partner splits his honors (if he has them)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well if N/S allow vulnerable interventions of south's type on a festering suit  in a fersteing hand, then north should have gone more cautiously|pg||
nt|pelu: West cant bid 1NT over 1@S - 1Nt = 15-17 - so he has to bid 2@C|pg||
nt|stc: -500, may -800 ?|pg||
nt|haans: -400 i OR|pg||
nt|rcerreto: ??|pg||
nt|effebi: però...|pg||
nt|cuan: qua si divertono poco|pg||
nt|rcerreto: 4@h veramente?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxq: yes|pg||
nt|rcerreto: interessante|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sfoxa: yes, living in the European bridge suburb...|pg||
nt|haans: 9th trick in clubs|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N by E would be slightly better here, but 4@H is also OK|pg||
nt|mmmakela: dias shift now?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: what had happened after pass from E? only an academic question|pg||
nt|rialc2: a me sembra una pura surlicita (e 3@S un intervento minimo)|pg||
nt|katar: non dovrebbe aver problemi se batte immadiatamente atout perde 2 picche una fiori|pg||
nt|cuan: le fa|pg||
nt|rcerreto: 8 carte sia a @s che a @h|pg||
nt|rcerreto: strano però|pg||
nt|gluckenval: zona 800 più o meno|pg||
nt|cuan: secondo me 1100|pg||
nt|ardf10987: Avrà valutato che 3sa sarebbero stati di battuta, e che la perdita massima sarebbe stata 800 contro 600. Non la si può defnire una scommessa alla pari, ma insomma...|pg||
nt|rcerreto: non è la decisione di difendere che mi stupisce|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ralfwil: a flat board  - next|pg||
nt|dima:  Not too much of help :)|pg||
nt|april7: E might have ducked this and N could perhaps continue for a ruff,then the contract would be made|pg||
pc|cA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good morning all. Sorry I'm late - connection problems|pg||
nt|haans: hi Mike |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Hi Mike welcome along|pg||
nt|haans: u missed nothing |pg||
nt|mdgraham: however, don't seem to have missed much - three flattish hands |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: all quiet so far|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the sort where you will probably go down a packet, and there is diddly-squat on for the opponents|pg||
nt|haans: i think pass|pg||
nt|rcerreto: è quella di difendere a @h e non a @s|pg||
nt|rcerreto: a parte che le @h sono 5-0, cosa che non possono sapere...|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mmmakela: now the @C loser goes on hearts if plays A|pg||
nt|ralfwil: nice defence!|pg||
nt|rcerreto: vero|pg||
nt|rcerreto: paga solo 3@s|pg||
nt|gioffi: ora gioca @H|pg||
nt|rialc2: le farebbe anche con le @H 4-2 purchè il doppio di @H fosse assieme a quello di @S|pg||
nt|effebi: di là 3SA-1|pg||
nt|katar: cosa gioca gioca fra picche e cuori... è listesssssssss|pg||
nt|gioffi: giocando @H le fa anche con @H 3\3 e @S 4\1|pg||
nt|rialc2: vero|pg||
nt|katar: anche giocando picche|pg||
nt|katar: non cambia nulla|pg||
nt|gioffi: onosce 6@C in O|pg||
nt|effebi: Fantoni pensa, situazione inconsueta....|pg||
nt|julia11: non pretenderete che  giochi alla velocità del suono ...no?|pg||
nt|gioffi: deve decidere se è più probabile la 6\3\3\1 o la 6\3\2\2|pg||
nt|katar: ahahaha mai fatto in vita sua|pg||
nt|gioffi: fabrizio non cambia nulle come sono messe le carte|pg||
nt|katar: si ma giocando cuori vince con una figura in più|pg||
nt|gioffi: di al commentatore di fare claim :)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|xenya: this looks a bit too high -- apparently N was hoping for a better hand with S for his vulnerable overcall|pg||
nt|april7: it was a chance|pg||
nt|haans: 3@S =assume some steath but not forcing|pg||
nt|rcerreto: non vedo il vantaggio di tagliare le @c dalla lunga|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mdgraham: and this 3N seems to have three club tricks and two in each |pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|xenya: there's no chance at all|pg||
nt|lestergold: lucky not to be cracked|pg||
nt|ardf10987: La decisione cmq è di Hausler... Gromoeller ha solo proposto di giocare sia a @H (più lunghe) che a @S...|pg||
nt|rcerreto: vero|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ritong: let s make it 1 NT was optional|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jbgood: all of a sudden a good slam..|pg||
nt|dima:  With 10+ black cards there could be another action then 1@s overcall|pg||
pc|cK|nt|xenya: that's the only consolation|pg||
nt|lestergold: well n/s may be world class but this hand is not supportive evidence for that|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|ardf10987: Avrà pensato che avrebbe tagliato dalla parte corta..:)|pg||
nt|rcerreto: continuo però a non capire come e quando possa essere meglio giocare a @h|pg||
nt|rcerreto: se sud avesse avuto 4@h e 4@s non avrebbe detto 2@h ?|pg||
nt|effebi: stai a vedere che i compagni, ora, se la prendono con Sud....|pg||
pc|sK|nt|effebi: io avrei giocato cuori (dev'essere per questo che sto al computer...)|pg||
nt|rcerreto: cuori dopo l'A@s va ancora bene|pg||
pc|s3|nt|stc: A@d and 4 rounds @h for -1 now -3|pg||
pc|s5|nt|haans: need to correct myself its France again Sweden|pg||
nt|haans: sorry again Norway-France|pg||
nt|xenya: however EW next door made 2@C, so the loss shouldn't be too big|pg||
pc|sA|pg||

pc|d7|pc|dQ|pc|h3|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|mmmakela: yep|pg||
nt|cuan: con le carte di nord se difendi bene potresti anche battere 3NT|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mmmakela: N couldn't fear dias 5-1|pg||
pc|c2|nt|effebi: si naviga per 800|pg||
nt|rcerreto: intanto 7 prese le fa, potrebbero diventare 8 ?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|xenya: looks like it will be big enough though|pg||
nt|pelu: the only defense to make problems for declayer is 3x@D and then the 4.@D to @H8 and @hQ - the West has to find @HJ|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|lestergold: well just because they are who they are does not exempt them for being slated when they bid like a pair of demented palookas|pg||
nt|haans: Elisabeth who is playing who?|pg||
pc|h6|pc|c7|nt|rialc2: seOvest non avesse aperto questa manche forse non si chiamava|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|effebi: sondaggio: lasciate stare Sud, chi avrebbe licitato come Nord?|pg||
nt|rcerreto: non vale!!|pg||
nt|figb_rama: bell'impegno anche per Lorenzo, che in aperta di @H contrati ne gioca 1|pg||
nt|effebi: vale eccome!|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|julia11: avrà perso almeno un etto in questa smazzata|pg||
pc|h8|nt|effebi: 12 per Angelini|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ardf10987: Non lo so se Sud con una 44 avrebbe detto 2@S o 2@H... talvolta è più semplice dire le @S e dopo dire le @H... Ma non ne voglio fare una crociata...|pg||

nt|rcerreto: diciamo che si è preso un'iniziativa|pg||

nt|figb_rama: Angelini dovrebbe incassare 12 o 14 alla 4 ed allungare in modo deciso|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2C|nt|sfoxa: but hard to imagine proper way to it |pg||
nt|haans: France may go to high here|pg||
nt|dima:  some shape some fit - might get interesting here|pg||
nt|april7: an easy 4@H or 4@S, but not more|pg||
nt|dima:  Also some easy minor suit contract for EW|pg||
nt|dima:  so about a small slam on a finesse through opener|pg||
nt|rialc2: allora ce ne vorrebbero almeno 100 per rifargli una siloutte presentabile |pg||
mb|2H|nt|mdgraham: I know a couple of pairs who, after an obviously flat board like that, will try to needle the opposition - a comment like "Oh, well bid, good job we didn't get any higher, etc." ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: That sort of thing |pg||
nt|cuan: duck is wrong, after elimination|pg||
nt|april7: 5@H a good save against makable 5@C|pg||

nt|dima:  I think 12 tricks are available|pg||
nt|sybarra: dima you mentioned the possible 6 above|pg||
nt|figb_rama: in questa Alf sta giocando 2@Hx da Ovest, attacco atout|pg||
nt|effebi: intanto, cosa sta succedendo sullo schermo?|pg||
nt|cuan: chi è in attacco qui ?|pg||
mb|d|mb|3C|nt|cuan: 2@C = 6@C or 5@C+4@D 11-15|pg||
nt|dima:  It is the matter of bidding, Nystrom gives a lot of leeway, but still might be pushed into "sacrifice"|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: may "take" it early also |pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa: if NS reach 5@d, EW can sacrifice in 5@s|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: short suit try no doubt|pg||
nt|lestergold: and its cold on the 2/2 spade break|pg||
nt|dima:  So far nobody know who is in attack who is in defence|pg||
nt|sybarra: bet the pass by W shows the ace  |pg||
nt|dima:  Now West might figure that partner is void in hearts otherwise would vul opponents go to the 5 level with only 4-card support?|pg||
nt|sybarra: W asking if it is his lead  (joke)|pg||
nt|dima:  East sorry|pg||
nt|haans: anyone know what system NS are playing?|pg||

pc|dK|nt|sfoxa: yes, that was costly|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @DQ or @cq|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: south may not be too happy with North's @h shortage|pg||

pc|h3|nt|rialc2: speriamo che a 2@C non paghi molto|pg||

pc|h2|nt|ralfwil: and what use of @h10 |pg||
nt|xenya: yes, but E might have @HS -- so 1N doesn't look too wild -- also you are not vulnerable|pg||

pc|c4|pg||
nt|bessi2: for east to hold 3127 + not open with a club preempt nv vs vul,  well it was possible but the finesse was with the odds i believe|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a club lead will make things awkward, but how can East find that?|pg||

pc|s5|nt|lestergold: Chemla can afford to bid 3N on this moderate 12 count  because opening bids in France are somewhat sounder than many play elsewhere|pg||
nt|marlowepi: double dummy there is an extra chance that the slam could also be made if the same hand holds 3 spades and four Ds and 3 clubs. so declarer might star: spade ace, club toward jack.|pg||
nt|xenya: provided NS don't do something silly later|pg||

pc|d2|nt|xenya: 6@S might be tempting here |pg||
nt|jbgood: di after heart ace would suffice I think|pg||
nt|haans: must play 2 @H|pg||
nt|haans: must take 2 tricks in hearts preferable now|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now by reduction S knows N's heart holding|pg||

pc|h3|nt|haans: holy ...|pg||

pc|h2|nt|mdgraham: on the last board, the @D8 return was for sure a heart signal - West led back the @H3 |pg||

pc|hQ|nt|sybarra: http://eurobridge.org/competitions/09Paris/Paris.htm   are the results here? |pg||

nt|hedyg: S did not enter the bidding in the CR|pg||
mb|3D|mb|4D|nt|Walddk2: Yes, 6@C makes because @SA is onside, but would you think it was after South's overcall?|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4S!|nt|petergill: Smirnov will like the sound of 4@D splinter, showing club fit|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: but as there arent the entries to play club finesses from dummy declarer is forced to bang down club ace and with ace hearts with north thats 9 tricks to b made|pg||
nt|xenya: true|pg||
nt|ahri: and for curious specs: 1M-2NT is not natural. they play it as 10-11 with 4card support or any 6-9 splinter.|pg||
nt|lestergold: spades cant be continued so defence cant do anythinmg|pg||
nt|ahri: to be more precise, it's over 1@S; over 1@H, they play it one step below.|pg||
nt|stc: I think 2@d is any game forcing|pg||
nt|cuan: dieci punti e tre cuori, molto pericoloso|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Thanks to Martin Rehder|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: West is opposite 11-13 and has only an eight card trump fit in a misfit, so I thoughtthe would sign off in 4@S. |pg||
nt|hedyg: @s lead?|pg||
nt|ritong: smirnov clearly overrated his hand|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@S has no hope on any lead, except perhaps a bizarre @SJ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They have changed this sequence recently, Thomas Gotard tells me. The explanations in the boxes are correct|pg||
nt|petergill: With misfits and low point counts, you usually need 9+ trumps for slam. |pg||
nt|hedyg: yes not all bids in their CC are correct anymore either|pg||
nt|chessmaste: They were not unfortunate on the previous deal - now the Gods take their revenge|pg||
nt|ritong: can t be sure about all the inferences, of course, but 4 NT looks over the top  4@s would be ok imho|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sastro: no- Smirny made reasonable bids. Pikarek should not invite with such a bad trump suit|pg||
nt|petergill: Versace simply had to avoid leading a black honour|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||

nt|ritong: when did piek invite?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I have been in worse slams, trust me|pg||
nt|petergill: but 3NT was 55 and 11-13, then 4@C asked which side suit and 4@D showed 5@C, so East did not ever suggest slam, if the explanations we were given are correct.|pg||
nt|chessmaste: We know|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Bamberger Reiter won this event in 2006. Italy won six times of seven. This is the 8th edition of the Champions' Cup|pg||

nt|dima:  that @s 6 is looking sweet but will not help|pg||
nt|april7: X or 5@D, but the vulnerability calls for X, except N could be very weak|pg||
nt|sybarra: seems to me bidding 5 @d over 4 would have been better so opps do not know their major suit |pg||
nt|dima:  And we have a new leader again|pg||
nt|sybarra: S now worried  N could hold xx in spades |pg||
nt|haans: 1H GF most hand without splinter|pg||

pc|d9|nt|po-s: Pass is probably forcing  but Fredrik wants to pass|pg||
nt|dima:  Was pass forcing?|pg||

pc|hA|nt|xenya: N is going passive -- looks like the best he can do|pg||
nt|ybob: if W discard @D = no way to win by @D|pg||

nt|katar: e che vuoi fare impasse prima a quadri e poi a cuori|pg||
pc|h3|nt|haans: 6nt from E makable squeeze in red on S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i wonder why S played the heart 4? 2 or 5 would seem normal according to methods. some sort of odd-even thing seems unlikely|pg||

nt|rcerreto: comunque vediamo|pg||
nt|gluckenval: vero... i resti 5/1 sono il 14,35%, tranne quando il colore è @D. In quel caso diventa circa il 16% :)|pg||
nt|cuan: stop a manche di là inconsueto|pg||
pc|c7|nt|april7: W should have passed in the first place, has no business doubling 3NT IMO|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||

nt|rcerreto: in aperta 4@h+1, questo board sposterà dei bei punti|pg||
pc|h4|nt|toniemme: il taglio rispetto al sorpasso ha il merito in certe occasioni di rimandare il daun...non so se qui sia corretto agire così..ma vuoi mettere andare sotto alla fine ?...l'avversario ...|pg||

nt|haans: did North really pass?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxq: yes|pg||
nt|dima:  EW play a system where 1@d could be 0 @d so gromÃ¶ller has an unusual decision to  make|pg||

mb|p|nt|toniemme: di dove sono i Bamberger (città intendo)?|pg||
nt|josj: Bamberg, ufficialmente|pg||
nt|rialc2: i bamberger?|pg||

mb|4S|nt|haans: and off they go|pg||
nt|mdgraham: just seem the movie - North ducked two spades, then led @CK from hand. Not a success on the actual layout |pg||
nt|lestergold: defence were only due three bullets and two ruffs|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 3 ruffs|pg||
nt|xenya: thy won't stop of 6@C now -- the question is whether they'll bid 7|pg||

mb|d|nt|sybarra: S sounded like he had 6 spades I think |pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: A normal contract by a nice layout for EW|pg||
nt|haans: slam bidding much easier if 2@H promise 4 cards|pg||
nt|xenya: *short of 6@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: it was a courageous and imaginative defence in which he decided what to play his partner for and how to wrong foot declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: how to bamboozle declarer from taking the winning line|pg||
nt|xenya: and i'm told the other rable is in 7|pg||

nt|lestergold: this is surely an excellent granny|pg||
nt|dima:  S had to bid something|pg||
nt|sybarra: and 2 nt might have promised more|pg||
nt|ardf10987: ma il tentativo di 4@S era il dbl o il 4@S attuale? :)|pg||
nt|rcerreto: credo che il down a 4@h l'avrebbero trovato|pg||

pc|sT|nt|sfoxa: and with nice start, as wee see|pg||

nt|dima:  Well if @d are 2-2 he is home dry since last spade is likely to be with East|pg||
nt|po-s: only one since if they are 2-2 it is ok -  but here was not easy.. they have a heart entry as well|pg||
nt|dima:  We all seem to agree :)|pg||
mb|1C|nt|pelu: 5 card @s|pg||
nt|april7: bravo!|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: thx all for info,  |pg||
nt|dima:  That 2@h shows both majors?|pg||
nt|dima:  Some action again|pg||
nt|po-s: interesting... 6 spades?|pg||
nt|haans: must be negative no spade|pg||
mb|1H|nt|rodal f: Hi Jon:) |pg||
nt|haans: Norway did find an unluckly slam on 10|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jbgood: looks like it! Hi Frank|pg||
nt|dima:  Lightner double :) lead a heart and get @d ruff - just kidding|pg||
nt|april7: but not 6 @H,its interesting|pg||
nt|haans: but took time|pg||
nt|sybarra: 1 nt? |pg||
nt|sybarra: or 2 @C |pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I want to live in 1 @S |pg||
nt|haans: or xx = help|pg||
nt|toniemme: motivo del tuo commento?|pg||
nt|toniemme: è mano adatta a sistema?|pg||
nt|rialc2: Ovest non attacca mai a @S|pg||
nt|cuan: nei due slam, la situazione di zona comporterà un saldo attivo per angelini|pg||
nt|ardf10987: effebi deep finesse che dice? Giusto in linea teorica... si potrebbero fare 6@S alla 9?|pg||
nt|effebi: nemmeno Failla da junior (secolo scorso) l'avrebbe chiamato|pg||
nt|rcerreto: forse nemmeno Clair|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: another option |pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|sybarra: N does not know if S has any clubs|pg||
nt|effebi: no, Deep Finesse è sdegnato...|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: let us see if they can reach it after a strong 1@C from S and negative !1D from N |pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, that was made to look easy|pg||
nt|april7: E should X not W!!!|pg||
nt|sybarra: W will be sorely disappointed to see the aces come down in dummy |pg||
nt|april7: K!!!!|pg||
nt|haans: and xx must mean ok with diamonds|pg||
nt|rcerreto: speriamo|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: the landed right here|pg||
nt|haans: they|pg||
nt|effebi: olè|pg||
nt|rialc2: pfuiii|pg||
nt|rcerreto: si rifiuta di analizzarla?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|marlowepi: N will surely lead trumps|pg||
nt|pelu: some play here that X of 3@S = dont lead @S - so the pass = lead @S|pg||
nt|pelu: on a small !§S declayer have some problems|pg||
nt|pelu: after @s to 9 and 10 decl has to take 9 tricks - or there will be 5 for defense|pg||
nt|pelu: 25 to Italy after 2 not so good slams by the danish|pg||
nt|cuan: 3@S = strong twosuiter 5-5 heart+minor|pg||
nt|ardf10987: sta togliendo le carte di mano ai giocatori?|pg||
nt|cuan: X = tre cuori|pg||
pc|s3|nt|dima:  How can Bertheau find a @s shift now?|pg||
nt|sybarra: k of @C for spade shift |pg||
nt|dima:  I think it is matter of agreement - @c J might be asking for UNUSUAL shift|pg||
nt|sybarra: am told K only shows Q |pg||
nt|april7: thats true|pg||
nt|rcerreto: anche un software ha una sua dignità da difendere?|pg||
nt|effebi: dice: "io faccio quello che posso, ma licitate due prese in meno, per cortesia"|pg||
pc|s2|nt|marlowepi: then with club switch and D duck declarer has zip|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|dima:  Now it is a crunch time as they say in USA|pg||
nt|april7: W can't imagine a 7-5 distribution, but the 6 @C bid!!!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I don´t know what´s happening at the table, but I don´t like N´s thinking in this situation and after that a pass!|pg||
nt|haans: folled them?|pg||
nt|rcerreto: adesso le farei anch'io|pg||
nt|gluckenval: preferite attaccare da una 5a brutta ma con 2 possibili rientri, o da una 4a onorata e più solida ?|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|xenya: seems they are on their way?|pg||
nt|haans: what kind of bidding was that?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: board 9 was unlucky for Norway. One of those random swings which can go either way. |pg||
nt|marlowepi: after 3rd spade i mean|pg||
nt|Walddk5: One of the few good boards Denmark had against Angelini. 5@C+1 in one room, 6@SX= in the other. 17 IMPs|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jbgood: 6 boards ahead of the OR :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@c?|pg||
nt|haans: some use 2nt lebensohl here|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|h6|nt|rcerreto: very thin, but it makes|pg||
nt|haans: an easy make :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: any guesses on 3@S? Spade values?|pg||
nt|haans: you have a point there|pg||
nt|rcerreto: in funzione di cos'ha il compagno :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: of course 2N here could be too high spade lead and then dim switch and revert to spades looks lie would defeat 2n|pg||
pc|h4|nt|dima:  Another doubled slam missing 3 keycards and a key King comes home|pg||
nt|gluckenval: ottima risposta :)|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|xenya: great!|pg||
nt|lestergold: laltho let thru in open|pg||
nt|rcerreto: think so|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ybob: easy to Mihov :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: not many comparisons here..|pg||
nt|ritong: i think " yourse, dude"|pg||
nt|cuan: nine easy tricks|pg||
pc|cT|nt|pelu: yes - now :(|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ybob: 7 now|pg||
nt|xenya: the lead helped somewhat|pg||
nt|ybob: 14 imps to BC Quantum|pg||
nt|ybob: sry less|pg||
nt|ybob: 10 imps|pg||
nt|xenya: 10|pg||
nt|xenya: if he makes that is|pg||
nt|ybob: cant lost now|pg||
nt|xenya: careful, Roberto! Anything can happen in this game :)|pg||
nt|ybob: Q @C stiff|pg||
nt|april7: its not over yet!!!, shouldn't cover|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 6@S was meant as a save over 6@C of course. The best sacrifices are the ones that make|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ybob: impossible !!!!|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: good defence here beating 2s as dims will be cutt off|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sybarra: W will have no clue re the @S situation imo |pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|sybarra: but we never know exactly who is thinking |pg||
pc|c6|pc|d8|pc|s4|pc|c8|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|nt|mdgraham: I have an explanation for 4@C - North with other partners uses 1NT over the double to show clubs.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ah, the "you make the last mistake" bid |pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: Zmudliski do not give very many gifts when defending|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sQ|nt|cuan: now +1 ?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mdgraham: NS are a new partnership, so it looks like a misunderstanding|pg||
nt|haans: we all thank you |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|haans: screen?|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|nt|lestergold: i meant to type Zmudlicki|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is there are screens |pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s5|pc|d5|pc|c7|pg||
pc|hT|pc|s7|nt|sunsamvar: perfect defence as we might expect from N/S|pg||
nt|xenya: the name is Zmudzinski though|pg||
nt|haans: then N and E on same side|pg||
pc|d7|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sybarra: often the operator waits to enter both bids at same time |pg||
pc|s6|nt|sybarra: that keeps from giving any info re speed of bid |pg||
pc|dT|pc|cA|pg||

mb|p|nt|petergill: Might balance at this table|pg||
mb|p|pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|d3|pg||
pc|c3|nt|petergill: 3@H is down two, and Smirnov rightly thought having a bare king of trumps was a reason not to balance|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c4|pc|c7|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ritong: he has strictly nada, to be fair|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sK|pg||
nt|ritong: and trying for a disaster on the last board is not appealing, too|pg||
nt|hedyg: last board of this segment |pg||

nt|marlowepi: par defence yes. on that deal it was pretty easy to find though|pg||
nt|lestergold: world champion pairs are allowed to have names combined|pg||
nt|xenya: ah i see|pg||
nt|marlowepi: simplicity? polish names? :)|pg||
nt|dima:  Still just enough even if it is not covered or I miss something?|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is last hand in this set |pg||
nt|dima:  Declarer just abandons hearts and play @s Q|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is last hand of this set |pg||
nt|effebi: torniamo alla cronaca|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Thanks to Ivar Berg|pg||
nt|lestergold: Im told its Z & B|pg||
nt|pelu: 3nt - easy so bid, but not so easy to make - the @S-finess = 9 tricks|pg||
nt|gluckenval: mi sembra + 2, non +1|pg||
mb|1N|nt|april7: true|pg||
nt|toniemme: qui ci sono 2 teorie..se l'attacco vuoi che punga devi uscire nella lunga e picche morte dei senza...un difficile rebus..|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|haans: slam?|pg||
nt|rcerreto: penso che il J@h sia stato coperto|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yup|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to our wonderful operator in Paris great job!  |pg||
nt|haans: and we thank you all KIBITZERS  for watching We trust you have enjoyed the show|pg||
nt|rialc2: anche a me, 4@H - 5@C - 1S - 1@D|pg||
nt|figb_rama: ultima mano; si riprende alle 13.00 per il 2° tempo|pg||
mb|2S|nt|haans: must be an invite|pg||
nt|ritong: direct BW is my guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|dima:  Must be frustrating to make 5@sX and lose 10 IMPs in the process|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to Hans and Ralf, my co commentators  |pg||
nt|effebi: toni, però in questo caso c'è anche :"9 calante, Dama cadente"...|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: or not|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Our matches in round 4 (in 2 hours and 25 minutes) will be France Hosts vs Russia and Italy Allegra vs Norway|pg||
nt|ritong: no reason to monkey around|pg||
nt|april7: the luck is with Germany now|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to our terrific operator,  great job! |pg||
nt|rcerreto: non coprire il J sarebbe stato incomprensibile|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: Whý not pass on W and see what happens?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: was but declined I suspect|pg||
nt|haans: just rolling to slam|pg||
pc|d8|nt|rodal f: Could have been a interesting problem if they reaced 5@D|pg||
nt|rodal f: Now we have a new coffe board:)|pg||
nt|haans: and to u Shirley :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Thanks to Shirley and Hans! Nice to work with you. And also to operator and specs|pg||
nt|sybarra: and right Hans,  to our specs!   they are helpful and often humorous to us |pg||
nt|effebi: ..e credo abbiamo raggiunto il fondo|pg||
nt|figb_rama: fine sessione. si riprende alle 15.15|pg||
nt|ardf10987: Ultima del segmento (per quelli esperti in geometria), o ultima della serie (per quelli esperti in matematica)... non sembra spostare granché comunque...|pg||
nt|rcerreto: può fare 9 prese|pg||
nt|rcerreto: alla peggio 8|pg||
nt|effebi: in questa mano, il minimo da pagare è costituito da 3 picche e una cuori (guardando il F@c terzo di Est)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|haans: 2nt as relay good here|pg||
nt|haans: :) :) :)|pg||
nt|toniemme: come i palombari...|pg||
nt|cuan: 1NT ???|pg||
nt|effebi: :)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|xenya: what about S's double? Looks quite dangerous to me|pg||
nt|haans: see you all in 45 min|pg||
nt|rcerreto: il non appoggio a @s mi stupisce un filo|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|pelu: natural lead from S|pg||
pc|c8|nt|lestergold: !n maybe off one an excellent save against 4H but 4h shouldnt make|pg||
nt|rcerreto: KISS method :) always a good idea|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to Po, Dima, and Avram, my co commentators.  Great insight and analysis of hands |pg||
pc|c4|nt|haans: flat|pg||
nt|ritong: and the rest|pg||
nt|rcerreto: anche se, come sempre, ha ragione lui :)|pg||
nt|rialc2: l'1 SA lo ha intimorito|pg||

nt|rcerreto: quacks, in inglese|pg||

nt|mdgraham: are we stuck?|pg||
nt|haans: slow claim maybe|pg||
nt|mgchat: belle finale en perspective|pg||
nt|toniemme: compagno già passato..forse spera di battere o temeva un possibile resto 4-1 delle @S dopo ridichiarazione dell'apertore...|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ralfwil: last board. Thanks all and have a nice weekend|pg||
