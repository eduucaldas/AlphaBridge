mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1H|mb|2D|an|Nat|mb|p|mb|3D|an|F|mb|p|nt|athene: 2@D is fairly cautious; he isn't worth 3@D?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|jallerton: If 1@d was natural, raising to 2@d looks strange|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcmax: 21D is not very much. Mabe the partnership often bids 11D on a 3-card suit|pg||
nt|jallerton: perhaps 1@d showed 4+@h|pg||
nt|Walddk6: It does|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk6: 2@D is a reverse|pg||
nt|athene: ok, well in that case 1@H was a bit odd|pg||
nt|vugraphzzh: 3NT by Hauge|pg||
nt|jallerton: or perhaps 1@d was just a relay|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: well it all makes sense if 2@D was a reverse|pg||
nt|jallerton: Rune Hauge has his own pet system|pg||
nt|vugraphzzh: effectively it was a reverse|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|jallerton: relay, they dont bid majors if they dont have a 5 card suit, I am told|pg||
nt|vugraphzzh: saith Helness|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|athene: with west having the heart length, you are going to start with @DA, so no way to fall foul of the @DQJ doubleton, playing restricted choice the other way|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dT|nt|jcmax: Declarer has sort of a safety play available on this hand|pg||
nt|athene: If you must lose a diamond, you would rather it were to West, too, of course|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jcmax: The only time he would go down is if East had QJx(x) in @d|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s7|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jcmax: Unless a very clever East played the @HJ from KJx or AJx|pg||
nt|jcmax: But there are many reasons why taht cannot be the case|pg||
nt|athene: yes but that wouldn't give west much of a heart suit for his overcall, especially when he knew that south had 4+ hearts|pg||
nt|jcmax: 1) East didn't raise to 2@H|pg||
nt|jcmax: 2) The tempo of the play was very quick|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|lestergold: Mike Gold my name however|pg||

nt|vugraphzaf: Confusion about which way players should be sitting|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jallerton: Should East move here?|pg||
nt|lestergold: Well normal auction here to the point at which Cooke optimistically makes a slam try|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: hi everyone from Manchester|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Kath|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Well Norway is NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: Team will change direction after this board|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hi mike|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: and hi everyone lese who isnt from Manchester in that case!!¬|pg||
pc|s3|nt|yo_yo: :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well the lead has sorted out this contract |pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: not really giving his partner some alloweance for bidding under pressure|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: unofrunately Erichsen decided that leading his own singleton was abetter shot than trying the ace form his 8 card suit|pg||
nt|jallerton: can declarer profit from the failure to cash @ha?|pg||
nt|lestergold: however Small sill has the problem of what to do with a lot of red suit losers|pg||
nt|jallerton: perhaps better to pitch @d and rely on @s 2-2|pg||
nt|jallerton: making 7@s 2@h 2@c|pg||
nt|lestergold: he cant really afford to burn two valuable heart tricks here|pg||
nt|lestergold: I cant see any alternative line|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hi everyone, from manchester|pg||

pc|d3|pc|c6|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Not sure how Norway gets an invite, do you Mike?|pg||
nt|lestergold: so a tame likely flat hand while we wait to see exactly who is sitting where and playing for whom|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but not an englishman in sight at this table|pg||
nt|lestergold: Well I do not understand the logic of the lederer- but certainly Helness is a legend in his own way like Zia|pg||
mc|13|nt|vugraphzaf: ignore result|pg||
nt|lestergold: Tundal and grotheim certainly a world class partnership|pg||

mb|3S|nt|jallerton: back to normal!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hT|nt|Walddk6: A difference of 10 points is a wash. So 620 vs 630 has no significance in either respect|pg||
nt|vugraphzzh: didn't expect to pass throughout with this says Jason|pg||
nt|Walddk6: If we are to see that later|pg||
nt|jallerton: some might have bid 4@d if available to show @d + @h|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Good evening to Paul Hackett|pg||
nt|jcmax: Hi Paul!|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jallerton: the lead mayhave helped declarer|pg||
pc|hK|nt|paulhac:  Hi everyone|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h7|pc|h3|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|athene: Yes it's close whether the 4minor overcall is better used as natural or a 2-suiter, when it's not a jump|pg||
nt|jcmax: It certainly gives declarer more hope than he had before|pg||
nt|athene: People who use it as a 2-suiter just hope they can cover the natural 4@C/4@D overcall hands by bidding 3nt or doubling or bidding 5 of their suit|pg||
nt|Walddk6: The Norwegians went overboard in the other room. 6@DX|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Grøtheim overcalled 4@D to show both red suits|pg||
nt|vugraphzzh: should West play a heart now?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|s7|pg||
nt|athene: West's best return is a heart, to take the dummy entry out whilst the diamonds are blocked|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|jcmax: I happen to believe it's not close at all. In my view it is far more advantageous to use 4 of a minor as a 2-suiter. The only question for me here would be whether the hand was ...|pg||
nt|jcmax: strong enough. Also 2 small @S is not great|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s4|nt|jallerton: it looks as though WEst could then be stepping stone squeezed though, Bill|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|pg||
nt|athene: but it can be hard as a defender to visualize a blocked suit for declarer|pg||
mc|11|nt|jallerton: he has to keep 4@d then @d to Q, @CA,@c10|pg||
nt|jcmax: In the other room S did in fact show his 2-suiter and partner took him a bit too seriously|pg||
pg||
qx|c14|st||md|4S97HQ8643DAKJ942C,SHKJ5DT863CKQJ973,SKT32HA92DQCAT654,SAQJ8654HT7D75C82|sv|o|nt|lestergold: what would have happened if Irens had forcd dummy to ruff at trick 2 with diamond ace|pg||
mb|3S|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|lestergold: well i will ignore the names for the moment as i do not thing Norway are playing against themselves|pg||
nt|yo_yo: this is maybe "non-leaping Michaels"  we shall see|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 5/5 in the reds|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: Board 13 played wrong direction|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: Will be played wrong direction at other table too (I hope)|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|jallerton: then dec has another trick with @dQ instead of a 2nd heart trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: entry probnlem in enjoying the third heart |pg||
mb|5H|nt|lestergold: well oh dear|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: if it is NLM i might have expected a simple 4@H|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|lestergold: th Norwegians catapulted overboard not surprisingly|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: and equally unsurprisingly Tosh is having none of it!|pg||
nt|lestergold: east's pre empt very standard hard for south not to sail in twith his two suiter although one suit is rather ropey|pg||
nt|lestergold: but north has not given patner a lot of 'slack' under the prssure of the preempt and he should hav seriously dongraded his spade holding|pg||
nt|lestergold: when opps preempt it is wise to err on the conservative side be glad to get to a game in the right denomination|pg||
nt|lestergold: and suits tend to break badly too in these situations|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Just looking up last year's winners of the Gold Cup, was Mcintosh in the team then?|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|c8|pc|s7|pg||
nt|lestergold: a it of blame hee to both north and south- south bidding 4d is playing his pard for heart support because he cannot expc not to lose two spade tricks and q empty to five festering ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: hearts is not hat robust|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Dave, not 4@D not leaping michaels?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i will rephrase:  was 4@D non-leaping michaels |pg||
nt|lestergold: it looks like it was diamonds Kath|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|s9|pg||

pc|c5|nt|lestergold: buyingt|pg||
nt|lestergold: likley to be  flat tho|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d9|pc|c3|pg||
nt|yo_yo: non-leaping Michaels is on my system card but usually either me or my partner forgets,  so usually a disaster|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||

pc|sT|pc|s6|pg||
nt|lestergold: having to pulverise his own ummy while drawing trumps|pg||
nt|lestergold: so the kids better be sent to bed|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the Hackett twins are declaring 3NT by North|pg||
nt|lestergold: well at least that isnt doubled might be a slight lack of er entries to enjoy the diamonds|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||

mb|1D|nt|jallerton: If you play these 2-suited bids ou have to agree how strong they are|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|athene: yes, since you have very little room|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: sometimes there's room to invite in either suit e.g. (3@S) 4@C now 4@D can be good with hearts and 4@S can be good with clubs for instance|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: but often you don't have that luxury|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk6: Helness can't reach dummy to lead a spade up, so all he will get is his eight trumps|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Not a good moment for Tor to preempt|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|dT|nt|jallerton: If defence get this right, declarer will have to lead awat from his @sK|pg||

pc|cK|pc|h8|pc|h3|pc|c6|pg||

pc|d2|pc|s4|pc|c7|pg||
pc|cT|pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|h4|pg||
pc|c4|pc|d6|nt|athene: What's worse is when partner gives you no help at all and *still* manages to have lots of defence against possible contracts the other way :)|pg||
pc|h9|pc|s7|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|paulhac:  I would be surprised if they got the defence wrong|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s6|pc|s5|pg||
nt|jallerton: No confidence, Paul|pg||
nt|jallerton: surely they have given count|pg||
nt|jcmax: In situations like this whe declarer is running a long suit it is important for the opponents to play count signals. Unfortunately this very often also helps declarer, but it is ...|pg||
nt|jcmax: almost impossible ton know when to do it and when not|pg||

mb|d|nt|lestergold: well I think Sandquist will run now|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|lestergold: the question is here whioch denomination they will play the slam in|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@h natural FG|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: hard to know who was saving ion last hand double not clear cut|pg||
nt|lestergold: it was a reasonable shot 3N but i think 5C is a rush of blood to the head|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: n/s were not necessarily bidding or making game hee|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|lestergold: am I seeing things here/|pg||
nt|lestergold: well in dims or spades 5 indeed the limit!|pg||
nt|jallerton: 6NT is where you want to be as chances in 3 suits|pg||
nt|lestergold: but you would have thought that with this degree of rock crushing strenth they may have finished in 6N|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sT|nt|lestergold: of course not a vey regular partnership here|pg||
nt|jallerton: Yes, one problem with 2/1 game forcing is getting over the extra values|pg||
nt|lestergold: he could have inolved his partner  in the decision making process after all Tosh has played before|pg||

nt|vugraphzaf: South has shown his shape & his controls|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what was 1@S?|pg||
nt|lestergold: to reach 8 card fit slams on a combined 28 count is not automatic and they arent always laydown|pg||

nt|lestergold: declarer will be thinking of the bestorder to play the cards here in case there are any nasty breaks but we can see he is safe whatever he does|pg||
nt|lestergold: like spade being overruffed or hearts being 4/1 etc|pg||
nt|andyv:  still has to contend with the 1@D overcall|pg||
nt|andyv:  but his options are limited|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes it will give him reason to tank but he has to play a card sooner or later and whatever he plays he makes|pg||
nt|andyv:  i agree Mike... that is a requirement... you have to eventually play a card!|pg||

nt|jallerton: declarer hopes that South will not get in again|pg||
nt|jallerton: but his @d pips are too poor|pg||

nt|lestergold: well its a 20/20 hcp division|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|nt|jcmax: In 4@S declarer might have tried to play on 1C except for South's 4@C bid. Considering the he then will have to decide how to play the @D suit for 1 loser|pg||
mb|d|mb|3D|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|jallerton: West hand is awkward over weak 2@d|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|jallerton: Do you agree with dbl?|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: very hard to say what will work overall...sometimes 3@C will be better, certainly|pg||
nt|athene: I would probably double, I think.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jallerton: All private answers say: no!|pg||
nt|jcmax: It has become very popular to play dbl over preempts and then bidding a suit as a flexible hand, not a hand that was too strong to just  bid a suit. In that context I guess dbl is ...|pg||
nt|jcmax: a possible bid|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d9|pc|dT|nt|athene: Yes, I remember a long discussion about that in The Bridge World|pg||

pc|h4|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|jcmax: Jeffrey I hope not all your private answers always are no|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|nt|athene: with a big one-suiter you just bid your suit, jumping as appropriate, so double is always flexible|pg||

mb|p|mb|3D|mb|d|mb|4D|nt|po-s: why not down 2?|pg||
nt|lestergold: good question i had made amnetalnote originally that it was down 2|pg||

nt|yo_yo: these doubles are difficult|pg||
nt|dburn: West will do rather well to pass this out|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jallerton: 4@s made in the other room|pg||
nt|po-s: apparentlyhe didn´t return a diamond|pg||
nt|lestergold: ewll Sandqvist may have ninje points but he can thrwo his diamond holding out of the window hisJ clubs similarly and look at his sot major suit values and his hand not that ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: exciting|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he has!|pg||
nt|dburn: good decision|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: well another opporutnity for england here to find their 4 tricks|pg||
nt|dburn: now, if he leads a trump as well...|pg||
nt|lestergold: however with trump lead enuf to defend with|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not many could resist leading a top @C|pg||
nt|lestergold: well Tosh knows that hey have the majority in all tghe sides so a trump is logical|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d9|pc|dT|pg||
nt|lestergold: the only way declarer can make extra triks on thes ehands is by ruffs in dummy so i think most good plauers would lead trump|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||
nt|jallerton: North led a @h and West ran it round to his 10 in other room|pg||

pc|dK|pg||

nt|lestergold: so good reult here for Gold Cup always good to take 300 when you cant make game|pg||
nt|yo_yo: McIntosh recently starred in a TV program  on Sky TV|pg||
nt|lestergold: As spec points out North's 4D was not that great a bid- he has defence aginst majors and probably enuf to make 5c a doubtful proposition for e/w|pg||
pc|dA|pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|d7|pg||
nt|lestergold: well so  far TGR are getting a bit of a pasting|pg||
nt|jallerton: a random swing - playing by the weak hand gains the swing|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|nt|jcmax: 13 or 23? The one we are looking at?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|athene: NS play 14-16 NT, 4-card majors and tend to open very light|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|jallerton: EW 5-card majors strong NT |pg||
nt|Walddk6: The format is a combination of IMPs (VPs) and point-a-board. Maybe Jeffrey can explain further ( I am tired)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c4|nt|jallerton: bd 13, Sabine, the first board (mis)played in the other room|pg||

mb|2S!|nt|jallerton: N/S did well to avoid 6@d in the other room|pg||
nt|andyv:  nice N hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well a good Roland Slam or N/S only needs a couple of  fineses sadly only one of them works|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|jallerton: needs little more than the @s finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: true bactually of course|pg||
nt|jallerton: @h can be pitched on @cK|pg||
nt|lestergold: so actully almost 50%|pg||
nt|lestergold: well im not ma woman so i wouldnt know|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: 1NT GF   |pg||
nt|lestergold: i will let Tosh know hes in with a chance with u Kath|pg||
nt|yo_yo: just a motherly interest of course  on my behalf|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|jallerton: slightly worse - @h ruff more likely than @sQ singleton I think|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|lestergold: pull the other one Kath its got bells on|pg||
nt|dburn: this is a relay auction - 1NT was game-forcing|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2@H minimum with 4+ @C   - this is impressive bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: meanwhile back in the dressing room where is this auction going?|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N|pg||
nt|dburn: and by now South has shown his shape, but not necessarily his strength|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes 2@H minimum|pg||
nt|dburn: but that is limited in any case by failure to open a strong club|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a lot of bids to arrive at papa mama 3N|pg||
nt|andyv:  all N knows is S doesn't have a @d fit for him and that's all N cares about to keep on bidding|pg||
nt|dburn: this is not actually an easy hand to bid at all|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jallerton: What was the purpose of North's 2@d if he was bidding 3NT anyway?|pg||
nt|lestergold: i agree its not easy to bid but al roads should lead to 3N|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: South has shown 2-5-1-5 or 3-5-0-5|pg||
pc|s4|nt|yo_yo: The Twins got there a bit quicker|pg||
nt|lestergold: well Imsure a certain jacon ferney would have arrived at 3n very quicjkly with the North hanbd to claim his 150 honours|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s9|nt|jallerton: Perhaps it was a mild slam try|pg||

pc|sT|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||
nt|jallerton: some would assume choice of games with 5 spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: there ahve been an enormous number of swings practically all in england's favour o we ow have a quiet hand for a rest|pg||
nt|andyv:  this hand would be more interesting in mp than in imps|pg||
nt|lestergold: by the ay welcome David are u still here?|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: of ourse strange team members not many england players in the england team and im not convinced that many of the tgr players reguilarly play rubber bridge at TGRs either|pg||
nt|jallerton: defence need to hold on to their spades|pg||
nt|jallerton: the TGRS team won the TGRs Super League (duplicate)|pg||

nt|athene: so it does pay to make overtricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|nt|Walddk6: 60 VPs at stake in every match. 36 of those are divided according to difference in the IMP score; the rest via point-a-board. 2 for a win, 1 for a tie, 0 for a loss|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|an|alert|nt|Walddk6: So in theory, you can win 60-0 VPs|pg||
nt|Walddk6: I think Steve said the record is 58-2|pg||
nt|jallerton: X = 4!+ @s?|pg||
mb|2N!|an|mixed raise|nt|jcmax: It is a very interesting form of scoring. More than at any other form of scoring your judgment matters as to what you believe the contract rates to be in the other room.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|jcmax: Like on the previous hand, if you believe there is a chance NS got too high at the other table, it is clear to just play safe.|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|athene: Yes, there haven't been that many boards which were swung on overtricks/undertricks.|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: But the issue is there.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|jallerton: West's 2nd double is a call and a half|pg||
nt|Walddk6: 1 IMP difference is enough to win 19-17 .... 2-3  20-16  and so on until you reach 51 (36-0)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|nt|jcmax: E no doubt expected extra values for his partner's 2nd double|pg||
nt|athene: Even so, 4@S is quite aggressive on a balanced 12 count facing a passed partner :)|pg||
