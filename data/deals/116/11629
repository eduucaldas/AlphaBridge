nt|athene: 4@S now might give EW a problem|pg||
mb|3S|mb|4H|nt|jwit: Yes it would have|pg||
nt|athene: west just has to double that and east probably passes|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: 4@SX-1 is a huge score|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|nt|jallerton: South bid 4@s at other table (after support X) and West went on to 5@h|pg||
nt|athene: i guess opener couldn't make a support double because it would show the strong hand-type?|pg||
nt|jwit: They pushed them to 5H in the closed room, which actually can be defeated double dummy, though not likely.|pg||
nt|lestergold: Tom should have barraged 4 in my view|pg||
nt|heatherd: Need to underelad the @s to defeat 5@h? Then they can get a @c trick in time.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: these two-way clubs can be very weak in lots of competitive auctions|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|heatherd: Not a likely defence.|pg||
nt|athene: yes, small spade and club through would win the prize for best defended hand, i think|pg||
nt|athene: there isn't an "opening lead" prize, is there?|pg||
nt|jallerton: "best defended hand"|pg||
nt|jwit: 4S is certainly a very aggressive bid, but not unreasonable with five trumps to the king, and a singleton.|pg||
nt|lestergold: no one commentating on the (my view) inadequacy of Townsend's preemoptive raise|pg||

nt|jwit: If they get to a slam on the last board, I would expect it to be 6D rather than 6S|pg||
pc|h9|nt|andyv:  agree Jon|pg||
nt|lestergold: Even a most consevative and cautious biddr like Tony Waterlow raises those hands to 4|pg||
nt|athene: the scores up to end of last match are on the website now|pg||
nt|heatherd: Declarer seems to be on a guess here. If South has @cK he needs to play @dA|pg||

nt|lestergold: if townsend played a spade here there was a losing option available to declarer|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jallerton: was he planning to defend 1@sx?|pg||
nt|jwit: I would have bid 1NT Jeffrey|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt looks preferable since the spades aren't good enough to defend 1nt|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|nt|athene: *aren't good enough to defend 1@S|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|pg||
nt|heatherd: They seem to have managed to stay a little lower than in the other room.|pg||
nt|athene: getting to 4@S on the EW cards was quite enthusiastic|pg||
nt|jwit: That's an understatement|pg||
nt|heatherd: Poor result for England in the closed room|pg||
nt|jallerton: apparently 1NT was supposed to show clubs|pg||
nt|andyv:  N made a strange overcall in CR, deciding to show @cs over W's 1@s overcall|pg||
nt|jallerton: so East-West called the director and said that they would not have bid 4S if 1NT had been described as natural|pg||
nt|lestergold: the closed room bidding looks like they were all attending a mad hatter's tea party except for north|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
nt|heatherd: Not sure why they bid it anyway!|pg||
nt|jwit: I fault West in the closed room for bidding a free 3D.  From partner's point of view, give partner as little as AKQJx  x  QJxxx  xx, and 4S is practically cold|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jallerton: thanks to David Burn, pretending to be Steve|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW have little defense to what happened|pg||
nt|athene: well, those spades aren't "as little as"|pg||
nt|athene: but i am not sure EW can blame everything on the misexplanation, no|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d4|pc|d8|pg||
nt|jwit: Yes, but he's got to have something for a free 3D bid when you're looking at the Ak of diamonds|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h3|pc|d5|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|heatherd: I doubt they'll get anywhere with their ruling. But I've been wrong before in such matters|pg||
nt|jallerton: 4@s bid looks entirely reasonable|pg||
nt|athene: an interesting idea to give up the natural 1nt bid to use transfers|pg||
nt|athene: it basically means you get non-forcing AND forcing 2-level suit bids|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|athene: but you can't bid 1nt|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: based on what seems to be a gross overbid by Erichsen|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c5|pc|cA|nt|jallerton: even more interesing if only played from one side of the table!|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|athene: i guess they feel that with a 1nt bid you can pass and wait for partner to double, and bid 1nt then|pg||
nt|andyv:  you are allowed to forget your agreements... as long as neither side takes advantage of that "forgetfulness"|pg||
nt|jwit: 3D makes no sense to me on that bad suit, especially when you know the spades are all behind you, since partner has 2 at most, and South has shown 10 cards in the rounded suits.|pg||
nt|andyv:  I imagine he didn't expect pd to jump to 4@s, Jon|pg||
nt|athene: if 1NT shows clubs, south hasn't shown 10 cards in @H+@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3D a most unlikely foray into the penalty zone by the normally careful Erichsen|pg||
nt|athene: he might bid 3@C with only 5-4|pg||
pc|cK|pc|s4|pc|c2|nt|jwit: Well, partner has to be in on the party Andy.  If my partner bid a free 3D on that auction, I would never expect the hand he actually had.|pg||

nt|athene: 1nt is clubs here, i guess|pg||
nt|andyv:  now 3N is wrongsided|pg||
nt|athene: i would have said the main weakness of this is it's going to wrongside a lot of 3NT contracts|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|jwit: Yes, and doesn't work well here, since 3NT is the normal spot, and you're wrong siding it.|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|lestergold: well 3N looks like a totally normal contract for E/W but apart from one trick in the heart finesse the rest of the cards are spitting |pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|heatherd: Doesn't matter too much as you have the 10, just duck the opening @s lead.|pg||
nt|athene: sure, on the cards here it's ok|pg||
nt|athene: but in general it's often going to be costly |pg||
nt|lestergold: and as you say the wrong siding means more than 1 ioff so more on the way for Eng|pg||
mb|p|pc|s9|nt|athene: Townsend has to decide whether to plug ahead with spades, relying on his two diamond entries|pg||
nt|athene: giving up a spade trick to establish his suit|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|s6|pg||
nt|jallerton: might be able to make 9 then by ducking a @c|pg||
nt|jwit: It would seem this is a big flaw in EW's system.  Looking at the West hand, it appears 3NT is a very possible contract, and if so, partner should be declarer|pg||
nt|jallerton: and the 2nd club trick has to be won by North, who is out of spades|pg||
nt|athene: one defensive strategy for south on these sort of hands, if you think partner will get in first, is to duck the first spade|pg||
nt|jallerton: Yes, perhaps you should think about that before playing to trick 1!|pg||
nt|andyv:  can make this now|pg||
nt|athene: but ducking at trick 1 does give declarer two fast spades which might matter in some layouts|pg||
nt|lestergold: Townsedn only needed to think about what on earth he was going to return after winning this spade|pg||
nt|athene: south knows his partner is very weak but he could still have a club entry|pg||
nt|athene: @CJxx, @CJ9xx, that sort of thing|pg||
nt|heatherd: If you are going to think at this point, though, you might as well think before playing your card.|pg||
nt|po-s: what if declarer is allowed to win the first spade - he must then duck a club directly|pg||
nt|lestergold: exactly my point Heather|pg||
nt|andyv:  in CR, it seems that E forgot to count his tricks|pg||
nt|athene: usually this theme of ducking the first trick to keep open communications with partner applies when you have something like KQ109x and declarer has AJx over you|pg||
nt|athene: you put the ten in when partner leads  a doubleton, forcing declarer to use his stopper prematurely|pg||
nt|athene: here there's the added twist that you are actually giving up a spade trick to do it|pg||

nt|heatherd: Can't cash it!|pg||
nt|jwit: Or attempt to cash diamond, otherwise North would be endplayed in trumps|pg||
nt|jwit: If North had been allowed to hold second club, would have had to exit J of trumps, and then would be endplayed on next trick|pg||

nt|andyv:  1@c alerted because it may be short?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  or just a strong |pg||

nt|athene: i am not sure he can bid 4@H fast enough to show quite HOW bad, though|pg||
nt|jwit: Pretty good spot.  Basically needs one of four finesses working, assuming trumps behave fairly well|pg||
nt|heatherd: Declarer just has 2 trumps and a @s to lose, should be no problems here.|pg||

nt|athene: once the @DK appears declarer just wants to get the trumps out the way as fast as possible|pg||
nt|athene: he prefers to use the @CK entry for the spade finesse|pg||
nt|jwit: Yes, declarer probably pretty wise just pounding out trumps, since with that lead, he can only lose three tricks unless something dire happens|pg||
nt|athene: rather than the finesse for the @HQ|pg||
nt|athene: i guess his thinking was that if the @SK is right, the spade finesse will definitely gain a trick|pg||
nt|athene: but even if the @HQ were right, finessing for it might not gain|pg||
nt|athene: for example 4-1 hearts|pg||
nt|athene: also you might just snag a stiff @HQ sometimes; then you become a hero :)|pg||
nt|heatherd: I'm not sure why we're still playing this. Declarer can claim, stating that he'll try the @s finesse.|pg||
nt|jwit: My thoughts Heather lol|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Jon|pg||

nt|jwit: Maybe declarer is just trying to make your son use up all his energy on this hand Mike|pg||
nt|athene: is declarer just letting him think to try to tire him out?|pg||
nt|jallerton: No wonder the Irish had a slow play penalty earlier|pg||

nt|snorris:  another brakedown I suspect|pg||
nt|snorris:  why should west be thinking?|pg||

nt|vugraphzzh: Finally claimed|pg||
nt|heatherd: At last!|pg||
nt|lestergold: he is unlikely to rest with bridge more likely to watch a horror video|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C opener for west|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  @d or @s slam here|pg||
nt|athene: South will bid 2@S rather than double, i guess|pg||
nt|jallerton: not obvious to lead a @d though|pg||
nt|athene: west is more likely to lead @HK against 6@S, i think|pg||
nt|jwit: Would be surprised if they got to a slam however|pg||
nt|athene: playing a known weak partner for a pointed-suit ace seems to be a long shot|pg||
nt|jwit: If South balances with 2S and North bids 3C, won't exactly turn South on|pg||
nt|athene: i think it would be better to lead @HK and hope partner can win a diamond finesse and you get @H @D|pg||
nt|heatherd: Might depend on the auction. If it sounds as though they are missing an ace, West will lead a @d for sure.|pg||
nt|jallerton: If Tom protects, David will become very enthusiastic|pg||
nt|lestergold: a few years ago David said that his and tom's slam bidding was their biggest weakness- interested to see if that is tested here|pg||
nt|athene: well, they reached a fine 7@S last set|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  of course, would help if NS did bid|pg||
nt|jwit: Spade slam can be beaten with a diamond lead|pg||
nt|athene: including (i think) an exclusion king-show at the 6-level :)|pg||

nt|jwit: My sentiments Bill!!!|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|d4|pc|c3|pc|cA|pg||
nt|athene: well, i might run a simulation on this but honestly i don't think it's close|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|nt|athene: passing is so committal - if it's wrong, there is no way to recover|pg||
pc|sK|nt|andyv:  i think it's the easiest balancing 2@s you are ever going to have|pg||
nt|jallerton: so is bidding when it was right to pass|pg||
nt|jwit: As a general rule, the shorter you are in declarer's suit, the more mandatory it is to reopen.|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|athene: well, even if you bid 2@S and it's the "wrong" decision, it isn't necessarily an instant disaster|pg||
nt|heatherd: Yes, but you aren't going to repoen with a double, even though you know that partner has a penalty pass.|pg||
nt|lestergold: there is the outside possibility of an enormous misfit but you know partner has strength and you have two suits to offer so it must be grossly against the odds to pass|pg||
nt|heatherd: I can see why he passed|pg||
nt|jwit: I wouldn't reopen with a double with that distribution, though, of course, it could be right.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|pc|c2|nt|athene: well of course you can see situations where it will be right to pass|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|heatherd: Not only the distribution, but the lack of defence.|pg||
nt|andyv:  sorry, Bill, I must have blinders on... can't see where it's ever right to pass with S hand...even when it's right:)|pg||
nt|athene: EW are quite aggressive pair in general though aren't they? so you aren't that worried about them having missed game? so it's just a question of how excited partner gets|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2S is a normal bid why not make a normal balancing bid at least doubling with so few points and shape or a two suited action I agree is dangeous|pg||
nt|jwit: Couldn't agree with you more Mike|pg||
nt|heatherd: I agree, I would have bid 2@ss|pg||
nt|lestergold: the most dangerous bid at this level of all is the one that was made|pg||
nt|jwit: In fact, if South had balanced with 2S and North had bid 3C, if South now bids 3D, they are a heavy favorite to get to 6D|pg||
nt|athene: south is mainly worried about 2@S, 3nt from partner, double from east, i guess|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: i am just thinking about auctions you don't want to hear after you bid 2@S|pg||
pc|hK|pc|c4|nt|athene: of course, there are some|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|andyv:  at least it's being defended well:)|pg||
mc|6|nt|lestergold: in that cas he can bid 4D showing his wakness and two suited nature giving par a choice|pg||
