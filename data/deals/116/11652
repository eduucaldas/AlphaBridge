pc|h4|pc|h7|nt|christinas: no, I think 3@h is too aggressive by W. He has a good hand, but he is vul, so if 2@d shows 5-5 he has already bid his hand once|pg||

nt|nielsfoged:  It will be interesting to see the results from all matches of Board  5 - does anyone have the methods to avoid 3 NT and reach 5@d? - Most likely would be the strong 1@c pairs (even better Relay-Precision)|pg||
nt|lestergold: do not understand|pg||
nt|monsted: must be !! ??|pg||
nt|lestergold: two asafe ways to rry for an overtrick and instead tries for one offski and succeeds|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|lestergold: did this really take place?|pg||
nt|monsted: looks like a big wictory for BK Nord|pg||
nt|vugraphzyy: he was playing 3 H !!|pg||
mb|d|mb|1H|nt|ritong: well we did suggest a possibility|pg||
nt|ritong: first, you give up on puppet stayman|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|ritong: second, you bid your suits|pg||

mb|p|nt|rnmalik: simple bid|pg||

nt|monsted: WAS plaing or ? |pg||
mb|4H|nt|lestergold: yeh sure we can se that|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: and third, if opener is not interested, he comes back to NT at the 4 level|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: weve all done it|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  may end in 4@H   which could be difficult     3NT  looks more likely to make|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Next match in 30 minutes: Blakset vs Århus BK|pg||
nt|ady: clb lead    cuts of trick supply|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|christinas: It works fine in this case, but I would be worried about the 2 little clubs - if I had the same hand with 4333 it is another story|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Pure HCP points 15-17 + 10 and 2 Ts|pg||
nt|ritong: here, opener gladly accepts ( via 4@s) and 5@d is the final contract|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  problem is that most of us do not have a natural @d-bid after 2NT- or 2@c-openings|pg||
nt|rnmalik: so may finesses and 6 makes|pg||
nt|lestergold: but the lead couldnt be more helpful|pg||

pc|s5|pg||
nt|lestergold: a club return might have been stronger but the clubs can still be cut off|pg||
nt|ady: west must remove club when in with A@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: west cannot be bl;amed for playing pard for a stifff space|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|h3|pc|hA|pg||

nt|ady: still now a club after A@D ok|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh derar|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h9|nt|nielsfoged:  yes an my bet is that at most 1-2 of the 12 pairs bidding  5 will have that capacity (I actrually expect 12/12 3NT-1)|pg||
