nt|Walddk3: We had Bjørn Olav Ekren on vugraph in the previous match|pg||

nt|sharynr: once again Hoffa's double caused trouble, I think|pg||
nt|sharynr: no reason to bid over 2H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W had a difficult bid, esp if he was not sure what double was or if that call has to cover a lot of ground. though S showed majors, normally if one major is shorter you would ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: expect it to be spades, and at this vul S could have anything (as her actual hand proives). so not that unlikely that 4S is best game|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bjacobs: Well, when it's not visible, playing @HQ might mislead declarer who holds @HAJ9|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|nt|jbgood: 3@d rates to make in comfort - but the club play was not to declarer's advantage|pg||
nt|haans: no imps the other way|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sharynr: i am told that DBL is usually played for penalty, which Hoffa clearly meant it as|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|rodal f: An other one as long as the first ain't up running. Here u at least have the names at the players: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=2010div_1|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in that case 3S has less going for it|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bjacobs: So turning it around, when West plays low, you play him for @HAQx rather than @HQ10x, on the basis that he might have played @HQ with the latter holding|pg||
pc|h9|nt|haans: endplay?|pg||
nt|davpro: Declarer preparing some sort of endplay if defense miss the defense|pg||

nt|athene: suits which you want to pre-empt, as mentioned|pg||
nt|sharynr: but the suit only blocks if !KQ doubleton, or KQJ, and then K would be strange play?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if N has those holdings, a holdup might work too|pg||
nt|sharynr: even KQJ10 would block|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|sharynr: yes holdup but would have to decide if 1 or 2 rounds|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|Walddk3: 4@H should not go down. Declarer in the other room must have been a little careless|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This one looks to have swing potential|pg||

mb|3S!|mb|p|nt|jbgood: kibs ask about the info on movie, and my advice is to ignore it. Scores entered are NOT correct for this session|pg||
nt|athene: interesting choice of re-opening action here|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: i wonder why he didn't bid 1NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: It seems like a matter of timing in 4@H - the key being not to play trumps too early|pg||
nt|Walddk3: With @DA onside you just need to ruff two clubs and you can do that in comfort|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: 2@C is a sound heart raise|pg||
nt|haans: drury in defense new one|pg||

nt|vugraphzyr: 2@c is a good raise in @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Bit other style then in OR|pg||
nt|vugraphzyr: 2NT is 2 over 1 in @c|pg||
nt|sharynr: especially after east open (?!?)|pg||

nt|marlowepi: more like 3 over 1 :)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|nt|sharynr: better spot than 2@S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: would prefer a bit of shape with E hand but it does satisfy several criteria for opening bid, and colors are favorable. not a staunch advocate but do not disapprove|pg||
nt|rodal f: Need to try a hook in @H before trying the @C cause of the bad layout there|pg||

nt|haans: do 2@S show better hand (invite)|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Prefer 3NT to 5@C here|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Operators are getting paid (fair enough), but it's not a fortune, and perhaps it would have been wiser to cut down elsewhere. But that is easy for me to say|pg||
nt|jbgood: I am in total agreement, Roland|pg||
nt|sharynr: 8 tricks (possibly 9 with dangerous @H guess)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: many would detest an overcall on such a horrible suit, but with 3 likely entries, S wants to make sure N leads a spade against NT which looks like a very likely strain from S hand|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|nt|athene: if south had just *opened* 1nt, then everyone would transfer with the north cards and accept playing the 5-2 fit|pg||

pc|d6|nt|athene: even if they had played 3N, they would have been OK on the layout (three spades and @CA to lose)|pg||
nt|athene: as long as declarer didn't make the mistake of ducking the first spade|pg||
pc|d2|nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|athene: if south led @S2 against 3N and declarer ducked, diamond switch is killing, but winning and playing clubs is happy|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: Voll need a bid showing both M|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Depends on what 2@S meant, I suppose|pg||
nt|jbgood: Chagas would have loved to land 4 spades via the intrafinesse|pg||
nt|haans: spec say clubs lead|pg||
mb|4D|nt|rodal f: Thats right. But I wrote after the 3NT bid:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: looks like trump beats it though|pg||
nt|sharynr: on @HJ lead, 5@D should make, doesn't it?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: odds at least 12-1 against that lead:)|pg||
mb|4S|mb|d|mb|5C|nt|jbgood: 2 @s is minor "stayman" |pg||

nt|Walddk3: Which would have made if hearts had not been 4-1|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Høyem thinking about bidding again. It does not seem right at these colours. He must have some hope of defeating 4@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: yes, we might see a spade intra-finesse here|pg||
nt|sharynr: otherwise would have to "pin" the @HJ himself :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: I like the way S bid her hand, anticipating E would bid diamonds|pg||
mb|5D|nt|athene: slight danger of diamond overruffs|pg||
nt|athene: e.g. @D lead, south ducks might cause some headaches for declarer|pg||
nt|athene: he would have to cash @HAK and throw a diamond from dummy, perhaps|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: this is a tricky contract|pg||
nt|rodal f: A spec pointed out that 5@D also makes, but will be hard to take the @HQ from table|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not afterthis auction|pg||
nt|sharynr: yes the 2@H opening has really given the hand away|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: are Hayem happy?|pg||

nt|jbgood: transportation not good|pg||
nt|athene: small club now is possible|pg||
nt|athene: but you aren't happy playing a 4-3 fit with trumps out; easy to run into a ruff|pg||
pc|cK|nt|marlowepi: well, not just that--S has shown a ton of black cards|pg||

nt|athene: not sure what declarer was playing for|pg||
nt|haans: right|pg||
nt|jbgood: sometimes you play and pray for a miracle|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s2|nt|athene: actually as a spec points out it's more for entry considerations than timing, that the @D was necessary|pg||

nt|rodal f: Next set are to start in 18min |pg||
nt|marlowepi: challenge the champs -- NS 3N with 9 spades|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|athene: but i think declarer knew enough about the distribution not to be tempted by that :)|pg||
nt|sharynr: very difficult|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for sure|pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: a spec reminds me that the trump squeeze was his idea :)|pg||
nt|haans: 5@D is par|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: big winner|pg||
nt|bjacobs: East is copying North with these @S10 leads ... and indeed, it's a threatening play|pg||
mb|p|pc|d2|nt|haans: 2 clubs 1 spade|pg||
nt|haans: ok|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if S had a third D then maaaybeeeeeeee, but with a weak doubleton no way|pg||
nt|marlowepi: now cold|pg||
nt|rodal f: A normal one for a new push|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no, it is cold now|pg||
nt|sharynr: no partial strip and endplay?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: eliminate majors and exit D|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|bjacobs: Declarer will need to bang out the hearts from the top to make it?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Yes, but don't you think he will?|pg||
nt|haans: but he may look like a fool|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He will look foolish if East started with @HKxx and West has @DA|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So, it doesn't look too clear to me to make this|pg||
nt|bjacobs: First, West has to find the spade return|pg||
nt|rodal f: It is. Sr|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|jbgood: there is no attractive alternative to another spade?|pg||

pc|sA|nt|bjacobs: NOW, refusing the finesse is probably|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|bjacobs: probable|pg||
nt|haans: yes 3@C was not a good bid prefer 4@C showing @D support|pg||

nt|rodal f: Y it was a key|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s3|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|nt|bjacobs: Of course, now he's scared of a diamond ruff, I suppose|pg||

pc|s8|pc|d5|pc|h8|pc|dT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as a matter of general theory, the D lead was a weak choice. the only trick that E might ever be able to contribute to the defense is a club ruff, so he should lead a club|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d8|pc|c9|pc|h9|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jbgood: ruter tilbake - øst får ruterrøff eller nord to trumftapere|pg||
nt|jbgood: sry - private|pg||
nt|jbgood: a kib insisted that 4 spades would make even on a di shift last board - he disappeared before i could correct him:)|pg||
nt|athene: i thought there might be some tricky line for declarer, but just checked, and you can't do it|pg||
nt|haans: kibs has been very active in this match GOOD|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|pc|dK|pg||

nt|jbgood: an opportunity lost for M-T 2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I'd like to thank our excellent operator Liv Marit Grude for a fine job (also entering all those CR scores)|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|athene: the same as playing in 1nt or 3, never 2 |pg||
nt|rodal f: Ure a hard man Marshall:)|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: and thanks also to Roland, Jon and Hans for the commentary|pg||

nt|marlowepi: i prefer to think of myself as "frank" :)|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Finally our appreciation to the NBF (Inger Hjellemarken) for putting on the show.  One table is a lot better than none!|pg||
nt|athene: at least three of the players have an opening bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzyr: still...the scores are wrong|pg||
nt|rodal f: 17.40CET or in 11 min|pg||
nt|marlowepi: just like you :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: According to my notes, the next set is due to start in 3 minutes, but somehow, I don't think it will|pg||
nt|haans: 4@D error?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Me????? Soft. The body I ment:)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: now west really has to go 3@S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: frank|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk3: 23 minutes rather|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Bid it for the lead?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyr: no|pg||
nt|haans: ok|pg||
nt|jbgood: current score is 46-33 in favour of MR|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|Walddk3: 4@D was tactical. He wanted a diamond lead if partner were to lead against a heart contract|pg||
nt|athene: no-one did anything really silly here, but this should be 170|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bjacobs: N/S seem quite imaginative ... have enjoyed watching their play, even though not everything has come off|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jbgood: but a backfire|pg||
nt|bjacobs: big-time|pg||
nt|Walddk3: But now it backfired. Kvangraven wasn't in for tactics|pg||
nt|haans: Voll must have a talk with p|pg||
nt|jbgood: sometimes being smart is too smart even for prd|pg||
nt|bjacobs: How annoying.  This really is a supremely educational hand|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: declarer might actually have a bit of a club guess|pg||
nt|haans: dummys cards all aces|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk3: Should he not have guessed when Voll pulled to 5@C? I mean, he could have pulled to 5@D|pg||
pc|c9|nt|marlowepi: wrong playt by E and by S|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jbgood: does your statement also include passing on the E hand in the CR?|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think he should indeed have worked it out|pg||
nt|haans: me 2|pg||
pc|hA|nt|marlowepi: E needs to attend to his side suit immediately, at trick 2|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h6|pc|h5|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But it's easier to say this in my computer room, than at the table|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s5|pc|s4|nt|haans: i do assume that their was no passed out|pg||
nt|jbgood: ooops - that may be very true:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyr: the scores are WRONG|pg||
nt|marlowepi: had S covered spade king, which could not cost, contract sure to fail|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s9|pc|sA|nt|athene: now on a club back you are likely to finesse, if you are in game?|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: play the lead for singleton or @CQx rather than @CQJ doubleton|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: the alternative is rise @CA and hope the player with the trump has three diamonds so you can get the club away in time|pg||
nt|athene: of course after north cashes the @HK there's also a ruffing finesse in hearts|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E lucky|pg||

pc|h8|pc|h7|pc|hT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the spade layout is known, and it cannot matter to S if she takes her spade trick with the king or the nine, so she should cover the queen.|pg||
