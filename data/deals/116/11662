mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: it may come back to haunt them later....|pg||

pc|d4|nt|kiwibridge: it was indeed, but they may get a little back here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The key to this deal is East's decision to treat his hand as one suited, bidding 2@H rather than 2@C|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|an|16+|nt|kiwibridge: Gumby's carryover lead of 8 was reduced by just 2 in the first set so close match|pg||
nt|vugraphzzr: NS play a mostly natural system, and EW play strong club|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: The two finalists were the teams seeded 3 and 4|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But since the top two seeded teams both had a sponsor, it might just be that these were actually the best two theoretical teams in the eventg|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Hi Bill, and Gumby was so sold in the qualifying, losing only to Neill|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: solid|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bjacobs: Pauline Gumby and Warren Lazer are a life and bridge partnership spanning decades|pg||
