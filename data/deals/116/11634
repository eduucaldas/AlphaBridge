nt|haans: what a fight :)|pg||
nt|pkl: Lots of dynamite in the first deal|pg||
nt|sybarra: and here we go |pg||
nt|ralfwil: good afternoon from Sweden|pg||
nt|sybarra: challenging first hand    |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: one a  missing in  Schollaardt|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Operator?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@h on W. will they find it?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lestergold: hi Mike Gold Uk here|pg||
nt|xenya: E's double probably shows strong hand|pg||
nt|snorris:  hi all|pg||

mb|2C|nt|ralfwil: Hello Mike! Nice to see you again!|pg||

nt|haans: Both teams need a good win|pg||

nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||

nt|mmmakela: Hi all and welcome!|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Markku|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 level is the max here |pg||
mb|d|nt|hedyg: our operator is Francois Colin, bonjour Francois:)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2@C is an artificial game force|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|lestergold: hi Raif|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2@H is even more artificialer|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Bill|pg||
nt|pkl: I have no idea what the D means, so don't ask about the bidding|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If S bids 5@c I prefer 5@d from W|pg||
nt|sybarra: but E/W might get too high |pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Hi Sabine.  I guess I'll let you make the 2@c/1@d suggestions.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: @H cheriehi all|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Sabine|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello Marshall|pg||
nt|haans: and he got it|pg||
nt|xenya: and S's pass is strong|pg||
nt|snorris:  demands redouble if passed|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Bergen style raise and Ron is miniumum|pg||
nt|mmmakela: this is the match to decide bronze medal|pg||
nt|sybarra: or N/S  for that matter|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|h bertens: nice 800 to start with|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 5 obvious losers|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 3@D a make|pg||
mb|p|nt|jstokes: good dummy for Versace -- right ace, spade J|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS CC: http://tinyurl.com/539d3g|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and an easy 3 @C here,  S hand nearly perfecto |pg||
nt|xenya: this should make|pg||
nt|snorris:  a lucky 3nt..|pg||
nt|sybarra: :( N is not listening |pg||
pc|d5|nt|snorris:  but quit good after easts double|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Shirley. Not the easiest contract to make|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure its makeable at all |pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe Zeeberg proves me wrong |pg||
nt|smoller: 8 tricks only|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Steen,  welcome |pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Shirley Ybarra, Ralf Willquist and Steen Møller|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree |pg||
pc|dA|nt|h bertens: 500|pg||
nt|xenya: This is a semifinal, Round 3 of 4|pg||
nt|pelu: need a @C-ruff to defeat 4@H|pg||
nt|pelu: is 3@D to play or 3½@H?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mdgraham: still, there is the danger of getitng forced |pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW probably do best to cash @SAK and switch to diamonds|pg||
nt|jstokes: yes, and crossing to dummy to lead a club increases that danger -- but increases the possibility of making|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2@H actually shows diamonds|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|xenya: well it's certainly a reasonable contract |pg||
nt|sybarra: ty Roland |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even 3S ttypically puts enough pressure on opps in auctions like this wherethey have not made one natural bid|pg||
nt|roghog: glad you can interpret for us, Bill|pg||
nt|bjacobs: E/W play, in my opinion, one of the world's most interesting systems|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: @D switch early is good|pg||
nt|smoller: thank you, nice to see you|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: this save a bit gungho|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jcmax: I am wondering why Madala did not choose a preempt at 1st opportunity|pg||
nt|pelu: NS is a new partnership - so some explanation for the bidding misunderstanding|pg||
pc|sA|nt|roghog: agreed. nothing else anywhere near it|pg||
nt|haans: Fantunes system text by Daniel Neill 29 pages): http://bridgewithdan.com/systems/Fantoni_Nunes.txt|pg||
nt|bjacobs: No artificial forcing opening ... just a lot of natural ones, 1@C, 1@D, 1@H and 1@S|pg||
nt|xenya: exactly|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|bessi2: now he'll just discard club and except a small minus|pg||
nt|bessi2: accept i mean :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Peter, Ralf and specs|pg||
nt|mmmakela: had S responded on 2-level he'd probably have bought it|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: lucky lead and it still makes a loss|pg||
nt|h bertens: back to 800|pg||
nt|santyclz: 4@h has some play e-w but doesn't seem likely to be bid.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good afternoon to Mathias Bruun|pg||
nt|mbruun: Hi all|pg||
nt|xenya: The 24-imp lead is serious but can be overcome over the remaining 24 boards|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Federico Lizzio|pg||
nt|feffo: hi all, hi Roland and tks|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|ralfwil: W:s hand is VERY strong in this situation, so 5@d is obvious for me and my P will bid 6@h|pg||
nt|pkl: Seems like a draw. West will play the spade ace soon to keep South out, then claim 13 tricks|pg||
nt|pkl: Yes - Wests hand is almost to good.|pg||
nt|feffo: the situation for Denmark is very bad, so now try to play very aggresive|pg||
nt|feffo: N thinking bid  7 @H|pg||
nt|feffo: or 7NT|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3NT is no success. In the other room Fantroni found the master bid of 5@C|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good afternoon to Mike Graham|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good afternoon all|pg||
pc|dK|nt|h bertens: to 500|pg||
pc|d8|nt|xenya: hello Mathias|pg||
nt|mbruun: After serious calculations Ill take it for 1 IMP every hand|pg||

nt|Walddk4: But then we have a tie|pg||
nt|april7: hello everybody|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello Avram|pg||

nt|mbruun: Impressive to reach 5C|pg||
nt|mbruun: Hi |pg||
nt|pelu: wellcome Mike - I was alone un the hole world :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: with no clubs honors on side this hand falls apart |pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|nt|feffo: the some contract in OR|pg||
nt|feffo: same|pg||
pc|d7|nt|haans: and very hard to learn|pg||

pc|c5|pc|s8|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|haans: looking at it but not really trying|pg||
nt|bjacobs: As one who is in fact playing with it (or trying to), I can tell you that it's a lot of fun|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|snorris:  so some much needed imps to Denmark|pg||
nt|xenya: so 8 imps to Denmark|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|nt|feffo: done by Versace|pg||
pc|c2|nt|april7: to late now|pg||
pc|c9|pg||

nt|marlowepi: outbid them in any other suit. 1S allows NS to find a red suit too|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good afternoon to Peter Koch Larsen|pg||
nt|pkl: Hello all|pg||
nt|feffo: hi Peter, wlc|pg||
nt|xenya: but well played by W for only one undertrick|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: look at other room result !|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mdgraham: no - 5@c looks wrong|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=804&qshowflag=1  running scores Group A|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2@H = 10-13 with hearts, and maybe a minor|pg||
nt|mmmakela: but as the OR result shows well done to bid bergen|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: ah, here we go|pg||
nt|santyclz: Harmon Edgar points out 5@cs is there for those who bid @cs as a suit.|pg||
nt|snorris:  another "lucky" 5 @ds|pg||
nt|smoller: Slam in NT and majors|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jcmax: in any event -500 is way better than -800|pg||
nt|roghog: another fascinating idea|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2@S is an enquiry, not showing spades|pg||
nt|april7: 4@H with a deep finesse in @H|pg||
nt|mbruun: 3 NT by NS, maybe hard to reach|pg||
nt|xenya: tough for N|pg||
nt|mbruun: To get the excitement back in the match, he´ll better pass|pg||
nt|snorris:  actually quit good contract too|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 4@H looks easy to get to here, but can be defeated |pg||
mb|2N|nt|haans: long way to 9th trick|pg||
nt|xenya: i tend to agree with the pass|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, it's a swingy hand -- just what Denamrk needs |pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: club lead, diamond switch|pg||
mb|3S|nt|marlowepi: 4H was there too|pg||
nt|pelu: in CR W in 5@hX - exp -2|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hej Sten! Det var ett tag sedan vi sågs!|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: 5 @H good sac but ns can make 11|pg||
mb|4D|nt|mdgraham: what?|pg||
nt|hedyg: this cannot be right|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unless Versace is in 5@Hx|pg||
nt|marlowepi: double probably prepares for showing a value raise to 3H|pg||
nt|jcmax: Bocchi doubles 2@S here because his hand is not all about hearts. he has some constructive values and all of them outside hearts. Bidding 3@H would show a different kind of hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sabine said it better:)|pg||
nt|jcmax: no, I just used more words :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: people seldom outbid me in THAT respect:)|pg||
nt|jcmax: male and female?|pg||
nt|xenya: well swing goes the other way...|pg||
nt|snorris:   lets prey for a @h lead...|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: what on earth is going on here? |pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2NT denied a minor, hence 6+ hearts|pg||
nt|sybarra: @S lead will give declarer the temp |pg||
nt|sybarra: *tempo|pg||
nt|pkl: 3@S is preemptive with four cards. On the actual hand, I could be tempted to stay low with 2@S|pg||
nt|april7: still 100 for NS|pg||
nt|snorris:  not enough..|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and in fact the NS cards fit extremely well - 4@S is on|pg||
nt|pelu: over 4@S - correct to go in 5@H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West knows there is a huge red suit fit|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@H could be a double-shot - making or goos sac|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @S is the "big bid"  4 @S  sign off |pg||
nt|smoller: yes Ralf, no time has past|pg||
mb|4N|nt|hedyg: 2@s weak 1suiter . 5+ cards|pg||
nt|feffo: mmmmmmmmhhhhhhhhhhhhhh|pg||
nt|xenya: and no switch afterwards...|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: that makes no sense either|pg||
nt|jstokes: better but still seems unlikely|pg||
nt|mdgraham: reckon West bid 4@S and South 5@H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: then double by West|pg||
nt|bessi2: yep,  that seems plausible|pg||
nt|marlowepi: do i get to choose?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Once again, e-w's 9 card club fit was undisclosed.|pg||
nt|jcmax: It seems like declarer has to lose 11S, 2@H and 2@D tricks. Making this contract would be tough|pg||
nt|santyclz: Who cares about @cs.|pg||
nt|santyclz: See you later folks, I've been re-assigned.|pg||
nt|jcmax: see you|pg||
nt|marlowepi: see you Joe|pg||
nt|marlowepi: send a  postcard|pg||
nt|jcmax: Maala is trying to figure out a lie of the cards consistent with the bidding that would let him make his contract|pg||
nt|bjacobs: To show spades, West would have to bid 2NT.  The system can at times make your head spin|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And the system is not clever enough to know that South has all the hearts, unfortunately|pg||
nt|roghog: Leader is thrown in, so only 1 down|pg||
nt|pkl: Difficult to find the club lead after D - now 11 easy tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: i think it should be -1 again|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://psbridge.gotdns.com/bbo/allvug/  - Vugraph Hand Records(PDF)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: getting my morning coffee brb|pg||
mb|5C|nt|feffo: now yes|pg||
nt|snorris:  right :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: It looks like this down one without any endplay|pg||
nt|xenya: 2 trump tricks, a club and a heart (2nd heart loser goes on a diamond) -- plus the two tricks already lost|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi |pg||
nt|smoller: The best slam is probably en spades, because a 4-1 break in hearts can be handled|pg||
mb|5D|nt|marlowepi: he shouldnt have bid so much without the 8 of diamonds (though even then diamond lead & spade back beats it|pg||
nt|pkl: Any comments from anyone are much appreciated |pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all  |pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Sten!|pg||
nt|smoller: It club ace is not knocked out at trick one|pg||
mb|p|nt|dima:  Morning all|pg||
mb|6C|nt|sybarra: not sure N has enough tempo to find 9th trick |pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: Easy -1 after a @h lead, but now....|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2 colors to handle here. Belive the @C will be played from N because of the enteryes|pg||
nt|Walddk5: there is no   n   in Wikner   operator|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good morning to Dima Nikolenkov and Bertil G Johnson|pg||

nt|pkl: As Ralf pointed out, an initial heart lead would give E-W a trump promotion.  North now gets nine tricks no sweat after the spade guess|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a small @c is very clear|pg||
nt|april7: now 3 down |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: another diamond ruff, and play club finesse?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: (after drawing trumps, of course)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jcmax: but E could just overtake and cash the @HJ unless he was asleep|pg||
nt|h bertens: not anymore|pg||
pc|c3|nt|marlowepi: yes was expecting that--in any case i dont see how retaining club ace in hand can help, unless he is worried about 4-1 trumps|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ues, i thought you meaNT qj DOUBLETON|pg||
nt|haans: Duboin must hold all @D|pg||

pc|sA|nt|rodal f: The BBO-TV: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: could even play @CA first|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mdgraham: North won't know the position of the heart honours, so West may have @CK|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ralfwil: do you all agree with D over 1@s with 6-4 in minors?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|snorris:  13 imps to Angelini|pg||

nt|snorris:  only 12|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ralfwil: Looks like a correct play! If @s are 3-2 can check 4-1 in @h|pg||

nt|pkl: I agree with the D - even with 6 @D|pg||
nt|pkl: Would anyone have bid clubs instead of doubling.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: useful swing to make the match closer|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: still, it allows our imagination free rein :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: Francois is a new operator :)|pg||
nt|h bertens: after d for tke king he could cash ace of c and play q of spades|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Now we check their non-slam bidding|pg||
nt|rodal f: A better bid Ralf|pg||
nt|pkl: I would - after seeing all four hands|pg||
nt|feffo: strange for Fantoni|pg||
nt|snorris:  same theme|pg||
nt|snorris:  5 minor beats 3nt|pg||
nt|sybarra: good timing to arrive I think |pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|h bertens: then he wins|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This will likely be the last appearance on BBO vugraph for Vilhjalmsson and Sigurjonsson. After Dec 31 our new rule will be enforced. People with surnames longer than 10 characters ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: will not be allowed to ...|pg||
nt|milton_se: quite an aggressive double|pg||
nt|smoller: No fit, but 3NT easy|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jstokes: and it's not that easy :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so the 2@S opening shows a profit there|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed it isn't|pg||
nt|hedyg: but he will learn quickly :) courage Francois!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not absloutley certain, but I think 2@D=both majors|pg||
nt|roghog: not too tough a test here|pg||
nt|haans: that 2 is weeeeeeeeak|pg||
nt|sybarra: is this (mini) multi?|pg||
nt|haans: can we call it anything?|pg||
nt|xenya: chance for the Danes|pg||
mb|p|nt|h bertens: should have taken ace of d|pg||
nt|jcmax: Sementa apparently did very well on board 1 in the other bringing hme 3NT with an overtrick after a @S lead.|pg||
nt|sybarra: garbage multi  I am told |pg||
nt|Walddk4: play|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 2@d first and perhaps a D later to show @c|pg||
nt|dima:  Looks like German pair plays weak NT and 4-card majors ...|pg||
mb|3N|nt|snorris:  thay should be warned..|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Same applies for Schollaardt of course|pg||
nt|pkl: Brøndum bid 2@C in the open room.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Tell his story|pg||
nt|rodal f: E a bit more careful here contra the OR|pg||
nt|pkl: A most sensible rule - and I've heard they will also disallow any players with a 4-letter word last name.|pg||
nt|dima:  So we get some action here|pg||
nt|milton_se: will East be able too keep his spade entrance?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: it will take a heart lead to beat this it seems|pg||
nt|jstokes: hardly seems fair -- not only are Lauria-Versace two of the world's greatest players, they have a bid for everything |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Hi all|pg||
nt|bjacobs: They will cue 1st and 2nd round controls, so Nunes knows immediately that he is off 2 club losers|pg||
nt|dima:  I dont think so - if South gets a count signal on a herat play he will know hearts are likely to be 4=2=2=5 around the table|pg||
nt|feffo: in OR 5 @D by Versace, lead @C and down|pg||
nt|april7: W must take a @S ruff in hand, so a @H lead might have been best for the defence|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@D was a transfer to @Hs, W obviously raised to game|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mdgraham: will make on a diamond lead |pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|haans: spec think suicidal is best|pg||
nt|sybarra: in 3rd seat with this vulnerability |pg||
nt|sybarra: some number of nt?   best if West plays it |pg||
nt|sybarra: and every lead gives a trick  |pg||
pc|c2|nt|milton_se: if not, the 10C will be valuable|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|roghog: welcome|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Most top players cue-bid this way.  Cue 1st and 2nd round controls, and use Blackwood to check back whether you are off two aces|pg||
nt|pelu: 12 tricks in NT|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|xenya: well done|pg||
nt|snorris:  10 imps back|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe @D lead does not but who can lead q or 10 of @D? |pg||
pc|cT|nt|sybarra: I have some other suggestions which will remain private to me, thanks specs, ! |pg||
nt|ralfwil: I don´t like that save action  from W. Trust your partner!|pg||
nt|pkl: A most sensible 2@D and still a blood bath for EW. Sometimes stuff just happens |pg||
nt|rodal f: He will agree with u after the board:) Or might already now.|pg||
nt|dima:  upside down count I suppose by NS|pg||
nt|xenya: funny that these 2 hands should come one after another|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mdgraham: will make on a club lead, too|pg||
nt|sybarra: 12? |pg||
pc|c8|nt|mbruun: Angelini is tough to beat. 41-1 first set, and so far 15-0 in the second. I had a similar experience, when we got killed in the final in Champions Cup 2006 all the sets he played. |pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jcmax: Very tough for Bocchi here to stay out of game after partner freely bid 1@S. The question is: Did 31H confirm 4 cards in @S?|pg||
nt|haans: common in Norway to play garbage Multi + ordinally weak 2s|pg||
nt|mmmakela: hearts nicely, spades not|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes @S to the 10|pg||
pc|c5|nt|milton_se: and now?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|pkl: I don't know Ralf, depends very much on your defensive style|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|pkl: But the actual pips in @C could be a warning to stay low|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hedyg: he can claim now|pg||
nt|milton_se: good def|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: now @Ds have been picked for him|pg||
pc|s6|nt|haans: Corretion: STRIK3R: nope, not common to play garbage multi anymore|pg||
nt|haans: only in 3rd|pg||
nt|dima:  So herats have been killed for a moment|pg||
nt|milton_se: should go at least one down now|pg||
nt|dima:  Specs honor fine effort by South|pg||
nt|dima:  So Declarer has now 2@s + 2@d + @cA, might endplay South for 6th trick|pg||
nt|sybarra: early for me,  I didnt see it at once |pg||
pc|s2|nt|pkl: Røn chose the trump lead. This time it cost a trick|pg||
nt|feffo: i hope for Denmark that now change the "wind" :)|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good morning to Martin Carroll|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Morning all|pg||
nt|dima:  Hello Martin :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Dima|pg||
pc|d2|nt|dima:  On N2 in the open room constructive raise was left in to make 2@s so Germany is on the board|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|nt|ralfwil: It´s basic for me. trust your partner and bid only if you have a very solid suit|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|smoller: 13 tricks now :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: Steen, he seems to only want 12 |pg||
pc|s8|nt|kiwibridge: J@C then would have been better|pg||
pc|s3|nt|dima:  Lets count NS tricks now - 2@h + 2@d + 1@s + 1@c + ? ...|pg||
nt|milton_se: now back to advantage EW :)|pg||
nt|dima:  Maybe North should have cleared @s trick for his side ...|pg||
nt|milton_se: y a spade we needed|pg||
nt|milton_se: was|pg||
nt|dima:  West is unlikely to have 4 for his 1NT response|pg||
nt|dima:  And @d J is surely an entry after the play at trick 1|pg||
nt|dima:  well WAS an entry|pg||
nt|milton_se: endplaying pard isn't popular :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes not much fun in this post mortem I reckon|pg||
nt|dima:  In the OR twoway sweidish club got to 1NT from NS making|pg||
nt|milton_se: Wikner should be able to read this now|pg||
nt|mmmakela: he's ok|pg||
pc|sK|nt|xenya: trying to set up clubs, but the plan doesn't work here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: so the actual score is now 97-48|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It hurts to tell the Danish supporters that in real life Italy has 10 IMPs more than shown on the scoreboard. The last board in the previous set was not recorded, and it gave Italy ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 10 IMPs|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dQ|nt|pkl: Denmark certainly needs some points to keep the match exciting|pg||
pc|d4|nt|feffo: sure Peter, starting very well in this segment|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm afraid this will bring even more imps to Angelini|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|xenya: of course S didn't discard a club|pg||
nt|mbruun: Roland you are a partyspoiler|pg||
nt|smoller: Yes, they wont give the diamond trick back|pg||

nt|feffo: 1nt 12-14|pg||
nt|pkl: 4@S can't win as EW can get a club trump or a trump trick. |pg||
nt|feffo: 3 imp's more for Denmark|pg||
nt|april7: a slam |pg||
nt|snorris:  with no @c lead or @h lead and @c switch 5 @c is a winner|pg||
mb|d|nt|roghog: another non-slam that isn't too demanding|pg||
nt|paulg:  Hi everyone|pg||
nt|haans: we had some talk from specs here|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Paul,  welcome |pg||
nt|haans: yes Hi Paul|pg||
nt|pkl: A lot of play looks obvious when you can see all four hands. In real life you can only see two.|pg||
nt|pkl: I also play a weak 1NT but feel slightly uncomfortable in third hand vulnerable|pg||
nt|mbruun: Pretty staightforward. No swing|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Do you know what kind of "way out" NS are playing Steen?|pg||
nt|smoller: No, sorry|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3S|nt|mdgraham: oh dear, G****r - don't tell Roland|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh my, what is happening here?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@H by West, of course...|pg||
nt|hedyg: Francois?|pg||
nt|hedyg: vraiment 4@H par S?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: No problems with the aces and kings.  |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Not often you see the same contract made by NS and EW on the same hand at this level|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East could have passed, hoping for a re-opening double and a penalty leave-in...but of course there is no guarantee of a re-opening double|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and you don't often get rich defending a one-level contract  |pg||
nt|pelu: decl has to play @Cs first - if he play @D to A N can play a@S2 and set up 3 @S-tricks for defense|pg||
nt|po-s: looks like some kind of dont|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: merci|pg||
nt|bessi2: i wonder what the range of 1N is,  seems strange not to try for slam with east hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: so it was a South African Texas after all, 4@C=@H|pg||
nt|jstokes: I suspect 4@C was Gerber (asking aces) and he found two missing|pg||
nt|mdgraham: then it was a good idea to stop. |pg||
nt|bessi2: ahhh.. yes.. i think you're right|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1NT might well be 13-15|pg||
nt|feffo: me too Peter|pg||
nt|snorris:  well.. 2 times @hs is tough..|pg||
mb|p|nt|pkl: Personally I often find that to be one to many|pg||
nt|rodal f: No trancfeer|pg||
nt|pkl: That is not the position where I upgrade 11 points ;-)|pg||
nt|april7: is this forcing?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hej P-O!|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Lindqvist to blame|pg||
nt|paulg:  is Rekstad older than Lindqvist?|pg||
nt|sybarra: may need some help from defense here|pg||
nt|sybarra: or a spec rightly suggest help from supernatural powers |pg||
nt|feffo: :)|pg||
nt|feffo: 5 @C by Lauria in OR|pg||
nt|smoller: 4 @S is makeable double dummy|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bjacobs: I'm guessing, but it's common nowadays with big clubs, that 1@H shows 19+, artificial|pg||
nt|roghog: 2@c some sort of semi-positive after that|pg||
nt|roghog: 1@s is probably the double-negative|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think the defence may already have helped by not doubling|pg||
nt|dima:  At the level of 1NT it does happen :) but you meant another level :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: True|pg||
nt|xenya: i like N's 3N -- considering the state of the match|pg||
pc|h2|nt|xenya: yes, "serious" 3N|pg||
nt|mbruun: Most Danes play it as slammy with no shortage|pg||
nt|mmmakela: in final both EWs bid the good 5 H sacrafice, neither NS bid 5 S  2 board|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: good players don't bid on at the 5 level|pg||
nt|mmmakela: only when it's right they usually do lol|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: lol|pg||
nt|mmmakela: needs spades 3-2 and hearts 3-3 here|pg||
nt|mmmakela: or 4H with 3 spades|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bjacobs: A spec who seems like he knows what he's talking about says: 1@H could also be hearts, 2@C showed 5-7|pg||
nt|ralfwil: another flat board|pg||
nt|pelu: In CR N (den) are in 2@Hx|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|mcarroll: a couple of overtrick imps to EW|pg||
nt|milton_se: just then?|pg||
nt|milton_se: ten|pg||
nt|dima:  If NS go passive it will be a push|pg||
nt|pkl: 3@S is an easy winner; against 5@C you must take the three first tricks|pg||
pc|dA|nt|pelu: now @S2 will defeat|pg||
nt|smoller: Looks like Sundelins spr¨ttlingar|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bjacobs: So then 3@C some sort of Stayman|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So in summary ... no one is playing SAYC at this table!!|pg||
nt|roghog: Perhaps we can convert yhem :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: good luck with that ...|pg||
nt|roghog: @c gives the 9th trick, so it's just about overtricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: think you are right Paul |pg||
nt|mbruun: 4 any after 3 Sp is shortage. Not 4 Sp though |pg||
pc|d2|nt|haans: close to endplayed|pg||
nt|haans: easy way our spades|pg||
nt|feffo: arrived more imp's for Denmark Peter? :)|pg||
nt|pelu: a "2" BUT WRONG SUIT :)|pg||

nt|ralfwil: but 4@h is also a nice contract|pg||
nt|feffo: maybe now we have a match|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|nt|april7: this will be a very quick claim|pg||
nt|smoller: hej Peo|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sunsamvar: oops|pg||
nt|bjacobs: oopsing all over the place.  Board 3 ... board 4|pg||
nt|roghog: perhaps we can convert them after all....|pg||
nt|paulg:  Thanks to all who have told me that Rekstad is over ten years older ... which may explain why he expected more for 1@s|pg||
nt|pkl: It now comes down to the play in clubs. It is one or two losers - if West ducks the jack, East might get a trick on the @C9|pg||
nt|pkl: We will see - it certainly will be a swing. |pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: true!|pg||
nt|dima:  looks like 10 tricks|pg||
nt|po-s: nope, looks like dont - diamondsand a higher|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sunsamvar: will Nunes find the @S lead ?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well this is real ugly if Nunes hits on a spade lead|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: it is between the majors|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Active or passive -that's the question|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: @H more likely i think|pg||
pc|s4|nt|roghog: difficult - you know partner has very little|pg||
nt|haans: time to remove dummys trumps|pg||

pc|sK|nt|kiwibridge: hurdle one successful|pg||
nt|mmmakela: shd've played 2 rounds spades first|pg||
pc|sT|nt|bjacobs: The fact that partner has only a little probably acts in favour of the heart lead.  Eg partner has @HK, you get an entry with one of your minor queens|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s8|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|pkl: West covers the jack, of course|pg||

nt|sssvablue: EW can save in the minors if they get involved, and will be pleased to find they make 6|pg||
mb|3C|nt|hedyg: 1NT for EW is 14-16|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 10-13, spades, could have a minor ...|pg||
nt|dima:  That is the kind of hand where people bid 3@h to show GF with @h shortness without 4@s|pg||
nt|pkl: They might find that their save was an underbid|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Ron always has @S|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jcmax: I wonder how high Madala is planning to bid|pg||
nt|paulg:  Slam on a 2-2 trump break?|pg||
nt|haans: how many would have bid only 2@S?|pg||
nt|pkl: South has a perfect hand for 4@H. How could North ever know?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Surely S is not thinking of anything except Game over a weak NT?|pg||
nt|dima:  2NT is surely some Multiway something- does anyone know the meaning?|pg||
nt|pkl: 3@S asks for singleton. But why?|pg||
nt|feffo: after 3 @S i don't think Stan|pg||
nt|po-s: well, the D10 was making life easy for declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|roghog: This is the Fantunes opening that really doesn't look sound|pg||
nt|sybarra: S was playing "junk" stayman |pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: It's not sound, I suppose, but it puts considerable pressure on the opponents|pg||
nt|roghog: Must gain more than it costs, I guess|pg||
nt|sybarra: I play constructive raises  so 2 @S for me|pg||
nt|dima:  Rather brave 3@h by Wrang|pg||
nt|milton_se: well, not more than a good D fit and an outside ace will do|pg||
nt|dima:  Now take your money|pg||
nt|xenya: as expected, 12 more imps to Angelini on 3 -- so the real score now is 109-48|pg||
mb|p|nt|h bertens: now we know|pg||
nt|sssvablue: Presumably they have found the minors, now they may get pushed to 6|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ralfwil: What do you think about 3@c from W instead of 2@s, showing a @c-suit and a 3-card @s support?|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'd show a limit raise to 3@s|pg||
nt|paulg:  8 losers|pg||
nt|pkl: Will East bid on? I certainly would bid!|pg||
nt|feffo: in OR 5@H by Lauria|pg||
nt|sssvablue: And NS have a good Red/White save in 6@H :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Well spotted Stan, red/white, the Danish colours|pg||
nt|pkl: An excellent result for Italy in the open room|pg||
nt|feffo: very interested situation now|pg||
nt|snorris:  this should be 8 tricks nomore no less|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mdgraham: which states that, in a slam auction, find out how many aces are missing. Subtract that number from eight, and do not bid at the level given by the answer. Also known as the Rule ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: of Eight |pg||
nt|hedyg: great dummy|pg||
nt|smoller: Good practical bid by West (opposite a passed partner), but can he make it?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: As Steen said. With open cards 4@s is makeable, if he plays N with @dAx after having played @cA and a small|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bjacobs: You can see how West might well be guessing over these openings ... the two level openings definitely roll the dice|pg||
nt|dima:  Specs suggest both minors with the follow-up showing shortness (now available per inference)|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|haans: STRIK3R: so 2@h would have shown 12+ and @h or 3-7 and @s, think they play it like, that not sure|pg||
nt|paulg:  Easy to say looking at the hand, but 4@h is an imprecise slam try|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I vote for @dQ as a lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: Would have been the best here buy I belive Q@C is a normal one:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: but|pg||
nt|pkl: The @DQ sets 4@S, but I would also have led the @CQ|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|smoller: Sorry, he has lots of tricks with @D J in dummy|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mmmakela: this looks quite interesting|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North isn't|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bessi2: i feel east must dbl 2c with that shape at that vulnerability|pg||
nt|feffo: push fantoni|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hedyg: all cards sitting well for him, can make this|pg||
nt|sssvablue: If EW stumble into 7, North better lead a spade|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 10 tricks and next|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|jcmax: you mean i suppose. But that may not be part of their system.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mcarroll: Now the @H7 gets a ruff|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|h7|nt|roghog: It has to be there, though, to make a complete system, as Goran reminds me|pg||
nt|pkl: Anyway - this lead is just as good|pg||
nt|pkl: ... just not anymore - but who can blame East?|pg||
nt|pkl: Ouch - I´m babbling right now|pg||
nt|dima:  I think if you overcall 3@h on those hands partner better watch his steps about raising to 4 level|pg||
nt|pkl: Lots of imps to Italy here. Lets see how many|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: another big + for Denmark on 4|pg||
nt|mmmakela: good principle: if lead from 2 small trumps lead the small if expect length on your right|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: very good|pg||
nt|mmmakela: like here wd be nice to have the 8 left|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes indeed|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|pkl: So thirteeen tricks - anyone now what that is in imps?|pg||
nt|sssvablue: If my math is right the overtrick doesn't cost an IMP|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hedyg: i think E remembers that his pd passed 1@s and is lying low|pg||
nt|mbruun: Should be down one, if North manages to duck Sp Q |pg||
nt|xenya: a @S switch might have created some problems |pg||
pc|h3|nt|bjacobs: Well, it's not THAT different from a weak two, as a lot of people play them.  Just a different point range|pg||
nt|sssvablue: 15 IMPs|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|mbruun: With CKxxx, never a chance|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mdgraham: West might have responded 1NT (if that would be natural)|pg||
nt|bessi2: but they play strong club so pass can have some hcp easily|pg||
pc|h8|nt|bjacobs: I thought he might upgrade that hand to a 1@S opening ... but no|pg||
pc|hT|nt|rodal f: If @S8 was at N.... Then enteryes enough for use the @D there|pg||
nt|dima:  that @h 7 is worth a lot of IMPs|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|hK|pc|c2|nt|sunsamvar: how do they handle a 8 point 6 card major ?|pg||
nt|xenya: but yes, it's down anyway|pg||
pc|s5|nt|pkl: Can you blame NS for the result?|pg||
nt|feffo: was better 6@H by north|pg||

nt|mbruun: Probably playing for a swing, but this time it didnt matter|pg||

mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|ralfwil: nice contract! 7@c|pg||
mb|3C|nt|bjacobs: Speaking of thrills and spills ... |pg||

nt|sunsamvar: when vul it could lead to problems...|pg||
nt|mbruun: 9 tricks in clubs on a heartguess NS |pg||

nt|sybarra: 4 nt,  good clubs suggests a spec|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: this shd be -2|pg||
mb|6C|nt|mdgraham: some pairs like that as it saves playing in 4@H after 1N-4@H with a 6-3 spade fit and 2-2 heart fit  |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: this is such a magic hand!  |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: @CT = good stopper|pg||
nt|feffo: and now 2nt|pg||
nt|sssvablue: In the open room, Versace responded 3@d to 1@h, and the Danes doubled.|pg||
nt|sssvablue: the double fit was never revealed|pg||
mb|p|nt|h bertens: looks like the only lead....|pg||
nt|jcmax: will he put in the 9?|pg||

nt|pkl: ... which describes bidding by EW|pg||
nt|feffo: now is better Peter :)|pg||
nt|snorris:  the @c ruff was a bit strange|pg||
nt|sybarra: but that should be a push|pg||
nt|sybarra: you may be right Ralf,  but looking at the hand,  not sure what W cues that makes E happy |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcmax: That will feel like a very good result for Italy|pg||
nt|sybarra: another slam |pg||
nt|mbruun: Pedestrian 4 H|pg||
mb|1S|nt|hedyg: ok so strong @c it is|pg||
nt|paulg:  are we back at the goulash event?|pg||
nt|haans: very easy to bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: no wasted values in the @C suit |pg||
nt|pkl: Westra in the open room was a bit more cautious as West - perhaps Sigurjonsson was helped by his system?|pg||
nt|pkl: 2@S Michaels - 5 hearts and a minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|pkl: ... sorry - it is spades and clubs|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|roghog: Lauria Versace overboard next door. Can the Swedes do better?|pg||

nt|dima:  So now EW kann sniff around for a slam|pg||
nt|pkl: EW 3NT? |pg||
nt|feffo: i supposed|pg||
nt|sssvablue: Was 2@s weak or muiderberg?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Showing 4 aces and a K, W can see a singleton @s on E and cover 3cards with two aces and a K|pg||
mb|2D|nt|hedyg: they might be playing ice-relay precision|pg||
nt|jcmax: There seem to be a lot of competitive doubles in this match. |pg||
nt|h bertens: does not easy to bid 4@H after this start|pg||
nt|h bertens: does not soud like english.......|pg||
nt|h bertens: sound|pg||
nt|lestergold: west could have shown extras by a redouble and east may have upgraded holding Ks over the overcall|pg||
nt|bjacobs: yes, that would be, so, SAYC'ish|pg||
nt|sybarra: not short suit bid |pg||
nt|paulg:  probably showing some non-minimum|pg||
nt|sybarra: which might have helped both pard and defenders here|pg||
nt|haans: think 3@C min and then steps|pg||
nt|pkl: Can Wortel resist that one? I would not|pg||
nt|dima:  Is 1NT 14-16?|pg||
nt|feffo: is a weak in Denmark system, correct Peter?|pg||
nt|pkl: So... how easy is it to set? 3@C indicates hearts, I guess. A tad more difficult now?|pg||
nt|pkl: 2@S is weak - can be five cards|pg||
nt|xenya: well perhaps it wasn't easy to work out the layout |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: just 4@S here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: I now like 3@d from E|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: actually it is only the @C suit quality that is the problem in a slam|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sybarra: now cue bids|pg||
nt|mbruun: Need swingy boards to catch up with these strong Italians. Running out of time|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: West's hand is looking very good here|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jcmax: If West could have scraped up a 3@D bid East surely would bid game, but not so easy to visualise game with the W hand|pg||
nt|h bertens: wel done|pg||
nt|roghog: A penalty double. Heard our recommendation!|pg||
nt|sybarra: or shape?|pg||
nt|milton_se: apparently|pg||
nt|snorris:  no after the king of @c lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: i am told just strong @c|pg||
nt|mdgraham: they might have found a few more bids in that case|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: imps for the Swedes here|pg||
nt|rodal f: N have a auto 4@S now but will W lead @HK?|pg||
nt|pkl: West must play low when South leads a club.|pg||
nt|dima:  Controled stop|pg||
nt|dima:  Without @d lead Wrang will be happy to see @s finesse fail|pg||
nt|milton_se: 6 is only on a finesse, though|pg||
nt|mmmakela: some might open the S hand differently...|pg||
mb|4D|nt|hedyg: Francois tells me they play precision|pg||
nt|mcarroll: No swing - they play 3NT in Open|pg||
nt|feffo: very interested board|pg||
nt|pkl: 2@S is exactly five spades and 7-11|pg||
nt|pkl: South needed to lead a heart - or the @DA and switch to hearts. |pg||
nt|sssvablue: Thanks very much to the knowledgeable kibbitzers who have been a great help so far|pg||
nt|sssvablue: It would appear that the line is difficult, but almost all lines will lead to success |pg||
nt|sssvablue: with both red aces onside and the 10@c dropping doubleton|pg||
nt|feffo: ya, but all us knows Fulvio, this board will be finish in 1 hour more or less :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: well, E was not far off a 2S bid last time. but i am not sure if 3D is a better call than D|pg||
nt|smoller: 5 @S will not be in any danger|pg||
mb|4N|nt|sunsamvar: if the defence does not touch @H they could get it many down|pg||
nt|haans: and B|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 3 sp asked for singleton I am told |pg||
mb|5H|nt|mbruun: Wests bidding just shows 18-19 NT. Upgrading the clubsuit|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: very likely W needs something different for a RDBL in their methods|pg||
mb|5S|nt|xenya: well this is not a board to get swingy on|pg||
nt|mbruun: If EW reaches a slam 6Ht will be played by West, where the diamondlead is obvious|pg||
nt|xenya: pretty obvious from S too|pg||
nt|april7: why not, should they reach 6, then .......|pg||
nt|mbruun: Yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: lol|pg||
nt|dima:  Well without @d lead it is better then finesse, I think @s AK + @s to the J ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|pkl: ... it doesn't really matter. Always ten tricks, I guess|pg||
nt|xenya: well done|pg||
pc|sT|nt|bjacobs: Well it was a good comment - maybe North might have played 3 rounds of spades|pg||
nt|ritong: or @h A and a @h|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, Henri, he develops a heart ruff that way|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Actually, the @HA and another is the way to get 800, as the hearts can be played succesfully with dummy's two entries|pg||
nt|ritong: the difference between 500 and 800 is not huge, imp speaking, with the result other room 2 imps or so|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: True Bill as a hundred specs tell me|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yeah, specs can be like that :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but Henri it could mean a 10 imp swing if the Italians were only in game in the other room|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: sry 8 imps|pg||
nt|paulg:  At the club West would have bid, but the Italians like a stronger hand for their 2-suiter overcalls when vulnerable|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Here is a classical duck from W when s plays @c towards dummy. otherwise S has 2 discards|pg||
nt|rodal f: If so there are 1 @H and 2@D loosers. Even 10 by a @HK lead. 3 @Ds run |pg||
nt|pkl: Duck and EW has three diamond and one heart trick|pg||
nt|ralfwil: one trick to win and 2 to loose. But this time it does not matter|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y. The @D8|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Sry Did´nt see the @d8 so a duck was essential|pg||
nt|pkl: I first overlooked the @D8, I do not believe that 4@S wins if W ducks the club|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bjacobs: I don't think the italians did anything wrong here ... at this level, you have to disrupt big club auctions|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: not 10|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s2|nt|roghog: Well, if partner is sticking his neck out with 2@s, you risk chopping it off with 3@s, I suppose|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The 3@S bid takes away N/S's 3@D and 3@H bids.  If Nunes didn't have @C10, he would have earned a big swing|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Sometimes, you just don't know|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: True Bill. Nunes was betting the opps had slam|pg||
nt|roghog: always, in my case|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|nt|gioffi: 11 tricks|pg||
nt|rodal f: I missed it 2 Ralf:)      :(|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's a mysterious game.  Watching it on VuGraph demystifies it a little, but you also discover that no-one can play the perfect game|pg||
nt|mbruun: Invert Wests minorholding, and slam is very good |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bjacobs: Fortunately|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: @S q shd have been ducked i think|pg||
nt|roghog: Still has an entry to play @h from dummy|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lestergold: no risks|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Tough play here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: good play|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but the points are counted out now|pg||
nt|roghog: Well, he's seen KKQ from South|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He might just get it right.  If North had started with A109x, he could play 3 rounds of spades|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and he shd place @Ha with north|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's a matter of who has @H9, he knows about @HA|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So technically, finessing here is playing for North to make a mistake|pg||
nt|sybarra: that didnt hurt declarer |pg||

nt|marlowepi: but i agree that W could have done something over the double. probably not that likely that EW have a game, and there is some danger in getting to a no-play 4H if W bids freely ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: over D, but i think probably that danger is not so great|pg||
nt|icearif: sry- private message...in strange language...|pg||
nt|ritong: np|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I don't know, there was "pass" ...|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: a star points out " bd8 is a beauty-3nt down on hk lead foll by hq-squeezes decl "|pg||
nt|ritong: oh yeah|pg||
nt|ritong: 5 toppies, though|pg||

nt|xenya: was not obvious though|pg||
nt|snorris:  we have a slam|pg||
nt|mmmakela: Swedes on the scoreboard finally!|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sunsamvar: lol|pg||
nt|dima:  and here too :)|pg||
nt|snorris:  6@hs|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes :)|pg||
nt|pelu: 3NT by EW bad stoppers - but 9 fast tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: predict 4@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|milton_se: looks like a 2-way club and transfer|pg||
mb|3N|nt|pkl: What to bid as South? How probable is slam with a passed partner?|pg||
nt|dima:  Transfer I suppose , constructive raise from South, no slam interest by West|pg||
nt|feffo: cosa vorresti che fosse rimasto scongelato?|pg||
nt|feffo: sorry all|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 1@H transfer|pg||
nt|mmmakela: S:T Erik the largest bridge club in the world with it's aprox 2500 members (in Stockholm)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: wrong again :(|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: although if west does not cash @hs immediately..|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: in real life Nunes will probably lead a @C and def will be unable to cash the toppies|pg||
nt|ritong: and why would he|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: all no trumps and red suit games make but club lead defeats slams|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ritong: how so, 1@s?|pg||
nt|roghog: @c lead to 10 and K. What then?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sigurjonsson had problems to fin a pass:) Nice quality|pg||
nt|xenya: 5 imps to Angelini on 5, when they stopped in 3@H in the other room, just making|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would have predicted 3 nt from the other side |pg||
nt|ralfwil: Agree Shirley!|pg||
pc|s7|nt|hedyg: 2@c some relay|pg||
pc|s9|nt|sunsamvar: tough to duck the @Ca on the lead tho|pg||
nt|roghog: very true|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That will beat it, but as Sunil points out, it's quite a defence|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i agree that the earlier pass by W followed by a last-second 4H looks a bit like a good guess after a self-inflicted endplay. however, if most of the time the E sequence would mean ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4 trumps, then W will have decent play opposite a LOT of hands, even:  xxx  Axxx  xx  xxxx|pg||
nt|lestergold: so lead makes a difference of three tricks here|pg||
nt|paulg:  a bit of work to do here, but will probably lead the @cA from hand at some point and it will get easier|pg||
nt|sssvablue: action double by S|pg||
nt|snorris:  2@s and 3@cs dont look natural|pg||
pc|d5|nt|hedyg: 3@s forcing|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: defence may be cashing 5 clubs.. so east cannot duck|pg||
nt|pkl: That 1@H was lead-directing, I presume|pg||
nt|rodal f: Belive the same but cost a trick|pg||
nt|sssvablue: Hopefully for the Danes the action won't be 4@c|pg||
nt|xenya: remember that the actual score is 114-50|pg||
nt|mbruun: East has a disgusting leadproblem |pg||
nt|mbruun: Probable a trump or SA|pg||
pc|d9|nt|pkl: In the open room, Westra also directed a heart lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: Running scores for new specs: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=805&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|feffo: N thinking what?|pg||
nt|april7: he will lead a @C, otherwise S must take the finesse and make 9 tricks at least|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: biggest here about 1200 I think|pg||
nt|mdgraham: possibly this sequence - two-level transfer and game jump - shows a stronger hand than a direct four-level transfer. |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mmmakela: ITA-GER 14-0 in the final|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: They play an usual system of opening leads ...|pg||
nt|sybarra: and we all would finesse the @D   |pg||
nt|sybarra: except if we sit up here|pg||
nt|smoller: The Danes bid the grand slam|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bjacobs: That shows either an odd number of clubs with an honour, or an even number of clubs without an honour|pg||
nt|ritong: visibly, the bell rung in fulvio s mind|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Definitely, but there's not much to go on|pg||
nt|mbruun: Nine tricks are there now|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N must be a serious slam try|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: It won't be easy to make this 4@S|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hedyg: with a better hand N would have cuebid over 3@s|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ritong: nunes doubled 1@c, then he might try for 4 @h tricks|pg||
nt|milton_se: another push -- low scores|pg||
nt|xenya:  i think they'll stop there|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|sybarra: am told:  Bocchi - Madala pair reached and made 6@s on  5|pg||
nt|sybarra: as we can see in the OR here|pg||
nt|paulg:  currently Duboin can see 7 tricks with endplay possibilities for an 8th|pg||
nt|haans: not the best slam ever :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  he also knows that the defence will not be helpful, as they have found their two suits to attack|pg||
nt|dima:  Looks like 1@h and 2@d for another push|pg||
nt|snorris:  2@s is any hand exept with minimum and 5 @hs|pg||
nt|xenya: rather hard to bid slam with any degree of certainty|pg||
pc|s2|nt|snorris:  and 3@cs 2 suiter |pg||
nt|snorris:  a chanse for some pickup here for the Danes?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mmmakela: guess no chance at all|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: same with 3N which was an alternative I guess|pg||
nt|mmmakela: N trying to figure out W's hand after this unexpected developement|pg||
nt|sybarra: impressive |pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|ralfwil: good for the match|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now W is concerned if @d9 was a singleton. Better to play @d10|pg||

nt|rcerreto: any reason not to draw trumps?|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dT|pc|d4|pg||
nt|paulg:  @hA10 doubleton would be helpful (though unlikely)|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c7|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||

mb|p|nt|april7: Isn't Roland Danish?:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: 1@H natural and 100% forcing|pg||

mb|p|nt|paulg:  i wonder if double is takeout or just hearts?|pg||

pc|cA|nt|snorris:  combined|pg||

nt|rcerreto: but Angelini showed his pattern anyway|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|bessi2: some might be tempted to bid 2@d with east hand but just as well he didn't since west will then surely jump to 3N|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2@D = spades|pg||
nt|paulg:  I used to play that X was hearts and 1@s takeout, but now play X is takeout and 1@s=hearts and a minor|pg||

pc|c6|pc|cJ|nt|snorris:  well a @s lead perhaps..?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: more and more players play trsf responses so they can't be all that bad|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|hedyg: why should he bid 2@d?|pg||

nt|dima:  Well seriously HÃ¤usler now knows that finesses are likely to be right|pg||
nt|rcerreto: now, if it were not for those annoying 4 loosers...|pg||

nt|rodal f: So a sac to come? No|pg||

nt|rcerreto: a good save, anyway|pg||
nt|sybarra: true but still a few bds here and 12 more after that |pg||
nt|mdgraham: was 1@D a transfer response?|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@H sh be GF, and 3@s mild slaminvit|pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe had a @H mixed in with the @D|pg||
nt|smoller: Not obvious to play diamonds now|pg||
nt|sybarra: @D  now?    maybe Q?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or J?|pg||
nt|smoller: @H is also ok for the defenders|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sunsamvar: def cant get the @C ruff AND the @Dk as east will be declaring the 4@H contract|pg||
nt|april7: there is a chance if S continues @D!|pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe he treated them as 2 4 card suits?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bjacobs: 4@H was a fine contract in the other room ... here the Italians cannot go wrong, as they have put @DK on lead|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 3 nt is a dicey contract|pg||
nt|dima:  was 4@c Blackwood in clubs?|pg||
nt|milton_se: seems that 4C was RKC|pg||
nt|snorris:  bingo!!|pg||
nt|xenya: which he did -- |pg||
pc|d9|nt|dima:  I think so and 4@h sound like 3|pg||

nt|pelu: on CC: 1@D naturel|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|hedyg: pd can have singlton or void in @d and 6-7 @cs|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: voidwood in @H charlie tells me, ambitious|pg||
nt|smoller: Well done|pg||
nt|ralfwil: what happens if N playe @c10?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mmmakela: how to play after S lead|pg||
pc|cK|nt|dima:  11 IMPs for German team|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mbruun: Im afraid South is not wearing funny redwhite hat|pg||
nt|april7: 5@C would be a little better save against 4@H|pg||

nt|april7: so its 100 instead of 50|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|sybarra: W is optimistic  |pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think E must change to @h|pg||

pc|d8|nt|ralfwil: what´s your opinion? If W plays a @d the link is cut|pg||
pc|dT|nt|haans: be|pg||
nt|mbruun: 5C would be axed. 6C was to convincing|pg||
nt|xenya: 200 now|pg||
nt|pelu: hard bid by East - 3Nt i forward going and|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|sssvablue: Italians got to 5@d which makes with the j@c on side|pg||
nt|sybarra: but can stop in the logical 4 @S |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mmmakela: this won't work, needed to set up clubs|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jcmax: He took no action because EW are vulnrable and there is a decent chance they will go down several vulnerable tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: well my experience is that they hardly ever do|pg||
pc|h8|nt|pkl: I am not sure about that 6@H bid in the open room - looks more as an insurance|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|bessi2: indeed,  but could easily have 5d, or 4h,  but holding only 2 spades makes that unlikely I suppose|pg||

nt|dima:  Another strong result for the German team in the OR|pg||
nt|sssvablue: 3@d natural and invitational|pg||
nt|feffo: hi Rodolfo wlc|pg||
nt|rcerreto: hi everybody|pg||
nt|sssvablue: ciao|pg||
mb|p|nt|mbruun: South has two aces on every hand |pg||
nt|rcerreto: how smart|pg||
nt|mdgraham: we all have them|pg||
nt|sybarra: ?? |pg||
mb|p|nt|jstokes: and I forgot to draw trumps :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Roland :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: the injustice of it al|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: they will be in @H here... 6 or 7 ?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our matches in round 4 (in 2 hours and 25 minutes) will be France Hosts vs Russia and Italy Allegra vs Norway|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You mean they don't have the tools to find out about the missing @HQ?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I will bet a whole lot of something that they don't reach 7@H|pg||
nt|roghog: not sure if the raise is always 4|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt a make if play spade finesses|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D reverse|pg||
nt|paulg:  3@c, natural and forcing looks a good start here|pg||
nt|pkl: I would not play D as Lebensohl in this situation, but who knows?|pg||
nt|mbruun: Discountblackwood|pg||
nt|rcerreto: any idea what 3NT means?|pg||
nt|sybarra: this doesnt look right,  isnt 2 @H pass or correct?|pg||
nt|pelu: yes - also u Shirley :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm, some trouble with the system :) |pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Tournament website: http://eurobridge.org/competitions/09Paris/Paris.htm |pg||
nt|xenya: again the slammish 3N|pg||
nt|snorris:  ns can win 3 @s ..not more|pg||
pc|dA|nt|paulg:  or perhaps 4@c to show the slam intent|pg||
nt|sybarra: should there be a 2 suited call by E?  does it make any sense|pg||
nt|sybarra: no clue how to find the @D contract |pg||
nt|ralfwil: can he keep it on -1? 2 @s, 2@c and 1@c|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bjacobs: North needs to find out 3 things:  aces, @DK, @HQ|pg||
nt|mcarroll: And now things are even better for the Bamberg team|pg||
nt|rcerreto: serious slam try?|pg||
nt|snorris:  a good game mind you after the opening in east|pg||
nt|mmmakela: hearts + spade tolerance I suppose|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh yes I have blind spots even commenting,  never mind playing |pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, you can use redouble as pass/correct, and then 2M becomes to play. East must have thought that |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|hedyg: lost the @H suit?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not yet|pg||
nt|bessi2: he will surely bid 3h now|pg||
nt|jstokes: 3N is OK too|pg||
nt|bessi2: but 2n seems like an underbid to me|pg||
nt|roghog: Isn't that 4? :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: One very simple way to do it is 4NT over 2@H - if partner bids 5@S (2 aces, @HQ), he can bid 5NT asking for a cue-bid|pg||
nt|bjacobs: All right 4 things, you pedant :)|pg||
nt|ritong: moi?:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: so none of the above Paul |pg||
nt|haans: 4th suit or anythink but GF|pg||
nt|pkl: And I mean Lightner, of course. |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Another 11 imps|pg||
nt|mbruun: I thought it denied shortage|pg||
nt|xenya: yup|pg||
nt|mmmakela: phone brb|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|lestergold: very friendly layout hee for E/W|pg||
nt|smoller: Looks like down 2|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ritong: they will probably discover @h Q is missing|pg||
nt|haans: did the 4th suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: makes sense,   and then now can find the trump suit |pg||
nt|mbruun: Apparently it didnt|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rcerreto: good old blackwood to follow|pg||
nt|snorris:   but unlucky with the brake in @ss|pg||
nt|xenya: on 8, the Danes did too much work -- they got to 7 (!) @S|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bjacobs: Seriously, this is the auction you should have in SAYC:  1@D-1@H-2@H-4NT-5@H-6@H|pg||
nt|roghog: he is too embarrassed to use a simple 4NT on VG|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Or something like that, anyway|pg||
nt|ritong: there are other considerations|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, I guess so - eg a 3-card raise|pg||
nt|ritong: like maybe @h is not the right suit|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is where the French are at an advantage?  2@H would show 4?|pg||
nt|ritong: it is not really an advantage|pg||
nt|paulg:  this works okay unless partner supports hearts, and then there is confusion about trumps|pg||
nt|rodal f: Same as I wrote him, but could it be any other lead left from E after the 4@C bid?|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a lot of guesses in this contract. |pg||
nt|pkl: Guess hearts or clubs... Hearts will NOT be guessed, I guess ;-)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y, and I belive the @H will be missed so then @C are to hit. Lets see:)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now -2|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lestergold: North virtually endplayed at trick 1|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|pkl: A reasonable contract: wins if diamonds come home. They just don't today|pg||
nt|xenya: classic auction|pg||
nt|snorris:  dimond lead from the king..|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hedyg: 9 quick tricks, when @hs split give K@D|pg||
nt|ritong: it just saves the checking bids|pg||
nt|rcerreto: blackwood got out of fashion in Italy, still I think it's simple and effective|pg||
nt|po-s: 3|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|ralfwil: if he had played @hA and on the actual split only -1|pg||
nt|smoller: yes 3 down now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Was it correct to play a small @h on the bidding?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: correct! I was not awake!|pg||
nt|smoller: aybe not, especially not, if he could imagine the top clubs being in the west-hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If he had won with @hA, ruffed a @d anfd played @sJ, W hadn´t got his ruff with a small @s|pg||
nt|ralfwil: another reason is that @s are probably 4-0 on WE|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mdgraham: well, this will make, but not a great advert for the system when a simple 1@S overcall means you can't find a 4-4 fit (unless 3@S showed hearts and West rejected hearts to play NT) ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham:  |pg||
nt|lestergold: at least diamond never cost a trick|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Looks like some sort of Turbo here|pg||
nt|smoller: Open room plays 3NT|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ritong: however, this is 13 for azzurri|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mdgraham: as you rarely want to play in 2@Dxx, and even when you do the opponents are most unlikely to let you |pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|xenya: some hands are tailor-made for blackwood, this is one of them|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rcerreto: quite so, yes|pg||
nt|snorris:  not enough..|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|nt|ritong: yes, 12|pg||
nt|ritong: they played in @ds|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Back to 13.  Very unfortunate for the Swedes who OBVIOUSLY knew what they were doing and paid the price|pg||
nt|ritong: ok, 13|pg||
nt|haans: 5nt-7?|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You really should be able to call the match referee and get the imp result adjusted on the board|pg||
nt|ritong: come on|pg||
nt|ritong: there is a gambling part in the game|pg||
nt|bjacobs: nope.  I am offended by this result|pg||
nt|roghog: You should get moral IMPs|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@d looks makeable, but difficult to bid|pg||
mc|6|nt|ritong: but they do|pg||
nt|sybarra: obviously @C's are trump to S |pg||
pg||
qx|c11|st||md|1SJ2H984DQT9754CK2,SAQ7643HJDACJ9876,SKHAQ7532DJ83CQT5,ST985HKT6DK62CA43|sv|o|nt|hedyg: ok so Versace did NOT disc his 3rd @s...|pg||
nt|pkl: A small break for me - see you in 3½ minutes|pg||
nt|sssvablue: Neither declarer had X-ray vision|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry pard  as they say |pg||
mb|1S|nt|jcmax: Italy did in fact not bid the game in board 7 at the other table|pg||
nt|haans: not often no swing on Grand|pg||
nt|xenya: 2 more boards to go in this segment|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 1 nt by N?|pg||
nt|sssvablue: Another huge IMP board|pg||
nt|rcerreto: a lot of action to come?|pg||
nt|sssvablue: EW make 6@c and NS make 6@s (or @h)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not 6@H|pg||
nt|sssvablue: sorry 6@s only|pg||
nt|pkl: Another gunslinger deal. Lots of drama ;-)|pg||
nt|rcerreto: hard to think, for N, that 6@s makes|pg||
nt|snorris:  west thinking @s is trump|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rcerreto: but he could sacrifice on 6@c/@d|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|jstokes: good great hands being dealt today|pg||
nt|rcerreto: ...making :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jstokes: some great...|pg||
nt|hedyg: and good too :)|pg||
nt|feffo: :)|pg||
nt|sssvablue: 6@h will go down if EW find their spade ruff|pg||
nt|pkl: Will Zeeberg be quiet? No - well done!|pg||
mb|2S|nt|hedyg: can they find the @cs?|pg||
nt|rcerreto: this could make I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: play trumps = down|pg||
nt|rcerreto: needs some guessing though|pg||
mb|p|nt|rcerreto: well, S took the plunge by himself|pg||
nt|sybarra: closer score again as 4 @s made +1 on bd 9 |pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: OR W went hard in by 1@H. Still they bid 3NT|pg||
pc|c6|nt|hedyg: 3@c puppet|pg||
nt|h bertens: this is very high|pg||
nt|xenya: 2N=good spade raise|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: helpful lead|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lestergold: hm North worth an invite  but 3N does not look to easy but lead helpful|pg||
nt|marlowepi: bocchi is very high:) madala no|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This would be a top at matchpoints|pg||
nt|rodal f: @S best at E but I belive @H by the long ride is best lead. Or??|pg||
nt|rcerreto: this is the most important|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rcerreto: huge board for the Danes!|pg||
nt|sssvablue: This looks like 17 IMPs|pg||
nt|rcerreto: badly needed, I'd say|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@d= 1 or both 4 vard majors, 3@H=@ss|pg||
nt|hedyg: card*|pg||
nt|bessi2: he'll bid 4c, i assume it would be nat|pg||
nt|bessi2: in any case he will never pass 3n|pg||
nt|hedyg: careful! commentator's curse may set in|pg||
nt|roghog: He assumes dummy is cut off|pg||
nt|xenya: duck seems best|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mcarroll: W is in 2@Sdbl in Open|pg||
nt|pelu: and more swedish imp's comming on board 10|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mdgraham: never say never|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|bessi2: indeed,  stupid to say that since I don't know the nuances of their system|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@H accepts @cs and denies @d control|pg||
nt|mdgraham: their system is easy - they just bid to the right contract |pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|lestergold: even with this lead and the clubs favourable there are problems|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont have a problem with a 3N bid with all those high spots, and whenever pd is going to accept it can help to have bid it yourself|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You would expect 3@H to have made in the OR ... but the defence was machiavellian|pg||
nt|pkl: Schollaardt might well be correct, but there is only room for ten characters in the name|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lestergold: communications not great either|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think 8 tricks only|pg||
nt|marlowepi: opps may defend differently--and to their advantage--if you only invite|pg||
nt|lestergold: I dont really agree the pips make it worth an invite not a unilatreral raise|pg||
nt|h bertens: If you want to bid them this surely is the best way to do it|pg||
nt|haans: in norway you play low enc but low odd count|pg||
nt|pelu: Denmark in 4@h - can be defeated on a @D ruff|pg||
pc|h5|nt|snorris:  a @d lead had tobe a small|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@s some kind of last train?|pg||
nt|hedyg: surely 4@s implies @d control|pg||
nt|dima:  That is a fight :)|pg||
nt|dima:  I would rather use 4@d overcall to show reds if W opens 2@s|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Seems obvious to lead @S, which will force  declarer and control will be a major issue|pg||
nt|dima:  @s shift now?|pg||
nt|dima:  I guess @c card was count so declarer is either 0=6=4=3 or actual shape|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|pelu: and was : 11 imp for Swe - and we have a match|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hedyg: anybody know if they play turbo?|pg||
nt|bessi2: assuming 4c was nat showing 5,  then 5c was somewhat of an underbid|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|pg||
nt|mmmakela: can W find S shift to hold it to 9|pg||
nt|mmmakela: yes|pg||
pc|c2|nt|snorris:  not that east would fall for it..|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 10|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bessi2: well if 4h showed 4clubs then maybe not|pg||
nt|pkl: Would anyone not D with Wests cards?|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||
nt|smoller: his is now in danger of losing control|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|pc|sA|nt|rcerreto: unavoidable, I think|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|dima:  Now declarer is in control |pg||
nt|xenya: no matter where the @SK is|pg||
nt|xenya: there is hardly any @D guess here -- because S had opened|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mdgraham: well, it just goes to show that even Lauria-Versace can miss a decent slam. There's hope for the rest of us yet. |pg||
pc|s9|pc|h6|pc|sT|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c8|nt|sssvablue: NS have found the best kind of sacrifice |pg||
pc|d2|nt|smoller: but does not need a diamond trick|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cT|nt|haans: miss in defense :)|pg||
nt|april7: @H lead might have been better, but makes with @S ruffing finesse after pulling trumps|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d9|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|nt|paulg:  After that club position Rekstad will be regretting not playing trumps instead|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sybarra: club again?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or @D?|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|c9|nt|dima:  So what happened in 2@sX in the OR?|pg||

nt|mdgraham: and let's face it, this one is only sort of decent - an ace and Qxxx of trumps missing |pg||
nt|jcmax: bye all!|pg||
nt|lestergold: bye Sabine|pg||

nt|rcerreto: 3@s with a 7-5 is not something you can foresee|pg||
nt|mmmakela: sry|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: indeed,  the kind of hand you don't mind bidding the slam and you don't mind stopping in game|pg||
nt|marlowepi: bye Sabine thx|pg||
nt|ralfwil: bye Sabine|pg||
nt|lestergold: we have a roland special here|pg||
nt|haans: Landy comming up|pg||
nt|rcerreto: then you're fixed|pg||
nt|sssvablue: Wild set of cards, 78 IMPs so far|pg||
nt|rcerreto: yes, a very good sacrifice :)|pg||
nt|snorris:  3@s e-w again|pg||
nt|xenya: and now the last board|pg||
nt|sybarra: and last bd or the match |pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|marlowepi: ok now we can talk cars & sports|pg||
nt|sybarra: last bd of this set |pg||
mb|2C|nt|lestergold: 20/20 hcp division|pg||
nt|april7: then cross ruff|pg||
nt|snorris:  3@ds: inviting with @hs|pg||
nt|smoller: this doet not look like 15 IMP for the Danes|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 5@c showed an odd nr of keycards but with @H void...very difficult for Lauria IMO|pg||
nt|xenya: last hand now and 3 more to compare -- the OR is still on 9|pg||
nt|rcerreto: again two aces missing, again 11 tricks|pg||
nt|rcerreto: not the kind of hands the Danes are needing|pg||
nt|mmmakela: last one this set, thx all for watching|pg||
nt|ralfwil: your former teammates needs a good score on this last board to win now Steen!|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sssvablue: 2@d 10-13 @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: 6@H-1 was flat and so the last hand of this set|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris:  this might go -2|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thanks operator smmooth job, thanks Markku and spectators for your helpful feedback|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mcarroll: Yep so 3 imps to Bamberg |pg||
mb|3H|nt|bessi2: indeed,  he probably felt he had done more than enough|pg||
nt|lestergold: well no pressure here from N/S at these colours so an easy ride for E/W|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W almost has enough to try 3H hoping for perfect fitter|pg||
nt|pkl: A perfectly normal 4@S - that can win now|pg||
nt|rcerreto: difficult defense here|pg||
nt|xenya: let me remind you that the actual score is 116-58 Angelini |pg||
nt|april7: exactly double|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to Francios our terrific operator |pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|snorris:  if east finesses south for the quenn of @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|roghog: @C takes the entry, but fortunately there will be another one|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: if south ducks and Fantoni knowing the layout continues with a low @D ?|pg||
nt|dima:  We are at the last board of the 1st segment and German team has opened up a very useful lead on a strong set by GromÃ¶ller - HÃ¤usler here|pg||
nt|dima:  I think besides that @d J play on the board N2 they were just about flawless|pg||
nt|dima:  And the score should be 35:7 ....|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to all of of our operators for the tourney,  |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 16 hcp missing so W have it|pg||
nt|sssvablue: This will make now|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 17|pg||
nt|sybarra: nt places a lot (all) of the cards|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx also to all the commentators,  esp. my co-cos at the moment|pg||
nt|smoller: yes, now they got help|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|haans: may be unlucky|pg||
nt|haans: lead of K = dubbleton|pg||
nt|sybarra: Francois great job as always! |pg||
pc|d7|nt|dima:  A powerful effort for a new partnership as knowing spectators mention|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx also to my co commentators MIke and Peter   |pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, Zia-style double|pg||
nt|smoller: but will he solve the trump problem?|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sA|nt|bessi2: the dreaded 4-2 fit, but it will handle very well and make easily enough it seems|pg||
nt|hedyg: the lead helped|pg||
nt|bessi2: yes,  it certainly didn't cripple declarer|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hedyg: with 3 cards in @s W would have corrected to 2@s|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but is @S is wrong that wd be winning line|pg||
nt|rcerreto: very hard for N to win with the ace to play a @c back|pg||
nt|sssvablue: Ron needed to play ace @h and shift to a club|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|pelu: I have been told that the 2 captains has deceided that the bronze-match only 2 segments - so this is the last board of the match|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: looks like a trivial ten tricks|pg||
pc|c3|pc|hQ|nt|mcarroll: Looks like 35-8 will be the score as 4@S also in Open|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|s7|nt|dima:  Losing one of each nondiamond for 10 tricks|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|nt|paulg:  very strange|pg||
nt|paulg:  sorry, that was a comment to someone else!|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|c8|nt|rcerreto: right, but it would have been a disaster had S had @hQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: wow! |pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
nt|sssvablue: Thanks everyone|pg||
nt|pkl: Yes - that defense was probably impossible to find. An unlucky lead|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rodal f: Next|pg||
nt|smoller: yes, East needed to play club before North saw 3-0 in trumps|pg||
pc|h9|nt|snorris:   a little fether in the hat of n-s|pg||
nt|sybarra: so thx to all who bought these matches to bbo  |pg||
nt|sybarra: so Mike in good conscience can go to London |pg||
pc|hT|nt|pkl: An easy slam to bid and make.|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx again all,  the Open room has a few bds to play |pg||
nt|sybarra: or this one anyway |pg||
nt|pelu: Denmark in 4@S - so Sweden will prb win by 3-4 IMPs|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|hK|nt|dima:  I think N8 is a push so score is 35-7|pg||
nt|xenya: mind you, 4@S is not as insane as it mght look|pg||
nt|snorris:  gratulation to Angelini|pg||
nt|snorris:  this was the last boards?|pg||

nt|ritong: is a consequence of their system|pg||

nt|sybarra: this should be interesting |pg||
nt|paulg:  Rekstad plays the same style as me ... always 1@c with this hand rather than 1@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: what does this 1n overcall mean|pg||
nt|sybarra: I might have tried a pass with N hanc to start with  |pg||
nt|ralfwil: a good result for EW in OR|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ritong: with " strong" and forcing 1 X openings|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: i c 5 cl 4 major|pg||
nt|haans: showing hearts?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: that previous board may be a small pickup for iceland since fantunes will reach 3n i suspect|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@S just a waiting bid after the reverse|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: decent slam actually|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, it takes a heart lead to put it under pressure|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: even on @H lead he can hope for @C to run|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Unfortunately, a heart lead is what he's going to get ... what is the % play in clubs?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Do you have to play clubs at all, Bill?|pg||
nt|ritong: the % play is a try for throw in, first|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: % play in @C is to drop the q|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: someone had better bid some hearts here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: What about partial elimination and throw South in with a heart?|pg||
nt|roghog: Elimination|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|s6|nt|bjacobs: Does that work, with trumps 3-1?|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|h bertens: wow, well done|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Two rounds of trumps, three rounds of diamonds (ruffing high), then exit with a heart|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ritong: the guy with top @hs will show out on trumps|pg||
nt|haans: did cool :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|marlowepi: wonder why D instead of 3D by E|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe 3D would confirm clubs and be a NT try|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, it works because the opponents have no choice who wins the 2nd heart ... but I guess it's worth a try, however unlikely|pg||
nt|roghog: Indeed. Costs nothing to try it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe it does not work after all as Marion Michielsen says|pg||
nt|Walddk4: South plays a 4th diamond|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So you are back to playing the club suit, and I think it's normal to bang out ace and king|pg||
pc|s8|nt|h bertens: maybe he hoped 2! by partner and then 3@C by him|pg||
pc|s5|nt|h bertens: 2@S|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lestergold: well 12 available double dummy but will probably make just the ten|pg||

nt|ralfwil: at least 3@s|pg||

nt|rodal f: Upgrading his 11HP in E?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|paulg:  quickly followed by 5@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: and a double|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mdgraham: the minor suit splits are going to make this awkward for EW|pg||
nt|jstokes: 6N east looks best here |pg||
nt|lestergold: cards are spitting against the Italians on this deal|pg||
mb|d|nt|mdgraham: soryr, missed @SJ - 6N ok, 6@D ok, 6@C more problematical|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as long as North leads a heart to 6@C|pg||
nt|bessi2: 6n is best and he east is surely headed there now.. via rckb|pg||
nt|hedyg: E in the tank|pg||
nt|ritong: polite bid|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Declarer misguessed clubs in 4@H|pg||
nt|ritong: just in case they go to 4@s, i guess|pg||
nt|pkl: Two tens, well placed cards - not that far away from 12 points|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: low to the 8|pg||
nt|rodal f: I count 12 there|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|hedyg: 4@H by W now?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|hedyg: no|pg||
nt|lestergold: now the Italians want to stay schtum|pg||
nt|marlowepi: EW did well to find 3C after 1C opener, but probably will just break even|pg||
nt|sybarra: commentators curse|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Let's see what Claudio makes of it|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: S on lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: this was plus for e/w whichever way|pg||
nt|haans: a prefer double|pg||
nt|paulg:  it was followed by a double ... eventually|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|hedyg: so N has no problem what to lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, South on lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: :) Many of us do.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk4: AQ  and  Q10  both 24% as Anders Wirgren pointed out, so there is nothing in it|pg||
pc|s6|nt|pkl: An ackward contract|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|jstokes: but when south is Versace....no problem|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  5@c seems to need a diamond lead or switch at trick 2 to beat it|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h6|pc|h3|pc|hK|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bessi2: strange,  when can 6n be worse looking at the east hand.. difficult to imagine|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ritong: ecco|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d2|pg||
nt|pkl: Not the right time to break communications|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|nt|lestergold: ten tricks with or without the spade duck|pg||
pc|c2|nt|h bertens: maybe pick up a couple of imps now|pg||
nt|ritong: besides, there is something in it|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jstokes: with East short in clubs (the double), he hopes partner has a club trick so take the heart ace|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and in 6NT, you might need only one of the minors to run|pg||
pc|hT|nt|bessi2: but I suppose west could have a heart void and also missing the @d ace|pg||
nt|hedyg: pls do not try to enter the polbridge site , correct is:|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=804&qshowflag=1  Group A|pg||
nt|hedyg: short break?|pg||
nt|bessi2: but i wonder what dbl of 3@h meant.. some play it penalty and pass t/o  or no good bid,  but others play dbl as pure t/o and pass everyting else|pg||
nt|bessi2: i believe the latter is the better approach.. usually you don't get rich dbling opps in their 9+ fits|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think after 2@c they were in forcing mode and X was t/o|pg||
nt|jstokes: In a GF auction, it would be unusual to me to play it as takeout|pg||
nt|jstokes: pass works for Take out|pg||
nt|bessi2: exactly what i mean.. the general approach.. when GF dbl is pen,,, |pg||
nt|bessi2: but that pass becomes so loaded,  it just shows no penalty dbl of hearts.. |pg||
nt|bessi2: and no other convenient bid|pg||
nt|jstokes: and no ability to raise clubs or bid your own suit|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think it means he does not want to penalise and is looking for a slam|pg||
nt|hedyg: not that he cannot penalise|pg||
nt|jstokes: or maybe it is just "extras"|pg||
nt|ritong: a defender with Q10 xcan envisage to play the Q|pg||
nt|Walddk4: ?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ralfwil: If E first had ruffed his @h and then played @cA and a small S i squeezed for 11 tricks|pg||

mb|p|nt|bjacobs: That's a very interesting point|pg||

mb|3C|nt|paulg:  so a good result for NS|pg||
nt|haans: ok :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|nt|jstokes: another big hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: awkward hand to play in spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: i do not claim he will play the Q, i m just saying there is a (tiny) clue|pg||
nt|paulg:  well, perhaps cold is not the right description, but there is a viable line to make it :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: always good to hold a hand like the North one and see partner pass as dealer |pg||
pc|s2|nt|hedyg: the dealer is E's friend|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but best lead of D unlikely|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant really lose more than  a heart and 2 spades here because of the favourable club position|pg||

pc|cA|nt|hedyg: especially good to see that pd did not bid @H Mike?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|marlowepi: not sure about that on D l;ead|pg||
nt|haans: this time 3nt safer than 4@H|pg||
nt|pkl: A nice preempt - and EW ends in a shaky 3NT that is going to win|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Iceland missed the slam on 11 as well - played in 3N+3 |pg||
pc|cT|nt|mdgraham: guess so|pg||
nt|lestergold: communications certainly less than ideal|pg||
pc|h3|nt|paulg:  i guess 3NT is choice of game rather than a non-serious slam try|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: odd that EW play 1@C-1N as balanced. Better for the stronger hand to become declarer |pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: if he can ruff one dim in dummy and discard one one on a club he is home just losing 2 spades and a heart|pg||
nt|lestergold: on way back to hand via heart ruffs west of course will sluff clubs |pg||
nt|lestergold: the great Bochi understandably in the tank|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Mike. |pg||
nt|lestergold: but overruffs by west will only exchange trump tricks from one form to another|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sybarra: not easy for W  to chose 3 nt however |pg||

nt|pkl: One more imp to the Netherlands|pg||
mb|1C|mb|d|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|lestergold: i agree but it was frigid depending on how played|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: again reverse|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Group B: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=805&qshowflag=1|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hedyg: message from Francois: the director : 2 VP penalty each team, Lauria and East left the room and smoked outside|pg||
nt|bessi2: that seems harsh|pg||
nt|jstokes: if members from each team were there smoking, why is that a problem?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i believe smoking is not allowed|pg||
nt|jstokes: ah|pg||
nt|lestergold: what dos 3d mean here?|pg||
nt|h bertens: i think @C|pg||
nt|h bertens: thats how we play it|pg||
nt|lestergold: a simple soul like me finds all these bids confusing |pg||
nt|lestergold: well as xlong as they dont con fuse each other its ok|pg||
nt|h bertens: me to, ask my partner :)|pg||
nt|h bertens: now 4@C shows good hand for @C and @S|pg||
nt|lestergold: well as long as they reach 4S all will end well|pg||
nt|lestergold: is Bochi in tank here?|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry mis-spell Bocchi|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Hmm, here's another hand that seems to threaten a defensive squeeze|pg||
nt|rodal f: F5  for update|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|nt|paulg:  i'd reverse too if partner bids hearts (as here), but closer over spades|pg||
nt|haans: most do to game with a+K|pg||
nt|paulg:  4@c now? as all your points are working|pg||
nt|haans: in my book 4@C stronger 5@C fast arrival|pg||
nt|paulg:  me too, but with two key cards I would not wish to bid 5@c|pg||
nt|haans: yep see them|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lestergold: last making game rapidly approaching|pg||
nt|h bertens: madala looking for best game, Bocchi for best slam...|pg||
nt|lestergold: no best game only one game making|pg||
nt|ritong: it also threatens to land in 3 NT down with a cold 5/6 @cs, from nystrom's point of view|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Incredibly tricky hand on @SQ lead|pg||
nt|ritong: i therefore wonder why he did not decide to go for game and propose his @cs|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bjacobs: Has to win in North|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Then if a club is ducked - how do you unentangle things?|pg||
nt|ritong: maybe 3@h has a conventional sense|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Declarer doesn't know clubs are 2-2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So here GIB is really giving unrealistic advice|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Specs want declarer to take 2 diamonds, his 8th and 9th tricks - pray, what do you discard on the second diamond?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's what I was thinking of when I mentioned a squeeze on declarer|pg||
nt|bjacobs: What a hand!|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It seems so logical to retain @SK as an entry to the clubs, but ...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Sorry  I can't respond to all the specs.  |pg||
nt|bjacobs: But you are ALL correct :)|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c= gazzilli, 2@d= 8+ hcps, 3@D= 3@s + 4 m, 3@H relay, 3NT= 3 5 1 4|pg||
nt|lestergold: one more turn of the screqw|pg||
nt|ralfwil: only 4@s not 5@c|pg||
nt|pkl: 4@S wins if you can see all cards. 3@S should be safe though, as North has @H QT|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|lestergold: now maybe he will subside|pg||
nt|lestergold: exactly Raif|pg||
nt|h bertens: dont think so|pg||
nt|h bertens: Kxxxx,xx,x,Kxxxx is slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: well he had better subside if he wants a plus score|pg||
nt|lestergold: we can see what Bocchi is hoping for|pg||
nt|lestergold: Madala has bid the pips off his ace and king|pg||
pc|c5|nt|h bertens: this looks difficult, madala did bid 4@D|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|pg||
nt|bessi2: i think it is inconsiderate to smokers not to allow them to smoke|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL you must be a smoker|pg||
nt|bessi2: indeed i am :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: why when he knows his pard is limitd to 19 balanced i do not know|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2 off is sad bridge|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe a 10% slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: u measn not even good enuf for roland|pg||
nt|h bertens: its a good slam with the EW hands reversed :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: only with @sKJ in front will make|pg||
nt|lestergold: i see no merit in Madala's 4D bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: its like handing ammunition to John Wayne|pg||
nt|vugraphzxu: director called again other side of the rooom|pg||
nt|vugraphzxu: screen, sorry|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And Claudio works out to play havoc with the communications|pg||
nt|ritong: and now declarer cashes six good @ds:)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: What a wonderful hand|pg||
nt|roghog: strange how the duck now causes such a tangle|pg||
nt|ritong: just joking, claudio has to duck this|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|nt|bessi2: the rule here in iceland concerning closed room play and smokers is that it is ok  until 30 min left on the clock then not allowed to leave unless finished|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I think smokers can smoke anywhere they like, as long as it is inside a sealed plastic bag  |pg||
nt|hedyg: the wbf demands that all competitions be nonsmoking, also in France all public places are nonsmoking by law|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|sybarra: houston we have landed.....as they say  |pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sT|nt|hedyg: so they broke 2 laws?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|haans: t´Norway did well here|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|lestergold: slam about 15% i reckon just good enuf for the governor|pg||
nt|ritong: but now he s sweating:)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sunsamvar: great duck. P can easliy have qxx|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think he will take the two top diamonds, hoping the hearts are blocked or 3-3|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|hT|pg||
pc|h2|nt|pkl: Perhaps you just might guess that North has @HQ. North does not have @DAKQ and he does not have @CKQJ|pg||
pc|d2|pc|hK|nt|haans: 3@C did say do not have 3 hearts|pg||
nt|pkl: ...otherwise he would have led the suit, right?|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|pkl: What to bid as N??|pg||
mb|d|mb|4S|nt|lestergold: well i lay odds that Madala will not find the killing trump lead|pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: but has found the easy let thru dim lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: so would I have|pg||
nt|haans: and now rebid @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: reasonable double|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@H ?|pg||
nt|pkl: Thanks to those who informed me that the North player, he is a she|pg||
nt|rodal f: I like better 4@H. Now he often tell some more @D at his hand. 2nd an X|pg||
nt|pkl: She is Meike Wortel. I like that name|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: She then have bidded and played as a he so fare|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Italy did not do good here|pg||
nt|haans: easy 3nt|pg||
nt|paulg:  interesting pass from Sementa .. I'd be thinking that I had two kings more than I'd shown although a heart less|pg||
nt|sybarra: not easy to get there with stiff A of clubs |pg||
nt|sybarra: but the 1 @H bid didnt help either |pg||
pc|dA|nt|hedyg: pragmatic bid|pg||

pc|d8|pg||

nt|haans: 2 deals Norway may win|pg||
nt|ralfwil: one board and 54 IMPs - difficult.........|pg||
nt|pkl: Personally, I believe that the north player plays like a very fine woman! ;-)|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|h bertens: 4@S|pg||
nt|pkl: 6@H can win, but difficult to bid, perhaps?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|hedyg: 2NT for minors? yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@s making|pg||
nt|pkl: I am sure it would be easier to bid if East had the @HQ |pg||
nt|ralfwil: anyone of you for 3@s on E after 3@h from N?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 5@s as well...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: needs a view or two though|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|lestergold: well a vul against not phantom|pg||
nt|lestergold: not a pretty result |pg||
nt|lestergold: if west cannot find a double over 4H then east's 4S bid extremely dangerous|pg||
nt|h bertens: 5@C only 1 down?|pg||
nt|h bertens: is he thinking about it?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s may only go one down all depends|pg||
nt|lestergold: on lead|pg||
nt|h bertens: why 5C down 2?|pg||
nt|lestergold: but as 4h is one off on leading the stiff ace of spades its not good business|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 2NT was not for minors, it showed a strong hand asking|pg||
nt|h bertens: normal I think.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: they dont actually know the layout when they have to bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4S vul against notwith a horrific suit you consider that normal?|pg||
nt|h bertens: yes I do.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: me too, just unlucky|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That comment applies to this board as well ... imagine N/S's spades swapped|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: vul against not affects game bonus also|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: this will make easily enough|pg||
nt|ralfwil: of course a 6-card suit, but too weak in my opinion|pg||
pc|dK|nt|hedyg: i wonder whether pass over 5@s was forcing|pg||
nt|pkl: Ohhh... 3@S certainly is an option. 4@S might be a good contract.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: it  is veryunlucky but sometimes you have to allow a preempt to stand- it could be even worse|pg||
nt|roghog: Indeed. An aggressive 2@s by E|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mdgraham: I think it will be forced to|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|paulg:  everything very friendly on this deal|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes but a challenge to play |pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|nt|lestergold: i want a better suit quality rest of hand ok|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you will make usually 4S facing   Qxxx  xxx  x  Kxxxx  |pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@s is also only -1 with the right play|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sometimes yoyu just have to hope for support|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Axxx   xx   xx    xxxxx    you wiull also usually mnake|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @h to @h A and @sJ...|pg||
pc|h3|nt|marlowepi: sorry  meant  stiff diamond in 2nd ex|pg||
nt|lestergold: and north will kill the club suit|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: like here - has to play @HA, really|pg||
nt|pkl: So a few consolation IMPs to Iceland, but far from enough|pg||
nt|rodal f: At vul against non vul. Bit to bad quality at the @S. Belive pass is OK|pg||
pc|c6|nt|haans: but to agressive when nonvul?|pg||
nt|paulg:  "colours are for children" seems to be the way in all aspects of the game nowadays|pg||
nt|haans: agree (with u)|pg||
nt|paulg:  just keep bidding game and let the defence have the problems|pg||
