nt|mmmakela: for those who forgot to adjust their clocks we are NOT 1 hour late|pg||
pc|cA|nt|monsted: East could have made a penalty dobl here i think|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome|pg||
nt|jcwla: E would probably double at matchpoints, but at IMPS penalty doubles into game should be made only if confident of setting the contract (some say by 2 tricks).|pg||

nt|rnmalik: 3 Nt by NS good spot|pg||
nt|sfoxa: with a lot of finesses, although )))|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Bridgewise, Denmark is divided into 11 districts. The district winners, and an extra team from the district with the holders (Copenhagen), compete for the honours|pg||
nt|mmmakela: slam is not great but could be laydown if N also held @C 10|pg||

nt|monsted: this is 4 spades - but with this weak opening they will go too high I think|pg||
nt|jcwla: A Rule of 20 opener here and this seems to be the rare right time for a trump lead.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Singleton trump lead that is.|pg||
nt|lestergold: work to deo to get at ten tricks but opps even with trump lead cannot get enough trump plays in|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
nt|cindy:  was it a risk   i guess i should have been paying attention :-)|pg||
nt|snorris:  I guess q of @s|pg||

mb|d|nt|ady: 20 pts eac h this time|pg||
nt|Walddk4: OEJ are the holders|pg||
nt|mmmakela: by S  good|pg||
mb|r|nt|rnmalik: will NS find it|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Yep|pg||
nt|snorris:  as if west MIGHT come in .|pg||
mb|3H|nt|christinas: EW play weak NT|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S  looks a possibility   but with trumps 5-1 looks doomed  especiaally on a heart lead|pg||
mb|4C|nt|lestergold: 5 spades 2 dims a heart and two club ruffs is ten tricks what if south ducks a diamond lead towards dummy?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Wow.|pg||
nt|lestergold: At unfavourable vulnerability??|pg||
nt|lestergold: is south colour blind?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the Schaltz team name is also the title of an outstanding Western from late 50s or early 60s starring Marlon Brando and Karl Malden|pg||
nt|lestergold: E/W playing a weak no trump?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: no transfer, interesting  |pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  Youth displays courage|pg||
nt|lestergold: obviously|pg||
nt|snorris:  very popular in Denmark|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  Again: @cQ behind J for winning 3NT - so now it is proven 100%|pg||
mb|4S|nt|roswolf: 4@S IS AN INSPIRED CHOICE|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  ...and will become older|pg||
nt|lestergold: its youth|pg||
nt|lestergold: well doube dummy there are 9 tricks available in 3N |pg||
nt|mmmakela: good lead|pg||
nt|sfoxa: not so easy with this start |pg||
nt|mmmakela: 135 leads|pg||
nt|mmmakela: promising 2 or none higher|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: Japenese?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: W's t/o dbl is little weak to my taste|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: true|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: not much chance of this making  |pg||
nt|lestergold: kamikaze trained|pg||
nt|mmmakela: for englishorientated audience EW team name is quite exotic|pg||
nt|ady: north might have reasoned south will be short in hearts    but has to be wary of at least 10 cards in the minors  so not likely to fit well in spades|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ady: club values bad for declarer|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  ...and richer|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh my west has let vul opps off hook|pg||
nt|monsted: Dennis is normaly very solid - despice of Junior|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ritong: first board was a clue about north s style|pg||
nt|lestergold: and 11 tricks i think is a distance too far|pg||
nt|jcwla: This sure looks like the time for a double by W.  E appears to have wasted @C values and W has the reds locked up, no comprendo.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|christinas: unpleasant to balance for NS, but they can make 3@c|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ritong: brutal.|pg||
nt|lestergold: on this defence a lot of tricks available |pg||
pc|c3|nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
nt|ady: likely 2 down|pg||
nt|lestergold: look at the mountain that south had offered|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: the children would have to be sent to bed early|pg||
nt|lestergold: and south was warned by the splinter that clubs were NOT breaking|pg||
nt|lestergold: well nmot the sharpestr defence ive ever seen |pg||
nt|lestergold: so far that is|pg||
nt|vugraphzyy: 4 cl = void|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rnmalik: Weak NT has its advantages aswell|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@H = 4. suit - tto strong for direct 4@S - but 3@S is in my book and overbid - 4.suit + 4@S is the hand!|pg||
pc|hK|nt|roswolf: well with a bit of luck on their side they are formidable|pg||
pc|h2|nt|marlowepi: given that you dont really want S on lead, i predict 4 club tricks|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jcwla: If West's splinter showed the void -- then it's incomprehensible.  If not, then the Rule of 20 opener combined with W's feeling of still having hidden extra values and a possible ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: slam at least makes it comprehensible, though still not my choice...|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|pelu: 4.suit + 4@s = mild slaminvit , 4.suit + 3@S = strong slam invit|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ady: +200 should be a useful score for e/w on a non event hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: then im afraid the men in white coats should be summoned|pg||

nt|mmmakela: not J?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: am i seeing things|pg||
nt|lestergold: how many tricks has south given away to declarer?|pg||
nt|jcwla: 6 to Blakset on 1, while their N/S failed by 2 in 3@C here, their E/W failed by 3 in 3NT in the OR.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|dJ|pc|d2|pg||
nt|mmmakela: needs good guessing now|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|nt|jcwla: Enough that this is now coming home.|pg||
nt|lestergold: in spite of south';s best efforts to give his oppos an early xmas one way or the other, declarer shgould still be left with an inescapable club loser|pg||

nt|roswolf: a hand of promise now|pg||
nt|ady: e/w may end in 4@s  going down|pg||
nt|jcwla: In the OR, E passed, S opened 1@D, and the contract is a quiet 4@S.|pg||
nt|pelu: No Martin is not - the team is from the Copenhagen Club One-Eyed Jacks - a club with 16 teams - only playing teams (and a few IMP-pair)|pg||

nt|ady: poor defence    trump should have beden played|pg||
nt|ady: been|pg||
mb|p|nt|monsted: yes this could give som action|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|nielsfoged:  6@c is ok|pg||
nt|sfoxa: hard to avoid 3 NT here as well|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 3 nt has a flaw here|pg||
mb|1N|nt|roswolf: 3@S?|pg||
nt|snorris:  180 not 210 surely|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 3NT by EW on a @S lead, |pg||
nt|monsted: 3 clubs non vul is not much here|pg||
nt|ady: this will not be a success|pg||
nt|lestergold: 9 top tricks 3n|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  but somewhat Roland style|pg||
nt|jcwla: An overtrick IMP on 2 as 4@S made on the dot.|pg||
mb|3C|an|invit|nt|lestergold: but with such a thin spade guard may be difficult to bid now|pg||
nt|mmmakela: w might bid 3 nt now|pg||
nt|lestergold: potential here for e/w to get overboard|pg||
nt|ady: 5@D  looks on for n/s|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mmmakela: not any more lol|pg||
nt|rnmalik: No @C lead and made|pg||

mb|p|nt|ritong: he wanted to show his @h xxxx, we guess$|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 3NT after the 3@D bid optimistic|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: i might have called again as east|pg||
nt|monsted: pass in North ?? - should have bid 4 spades I think|pg||
nt|sfoxa: sometime you'll find @d 4-4 by opps|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ady: looks down 4   -400|pg||
nt|mmmakela: u like Dorthe's bids Peter?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: best defence this is one off i fear|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ritong: but the scenario was relatively predictable with his @s single|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  but in 6@c do not play on double finesse - which would be rather natural after the 2@s bid|pg||
nt|jcwla: I would also open 1@C with West but a minority of players might choose something else.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 4s lucky to go obly three off reverse the heart honours and its 4 off|pg||
nt|lestergold: I dont think in an imps game its good business to o for such a potentially expensive save- especially when the game doesnt always make|pg||
nt|lestergold: it does here and it would profit but nothing to write home about|pg||
nt|monsted: not a safe - but to make it difficult for EW to make the rigth decision|pg||
nt|snorris:  credit to east for threding carefully|pg||
nt|lestergold: but makes now on the lead|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|sybarra: and overboard they went |pg||
nt|cindy:  might not make 3@h even   oops  that lead helps the cause|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ritong: so, if the system allows it, i think that bidding @ds immediately is more sound|pg||
nt|ritong: and, if pard has @hs, it will be good for @d trump as well|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ady: n/s should get a plus if they dont  mangle the diamond suit|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lestergold: not an easy lead i must admit but my choice would have been a passive club when the bididnmg shows the contract is likely to be tight|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Thought so, Shirley:) 2@H and 3@C discouraging bids but even then|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h2|nt|Walddk4: Did he really make 4 overtricks on board 2?|pg||
nt|lestergold: not possiblem Roland|pg||
nt|cindy:  think so|pg||
nt|lestergold: must have lost the AD at the end|pg||
nt|vugraphzyy: sr - no 10 tricks|pg||
nt|snorris:  must have been operators mistake|pg||
nt|lestergold: having already lost two hearts|pg||
pc|dA|nt|monsted: no 4 down - I would have bid 4 spades om E - strange not to|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|h7|pc|d9|pc|h5|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: there is some equity in it but north apart form spade support has a working yarboroug in tnhe side suits|pg||
nt|cindy:  on the lead  there is a tiny inference that S might have doubled 2@d|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ady: even with diamonds 4-4 Sveta  still the A@S|pg||
nt|sfoxa: but EW have cool 5@c|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|rnmalik: absolutely correct Henri bidding 2 @D would not hurt|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i think leading away from an unsupported Q is an unnecessary risk on this bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: and it cost as we have seen|pg||
nt|cindy:  yes  a negative inference|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  he hasn't won it yet|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk4: Good afternoon to Niels Foged|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|christinas: not very scientifically bid. NS are not in a regular partnership|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mmmakela: well 3nt could be based on 1suiter|pg||
nt|pelu: what could she do - 3@C is fair, and over 4@DX ir is hard to pass|pg||
pc|hA|nt|monsted: Anyway East hand is no use - and 1 suiter somes not often in this auction|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  now he has|pg||
pc|h3|nt|nielsfoged:  Hello everyone|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ritong: anyway, being shut out with a AKQxxx suit facing an opening looks wrong|pg||
pc|c2|nt|monsted: exactly - EW must have a possibel slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant relly go off |pg||
pc|c6|nt|ady: 5@C down on spade ruffs|pg||
nt|sfoxa: yes, David, although, for invitational hand, partner should have more than W has|pg||

mb|4D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: So we are all wondering how this breaking news hit Århus|pg||

nt|roswolf: the gremlins!?|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi Christina - I just told that 2X overcalls on 9xxxx from Morten and Lars gave u a chok - and startet the hole...|pg||
mb|5C|nt|christinas: actually it is our neighbour who is in labour...|pg||
mb|p|nt|monsted: hello Christina - |pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm is this clearly a cue?|pg||
nt|christinas: well, I was dreaming about something like that, it could have started the whole thing|pg||
nt|christinas: but now I hope all specs are awake, I know I am since people started calling me to ask if they could help driving me to the hospital...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They really should bid the cold grand slam :)  Not least against Storeslemmen = The Grand Slam|pg||
nt|monsted: lol nice people|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|monsted: what is 5 clubs|pg||
nt|roswolf: well an exciting push likely|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Cue bid I assume|pg||
pc|c2|nt|monsted: but what about the aces ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Mere details|pg||
nt|christinas: If anybody is in doubt, Morten knows I'm not in labour and was not thrilled that I called him for no reason. And then he denied a spade cue by bidding 5clubs, but showed the king ...|pg||
nt|christinas: of clubs|pg||
nt|pelu: Nils - it is possible to bid a slam not using 4nt :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: nice|pg||

nt|mmmakela: but 4 @S is down|pg||
mb|1D|nt|monsted: another strong hand for West|pg||
nt|monsted: ty Mike :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: east would not have a chance to ask his pard about spade guards for 3n|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: wet is picking  up so big hands|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Board 2 corrected|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|christinas: most players would bid either an artificial 2nt to show @s support and GF or 4@h to show a void|pg||
nt|monsted: 3 NT will be down again|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub6/Turneringer/KampResultat634.html  for results and standings|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  true only 3@d would be "nat" asking for @s topper i.m.o.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mmmakela: once again; for kibs who want private answers please have your full name on your profile! I got mine so it would be polite if u are not just mr/ms nobodys!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dont think it is so clear about not leading from the unsupported queen single dummy. it seems to me you lead one queen or lead from the other. what lead is better? club does not ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: seem dynamic -- if pd has nothing there u havent done much for your side, and if you are hoping to find an honor in partner's hand, why not look for it in a suit where it can do ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the most good (i.e. in a suit where you have one too)?|pg||
mb|p|nt|monsted: no sorry 9 tricks on the god spade|pg||
nt|monsted: 2NT on 19 I dont understand|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT   can get home on favourable spade split|pg||
nt|monsted: 20|pg||
nt|monsted: maybe 2NT is forcing|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5d fine here just lose the two bullets|pg||
mb|2S|an|4th|mb|p|nt|ady: seems not|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4N to play also a winning option in practice|pg||
nt|monsted: 4 spades if a litle strange here|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Part score here|pg||
mb|3H|nt|monsted: nope must be a miscount ?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: how can u pass as E?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: what on earth is east up to why is he slamming with 1 flattish points hios pard has not promised extras|pg||
nt|pelu: very aggressiv X by West - spec with @CK in front of the @C-opening|pg||
mb|4C|nt|cindy:  W isn't shy|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: this may well be a swing against Blakset|pg||
nt|lestergold: 13|pg||
nt|ady: 4@C?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|nielsfoged:  optimal contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: well some excitement any way|pg||
nt|rnmalik: very strang last hand E had better @D and he DBLED and now he has better @H and bids 2@D|pg||
nt|mmmakela: if W promises his cards|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 1820|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Board is cancelled. One player, accidentally, saw a card belong to N and one belonging to E|pg||
nt|mmmakela: could even call it foolish|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Board 1 that is|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well sanity has crept back in here|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, E does have some extras, but predictably W's reasonable 4@D was based partially on distribution.  At some point they recognized this.|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes butnoslam going extras|pg||
nt|lestergold: enough to make 11 tricks a proposition|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1NT +2 in this room|pg||
nt|pelu: I agre Markku - I also hate specs with "no name"|pg||
nt|mmmakela: dias lead now?|pg||
nt|sfoxa: E would mind|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I might lead the J@C|pg||
nt|sfoxa: very tiny game, but possible with unaccurate defence|pg||
nt|mmmakela: last train type?|pg||
nt|ady: 6@H  a fair contract|pg||
nt|mmmakela: seems antiques both sides|pg||
nt|vugraphzyy: trelde |pg||
mb|6H|nt|jcwla: Well, I think E's sequence was reasonable, show some extras (slam is possible opp some 4@D hands there), then pull back.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I am all wrong It is N to lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: my principle against suit part scores where there is unlikely to be anything to spare is to not get busy |pg||
nt|snorris:  this should make|pg||
nt|lestergold: communications between the defnders are fotunately not too ood|pg||
nt|lestergold: good|pg||
nt|cindy:  would have been easy with a @d lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: somewhat odd silence on first round by N, who is usually a forward bidder|pg||
nt|snorris:  yes..a good 4 card suit|pg||
nt|snorris:  in @hs|pg||
nt|lestergold: i overcall a heart on first round in case my partner is on lead and other reasons|pg||
nt|cindy:  now will declarer think its possible for W to have singleton @d ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W bidding would be 100% for me if NV, but vul more questionable. could go for several hundred against nothing even undoubled, and possession of spades may buy you time--less urgent ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: to bid first round|pg||
nt|cindy:  he can always get rid of losing @d later but might not realize there is no hurry|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: Hi olks sorry late |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: hmm inconsistent|pg||
nt|lestergold: more reasonable than some weve seen today i agree|pg||
nt|ady: cards lay well   spade finesse on  Q10 hearts doubleton with north   and diamonds 3-3|pg||
nt|vugraphzyy: control in cl  - and two aces for hearts|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mmmakela: probs with my dogs brb|pg||
nt|lestergold: Marshall are you evenmore old fashioned than me|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|lestergold: but lets bearin miond that making 5d here does depend on everything behaving reasonably well|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: ace of clubs on side helps this hand |pg||
nt|rnmalik: Friendly placement|pg||
nt|ady: hi Mike|pg||
nt|ady: may well make 7|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ritong: i will spare you my usual titade about raptor:)|pg||
nt|ritong: tirade*|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  2nd hand t.o. Dbl would require shorter @ss/longer @cs - closer to 1NT i.mo.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mmmakela: even 7 makes this time if u somehow end up there|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: the risks of NOT biodding with north's hand are arguably much greater|pg||
nt|snorris:  very clever..|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ritong: if you want a possible solution to these problems, just google " raptor"|pg||
nt|rnmalik: even 2 @C by P has rebid of 2@D|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hi Markku and hi David|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sybarra: now can make 5 |pg||
pc|d3|nt|christinas: EW have often represented Denmark in international events|pg||
nt|roswolf: i prefer T-Rex|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  ..still I agree that it was strandge (and expensive for EW) that Jepsen didn't bid 2@d rather than Dbl on former hand|pg||
nt|mmmakela: himike|pg||

pc|dA|nt|pelu: some spects tell me: tto kind with peter Schaltz - the X is not only aggressiv - but bad bridge! OK:)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: FYI specs, there is NOT a 1 hour time difference between Århus and Copenhagen :)|pg||

nt|roswolf: another hand full of possibilities|pg||
nt|rnmalik: another action board|pg||
nt|lestergold: a roland deal here|pg||
nt|jcwla: 4 a push at 5@D making.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a trivial 4S next|pg||
nt|sfoxa: and one more 3NT - for ns this time|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ritong: yes niels|pg||
nt|lestergold: wnow why did i say that?|pg||
nt|monsted: by ruffing you wil have 12 or 13 in any layout - but single in N|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|ritong: as said, 4 NT spot remains possible|pg||

nt|mmmakela: playing udca|pg||
nt|pelu: Aakirkeby BK er from the small island Bornholm between Sweden and Poland|pg||
nt|marlowepi: diamond ten maes it cold|pg||
nt|cindy:  or more|pg||

nt|cindy:  N will be in love with her hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: i would have bid 1@S as west i confess|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi nils|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|sybarra: results: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub6/KlubTurn.html|pg||
mb|2D|an|game force|nt|ritong: looks clearcut, for sevral reasons|pg||
nt|lestergold: Roland loves deals like this|pg||
nt|sfoxa: W knows partner's suit, will he lead it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: even without heart honor lead, could discard a D on 3rd heart|pg||
nt|ady: e/w  have a tight 4@H|pg||
nt|mmmakela: tough 4 H here|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: WOW GOING FOR THE THROAT|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ady: n/s can make 2/@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|christinas: EW struggling to find the best place to play|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @S might have been best |pg||
nt|roswolf: south hoping pard has his bidding - which he does of course|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s4|nt|ritong: first reason, ofc, is that you can have a @s game or slam, even playing a strong @c system|pg||
nt|roswolf: north to bid again - surely not|pg||
nt|lestergold: anyone tell me free virtual Danish pastry  for first one to tell me|pg||
nt|mmmakela: might not be easy|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ady: 3 level looks 1 too high for both sides|pg||
nt|lestergold: and this is a typical outcome for a roland favourite hand type|pg||
nt|monsted: is nt this a winner|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lestergold: no entrants to my comp?|pg||
nt|monsted: 2 loser in hearts 1 in dia and 1 in clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: high card points distributed 20/20|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|christinas: this is trickt because of the @s split.|pg||
nt|sybarra: big card is 8 of spades|pg||
pc|dT|nt|christinas: You have to play A and small to the ten to avoid 3 @s losers|pg||
nt|roswolf: incroyable|pg||
nt|ritong: second reason is that you tend to obstruct the bidding when hand belongs to opponents if it does not cost you a penalty too often|pg||
pc|d5|nt|marlowepi: undoubtedly N would have liked to do more, but the cuebid already puts them at 4H so she made the practical underbid|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ady: can make with A@D right for a spde discard   and clubs 3-3|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Lead favourable|pg||
nt|sybarra: but you will lose 3 @S that way |pg||
nt|sybarra: need ot lead low from dummy I think |pg||
nt|sybarra: then towards the 10 |pg||
nt|christinas: nonsens, S of course always gets 3, sry|pg||
nt|sybarra: so 3 sp and a @H,  = -1 |pg||
nt|ady: alyes sorry  3@H a make|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|nielsfoged:  EW must be careful|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ady: yes|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  not the day to choose the 4-4 Ma fit!|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 4/5 have been 3 NT|pg||
pc|h5|pc|dQ|nt|lestergold: in spite of the hearts wrong everything else is very ight|pg||
nt|lestergold: right|pg||
nt|sfoxa: quite an interesting position for W - he has to find 2 more spare cards|pg||
nt|mmmakela: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub6/Turneringer/KampResultat638.html  for results and standings after round 6|pg||
nt|mmmakela: the holders OYJ leading but in trouble now in this match|pg||
nt|mmmakela: once again: we have a new policy amongst the commentators, private messages only answered if whole name included in the profile|pg||

nt|nielsfoged:  (not likely!!)|pg||
nt|roswolf: more fun here if south opens|pg||
nt|monsted: 6 spades makes here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if you want to call it that. but it was a technically correct play, which is not too grosvenorish|pg||
nt|mmmakela: no!!!!|pg||
nt|sfoxa: not exactly...|pg||
nt|ady: good result for e/w|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: As Mare Winningham asked in "Miracle Mile," "What's the hurry, Harry?"|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: y |pg||
nt|mmmakela: will play 4 S here|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|mmmakela: but won't bid it|pg||
nt|ady: n/s bound to be ing ame    likely going down in both 4@S and 3NT|pg||
mb|3H|an|spade|mb|p|nt|monsted: maybe - when East shows spades it looks good|pg||
mb|3S|nt|roswolf: i dont like the heavy 2@C bid|pg||
nt|monsted: now 4 clubs|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 5 dias -3 w h ruff|pg||
nt|cindy:  i dont like 2@h|pg||
nt|snorris:  a rear convention|pg||
nt|cindy:  at all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he has 2 hearts, so very descriptive|pg||
nt|cindy:  lolol|pg||
nt|cindy:  sorry to be so blunt|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it might show 4 spades and longer minor rather than michaels|pg||
mb|p|nt|nielsfoged:  Dbl 1st round anyone with W?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|christinas: On the 6@s hand Århus got 3 imps - the contract was 5@sXX in the open room...|pg||
nt|jcwla: 12 points and five quack cards, what a thing of beauty.|pg||
nt|cindy:  yeh well   i still wouldnt like it|pg||
nt|lestergold: blunt is good Cindy|pg||
nt|mmmakela: Dorthe's and Peter's son is in the audience, Hi Martin!|pg||
nt|sfoxa: or may be it's normal to open vulnerable Multi with 5 points only?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: trouble ahead maybe|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rnmalik: any chance for 3NT by EW has a play|pg||
nt|monsted: 4 hearts - 4NT|pg||
nt|cindy:  u mean smoking a blunt ?|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  @ss are good enough for @c now|pg||
nt|snorris:  -1..if Peter doesnt pull ALL his aces|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  sorry next trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: no being honest direct blunt etc is good i dont know about smoking i dont smoke|pg||
mb|p|nt|nielsfoged:  @sQ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: small slam on club position      cant go wrong with  QX onside|pg||
nt|ady: if diamond is not cashed there are 13 tricks here|pg||
nt|monsted: I dont understand Frederik - when 4 clubs he must follow with 4 NT - only when 3 clubs whitout the Q it is bad|pg||
nt|pelu: what is going on in S? - He could open 1Nt or bid 1NT in sekund round - but 2@C????|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i prefer double--or possibly1S==with W hand also, but maybe EW dont play equal level conversion|pg||
nt|rnmalik: another 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: i would have been tempted|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  me too|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  beyond resistance|pg||
nt|ady: might make 4@S     |pg||
nt|sfoxa: yes, if E finds @d lead|pg||
pc|c5|nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well these two are obviously not pupils of Roland|pg||
nt|lestergold: he will be very disspointed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I am not|pg||
nt|lestergold: wont allow them in his bridge centre|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear You are here|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  maybe not so fond of 1NT opening?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mmmakela: he always is......|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh why didnt someone tell me|pg||
nt|pelu: no but 2@c?|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  yes a foreseeable situation after the "expected" 1@s|pg||
nt|mmmakela: bad bidding got what it deserved imo|pg||
nt|pelu: even bigger problem if pd bid 1@H - now I dont like 1NT|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sybarra: maybe now |pg||
nt|sybarra: I assume 2 @d was game force |pg||
nt|rnmalik: have 12 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4th suit forcing |pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  how would you bid after 1NT-opening (15-17)?|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rnmalik: 5@C+5@H+1@S+1@D=12|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe on their way,  but W have to be dragged along,  his spade suit is not "robust" |pg||
nt|jcwla: The double gained 2 IMPs for N/S on 5.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: you mean all these Waldks? they are all the one and only same person??|pg||
nt|rnmalik: strange first the 2@S and now 4@S|pg||
nt|mmmakela: guess 3 dias call indicated 5 spades|pg||
nt|sfoxa: that's more intersting contract than 3nt|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mmmakela: can still make after dias lead;3x hearts|pg||
pc|s8|nt|nielsfoged:  expecting fit in at least 1 black suit|pg||
nt|pelu: better play 1D4 - now pd is endplayed|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe west leading not being dragged |pg||
nt|ady: problem i is east can get a club ruff together with 2 trump tricks   and A@D|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|mmmakela: 1@D-2@D seems ok to me even with 16 points|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sybarra: 6 @C not a bad spot |pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  EW gained 5 imps for missing 3NT in  3!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We have results!   http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub6/Turneringer/Resultat633.html   All favourites won big in round 1|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  I think the 15 nice hcps can be used for opening 1@d and rebidding 3@d - but depends one style|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|sybarra: I was looking at nt also |pg||
nt|rnmalik: good slam, in duplicate|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Walddk4: Realistically, only four teams can win this year. One-Eyed Jacks and Blakset (both Copenhagen), Århus BK and BK Nord (Aalborg). OEJ are the holders|pg||
nt|ady: e/w did not get beyond 3NT on hand 1  with 6@D a certainty  and 7 actually makes    they only lost 1 imp|pg||
nt|mmmakela: no probs with dias 2-2 and spades optimally|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mmmakela: if pd passes we can't have a laydown game|pg||
pc|s5|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Bridgewise, Denmark is divided into 11 districts. The district winners, and an extra team from the district with the holders (Copenhagen), compete for the honours|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c2|pc|sT|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sfoxa: yes, from our point of view.|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|pc|cA|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jcwla: 6 a push at 4@H making.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||
pc|sK|nt|marlowepi: the one saving grace about 2H is that it increases chances of making a heart trick on defense. but that isnt enough upside to come close to outweighing the downside, IMHBAICO|pg||
nt|sfoxa: altough, experienced declarer can see his only chance - no others in view|pg||
nt|rnmalik: well played|pg||
pc|sA|nt|pelu: for sure I need a better suit for 3@D|pg||
nt|pelu: now W is endplayed - down 2|pg||
nt|mmmakela: will play HQ|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mmmakela: yes so club lead was the winner for def|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We are in Århus, the second largest city and the principal port of Denmark, situated on the peninsula of Jutland. It has around 300,000 inhabitants and claims the unofficial title ...|pg||

nt|nielsfoged:  3@d|pg||

nt|lestergold: well altho 4h can bemade N/S i dont expect them, to be in it|pg||
nt|jcwla: The intermediates definitely came into play there.|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  maybe the bid is 1NT 2nd round even if it shows just 12-14?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: why not 2@D?|pg||
nt|sfoxa: but this time - 3nt for sure :-) |pg||
nt|rnmalik: 9 top as we count and see|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 4@S NS, interesting hand otherwise|pg||
nt|pelu: when u support on a singleton u can also open 1NT on a 6 card minor|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I once commentated in a 8 board match where all 8 deals were played in 3 nt|pg||
nt|ady: likely 3NT n/s|pg||
mb|3D|nt|nielsfoged:  sorry!|pg||
nt|lestergold: what about 4S?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2s and a dim and maybe no diamonds??|pg||

nt|nielsfoged:  Easy 3NT NS LOL!|pg||
mb|p|nt|christinas: N didn't bid 1nt - they might not get there now|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I will bid 2@S after forced pass by N|pg||
nt|sybarra: how many spades to you bid as S ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: is 2 @S strong or weak?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or just a good suit?|pg||
nt|monsted: how many clubs from East |pg||
nt|jcwla: Lots of possible contracts here, from 4@SX to a N/S (save?).|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rnmalik: weak but good balancing|pg||

nt|marlowepi: showing the 2 of clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: oh|pg||
mb|p|nt|nielsfoged:  if you open 1d with down to 10 and distribution, these 15 hcps seems to give a too wide interval|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well-reasoned lead|pg||
nt|ady: looks clear for south to bid 3NT|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ady: 4@S  not makable on a club lead and forces|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so then we all agree on 1 nt opening, case closed|pg||
nt|sfoxa: special deals? |pg||
nt|sfoxa: or nt-loving randomizer  )))|pg||

nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm well south likes his shapely 3 count|pg||
nt|monsted: 3 or 4 clubs from East would have been better|pg||
nt|lestergold: the ruff is in effect going to be with east's money|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|jcwla: @D shift here.|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
pc|h4|nt|christinas: this is in my opinion an example of why if ofgten doesn't pay not to bid in bridge. I had bid on both the N and S hand. None of them did, and now they missed not only a partscore, ...|pg||
nt|christinas: but a game|pg||
nt|ritong: is it undiscreet to ask you about yourse, niels?|pg||

pc|h5|pg||
nt|sybarra: as I had conversation with several specs,  this is all by agreement,   some play 2 @S stronger than this hand |pg||
pc|s5|nt|rnmalik: true|pg||

pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|lestergold: surely not?|pg||

nt|lestergold: is tis correct operator?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyy: yes|pg||
nt|ady: thats what usually happens to me   I lead something against 3NT and opps play is straight back|pg||

nt|nielsfoged:  It will be interesting to see the results from all matches of Board  5 - does anyone have the methods to avoid 3 NT and reach 5@d? - Most likely would be the strong 1@c pairs (even better Relay-Precision)|pg||
nt|lestergold: do not understand|pg||
nt|monsted: must be !! ??|pg||
nt|lestergold: two asafe ways to rry for an overtrick and instead tries for one offski and succeeds|pg||
nt|jcwla: W happy to defend 1NT and even happier to defend 3NT if it comes to that.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|pelu: the bidding ask for @S-lead, so N only lead @C if he has a good @C-lead|pg||
nt|mmmakela: but would he lead one from dbltn looking at S's hand|pg||
nt|murat: baþlýyo|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: did this really take place?|pg||
nt|monsted: looks like a big wictory for BK Nord|pg||
nt|vugraphzyy: he was playing 3 H !!|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ritong: well we did suggest a possibility|pg||
nt|ritong: first, you give up on puppet stayman|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ritong: second, you bid your suits|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  yes but none of the players heard that|pg||
nt|mmmakela: YES peter|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have 25 hcp  and east a good 6 card heart suit   but again likely to go down in game|pg||
mb|2N|nt|rnmalik: simple bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: ah hah that explainis it oyall|pg||
nt|vugraphzyy: he thourght|pg||
nt|monsted: WAS plaing or ? |pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  2@h is probably showing @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: yeh sure we can se that|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ritong: and third, if opener is not interested, he comes back to NT at the 4 level|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: weve all done it|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  may end in 4@H   which could be difficult     3NT  looks more likely to make|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Next match in 30 minutes: Blakset vs Århus BK|pg||
nt|ady: clb lead    cuts of trick supply|pg||
nt|marlowepi: probably showing a sounder raise to 2S than a dirct 2S|pg||
nt|lestergold: a very poor game|pg||
nt|lestergold: I thnk West may have downgraded his Qx of hearts on the aucion|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at these colors i would judge the E hand to be very marginal for that action in a 2-way structure, and W also has some soft bits|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  but neither action is a distortion|pg||
mb|p|nt|christinas: It works fine in this case, but I would be worried about the 2 little clubs - if I had the same hand with 4333 it is another story|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Pure HCP points 15-17 + 10 and 2 Ts|pg||
nt|ritong: here, opener gladly accepts ( via 4@s) and 5@d is the final contract|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  problem is that most of us do not have a natural @d-bid after 2NT- or 2@c-openings|pg||
nt|rnmalik: so may finesses and 6 makes|pg||
nt|lestergold: but the lead couldnt be more helpful|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  No I just try to find explanation of why he didn't choose the (almost) obvious @c return|pg||
nt|pelu: keep looking :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: can they stay low here?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ady: still may have difficult making|pg||
nt|sfoxa: looks like first imps for OEJ|pg||
nt|mmmakela: finally 2 imps to OEJ|pg||
nt|sfoxa: and what will N lead?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lestergold: i must admit wild horses would nt have ;produced this lead from me|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|monsted: another 12 imps to BK Nord in board 8 ! - 6 spades bid|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|sfoxa: little bit of help comes|pg||
nt|ady: lead ok for declarer|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now might make|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|ritong: mind you, your question was " does anyone have methods..."|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am not sure about this line. if W feels like assuming from the lead that N does not have both top hearts (very reasonable but not guaranteed), then he will have all the rest of ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the artillery. and this lead is surely a singleton. so it seems right toi me to win the ace in dummy and lead a heart to the card of your choice. you cant ruff with spade ace and ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: also use it to draw a trump|pg||
nt|pelu: @cK in trick 2 work better|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: a club return might have been stronger but the clubs can still be cut off|pg||
nt|ady: west must remove club when in with A@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: west cannot be bl;amed for playing pard for a stifff space|pg||
nt|lestergold: i mjean why on earth would he expect his pard to resolve a qx position against an opp'sbid suit|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  S in open room may not have agreed fully with his partners lead and continuation against 2@s (@cA and @h5 to @hT and @hQ)!|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|mmmakela: good lead although not my choise|pg||

nt|lestergold: here comes the club?|pg||

nt|lestergold: oh derar|pg||
pc|hK|pc|s6|nt|nielsfoged:  yes an my bet is that at most 1-2 of the 12 pairs bidding  5 will have that capacity (I actrually expect 12/12 3NT-1)|pg||
nt|ady: squeeze on declarer|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h6|pg||

pc|c2|nt|lestergold: i can understand hiom not expecting partner to hopld six clubs which he might have led from in preference to Qx of spades|pg||

nt|mmmakela: north wondering which major S holds|pg||
mb|p|nt|monsted: af in OR|pg||
nt|lestergold: well west has stuck neck out a little more conservatively here than in the open room|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I don't think you can make 5|pg||
mb|p|mb|r|nt|nielsfoged:  no you are right|pg||
nt|lestergold: dont think you can get rid of two spades in south's hand|pg||
nt|pelu: tell us how u make 11 tricks, Niels?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: looks like 3 losers to me|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  sorry|pg||
nt|mmmakela: has pretty good support for both|pg||
nt|mmmakela: needs H lead to beat|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That is the easy part when partner has 5+ spades|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But he may fancy 5@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rnmalik: NT opening with stiff @SK was the reason in the OR|pg||
nt|roswolf: the offcentre 1nt in the other room didnt work too well|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 43o or so will give 9 imps to Blakset|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Which major to lead against 3NT is the question|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  I will absolutely NOT :)|pg||
nt|pelu: no Niels - u are welcome - now we are the clever ones :):)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ritong: i guess bidding went 1 NT 3NT or something like that|pg||
nt|ady: unusual opening  West|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 3N needs spade lead, good chances|pg||
mb|2D|mb|3C|nt|cindy:  what was opening 2@c on 8    the hand was pretty similiar to this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: simple auction here|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and correct|pg||
nt|ritong: oh we have the two rooms today, so we have auctions|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: wd N|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S looks a long way away now|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|ady: maybe not|pg||
mb|3S|nt|rnmalik: marked difference in bidding as compared with OR|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 3 nt better than 4 S|pg||
mb|p|nt|nielsfoged:  No one took your bet on 1NT-3NT, Henry?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mmmakela: 1 more to go, ty all and hope see u tomorrow!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: we did not yesterday|pg||
nt|ritong: no:(|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  not so easy to get the tempo, maybe would have been best chance to let the @c go?|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  (looks easy from here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: Jepson did not ruff 3rd spade high enough on hand 10    got overruffed and East played a club   hence the result of 2 down|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mmmakela: this has straight 4 losers|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sfoxa: but anyway - 4 imps for OEJ|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good defense|pg||
nt|ady: North will cash the 2 aces|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  back in tempo now?|pg||
nt|ritong: but if @d AK are not with @c Q, defense can certainly establish a @c, so your option looks better|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 6 IMPs I think|pg||
nt|ady: sit back and wait for 2 trump tricks|pg||
pc|hA|nt|nielsfoged:  they go on stealing imps|pg||
nt|mmmakela: ok last 1 coming up|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sybarra: this will play nicely |pg||

nt|ady: 8 tricks looks ok in spades|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and to our commentators: David, Mike, Nils and Markku|pg||

pc|h8|nt|christinas: the missed slam and game made the big difference|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks also to my co commentator Rashed and Christiana. We appreciate your time, your insights |pg||
nt|rnmalik: Board 7 and 8 damaging for NS|pg||
nt|sybarra: Our gratitude to the Danish Bridge Federation and Jeppe G. Knappe and Niels Aagaard for bringing this wonderful tourney to BBO.  Much appreciated by bridge fans all over the world|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks also to our specs who give us helpful comments and some humor!|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but maybe they can manage it|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  minors are too awful|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  ...for 4@s|pg||
nt|ritong: talking about that, the problem arises when opàener has a big hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think there is a case for passing here|pg||
nt|ritong: and can t raise @ss too high|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  that would be a well-deserved 13 imps|pg||
nt|ritong: because it is 4th suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: may try 2nt|pg||
nt|ritong: a possibility is he uses an " impossible" 3@h bid|pg||
nt|ritong: to show 4@s and strong|pg||

pc|hT|nt|sybarra: PS   Special thanks to Roland for his tireless efforts organizing the vugraph!|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|roswolf: intersesting henri|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  a little easier to pass when non-vuln|pg||
nt|mmmakela: The play will resume 9.30 Danish time tomorrow(remember to adjust your clocks for winter time!)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, but we have one more match today, Markku|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In 20 minutes|pg||

pc|d7|nt|nielsfoged:  could he be 1 down?|pg||

nt|jcwla: the 11th RR segment.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lestergold: can west develop an overtrick in clubs safely?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: seems better to play queen and lead a club if it holds|pg||
nt|lestergold: double dummy eay|pg||
nt|lestergold: easy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No, he doesn't have the entries|pg||
nt|pelu: he can try - but after @Dagain - no chance|pg||
nt|ady: this might be a swing for east west|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk4: Rødovre vs One-Eyed Jacks|pg||

nt|nielsfoged:  at least 7 tricks, but...|pg||
nt|po-s: west might continue with diamonds|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk4: He can advance @C9 now, but then he can't play on clubs any more|pg||
nt|pelu: but DD he can|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Anything is possible with all cards in view|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Dorthe was always going to make 5|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk4: Don't worry, you can sleep one hour more :)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|nielsfoged:  but OK those @c's are prettyu high|pg||
nt|ady: general opinion 3@H should go down    not an easy contract    but I think it is makable if going up with K@C first round|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|po-s: too late|pg||
nt|sfoxa: let's imagine, S doesn't play @c ace in the first round of suit|pg||
