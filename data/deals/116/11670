nt|thorvald: So 6@S by South would be a Roland-slam, need a friendly lead, and a small miracle ?|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|pelu: so another 0.5 penalty - they have tryed that 1 time before|pg||

pc|s9|nt|Walddk2: East in the other room took North's cards, so E-W played as N-S on that deal|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In this room right now, Bilde-Hansen are therefore E-W|pg||

nt|Walddk2: so who did?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No need to switch seats if no-one is at fault|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|nt|pelu: I am a little slow :( - but if Wast play @SQ - will that defeat 3NT?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|nielsbio: He did certainly take some cards, he was not to play.|pg||
nt|thorvald: 3NT always making|pg||
pc|c2|pg||

pc|s4|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|nt|nielsbio: But the tables were wrongly set up.|pg||

pc|s3|nt|cindy:  N cant make a penalty double ?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|roswolf: lack of entries to dummy will become all too evident|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|sfoxa: We are to follow Danish Club Teams Championship. Doesn it mean, there are Nationals as well, beside Clubs?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: for those who forgot to adjust their clocks we are NOT 1 hour late|pg||
pc|h6|nt|monsted: East could have made a penalty dobl here i think|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome|pg||
nt|jcwla: E would probably double at matchpoints, but at IMPS penalty doubles into game should be made only if confident of setting the contract (some say by 2 tricks).|pg||
nt|snorris:  needs to raise @hs|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mmmakela: sry don't understand your question Sveta|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|mmmakela: nowadays you tend to lose the minors|pg||
nt|mmmakela: depending what 2D-2 NT can have pretty lame|pg||
nt|ady: was going to be difficult to reach the slam    2 key cards in north hand    and still needs good fortune with the clubs|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|nt|ritong: hi|pg||

nt|roswolf: yes it does look doomed|pg||
nt|lestergold: a bit unluky neither red suit behaves|pg||
nt|roswolf: life is like that|pg||
nt|lestergold: west of course doesnt know his partner has a second diamond winner|pg||
nt|lestergold: but he must play a low spade here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Board 1 will be cancelled I am told. One of the players in the closed room took somebody else's cards|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jcwla: The OR is starting with 11 and 12 so we will be feeding them comparisons until we get that far.|pg||

nt|lestergold: hi Snorri|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sfoxa: if this is Club teams, do they have another teams championship?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: W's second dbl didn't work out well|pg||

nt|lestergold: and handed the contract to south on a plate|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah well at least we know it doesnt matter|pg||
mc|9|nt|marlowepi: 2D would be a lot to bid in most standard methods|pg||

mb|5D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: He did|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bilde is married to Hansen's sister|pg||
nt|thorvald: Strange that he got only 8 tricks in CR|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Dorte without the  h|pg||
nt|thorvald: Poul Clemmensen is a long time to find the natural @Club lead. Perhaps he is considering @SK|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this contract has a lot of handling charges|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Only 2 losers (diamonds), but far away from 11 tricks|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sharynr: he may be tempted to allow the club lead to lose|pg||
nt|thorvald: When many trumphs, lead your longest suit|pg||
nt|nielsbio: Another thing is, Århus BK has just lost an appeal in the local appeals-comite, where they could have gained 5 MP. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Does this give him a chance I wonder|pg||
nt|sharynr: then will need 1 of 2 finesses and trump break|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h6|pg||
nt|thorvald: But I think the 2@C rebid scared him, so knowing partner have long hearts. The @HQ is ok, but i remember an old Bols tip, that you should lead the small in this situation|pg||

nt|rnmalik: 3 Nt by NS good spot|pg||
nt|sfoxa: with a lot of finesses, although )))|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Bridgewise, Denmark is divided into 11 districts. The district winners, and an extra team from the district with the holders (Copenhagen), compete for the honours|pg||
nt|mmmakela: slam is not great but could be laydown if N also held @C 10|pg||

nt|monsted: this is 4 spades - but with this weak opening they will go too high I think|pg||
nt|jcwla: A Rule of 20 opener here and this seems to be the rare right time for a trump lead.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Singleton trump lead that is.|pg||
nt|lestergold: work to deo to get at ten tricks but opps even with trump lead cannot get enough trump plays in|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all|pg||

nt|mmmakela: by S  good|pg||
nt|lestergold: a bit of a misfit here|pg||
mb|1H|nt|rnmalik: will NS find it|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Yep|pg||
nt|snorris:  as if west MIGHT come in .|pg||
mb|p|nt|christinas: EW play weak NT|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S  looks a possibility   but with trumps 5-1 looks doomed  especiaally on a heart lead|pg||
mb|2C|nt|lestergold: 5 spades 2 dims a heart and two club ruffs is ten tricks what if south ducks a diamond lead towards dummy?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Wow.|pg||
nt|lestergold: At unfavourable vulnerability??|pg||
nt|lestergold: is south colour blind?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the Schaltz team name is also the title of an outstanding Western from late 50s or early 60s starring Marlon Brando and Karl Malden|pg||
nt|lestergold: E/W playing a weak no trump?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: no transfer, interesting  |pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  Youth displays courage|pg||
nt|lestergold: obviously|pg||
nt|snorris:  very popular in Denmark|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  Again: @cQ behind J for winning 3NT - so now it is proven 100%|pg||
mb|2H|an|6 !h 8-11 hp|nt|roswolf: 4@S IS AN INSPIRED CHOICE|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  ...and will become older|pg||
nt|lestergold: its youth|pg||
nt|lestergold: well doube dummy there are 9 tricks available in 3N |pg||
nt|mmmakela: good lead|pg||
nt|sfoxa: not so easy with this start |pg||
nt|mmmakela: 135 leads|pg||
nt|mmmakela: promising 2 or none higher|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: Japenese?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: W's t/o dbl is little weak to my taste|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah well 3nt is always forgiving|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: true|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: not much chance of this making  |pg||
nt|lestergold: kamikaze trained|pg||
nt|mmmakela: for englishorientated audience EW team name is quite exotic|pg||
nt|ady: north might have reasoned south will be short in hearts    but has to be wary of at least 10 cards in the minors  so not likely to fit well in spades|pg||
nt|marlowepi: awkward bid for N but when you can overbid in a way that allows you to tell your whole story, it is generally a good idea, especially at IMPs|pg||
nt|roswolf: well discipline reigns|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ady: club values bad for declarer|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  ...and richer|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh my west has let vul opps off hook|pg||
nt|monsted: Dennis is normaly very solid - despice of Junior|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ritong: first board was a clue about north s style|pg||
nt|lestergold: and 11 tricks i think is a distance too far|pg||
nt|jcwla: This sure looks like the time for a double by W.  E appears to have wasted @C values and W has the reds locked up, no comprendo.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|christinas: unpleasant to balance for NS, but they can make 3@c|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ritong: brutal.|pg||
nt|lestergold: on this defence a lot of tricks available |pg||
pc|hA|nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
nt|ady: likely 2 down|pg||
nt|lestergold: look at the mountain that south had offered|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: the children would have to be sent to bed early|pg||
nt|lestergold: and south was warned by the splinter that clubs were NOT breaking|pg||
nt|lestergold: well nmot the sharpestr defence ive ever seen |pg||
nt|lestergold: so far that is|pg||
nt|vugraphzyy: 4 cl = void|pg||
pc|h6|nt|rnmalik: Weak NT has its advantages aswell|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@H = 4. suit - tto strong for direct 4@S - but 3@S is in my book and overbid - 4.suit + 4@S is the hand!|pg||
pc|hT|nt|roswolf: well with a bit of luck on their side they are formidable|pg||
pc|h5|nt|marlowepi: given that you dont really want S on lead, i predict 4 club tricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: here thanks to system no need to do anything dramatic, though the N hand is suitable enough for a D contract that 2H is an underbid|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jcwla: If West's splinter showed the void -- then it's incomprehensible.  If not, then the Rule of 20 opener combined with W's feeling of still having hidden extra values and a possible ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: slam at least makes it comprehensible, though still not my choice...|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|pelu: 4.suit + 4@s = mild slaminvit , 4.suit + 3@S = strong slam invit|pg||
nt|lestergold: boing void in pard's seond suit is a little bit of a dampener allowing a downgrade|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ady: +200 should be a useful score for e/w on a non event hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: then im afraid the men in white coats should be summoned|pg||
nt|lestergold: i meanm for south|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|nt|snorris:  your cristalball is right|pg||

nt|sfoxa: rehi, Markku, hi, David|pg||
nt|ady: hi Sveta|pg||
nt|ady: does not know club will live|pg||

pc|dK|pg||
nt|mmmakela: not J?|pg||
nt|lestergold: hard not to losee 3 clubs a heart and a dim in 3n|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: am i seeing things|pg||
nt|lestergold: how many tricks has south given away to declarer?|pg||
nt|jcwla: 6 to Blakset on 1, while their N/S failed by 2 in 3@C here, their E/W failed by 3 in 3NT in the OR.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|cT|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|mmmakela: needs good guessing now|pg||
pc|d9|nt|marlowepi: the issues in 3N seems to be more a matter of having no tricks|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jcwla: Enough that this is now coming home.|pg||
nt|lestergold: in spite of south';s best efforts to give his oppos an early xmas one way or the other, declarer shgould still be left with an inescapable club loser|pg||
nt|jcwla: Disagree.|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh no its oit inescapable|pg||
nt|lestergold: is uit/|pg||
nt|lestergold: the qclubs is coming down|pg||

nt|christinas: champions|pg||
nt|roswolf: easy game|pg||
nt|roswolf: a hand of promise now|pg||
nt|ady: e/w may end in 4@s  going down|pg||
nt|jcwla: In the OR, E passed, S opened 1@D, and the contract is a quiet 4@S.|pg||
nt|pelu: No Martin is not - the team is from the Copenhagen Club One-Eyed Jacks - a club with 16 teams - only playing teams (and a few IMP-pair)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: strange play,but all well in the end|pg||
nt|ady: poor defence    trump should have beden played|pg||
nt|ady: been|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3 spades 2 hearts 3 dims and 2 clubsthere are tricks but unfortunatley there are more than four tricks for the defence|pg||
nt|roswolf: safely done|pg||
mb|1H|nt|monsted: yes this could give som action|pg||
nt|lestergold: and sharp defence could threaten 4S|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: an easy game|pg||
mb|3H|an|4! 7-9hp|nt|nielsfoged:  6@c is ok|pg||
nt|sfoxa: hard to avoid 3 NT here as well|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 3 nt has a flaw here|pg||
mb|3S|nt|roswolf: 3@S?|pg||
nt|snorris:  180 not 210 surely|pg||
mb|4H|nt|rnmalik: 3NT by EW on a @S lead, |pg||
nt|monsted: 3 clubs non vul is not much here|pg||
nt|ady: this will not be a success|pg||
nt|lestergold: 9 top tricks 3n|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  but somewhat Roland style|pg||
nt|jcwla: An overtrick IMP on 2 as 4@S made on the dot.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: but with such a thin spade guard may be difficult to bid now|pg||
nt|mmmakela: w might bid 3 nt now|pg||
nt|lestergold: potential here for e/w to get overboard|pg||
nt|ady: 5@D  looks on for n/s|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: not any more lol|pg||
nt|rnmalik: No @C lead and made|pg||
nt|mmmakela: surely W can't find C K lead|pg||
nt|mmmakela: would've been spectacular|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: east took a risk doubling 1@s|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @S lead by N|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ritong: he wanted to show his @h xxxx, we guess$|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: 3NT after the 3@D bid optimistic|pg||
nt|lestergold: nothing of interest here|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@S emerged boldy dont see why at these colors|pg||
nt|lestergold: You wanna see what emerged form Bilde at these colours yesterday!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at these colors i am a bit surprised S did not double, but maybe that would have some special meaning in NS methods, such as "i have a trump stack"|pg||
nt|roswolf: well the neck was stretched out for axing|pg||
nt|sybarra: would have been an expensive axe !|pg||
nt|lestergold: It was Bilde who offered his non vul opps something like a 4 figure penalty but they went on to bid 5 which was easy to defeat then bilde carved up the defence so there was no ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: happy endiong|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|roswolf: i might have called again as east|pg||
nt|monsted: pass in North ?? - should have bid 4 spades I think|pg||
nt|sfoxa: sometime you'll find @d 4-4 by opps|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|ady: looks down 4   -400|pg||
nt|mmmakela: u like Dorthe's bids Peter?|pg||
nt|lestergold: Bilde may be colour blind|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: best defence this is one off i fear|pg||
nt|lestergold: or Bild may be wild|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ritong: but the scenario was relatively predictable with his @s single|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  but in 6@c do not play on double finesse - which would be rather natural after the 2@s bid|pg||
nt|jcwla: I would also open 1@C with West but a minority of players might choose something else.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 4s lucky to go obly three off reverse the heart honours and its 4 off|pg||
nt|lestergold: I dont think in an imps game its good business to o for such a potentially expensive save- especially when the game doesnt always make|pg||
nt|lestergold: it does here and it would profit but nothing to write home about|pg||
nt|monsted: not a safe - but to make it difficult for EW to make the rigth decision|pg||
nt|snorris:  credit to east for threding carefully|pg||
nt|lestergold: but makes now on the lead|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: and overboard they went |pg||
nt|cindy:  might not make 3@h even   oops  that lead helps the cause|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|ritong: so, if the system allows it, i think that bidding @ds immediately is more sound|pg||
nt|ritong: and, if pard has @hs, it will be good for @d trump as well|pg||
nt|sybarra: or "c"  all of the above|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ady: n/s should get a plus if they dont  mangle the diamond suit|pg||
pc|h8|nt|lestergold: not an easy lead i must admit but my choice would have been a passive club when the bididnmg shows the contract is likely to be tight|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rnmalik: Thought so, Shirley:) 2@H and 3@C discouraging bids but even then|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk4: Did he really make 4 overtricks on board 2?|pg||
nt|lestergold: not possiblem Roland|pg||
nt|cindy:  think so|pg||
nt|lestergold: must have lost the AD at the end|pg||
nt|vugraphzyy: sr - no 10 tricks|pg||
nt|snorris:  must have been operators mistake|pg||
nt|lestergold: having already lost two hearts|pg||
nt|marlowepi: before we heap any more scorn on 3S, we should bear in mind that there is plenty of room in principle for his partner to hold useful values--S has opened at favorable and N has ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: announced 7-9. W could have up to  13 HCP, more than enough for EW game if they are nicely situated|pg||
pc|d8|nt|monsted: no 4 down - I would have bid 4 spades om E - strange not to|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|cJ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|lestergold: there is some equity in it but north apart form spade support has a working yarboroug in tnhe side suits|pg||
nt|cindy:  on the lead  there is a tiny inference that S might have doubled 2@d|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: even with diamonds 4-4 Sveta  still the A@S|pg||
nt|sfoxa: but EW have cool 5@c|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|nt|roswolf: funny but pard never has these goodies when i am so bold|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rnmalik: absolutely correct Henri bidding 2 @D would not hurt|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i think leading away from an unsupported Q is an unnecessary risk on this bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: and it cost as we have seen|pg||
nt|cindy:  yes  a negative inference|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  he hasn't won it yet|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk4: Good afternoon to Niels Foged|pg||
pc|c7|nt|christinas: not very scientifically bid. NS are not in a regular partnership|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|mmmakela: well 3nt could be based on 1suiter|pg||
nt|pelu: what could she do - 3@C is fair, and over 4@DX ir is hard to pass|pg||
nt|sybarra: me either, so I guess we need new pards|pg||
nt|roswolf: true|pg||
pc|s4|nt|monsted: Anyway East hand is no use - and 1 suiter somes not often in this auction|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  now he has|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|nielsfoged:  Hello everyone|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|pg||
nt|ritong: anyway, being shut out with a AKQxxx suit facing an opening looks wrong|pg||
pc|s5|nt|monsted: exactly - EW must have a possibel slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant relly go off |pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: 5@C down on spade ruffs|pg||
nt|sfoxa: yes, David, although, for invitational hand, partner should have more than W has|pg||
pc|sA|nt|marlowepi: maybe it is a karmic thing then. anyway i am not saying i would make this 3S call, but i have a little sympathy in this case|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|ritong: hi |pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|nielsfoged:  Interesting 3@s bid - if it is a splinter with @c support, W must have been quite tempted!|pg||

nt|pelu: for 5 card major - 3@D = no 5 card but 1or 2 4 card majors|pg||

nt|marlowepi: seem dynamic -- if pd has nothing there u havent done much for your side, and if you are hoping to find an honor in partner's hand, why not look for it in a suit where it can do ...|pg||

nt|lestergold: 4N to play also a winning option in practice|pg||

mb|p|nt|monsted: nope must be a miscount ?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: how can u pass as E?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: what on earth is east up to why is he slamming with 1 flattish points hios pard has not promised extras|pg||
nt|pelu: very aggressiv X by West - spec with @CK in front of the @C-opening|pg||
nt|roswolf: 6@C by west might have some play on another day|pg||
pc|h5|nt|cindy:  W isn't shy|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6N too|pg||
nt|lestergold: but neither sound to bid|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: this may well be a swing against Blakset|pg||
nt|lestergold: 13|pg||
nt|ady: 4@C?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|nielsfoged:  optimal contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: well some excitement any way|pg||
nt|rnmalik: very strang last hand E had better @D and he DBLED and now he has better @H and bids 2@D|pg||
nt|mmmakela: if W promises his cards|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 1820|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Board is cancelled. One player, accidentally, saw a card belong to N and one belonging to E|pg||
nt|mmmakela: could even call it foolish|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Board 1 that is|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|lestergold: well sanity has crept back in here|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, E does have some extras, but predictably W's reasonable 4@D was based partially on distribution.  At some point they recognized this.|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes butnoslam going extras|pg||
nt|lestergold: enough to make 11 tricks a proposition|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1NT +2 in this room|pg||
nt|pelu: I agre Markku - I also hate specs with "no name"|pg||
nt|mmmakela: dias lead now?|pg||
nt|sfoxa: E would mind|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I might lead the J@C|pg||
nt|sfoxa: very tiny game, but possible with unaccurate defence|pg||
nt|mmmakela: last train type?|pg||
nt|ady: 6@H  a fair contract|pg||
nt|mmmakela: seems antiques both sides|pg||
nt|vugraphzyy: trelde |pg||
nt|marlowepi: or by E on another day. if it is another day, the heart king could be in the S hand|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jcwla: Well, I think E's sequence was reasonable, show some extras (slam is possible opp some 4@D hands there), then pull back.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I am all wrong It is N to lead|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: my principle against suit part scores where there is unlikely to be anything to spare is to not get busy |pg||
nt|snorris:  this should make|pg||
nt|lestergold: communications between the defnders are fotunately not too ood|pg||
nt|lestergold: good|pg||
nt|cindy:  would have been easy with a @d lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: somewhat odd silence on first round by N, who is usually a forward bidder|pg||
nt|snorris:  yes..a good 4 card suit|pg||
nt|snorris:  in @hs|pg||
nt|lestergold: i overcall a heart on first round in case my partner is on lead and other reasons|pg||
nt|cindy:  now will declarer think its possible for W to have singleton @d ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W bidding would be 100% for me if NV, but vul more questionable. could go for several hundred against nothing even undoubled, and possession of spades may buy you time--less urgent ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: to bid first round|pg||
nt|cindy:  he can always get rid of losing @d later but might not realize there is no hurry|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lestergold: Hi olks sorry late |pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm inconsistent|pg||
nt|lestergold: more reasonable than some weve seen today i agree|pg||
nt|ady: cards lay well   spade finesse on  Q10 hearts doubleton with north   and diamonds 3-3|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|ritong: i will spare you my usual titade about raptor:)|pg||

nt|nielsfoged:  2nd hand t.o. Dbl would require shorter @ss/longer @cs - closer to 1NT i.mo.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mmmakela: even 7 makes this time if u somehow end up there|pg||
nt|lestergold: well here a dull ll tricks will be made |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lestergold: the risks of NOT biodding with north's hand are arguably much greater|pg||
nt|snorris:  very clever..|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ritong: if you want a possible solution to these problems, just google " raptor"|pg||
nt|rnmalik: even 2 @C by P has rebid of 2@D|pg||

nt|thorvald: There is a theme in 4@S x, When leading @CA, you should not cache the K but give pd a ruff, so you still have an entry for the setting trick. But Morten probably expected the @D ...|pg||
nt|thorvald: Ace to be an entry|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|s7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But if @DA is an entry it's not wrong to continue with a *low* club, is it?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: cash @HA before partner revokes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Doesn't a low club cater to all of it?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: low club can't be wrong|pg||
nt|thorvald: It will never be wrong, but one of these errors you "just" make. I remember it from Teams knockuot semifinale many years ago :-)|pg||
nt|thorvald: I was playing with Morten at that time, but it was me that made the error, so he probably have forgotten that :-)|pg||

nt|lestergold: at these colours i do not see e/w risking defending|pg||
nt|roswolf: but bd 1 was flat!!:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 1 was thrown out |pg||
mb|4S|nt|ady: without a heart lead  possible to make 13 tricks with ruffing diamond finesse|pg||
nt|monsted: King of dia whas the best lead - now it is agaion :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|nielsfoged:  Money in the Bank?|pg||

mb|p|mb|d|nt|rnmalik: This board will hurt|pg||
nt|monsted: lol no - looks like 11-13 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: and i dont think any risk whatsoever trying for it|pg||
nt|lestergold: kind of hand west has where he knows that two spades may stand up and his opartner may find his void but cannot be sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: I donmt know what S had for dinner - but it most have bene very special :):)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: got the H shift N wanted|pg||
nt|snorris:  so 4. suit is gf|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  still mayb too long way to 9|pg||
nt|cindy:  lots of combined hcp but not so many tricks|pg||
nt|snorris:  well Boysen has a natural lead..|pg||
nt|lestergold: entry probs are such that declarer unlikely to have the luxury of playing the hearts for 4 tricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why not 3C by S instead of 2N?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: west did well not to havehad a punt now|pg||
nt|cindy:  good question, marshall|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  would have better chances in N|pg||
nt|cindy:  why is that ?  isnt J of @d lead just as scary ?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 6 @C ?|pg||
nt|ady: could make 9 tricks   attack diamonds next   or hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: now only -1|pg||
nt|mmmakela: or 6 @D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: looks better for everyone in the Times if they can report that the result was based on the normal number of boards|pg||
nt|roswolf: west has a deathwish - his bidding is illogical|pg||
pc|cA|nt|marlowepi: better lead small at trick 2|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont blame west has to take insurance|pg||
pc|c3|nt|nielsfoged:  yes, but @d block|pg||
nt|lestergold: but how is declafrer going to come to nine tricks?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sure, it isscary, but as it turns out it cant hurt you|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  not likely|pg||
nt|cindy:  scary for halloween|pg||
nt|marlowepi: "better chances in N" mention better chances to make, not to have a sacre-free ride:)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ritong: not very convincing, though|pg||
nt|roswolf: but east fell into the trap|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  I think most of us would have ended up this way?|pg||
nt|lestergold: hes already lost a spade cant develop hearts without losing 2 hearts and cant develop clubs without similar|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: of course, even then S might find wrong shift, esp if N gives SP for D|pg||

pc|c7|nt|ritong: mm..|pg||
nt|lestergold: even if he double dummies the diamodn and why should he, i cant see 9 tricks|pg||
nt|snorris:  if south goes for @cs now he can win|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a one-eyed jack. film was directed by brando too, only one he ever directed i think|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c8|pg||
pc|c2|nt|monsted: and now 11|pg||
nt|lestergold: and as w e can see 4s may and WILL make now!!|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lestergold: not clear whether the successfrul line for 12 tricks was better odds here|pg||
nt|cindy:  you are having a groundhog moment, marshall|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the point is not about defending in 4S, it is about the way W got there|pg||
pc|s3|nt|pelu: here u see the problem with signals - if u signal distribution East no that there are no @C-ruff in Dummy - if u signal for high cards pd dont kniw the distribution|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|mmmakela: or -2|pg||
nt|roswolf: west may now come up smelling of roses|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ritong: i would offer my @ds, and if opener is not interested, he falls back on 4 NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup dangerous for experienced bidders - novices would have done better on this hand|pg||
nt|mmmakela: think W has a clear @C 2 to play on the lead|pg||

nt|lestergold: Roland loves deals like this|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: frigidon any reasonable line|pg||

pc|c2|nt|ady: n/s can make 2/@H|pg||
pc|c6|nt|christinas: EW struggling to find the best place to play|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @S might have been best |pg||
nt|roswolf: south hoping pard has his bidding - which he does of course|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|nt|ritong: first reason, ofc, is that you can have a @s game or slam, even playing a strong @c system|pg||
nt|roswolf: north to bid again - surely not|pg||
nt|lestergold: anyone tell me free virtual Danish pastry  for first one to tell me|pg||
nt|mmmakela: might not be easy|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ady: 3 level looks 1 too high for both sides|pg||
nt|lestergold: and this is a typical outcome for a roland favourite hand type|pg||
nt|monsted: is nt this a winner|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: no entrants to my comp?|pg||
nt|monsted: 2 loser in hearts 1 in dia and 1 in clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: high card points distributed 20/20|pg||
pc|cT|nt|christinas: this is trickt because of the @s split.|pg||
nt|sybarra: big card is 8 of spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: draw trumps play spade to K and run ten of spades defence gets a spade a club two hearts but NO diamonds|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1C-2D as a good club raise works pretty reasonably, but the flip side of the usual method is to use 1D-3C as an equivalent raise of 1D, and that is problematic due to the space ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: consumed. an interesting compromise is to play that 2D over EITHER minor is that kind of raise, but such an arrangement requires more detailed infrastructure|pg||
pc|h4|nt|christinas: You have to play A and small to the ten to avoid 3 @s losers|pg||
nt|roswolf: incroyable|pg||
nt|ritong: second reason is that you tend to obstruct the bidding when hand belongs to opponents if it does not cost you a penalty too often|pg||
pc|c7|nt|marlowepi: undoubtedly N would have liked to do more, but the cuebid already puts them at 4H so she made the practical underbid|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|ady: can make with A@D right for a spde discard   and clubs 3-3|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rnmalik: Lead favourable|pg||
nt|sybarra: but you will lose 3 @S that way |pg||
nt|sybarra: need ot lead low from dummy I think |pg||
nt|sybarra: then towards the 10 |pg||
nt|christinas: nonsens, S of course always gets 3, sry|pg||
nt|sybarra: so 3 sp and a @H,  = -1 |pg||
nt|ady: alyes sorry  3@H a make|pg||
pc|s3|nt|nielsfoged:  EW must be careful|pg||

nt|lestergold: oh why didnt someone tell me|pg||
nt|pelu: no but 2@c?|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  yes a foreseeable situation after the "expected" 1@s|pg||
nt|mmmakela: bad bidding got what it deserved imo|pg||
nt|pelu: even bigger problem if pd bid 1@H - now I dont like 1NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: well if 2s is defeated he will be vindicated for his conservatism|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sybarra: maybe now |pg||
nt|sybarra: I assume 2 @d was game force |pg||
nt|rnmalik: have 12 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4th suit forcing |pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  how would you bid after 1NT-opening (15-17)?|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|nt|rnmalik: 5@C+5@H+1@S+1@D=12|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe on their way,  but W have to be dragged along,  his spade suit is not "robust" |pg||
nt|jcwla: The double gained 2 IMPs for N/S on 5.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|lestergold: you mean all these Waldks? they are all the one and only same person??|pg||
nt|rnmalik: strange first the 2@S and now 4@S|pg||
nt|mmmakela: guess 3 dias call indicated 5 spades|pg||
nt|sfoxa: that's more intersting contract than 3nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: nope he stayed at home - but 3@C on this hand was sounder than his 3@S call a few hands ago |pg||
nt|lestergold: and actually 2S looks like going one off here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E has good enough defense that it is far from obvious to enter with his hand--with his uglkyu shape he could easily be truning a plus into a minus. in contrasts, it is easy for W ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: to bid over 1N|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|pc|hK|nt|mmmakela: can still make after dias lead;3x hearts|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry about the typing. i need a secretary|pg||

pc|s6|pc|sT|nt|sybarra: maybe west leading not being dragged |pg||
nt|ady: problem i is east can get a club ruff together with 2 trump tricks   and A@D|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 1@D-2@D seems ok to me even with 16 points|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no offers from specs yet:(|pg||
nt|roswolf: unlucky:(|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sybarra: 6 @C not a bad spot |pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  EW gained 5 imps for missing 3NT in  3!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We have results!   http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub6/Turneringer/Resultat633.html   All favourites won big in round 1|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  I think the 15 nice hcps can be used for opening 1@d and rebidding 3@d - but depends one style|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sybarra: I was looking at nt also |pg||
nt|rnmalik: good slam, in duplicate|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk4: Realistically, only four teams can win this year. One-Eyed Jacks and Blakset (both Copenhagen), Århus BK and BK Nord (Aalborg). OEJ are the holders|pg||
nt|ady: e/w did not get beyond 3NT on hand 1  with 6@D a certainty  and 7 actually makes    they only lost 1 imp|pg||
nt|mmmakela: no probs with dias 2-2 and spades optimally|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|mmmakela: if pd passes we can't have a laydown game|pg||

nt|lestergold: cos they are all working for me Marshall|pg||
nt|roswolf: great idea|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c8|nt|Walddk4: Bridgewise, Denmark is divided into 11 districts. The district winners, and an extra team from the district with the holders (Copenhagen), compete for the honours|pg||

pc|s9|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d3|pc|dQ|nt|marlowepi: the one saving grace about 2H is that it increases chances of making a heart trick on defense. but that isnt enough upside to come close to outweighing the downside, IMHBAICO|pg||

nt|lestergold: well altho 4h can bemade N/S i dont expect them, to be in it|pg||
nt|jcwla: The intermediates definitely came into play there.|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  maybe the bid is 1NT 2nd round even if it shows just 12-14?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: why not 2@D?|pg||
nt|sfoxa: but this time - 3nt for sure :-) |pg||

nt|roswolf: another possible fun hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 4@S NS, interesting hand otherwise|pg||
nt|pelu: when u support on a singleton u can also open 1NT on a 6 card minor|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I once commentated in a 8 board match where all 8 deals were played in 3 nt|pg||
nt|ady: likely 3NT n/s|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5C needs accurate bidding tho|pg||
mb|3N|nt|nielsfoged:  sorry!|pg||

nt|nielsfoged:  Easy 3NT NS LOL!|pg||
mb|p|nt|christinas: N didn't bid 1nt - they might not get there now|pg||

nt|sybarra: is 2 @S strong or weak?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or just a good suit?|pg||
nt|monsted: how many clubs from East |pg||
nt|jcwla: Lots of possible contracts here, from 4@SX to a N/S (save?).|pg||
nt|lestergold: like for example n orth opening it?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not necessarily. i have seen people get to 5C in one bid|pg||

nt|lestergold: and 5th best too|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok 3/5|pg||
pc|h5|nt|nielsfoged:  if you open 1d with down to 10 and distribution, these 15 hcps seems to give a too wide interval|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well-reasoned lead|pg||
nt|ady: looks clear for south to bid 3NT|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ady: 4@S  not makable on a club lead and forces|pg||

pc|h3|nt|Walddk2: Nice thinking|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||

nt|sharynr: was it a safety play ? :)|pg||
nt|chick: perhaps S forgot their system and was thinking Stayman?  :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe Hansen should have foreseen that partner might have the 4414 hand and passed 2@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That would be playing safe|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They have been doubled in 1NT 1,819 times in their careers as a pair, so they surely know what escape method they play|pg||

nt|ady: n/s need to stay low with their 24 hcp and heart fit|pg||

nt|marlowepi: sorry, crashed. probably best to play for 22 hearts by ruffing high & leading another high trump, as i think mike was implying|pg||

nt|sybarra: taking advantage of vulnerability here maye to no avail |pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|nt|christinas: no, I think 3@h is too aggressive by W. He has a good hand, but he is vul, so if 2@d shows 5-5 he has already bid his hand once|pg||

pc|s6|pg||
nt|chick: yes, twice if necessary|pg||
nt|pelu: yes spec on a 3-loser hand - no problem with reverse in 2@S|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|hT|pc|c2|pc|d5|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|pc|s7|nt|thorvald: The problem is that the revers implies a stronger hand, but you need to have an agreement about what to do with weaker 5-6 hands|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|chick: IMO any 6-5 with opening count is strong enough to reverse|pg||
mc|10|nt|Walddk2: Thanks all, back soon with Århus vs One-Eyed Jacks. In fact, there is only one one-eyes jack in the pack, the jack of spades|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the problem with opening 1@S and then bididng hearts is that partner will never believe you have 6/5 that way round |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Have a look during the break|pg||
nt|thorvald: And my advice is never to open any hand with a strong 2 with only one ace, but this is close|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bye for now|pg||
nt|chick: agree Mike|pg||
nt|mdgraham: thanks all. |pg||

nt|nielsfoged:  It will be interesting to see the results from all matches of Board  5 - does anyone have the methods to avoid 3 NT and reach 5@d? - Most likely would be the strong 1@c pairs (even better Relay-Precision)|pg||
nt|lestergold: do not understand|pg||
nt|monsted: must be !! ??|pg||
nt|lestergold: two asafe ways to rry for an overtrick and instead tries for one offski and succeeds|pg||
nt|jcwla: W happy to defend 1NT and even happier to defend 3NT if it comes to that.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: the bidding ask for @S-lead, so N only lead @C if he has a good @C-lead|pg||
nt|mmmakela: but would he lead one from dbltn looking at S's hand|pg||
nt|murat: baþlýyo|pg||
nt|marlowepi: strange play and defense on Bioard 1 in other room. maybe that is why it will count--some sadist wants the details published:)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lestergold: did this really take place?|pg||
nt|monsted: looks like a big wictory for BK Nord|pg||
nt|vugraphzyy: he was playing 3 H !!|pg||
nt|sybarra: reminding you that bd 1 is thrown out |pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|ritong: well we did suggest a possibility|pg||
nt|ritong: first, you give up on puppet stayman|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: VG operator said no|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ritong: second, you bid your suits|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  yes but none of the players heard that|pg||
nt|mmmakela: YES peter|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have 25 hcp  and east a good 6 card heart suit   but again likely to go down in game|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: simple bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: ah hah that explainis it oyall|pg||
nt|vugraphzyy: he thourght|pg||
nt|monsted: WAS plaing or ? |pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  2@h is probably showing @s|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lestergold: yeh sure we can se that|pg||
mb|p!|mb|4H|nt|ritong: and third, if opener is not interested, he comes back to NT at the 4 level|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: weve all done it|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  may end in 4@H   which could be difficult     3NT  looks more likely to make|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Next match in 30 minutes: Blakset vs Århus BK|pg||
nt|ady: clb lead    cuts of trick supply|pg||
nt|marlowepi: probably showing a sounder raise to 2S than a dirct 2S|pg||
nt|lestergold: a very poor game|pg||
nt|lestergold: I thnk West may have downgraded his Qx of hearts on the aucion|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at these colors i would judge the E hand to be very marginal for that action in a 2-way structure, and W also has some soft bits|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  but neither action is a distortion|pg||
nt|marlowepi: where i come from that is a 1H opener. are NS using canape?|pg||
nt|lestergold: i do not follow the logic here why open the shorter suit when you can show the actual distribuition by reversing ith this strength|pg||
mb|4S|nt|christinas: It works fine in this case, but I would be worried about the 2 little clubs - if I had the same hand with 4333 it is another story|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Pure HCP points 15-17 + 10 and 2 Ts|pg||
nt|ritong: here, opener gladly accepts ( via 4@s) and 5@d is the final contract|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  problem is that most of us do not have a natural @d-bid after 2NT- or 2@c-openings|pg||
nt|rnmalik: so may finesses and 6 makes|pg||
nt|lestergold: but the lead couldnt be more helpful|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  No I just try to find explanation of why he didn't choose the (almost) obvious @c return|pg||
nt|pelu: keep looking :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: can they stay low here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: still may have difficult making|pg||
nt|sfoxa: looks like first imps for OEJ|pg||
nt|mmmakela: finally 2 imps to OEJ|pg||
nt|sfoxa: and what will N lead?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: i must admit wild horses would nt have ;produced this lead from me|pg||
mb|p|nt|monsted: another 12 imps to BK Nord in board 8 ! - 6 spades bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm didnt seem to work|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sfoxa: little bit of help comes|pg||
nt|ady: lead ok for declarer|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now might make|pg||
nt|lestergold: i mean strong enough for a jump shift on second round then strong enuf for a reverse|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe S would need a 2-loser hand instead of 3-loser to do that|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|nt|ritong: mind you, your question was " does anyone have methods..."|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am not sure about this line. if W feels like assuming from the lead that N does not have both top hearts (very reasonable but not guaranteed), then he will have all the rest of ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the artillery. and this lead is surely a singleton. so it seems right toi me to win the ace in dummy and lead a heart to the card of your choice. you cant ruff with spade ace and ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: also use it to draw a trump|pg||
nt|pelu: @cK in trick 2 work better|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|lestergold: a club return might have been stronger but the clubs can still be cut off|pg||
nt|ady: west must remove club when in with A@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: west cannot be bl;amed for playing pard for a stifff space|pg||
nt|lestergold: i mjean why on earth would he expect his pard to resolve a qx position against an opp'sbid suit|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  S in open room may not have agreed fully with his partners lead and continuation against 2@s (@cA and @h5 to @hT and @hQ)!|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mmmakela: good lead although not my choise|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|s6|pg||
nt|ritong: i do, and i am not alone|pg||
nt|lestergold: here comes the club?|pg||
nt|roswolf: south needs to take care here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe S wanted to attract a spade lead in case the opps bought it for 3C or something|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: heart switch best|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s7|nt|lestergold: i think holding strong hand with two boss suirts more important to bid accurately|pg||
nt|lestergold: now declarer is going to get tapped|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|lestergold: i mean he better not have any fantasies about promoting trump by playing a spade|pg||
pc|c3|nt|roswolf: sometimes i do too|pg||
nt|ady: still now a club after A@D ok|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh derar|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c4|nt|nielsfoged:  yes an my bet is that at most 1-2 of the 12 pairs bidding  5 will have that capacity (I actrually expect 12/12 3NT-1)|pg||
nt|ady: squeeze on declarer|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jcwla: 9 a push at 2NT-2.|pg||
nt|mmmakela: how to get the 8th|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|mmmakela: still needs to guess clubs I suppose|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|cT|nt|rnmalik: +1|pg||
nt|sfoxa: now N has to give @h trick - other play is more costly|pg||
nt|mmmakela: surely H 10 now|pg||
nt|ady: might play club|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lestergold: i can understand hiom not expecting partner to hopld six clubs which he might have led from in preference to Qx of spades|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  a 25 imp swing when not returning @c - the other table stayed in 4@s (13 tricks - @d duck to singleton K)|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c5|pg||
nt|ritong: admittedly, on bd 5 west has a decision to make on 3 NT|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|roswolf: you might well be right|pg||
pc|d2|pc|c8|pc|s4|pg||
nt|jcwla: OR is finished.  Welcome to all who have joined us from in there.|pg||

nt|roswolf: hmm the 4-4 heart fit not mentioned in the other room|pg||
nt|lestergold: probably a premature attempt to cash clubs for some strange reason|pg||
nt|monsted: last chance for Blakset to get imps|pg||
nt|jcwla: The last two were @S partials in the OR, we'll see what unfolds here.|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  Good result for OEJ in Open|pg||
nt|mmmakela: and some more here?|pg||
nt|lestergold: lucky to get away with it on this particular hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: the ace of clubs in N (stopping clubs once) saved declarer |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: what a misfit here|pg||
nt|mmmakela: actually any card was fine|pg||
nt|pelu: so the champs only down 7 after a gift of 25 IMP :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not a big deal, N-S can make 4@C|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 35 to 2 in 10 boards, are outplayed|pg||
nt|mmmakela: meaning after the C K play|pg||
nt|ady: likely to reach 4@S as in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|nielsfoged:  4@h seems ok|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT or 4@H  both making games for n/s     west may get into some trouble in spades if bidding high|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  5@c|pg||
nt|sfoxa: uh-hu, i wonder, if 6@d bid as attack or defence?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: close to a flat board 100 or 130|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You sure?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: north wondering which major S holds|pg||
nt|roswolf: interesting result from the other rooom but no double no trouble|pg||
mb|1N|nt|monsted: af in OR|pg||
nt|lestergold: well west has stuck neck out a little more conservatively here than in the open room|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I don't think you can make 5|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: at least north didnt open here|pg||
mb|p|nt|nielsfoged:  no you are right|pg||
nt|lestergold: dont think you can get rid of two spades in south's hand|pg||
nt|pelu: tell us how u make 11 tricks, Niels?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: looks like 3 losers to me|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  sorry|pg||
nt|mmmakela: has pretty good support for both|pg||
nt|mmmakela: needs H lead to beat|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That is the easy part when partner has 5+ spades|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But he may fancy 5@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 4333 8 count,  sort of funny |pg||
pc|s5|nt|rnmalik: NT opening with stiff @SK was the reason in the OR|pg||
nt|roswolf: the offcentre 1nt in the other room didnt work too well|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 43o or so will give 9 imps to Blakset|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Which major to lead against 3NT is the question|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  I will absolutely NOT :)|pg||
nt|pelu: no Niels - u are welcome - now we are the clever ones :):)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ritong: i guess bidding went 1 NT 3NT or something like that|pg||
nt|ady: unusual opening  West|pg||
pc|sK|nt|marlowepi: 3N needs spade lead, good chances|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|dK|nt|cindy:  what was opening 2@c on 8    the hand was pretty similiar to this one|pg||
pc|d6|nt|roswolf: simple auction here|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dA|pg||

pc|s2|nt|rnmalik: marked difference in bidding as compared with OR|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 3 nt better than 4 S|pg||

nt|nielsfoged:  not so easy to get the tempo, maybe would have been best chance to let the @c go?|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  (looks easy from here|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ady: Jepson did not ruff 3rd spade high enough on hand 10    got overruffed and East played a club   hence the result of 2 down|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mmmakela: this has straight 4 losers|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|sfoxa: but anyway - 4 imps for OEJ|pg||

nt|ady: North will cash the 2 aces|pg||
pc|s7|pc|d5|nt|nielsfoged:  back in tempo now?|pg||
nt|ritong: but if @d AK are not with @c Q, defense can certainly establish a @c, so your option looks better|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 6 IMPs I think|pg||
nt|ady: sit back and wait for 2 trump tricks|pg||

nt|Walddk2: One-Eyed Jacks are the holders|pg||

pc|h7|nt|christinas: the missed slam and game made the big difference|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks also to my co commentator Rashed and Christiana. We appreciate your time, your insights |pg||
nt|rnmalik: Board 7 and 8 damaging for NS|pg||

nt|sybarra: Thanks also to our specs who give us helpful comments and some humor!|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but maybe they can manage it|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  minors are too awful|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  ...for 4@s|pg||
nt|ritong: talking about that, the problem arises when opàener has a big hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think there is a case for passing here|pg||
nt|ritong: and can t raise @ss too high|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  that would be a well-deserved 13 imps|pg||
nt|ritong: because it is 4th suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: may try 2nt|pg||
nt|ritong: a possibility is he uses an " impossible" 3@h bid|pg||
nt|ritong: to show 4@s and strong|pg||
nt|cindy:  i guess there is 1 card diff|pg||
nt|mmmakela: bye all see ya in 20 mins|pg||
nt|mmmakela: btw Storeslemmen=grand slam in danish|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|sybarra: PS   Special thanks to Roland for his tireless efforts organizing the vugraph!|pg||
nt|lestergold: the interesting point here is the issue of overtricks|pg||
nt|cindy:  you dont like my boring questions ?   :)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|roswolf: intersesting henri|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  a little easier to pass when non-vuln|pg||
nt|mmmakela: The play will resume 9.30 Danish time tomorrow(remember to adjust your clocks for winter time!)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, but we have one more match today, Markku|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In 20 minutes|pg||
nt|ady: north must have presumed 4 carfds in clubs for the 1NT response|pg||
pc|s2|nt|nielsfoged:  wd EW|pg||
nt|roswolf: but a good stop|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good a misfit and well assessed|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  good lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|nielsfoged:  could he be 1 down?|pg||
nt|monsted: 4 spades looks like a winner|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|sfoxa: and why not 5 in diamonds? with 5332 split? |pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|jcwla: Well, as we approach the end of this segment, a big thank you to Roland Wald, to our excellent operator Tom, to Mike, Nils and all specs.  I'll be back with you in 22-1/2 hours for ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: the 11th RR segment.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: can west develop an overtrick in clubs safely?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: seems better to play queen and lead a club if it holds|pg||
nt|lestergold: double dummy eay|pg||
nt|lestergold: easy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No, he doesn't have the entries|pg||
nt|pelu: he can try - but after @Dagain - no chance|pg||
nt|ady: this might be a swing for east west|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Rødovre vs One-Eyed Jacks|pg||
nt|mmmakela: oops some excitement after all|pg||
nt|sfoxa: no more - with this lead|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mmmakela: ok sry was concerned ab time change|pg||
pc|s3|nt|nielsfoged:  defense: like brothers in arms |pg||
nt|roswolf: i think an overtrick is more likely|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  at least 7 tricks, but...|pg||
nt|po-s: west might continue with diamonds|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk4: He can advance @C9 now, but then he can't play on clubs any more|pg||
nt|pelu: but DD he can|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Anything is possible with all cards in view|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Dorthe was always going to make 5|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Don't worry, you can sleep one hour more :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|nielsfoged:  but OK those @c's are prettyu high|pg||
nt|ady: general opinion 3@H should go down    not an easy contract    but I think it is makable if going up with K@C first round|pg||
pc|s4|nt|po-s: too late|pg||
nt|sfoxa: let's imagine, S doesn't play @c ace in the first round of suit|pg||
nt|sfoxa: yes,  they can get 2 ruffs now  |pg||
pc|c6|nt|lestergold: looks likerun for home|pg||
nt|pelu: homerun or run for home :)|pg||

nt|roswolf: why not overuff|pg||
nt|ritong: operator s miss, clearly  lets wait for the claim|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks to Tom, Peter and Markku|pg||

nt|ritong: or not:)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|christinas: Good save here. that will add to Århus victory, but at least Storeslemmen avioded getting a blitz by making 2 imps on board 10|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He did|pg||
