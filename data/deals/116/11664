nt|monsted: this is 4 spades - but with this weak opening they will go too high I think|pg||
nt|jcwla: A Rule of 20 opener here and this seems to be the rare right time for a trump lead.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Singleton trump lead that is.|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: 5 spades 2 dims a heart and two club ruffs is ten tricks what if south ducks a diamond lead towards dummy?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Wow.|pg||
nt|lestergold: At unfavourable vulnerability??|pg||
nt|lestergold: is south colour blind?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the Schaltz team name is also the title of an outstanding Western from late 50s or early 60s starring Marlon Brando and Karl Malden|pg||
nt|lestergold: E/W playing a weak no trump?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: no transfer, interesting  |pg||

pc|cK|nt|christinas: unpleasant to balance for NS, but they can make 3@c|pg||

nt|lestergold: so far that is|pg||
nt|vugraphzyy: 4 cl = void|pg||
pc|d8|nt|rnmalik: Weak NT has its advantages aswell|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@H = 4. suit - tto strong for direct 4@S - but 3@S is in my book and overbid - 4.suit + 4@S is the hand!|pg||
pc|h9|nt|roswolf: well with a bit of luck on their side they are formidable|pg||
pc|h5|nt|marlowepi: given that you dont really want S on lead, i predict 4 club tricks|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jcwla: If West's splinter showed the void -- then it's incomprehensible.  If not, then the Rule of 20 opener combined with W's feeling of still having hidden extra values and a possible ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: slam at least makes it comprehensible, though still not my choice...|pg||
pc|h7|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: what on earth is east up to why is he slamming with 1 flattish points hios pard has not promised extras|pg||

nt|mmmakela: if W promises his cards|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 1820|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Board is cancelled. One player, accidentally, saw a card belong to N and one belonging to E|pg||
nt|mmmakela: could even call it foolish|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Board 1 that is|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well sanity has crept back in here|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, E does have some extras, but predictably W's reasonable 4@D was based partially on distribution.  At some point they recognized this.|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes butnoslam going extras|pg||
nt|lestergold: enough to make 11 tricks a proposition|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1NT +2 in this room|pg||
nt|pelu: I agre Markku - I also hate specs with "no name"|pg||
nt|mmmakela: dias lead now?|pg||
nt|sfoxa: E would mind|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I might lead the J@C|pg||
nt|sfoxa: very tiny game, but possible with unaccurate defence|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jcwla: Well, I think E's sequence was reasonable, show some extras (slam is possible opp some 4@D hands there), then pull back.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I am all wrong It is N to lead|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lestergold: my principle against suit part scores where there is unlikely to be anything to spare is to not get busy |pg||

nt|lestergold: communications between the defnders are fotunately not too ood|pg||
nt|lestergold: good|pg||
nt|cindy:  would have been easy with a @d lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: somewhat odd silence on first round by N, who is usually a forward bidder|pg||
nt|snorris:  yes..a good 4 card suit|pg||
nt|snorris:  in @hs|pg||
nt|lestergold: i overcall a heart on first round in case my partner is on lead and other reasons|pg||
nt|cindy:  now will declarer think its possible for W to have singleton @d ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W bidding would be 100% for me if NV, but vul more questionable. could go for several hundred against nothing even undoubled, and possession of spades may buy you time--less urgent ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: to bid first round|pg||

pc|hK|nt|ritong: i will spare you my usual titade about raptor:)|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h4|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|lestergold: the risks of NOT biodding with north's hand are arguably much greater|pg||

pc|d7|nt|pelu: some spects tell me: tto kind with peter Schaltz - the X is not only aggressiv - but bad bridge! OK:)|pg||

pc|c5|nt|lestergold: no entrants to my comp?|pg||
nt|monsted: 2 loser in hearts 1 in dia and 1 in clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: high card points distributed 20/20|pg||
pc|c2|nt|christinas: this is trickt because of the @s split.|pg||
nt|sybarra: big card is 8 of spades|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|christinas: You have to play A and small to the ten to avoid 3 @s losers|pg||
nt|roswolf: incroyable|pg||
nt|ritong: second reason is that you tend to obstruct the bidding when hand belongs to opponents if it does not cost you a penalty too often|pg||
pc|c4|nt|marlowepi: undoubtedly N would have liked to do more, but the cuebid already puts them at 4H so she made the practical underbid|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|nt|rnmalik: Lead favourable|pg||
nt|sybarra: but you will lose 3 @S that way |pg||

mb|p|nt|christinas: On the 6@s hand Århus got 3 imps - the contract was 5@sXX in the open room...|pg||

mb|d|nt|ady: small slam on club position      cant go wrong with  QX onside|pg||

nt|monsted: I dont understand Frederik - when 4 clubs he must follow with 4 NT - only when 3 clubs whitout the Q it is bad|pg||
nt|pelu: what is going on in S? - He could open 1Nt or bid 1NT in sekund round - but 2@C????|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i prefer double--or possibly1S==with W hand also, but maybe EW dont play equal level conversion|pg||
nt|rnmalik: another 3NT|pg||

nt|lestergold: oh why didnt someone tell me|pg||
nt|pelu: no but 2@c?|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  yes a foreseeable situation after the "expected" 1@s|pg||
nt|mmmakela: bad bidding got what it deserved imo|pg||
nt|pelu: even bigger problem if pd bid 1@H - now I dont like 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: maybe now |pg||
nt|sybarra: I assume 2 @d was game force |pg||
nt|rnmalik: have 12 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4th suit forcing |pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  how would you bid after 1NT-opening (15-17)?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 5@C+5@H+1@S+1@D=12|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe on their way,  but W have to be dragged along,  his spade suit is not "robust" |pg||
nt|jcwla: The double gained 2 IMPs for N/S on 5.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: you mean all these Waldks? they are all the one and only same person??|pg||
nt|rnmalik: strange first the 2@S and now 4@S|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|d9|pg||

pc|s2|nt|sybarra: 6 @C not a bad spot |pg||

nt|Walddk4: We have results!   http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub6/Turneringer/Resultat633.html   All favourites won big in round 1|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  I think the 15 nice hcps can be used for opening 1@d and rebidding 3@d - but depends one style|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sybarra: I was looking at nt also |pg||
nt|rnmalik: good slam, in duplicate|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Realistically, only four teams can win this year. One-Eyed Jacks and Blakset (both Copenhagen), Århus BK and BK Nord (Aalborg). OEJ are the holders|pg||
nt|ady: e/w did not get beyond 3NT on hand 1  with 6@D a certainty  and 7 actually makes    they only lost 1 imp|pg||

pc|s6|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|s7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the one saving grace about 2H is that it increases chances of making a heart trick on defense. but that isnt enough upside to come close to outweighing the downside, IMHBAICO|pg||

nt|marlowepi: well-reasoned lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4@S  not makable on a club lead and forces|pg||

mb|3N|nt|jcwla: @D shift here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|christinas: this is in my opinion an example of why if ofgten doesn't pay not to bid in bridge. I had bid on both the N and S hand. None of them did, and now they missed not only a partscore, ...|pg||

nt|mmmakela: can they avoid 4 H here|pg||
nt|lestergold: cards are spitting here against E/W could get overboard|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry, crashed. probably best to play for 22 hearts by ruffing high & leading another high trump, as i think mike was implying|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d7|pg||
nt|mmmakela: wd|pg||
nt|ady: well stopped    |pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: well 9 card fit combined 24 hcp and they have chosen a good moment  to vote conservative|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|nt|rnmalik: a misfit, W could pass 2@H|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  That could be a championships match - both sides combines bold attitudes with high skills|pg||
nt|lestergold: i was Marshall of course|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|mmmakela: many would invite w W hand|pg||
nt|pelu: 6@S down on a @C-lead|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  and also on a trump lead|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@H = 4. suit, 3@S = slaminvit|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|nt|christinas: no, I think 3@h is too aggressive by W. He has a good hand, but he is vul, so if 2@d shows 5-5 he has already bid his hand once|pg||
nt|lestergold: well two 3 card qs to the umph needs circumspection/ devaluation milton opvervlaues these things|pg||
nt|pelu: West has some very good cards|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry East|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  but may win on a red lead even if trump shift when in on @dA|pg||

nt|nielsfoged:  one @h ruff and 1@h+1@c discard on @dQJ|pg||

pc|hK|nt|mmmakela: if not VERY surprised|pg||

nt|nielsfoged:  It will be interesting to see the results from all matches of Board  5 - does anyone have the methods to avoid 3 NT and reach 5@d? - Most likely would be the strong 1@c pairs (even better Relay-Precision)|pg||
nt|lestergold: do not understand|pg||
nt|monsted: must be !! ??|pg||
nt|lestergold: two asafe ways to rry for an overtrick and instead tries for one offski and succeeds|pg||
nt|jcwla: W happy to defend 1NT and even happier to defend 3NT if it comes to that.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|pelu: the bidding ask for @S-lead, so N only lead @C if he has a good @C-lead|pg||
nt|mmmakela: but would he lead one from dbltn looking at S's hand|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lestergold: did this really take place?|pg||
nt|monsted: looks like a big wictory for BK Nord|pg||
nt|vugraphzyy: he was playing 3 H !!|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2N|an|4+ s|nt|ritong: well we did suggest a possibility|pg||
nt|ritong: first, you give up on puppet stayman|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|ritong: second, you bid your suits|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  yes but none of the players heard that|pg||
nt|mmmakela: YES peter|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: simple bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: ah hah that explainis it oyall|pg||
nt|vugraphzyy: he thourght|pg||
nt|monsted: WAS plaing or ? |pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  2@h is probably showing @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: yeh sure we can se that|pg||
mb|p|pc|d7|nt|ritong: and third, if opener is not interested, he comes back to NT at the 4 level|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: weve all done it|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  may end in 4@H   which could be difficult     3NT  looks more likely to make|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Next match in 30 minutes: Blakset vs Århus BK|pg||
nt|ady: clb lead    cuts of trick supply|pg||
nt|marlowepi: probably showing a sounder raise to 2S than a dirct 2S|pg||
nt|lestergold: a very poor game|pg||
nt|lestergold: I thnk West may have downgraded his Qx of hearts on the aucion|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at these colors i would judge the E hand to be very marginal for that action in a 2-way structure, and W also has some soft bits|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  but neither action is a distortion|pg||
pc|d2|nt|christinas: It works fine in this case, but I would be worried about the 2 little clubs - if I had the same hand with 4333 it is another story|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Pure HCP points 15-17 + 10 and 2 Ts|pg||
nt|ritong: here, opener gladly accepts ( via 4@s) and 5@d is the final contract|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  problem is that most of us do not have a natural @d-bid after 2NT- or 2@c-openings|pg||
nt|rnmalik: so may finesses and 6 makes|pg||
nt|lestergold: but the lead couldnt be more helpful|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  No I just try to find explanation of why he didn't choose the (almost) obvious @c return|pg||
nt|pelu: keep looking :)|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ady: still may have difficult making|pg||
nt|sfoxa: looks like first imps for OEJ|pg||

nt|lestergold: probably a premature attempt to cash clubs for some strange reason|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Not a big deal, N-S can make 4@C|pg||

mb|3D|nt|nielsfoged:  4@h seems ok|pg||

mb|4D|nt|pelu: close to a flat board 100 or 130|pg||

nt|Walddk4: But he may fancy 5@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rnmalik: NT opening with stiff @SK was the reason in the OR|pg||
nt|roswolf: the offcentre 1nt in the other room didnt work too well|pg||
