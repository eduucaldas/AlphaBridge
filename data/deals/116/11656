pc|h8|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome|pg||
nt|jcwla: E would probably double at matchpoints, but at IMPS penalty doubles into game should be made only if confident of setting the contract (some say by 2 tricks).|pg||

nt|monsted: this is 4 spades - but with this weak opening they will go too high I think|pg||
nt|jcwla: A Rule of 20 opener here and this seems to be the rare right time for a trump lead.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Singleton trump lead that is.|pg||
nt|lestergold: work to deo to get at ten tricks but opps even with trump lead cannot get enough trump plays in|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 20 pts eac h this time|pg||
mb|1D|nt|rnmalik: will NS find it|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Yep|pg||
mb|p|nt|christinas: EW play weak NT|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lestergold: 5 spades 2 dims a heart and two club ruffs is ten tricks what if south ducks a diamond lead towards dummy?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Wow.|pg||
nt|lestergold: At unfavourable vulnerability??|pg||
nt|lestergold: is south colour blind?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: no transfer, interesting  |pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  Youth displays courage|pg||
mb|2H|nt|roswolf: 4@S IS AN INSPIRED CHOICE|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  ...and will become older|pg||
nt|lestergold: its youth|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: Japenese?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|rnmalik: true|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: not much chance of this making  |pg||
nt|lestergold: kamikaze trained|pg||
nt|mmmakela: for englishorientated audience EW team name is quite exotic|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ady: club values bad for declarer|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  ...and richer|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh my west has let vul opps off hook|pg||
nt|monsted: Dennis is normaly very solid - despice of Junior|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: first board was a clue about north s style|pg||
nt|lestergold: and 11 tricks i think is a distance too far|pg||
nt|jcwla: This sure looks like the time for a double by W.  E appears to have wasted @C values and W has the reds locked up, no comprendo.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|christinas: unpleasant to balance for NS, but they can make 3@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: brutal.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
nt|ady: likely 2 down|pg||
nt|lestergold: look at the mountain that south had offered|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: the children would have to be sent to bed early|pg||
nt|lestergold: and south was warned by the splinter that clubs were NOT breaking|pg||
nt|lestergold: well nmot the sharpestr defence ive ever seen |pg||
nt|lestergold: so far that is|pg||
nt|vugraphzyy: 4 cl = void|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Weak NT has its advantages aswell|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 2@H = 4. suit - tto strong for direct 4@S - but 3@S is in my book and overbid - 4.suit + 4@S is the hand!|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|roswolf: well with a bit of luck on their side they are formidable|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h6|nt|jcwla: If West's splinter showed the void -- then it's incomprehensible.  If not, then the Rule of 20 opener combined with W's feeling of still having hidden extra values and a possible ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: slam at least makes it comprehensible, though still not my choice...|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|pelu: 4.suit + 4@s = mild slaminvit , 4.suit + 3@S = strong slam invit|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ady: +200 should be a useful score for e/w on a non event hand|pg||

nt|lestergold: how many tricks has south given away to declarer?|pg||
nt|jcwla: 6 to Blakset on 1, while their N/S failed by 2 in 3@C here, their E/W failed by 3 in 3NT in the OR.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|h3|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|jcwla: Enough that this is now coming home.|pg||
nt|lestergold: in spite of south';s best efforts to give his oppos an early xmas one way or the other, declarer shgould still be left with an inescapable club loser|pg||

nt|thorvald: NS will not like this result. Against the weaker teams there is normally not place for double patials, when they cant win anything|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And they are playing against naturalists. Most doubles are for penalty, unlike the rest of the world|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Åkirkeby from the island of Bornholm, located closer to Sweden than Denmark|pg||

nt|christinas: a little info about the tournament: All the contesting teams are regional champions, besides the copenhagen region who are represented by two teams because they are reigning ...|pg||
nt|christinas: champions|pg||
nt|roswolf: easy game|pg||
nt|roswolf: a hand of promise now|pg||
nt|ady: e/w may end in 4@s  going down|pg||
nt|jcwla: In the OR, E passed, S opened 1@D, and the contract is a quiet 4@S.|pg||
nt|pelu: No Martin is not - the team is from the Copenhagen Club One-Eyed Jacks - a club with 16 teams - only playing teams (and a few IMP-pair)|pg||
mb|p|nt|monsted: yes this could give som action|pg||
nt|lestergold: and sharp defence could threaten 4S|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|nielsfoged:  6@c is ok|pg||
mb|3C|nt|roswolf: 3@S?|pg||
mb|4D|nt|rnmalik: 3NT by EW on a @S lead, |pg||
nt|monsted: 3 clubs non vul is not much here|pg||
nt|ady: this will not be a success|pg||
nt|lestergold: 9 top tricks 3n|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  but somewhat Roland style|pg||
nt|jcwla: An overtrick IMP on 2 as 4@S made on the dot.|pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: but with such a thin spade guard may be difficult to bid now|pg||
nt|mmmakela: w might bid 3 nt now|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: not any more lol|pg||
mb|5C|nt|ritong: east took a risk doubling 1@s|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @S lead by N|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: he wanted to show his @h xxxx, we guess$|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: i might have called again as east|pg||
nt|monsted: pass in North ?? - should have bid 4 spades I think|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: looks down 4   -400|pg||
nt|mmmakela: u like Dorthe's bids Peter?|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|nt|ritong: but the scenario was relatively predictable with his @s single|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  but in 6@c do not play on double finesse - which would be rather natural after the 2@s bid|pg||
nt|jcwla: I would also open 1@C with West but a minority of players might choose something else.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 4s lucky to go obly three off reverse the heart honours and its 4 off|pg||
nt|lestergold: I dont think in an imps game its good business to o for such a potentially expensive save- especially when the game doesnt always make|pg||
nt|lestergold: it does here and it would profit but nothing to write home about|pg||
nt|monsted: not a safe - but to make it difficult for EW to make the rigth decision|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|sybarra: and overboard they went |pg||
pc|d7|nt|ritong: so, if the system allows it, i think that bidding @ds immediately is more sound|pg||
nt|ritong: and, if pard has @hs, it will be good for @d trump as well|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Thought so, Shirley:) 2@H and 3@C discouraging bids but even then|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|pc|h7|nt|monsted: no 4 down - I would have bid 4 spades om E - strange not to|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lestergold: there is some equity in it but north apart form spade support has a working yarboroug in tnhe side suits|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c2|pc|s4|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|nt|rnmalik: absolutely correct Henri bidding 2 @D would not hurt|pg||

pc|cK|pg||
nt|christinas: not very scientifically bid. NS are not in a regular partnership|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mmmakela: well 3nt could be based on 1suiter|pg||
nt|pelu: what could she do - 3@C is fair, and over 4@DX ir is hard to pass|pg||
mc|9|nt|monsted: Anyway East hand is no use - and 1 suiter somes not often in this auction|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: what on earth is east up to why is he slamming with 1 flattish points hios pard has not promised extras|pg||

nt|mmmakela: 1820|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Board is cancelled. One player, accidentally, saw a card belong to N and one belonging to E|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Board 1 that is|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: well sanity has crept back in here|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, E does have some extras, but predictably W's reasonable 4@D was based partially on distribution.  At some point they recognized this.|pg||

nt|lestergold: enough to make 11 tricks a proposition|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1NT +2 in this room|pg||
nt|pelu: I agre Markku - I also hate specs with "no name"|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jcwla: Well, I think E's sequence was reasonable, show some extras (slam is possible opp some 4@D hands there), then pull back.|pg||

nt|roswolf: south hoping pard has his bidding - which he does of course|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|pc|cA|pg||

pc|h7|nt|christinas: this is trickt because of the @s split.|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
nt|christinas: You have to play A and small to the ten to avoid 3 @s losers|pg||
nt|roswolf: incroyable|pg||
nt|ritong: second reason is that you tend to obstruct the bidding when hand belongs to opponents if it does not cost you a penalty too often|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|hQ|nt|rnmalik: Lead favourable|pg||

nt|nielsfoged:  It will be interesting to see the results from all matches of Board  5 - does anyone have the methods to avoid 3 NT and reach 5@d? - Most likely would be the strong 1@c pairs (even better Relay-Precision)|pg||
nt|lestergold: do not understand|pg||
nt|monsted: must be !! ??|pg||
nt|lestergold: two asafe ways to rry for an overtrick and instead tries for one offski and succeeds|pg||
nt|jcwla: W happy to defend 1NT and even happier to defend 3NT if it comes to that.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: the bidding ask for @S-lead, so N only lead @C if he has a good @C-lead|pg||
nt|mmmakela: but would he lead one from dbltn looking at S's hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: did this really take place?|pg||
nt|monsted: looks like a big wictory for BK Nord|pg||
nt|vugraphzyy: he was playing 3 H !!|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|ritong: well we did suggest a possibility|pg||
nt|ritong: first, you give up on puppet stayman|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ritong: second, you bid your suits|pg||

mb|2C|nt|rnmalik: simple bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: ah hah that explainis it oyall|pg||
nt|vugraphzyy: he thourght|pg||
nt|monsted: WAS plaing or ? |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: yeh sure we can se that|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|ritong: and third, if opener is not interested, he comes back to NT at the 4 level|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: weve all done it|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  may end in 4@H   which could be difficult     3NT  looks more likely to make|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Next match in 30 minutes: Blakset vs Århus BK|pg||
nt|ady: clb lead    cuts of trick supply|pg||
mb|p|nt|christinas: It works fine in this case, but I would be worried about the 2 little clubs - if I had the same hand with 4333 it is another story|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Pure HCP points 15-17 + 10 and 2 Ts|pg||
nt|ritong: here, opener gladly accepts ( via 4@s) and 5@d is the final contract|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  problem is that most of us do not have a natural @d-bid after 2NT- or 2@c-openings|pg||
nt|rnmalik: so may finesses and 6 makes|pg||
nt|lestergold: but the lead couldnt be more helpful|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  No I just try to find explanation of why he didn't choose the (almost) obvious @c return|pg||
nt|pelu: keep looking :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ady: still may have difficult making|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lestergold: i must admit wild horses would nt have ;produced this lead from me|pg||

pc|s5|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|nt|ritong: mind you, your question was " does anyone have methods..."|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lestergold: a club return might have been stronger but the clubs can still be cut off|pg||
nt|ady: west must remove club when in with A@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: west cannot be bl;amed for playing pard for a stifff space|pg||

nt|lestergold: oh derar|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d9|nt|nielsfoged:  yes an my bet is that at most 1-2 of the 12 pairs bidding  5 will have that capacity (I actrually expect 12/12 3NT-1)|pg||

nt|nielsfoged:  a 25 imp swing when not returning @c - the other table stayed in 4@s (13 tricks - @d duck to singleton K)|pg||

nt|ritong: talking about that, the problem arises when opàener has a big hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think there is a case for passing here|pg||
nt|ritong: and can t raise @ss too high|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  that would be a well-deserved 13 imps|pg||
nt|ritong: because it is 4th suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: may try 2nt|pg||
nt|ritong: a possibility is he uses an " impossible" 3@h bid|pg||
nt|ritong: to show 4@s and strong|pg||
