nt|athene: they are both right on the borderline of being able to act over 3@D|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: that's always the way - if one partner is a little weaker and his partner is stronger, the stronger hand can bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: And they will likely make 4@H if they get there|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 4@D could have been right; Eber can't know that West is unable to act if he passes|pg||
nt|athene: right; south couldn't believe that 3@D was going to buy it|pg||

nt|ralfwil: 4@c from S showed in my opinion that opener had at least a 4-card @d so N could perhaps see a @d slam - or?|pg||
nt|robinswr: without the double of 4clubs there is only one bid between 4clubs and 4hearts. therefore 4diamonds should show extra values but not enough to bid above game|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Participating teams are Gauteng, Northern Gauteng, Western Province, Eastern Cape, Southern Cape, and KwaZulu Natal|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|robinswr: with the double there are now two bids Pass and 4diamonds|pg||

mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|athene: it's awkward when 4th suit forcing comes at the 3-level|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: I prefer 2nt from E instead of 3@c|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@H is perhaps the lesser of evils. Some would prefer 3@S|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: 2NT may not be forcing for them|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 2nt was certainly possible over 2@D, even if non-forcing|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|robinswr: if opener passes 2nt there probably isn't a game|pg||
nt|athene: usually you prefer to overbid a bit if it helps you explore the best strain more effectively, but here, the slight underbid might have actually done that better|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||
