nt|benjent: Nice play from 10863|pg||
nt|athene: yes, obligatory falsecard|pg||
nt|lestergold: it would also be a great false card to play if north held A T 8 x of spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: It is the sort of thing which occurs to oone but he will not get i right in practice|pg||
nt|athene: south should perhaps have ducked that trick? he can win the third spade and force with another club?|pg||
nt|athene: and if they don't play trumps he gets a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|benjent: Robinson hating all of his options now, that's for sure. Probably a heart I think.|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps he was led astray by his @S10 - with @SAxxx i am sure he would have ducked without any hesitation|pg||

nt|lestergold: well does he think that his opps arent good enuf to false card here if so then its probably right to play it like this|pg||
pc|s5|nt|benjent: @dQ was to figure out if he needs to ruff a @d or not|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: that was probably percentage after the @S8 fell, on the reasoning that if North was up to finding the falsecard every time it's still 50/50 whether to play for stiff ace or stiff 8|pg||
pc|s7|pc|d8|pg||

nt|athene: good job dummy had the @S7 not the @S6 :)|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|athene: north will bid stayman here surely and find the 4-4 diamond fit|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: in strong-NT-land, this double would be clubs, but against weak-notrumps, many people use it to say "i would have doubled 1nt"|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: north preumably intending to pass whatever south's response however the double has created other possibilities|pg||
nt|athene: it's a common tactical ploy if partner openes a weak-NT and you have nothing, to bid stayman|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|athene: so playing against weak-notrumps you might like to have some way to show good hands here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: well experience suggest that stayman here is odds on to improve the contract|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||
nt|athene: there's an intra-finesse in diamonds, which is unlikely to see the light of day i guess|pg||
nt|lestergold: I do not think it would have cost north to try 2d|pg||
nt|athene: no, you would assume 2@D means "i would have passed 2@D if you had bid that"|pg||
nt|vugraphzzr: "didn't want to bid 2d"- Robinson, "why the hell not?" - Delivera|pg||
nt|lestergold: the intra finesse is best chance for 3 dim tricks so why not/|pg||

nt|athene: you can always play the first part of the intra-finesse and then decide to play for @DKQ doubleton :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|benjent: Got a lot of dinky finesses to take here. If you're playing flat out for 4@h, you would do it. Here, playing for 2, I think you look for a more direct line to 8 tricks|pg||

nt|benjent: 4@s is available on the @d guess. If North opens a red 3@s, I guess South will raise. Otherwise, I think we're stopping in a partscore|pg||
nt|athene: but if north has a very weak hand he will specifically have short clubs almost always|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: so NS can't have been wanting to escape into 2@C|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|lestergold: 4S an excellent contract if they can find it|pg||

pc|d7|nt|athene: it looks like 3@S to me but i suppose people prefer to have the KQJ and stuff in their suits|pg||

nt|athene: Declarer could, in theory, get away with one down for a 1-imp gain, but i doubt he will pick up the clubs|pg||

nt|benjent: The Gumby team cruised through the qualifying and marched to an imposing lead in their semi-final. The only sets they have lost have been when they were already through to the next ...|pg||
nt|benjent: stage.|pg||
nt|lestergold: clubs behave nicely so cant see any problems in that contract|pg||
nt|benjent: They are the favourites today - which is not to belittle the fine players on the Neill team|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|benjent: NS play weak NT. Some would open that South hand 1NT, but I think it's a dreadful choice. I thoroughly approve of Robinson's 1@d choice|pg||
