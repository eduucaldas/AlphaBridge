nt|haans: no know that i rean BIN :)|pg||
nt|drorp:  establishing the spades would work, but he should start with clubs because other wise east can theoretically jump with K@s and play his 2nd heart, and west will have 2 more entries to establish his hearts and set the contract|pg||
nt|jbgood: rdbl - 4 sp - 4 NT |pg||
mb|5C!|mb|p|nt|jbgood: well - he skipped the xx|pg||
