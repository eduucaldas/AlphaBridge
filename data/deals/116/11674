mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: Martin knows the system|pg||
nt|thorvald: To win this tournament, its normally required to score about 19-20 MP / match. I can only recall one time, that the winner had less than 200 for 11 matches|pg||

nt|benno:  nothing special here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C can be 18-20 balanced, yes|pg||
nt|jcwla: "To bid game in notrump, your side needs 26 high card points."|pg||

nt|Walddk2: http://www.netbridge.dk/bridge/Upload/file/07_DOPE.pdf|pg||

nt|sfoxa: in CR, NS collected overtrick after @h start, so looks like -1 iml for OEJ|pg||

nt|mmmakela: hard to bi d W being 4144|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now 5 @H? or |pg||
nt|lestergold: this normal contract does not however look like a making one|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi Geoff|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|cindy:  N cant make a penalty double ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: decloarer will not be expecting hearts 3/3|pg||
pc|c4|nt|roswolf: lack of entries to dummy will become all too evident|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sfoxa: We are to follow Danish Club Teams Championship. Doesn it mean, there are Nationals as well, beside Clubs?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: for those who forgot to adjust their clocks we are NOT 1 hour late|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|monsted: East could have made a penalty dobl here i think|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome|pg||
nt|jcwla: E would probably double at matchpoints, but at IMPS penalty doubles into game should be made only if confident of setting the contract (some say by 2 tricks).|pg||
nt|snorris:  needs to raise @hs|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mmmakela: sry don't understand your question Sveta|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mmmakela: nowadays you tend to lose the minors|pg||
nt|mmmakela: depending what 2D-2 NT can have pretty lame|pg||
nt|ady: was going to be difficult to reach the slam    2 key cards in north hand    and still needs good fortune with the clubs|pg||
nt|pelu: has to duck to make presure onN|pg||
nt|lestergold: dont know east west's carding but east needs to duck this and hope that partner gets in again|pg||
nt|pelu: 2. - 4. here|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would have put spade 8 on the table playing very old fashioned methods|pg||
nt|sharynr: yes this way, east has to guess who has the 10|pg||
nt|chick: why oldfashioned?|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  If he ducks he may get next trick on @hQ|pg||
nt|pelu: but N can make by an endplay - On the 3. @C East has to discard @Hq|pg||
nt|sharynr: because surely his pard can have no more entries|pg||
nt|lestergold: well saying thats my highest spade but a lot of modern players do sophisticated things i dont understand|pg||
nt|sharynr: the endplay can be in spades then|pg||
nt|pelu: yes|pg||
nt|chick: if E ducks and a heart is led, E can play the Q and maybe get that entry to partner|pg||
nt|sharynr: after cashing the heart K of course :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: and now east apparently doesnt undrstand either or doesnt know what to do|pg||
nt|pelu: nice board to start with|pg||
nt|lestergold: he knows thatpards chances of coming in again are rather limited|pg||
pc|sA|nt|marlowepi: approve the 2D raise by S -- when opps rate to have spades, all the other suits are the same for us so bidding hearts would be misdirected and takes up no room|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ritong: hi|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi Shirley, Christina and Marshall|pg||
nt|pelu: when u sit for 2 min - u sh know what u will lead - if u have no lead - then dont take! :)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|roswolf: -2 is predestined|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi rashed|pg||
nt|sharynr: duck|pg||
nt|lestergold: might as well duck this|pg||
pc|h4|nt|roswolf: yes it does look doomed|pg||
nt|lestergold: a bit unluky neither red suit behaves|pg||
nt|roswolf: life is like that|pg||
nt|lestergold: west of course doesnt know his partner has a second diamond winner|pg||
nt|lestergold: but he must play a low spade here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Board 1 will be cancelled I am told. One of the players in the closed room took somebody else's cards|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jcwla: The OR is starting with 11 and 12 so we will be feeding them comparisons until we get that far.|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|monsted: looks like down 2 or 3|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So this is just for fun|pg||
nt|lestergold: he heards us both Sharyn|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi operator how i the stading here: Nord and OEJ?|pg||
nt|sharynr: and now it is quite obvious that @H break 3-3|pg||
nt|sharynr: having led the 8 and then Q|pg||
nt|vugraphzyy: Nord need 7 kp|pg||
pc|c9|nt|marlowepi: another reason not to bid hearts, of course, is that E is likely to have a good holding in the suit but that is a tertiary reason|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rnmalik: I thought NS had good play for 4@S, 1@C+1@D+1@S=3|pg||
nt|lestergold: Good evening everyone Mike Gold here from England|pg||
nt|marlowepi: when does the fun start?|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm lucky for someonr|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I have promised East not to tell who it was|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphzyy: @s|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello Mark|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|cindy:  3@sx looks pretty good to me|pg||
nt|cindy:  hi|pg||
nt|snorris:  hi Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Cindy!|pg||
nt|cindy:  :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: double seems to have a lot to recommend it, yes. they might run diamonds against you at 3N|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Snorri|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sfoxa: if this is Club teams, do they have another teams championship?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: W's second dbl didn't work out well|pg||
nt|lestergold: just as well as west has put paid to his side enjoying the 3 spade tricks they were dealt|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|monsted: yes and showing 24 as NT is ok I think|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lestergold: hi Marshall|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi there|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  could be ugly now|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  =is ugly|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  but end play'|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Niels|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would be surprised if this contract failed on any defence tho|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mmmakela: guess so where u can form teams that are not from same club|pg||
nt|sharynr: perhaps winning the @SA and playing a club best|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sT|pc|s3|pg||
nt|snorris:  north has ways to win this but will she|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d6|nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Tom Nørgaard. Hello to you|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  wd|pg||
nt|lestergold: and handed the contract to south on a plate|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah well at least we know it doesnt matter|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|marlowepi: 2D would be a lot to bid in most standard methods|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|lestergold: but 3n would still be reached|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Bridgewise, Denmark is divided into 11 districts. The district winners, and an extra team from the district with the holders (Copenhagen), compete for the honours|pg||

nt|monsted: this is 4 spades - but with this weak opening they will go too high I think|pg||
nt|jcwla: A Rule of 20 opener here and this seems to be the rare right time for a trump lead.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Singleton trump lead that is.|pg||
nt|lestergold: work to deo to get at ten tricks but opps even with trump lead cannot get enough trump plays in|pg||

nt|pelu: OEJ need to win 24-6 to be champs - so I exp we will se some wild bidding :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w need to stay low their hands do not fit at all well outside hearts|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ady: 20 pts eac h this time|pg||
nt|Walddk4: OEJ are the holders|pg||
nt|mmmakela: by S  good|pg||
nt|lestergold: a bit of a misfit here|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: will NS find it|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Yep|pg||
nt|snorris:  as if west MIGHT come in .|pg||
mb|2H|nt|christinas: EW play weak NT|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S  looks a possibility   but with trumps 5-1 looks doomed  especiaally on a heart lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 5 spades 2 dims a heart and two club ruffs is ten tricks what if south ducks a diamond lead towards dummy?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Wow.|pg||
nt|lestergold: At unfavourable vulnerability??|pg||
nt|lestergold: is south colour blind?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the Schaltz team name is also the title of an outstanding Western from late 50s or early 60s starring Marlon Brando and Karl Malden|pg||
nt|lestergold: E/W playing a weak no trump?|pg||
nt|lestergold: this can go off|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sybarra: no transfer, interesting  |pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  Youth displays courage|pg||
nt|lestergold: obviously|pg||
nt|snorris:  very popular in Denmark|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  Again: @cQ behind J for winning 3NT - so now it is proven 100%|pg||
nt|sharynr: 1NT range, anyone?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 4@S IS AN INSPIRED CHOICE|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  ...and will become older|pg||
nt|lestergold: its youth|pg||
nt|lestergold: well doube dummy there are 9 tricks available in 3N |pg||
nt|mmmakela: good lead|pg||
nt|sfoxa: not so easy with this start |pg||
nt|mmmakela: 135 leads|pg||
nt|mmmakela: promising 2 or none higher|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: Japenese?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: W's t/o dbl is little weak to my taste|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah well 3nt is always forgiving|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: true|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: not much chance of this making  |pg||
nt|lestergold: kamikaze trained|pg||
nt|mmmakela: for englishorientated audience EW team name is quite exotic|pg||
nt|ady: north might have reasoned south will be short in hearts    but has to be wary of at least 10 cards in the minors  so not likely to fit well in spades|pg||
nt|marlowepi: awkward bid for N but when you can overbid in a way that allows you to tell your whole story, it is generally a good idea, especially at IMPs|pg||
nt|roswolf: well discipline reigns|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@H seems a good spot for NS |pg||
nt|lestergold: but not on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: must be weak|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ady: club values bad for declarer|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  ...and richer|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh my west has let vul opps off hook|pg||
nt|monsted: Dennis is normaly very solid - despice of Junior|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ritong: first board was a clue about north s style|pg||
nt|lestergold: and 11 tricks i think is a distance too far|pg||
nt|jcwla: This sure looks like the time for a double by W.  E appears to have wasted @C values and W has the reds locked up, no comprendo.|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|christinas: unpleasant to balance for NS, but they can make 3@c|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ritong: brutal.|pg||
nt|lestergold: on this defence a lot of tricks available |pg||
pc|sK|nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
nt|ady: likely 2 down|pg||
nt|lestergold: look at the mountain that south had offered|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: the children would have to be sent to bed early|pg||
nt|lestergold: and south was warned by the splinter that clubs were NOT breaking|pg||
nt|lestergold: well nmot the sharpestr defence ive ever seen |pg||
nt|lestergold: so far that is|pg||
nt|vugraphzyy: 4 cl = void|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Weak NT has its advantages aswell|pg||
nt|sybarra: just which 5/2 S should play and the breaks here are not good  |pg||
pc|s2|nt|pelu: 2@H = 4. suit - tto strong for direct 4@S - but 3@S is in my book and overbid - 4.suit + 4@S is the hand!|pg||
nt|lestergold: im told popular in denmark where there is a shortage of high card points|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|roswolf: well with a bit of luck on their side they are formidable|pg||
pc|sA|nt|marlowepi: given that you dont really want S on lead, i predict 4 club tricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: here thanks to system no need to do anything dramatic, though the N hand is suitable enough for a D contract that 2H is an underbid|pg||
nt|pelu: no 15-17 - u dont go to game on the West hand oop a weak NT|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|jcwla: If West's splinter showed the void -- then it's incomprehensible.  If not, then the Rule of 20 opener combined with W's feeling of still having hidden extra values and a possible ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: slam at least makes it comprehensible, though still not my choice...|pg||
nt|sharynr: then 4@H is aggressive|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pelu: 4.suit + 4@s = mild slaminvit , 4.suit + 3@S = strong slam invit|pg||
nt|lestergold: boing void in pard's seond suit is a little bit of a dampener allowing a downgrade|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ady: +200 should be a useful score for e/w on a non event hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: then im afraid the men in white coats should be summoned|pg||
nt|lestergold: i meanm for south|pg||
nt|rnmalik: mine was an observation after seeing all 52 cards but tough for N to bid 4@H, |pg||

nt|lestergold: how many tricks has south given away to declarer?|pg||
nt|jcwla: 6 to Blakset on 1, while their N/S failed by 2 in 3@C here, their E/W failed by 3 in 3NT in the OR.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|marlowepi: probably too tough to reach 4H, and after all it could just as easily have been the hearts that broke badly with the spades behaving|pg||
pc|dK|pg||

nt|christinas: champions|pg||
nt|roswolf: easy game|pg||
nt|roswolf: a hand of promise now|pg||
nt|ady: e/w may end in 4@s  going down|pg||
nt|jcwla: In the OR, E passed, S opened 1@D, and the contract is a quiet 4@S.|pg||
nt|pelu: No Martin is not - the team is from the Copenhagen Club One-Eyed Jacks - a club with 16 teams - only playing teams (and a few IMP-pair)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: strange play,but all well in the end|pg||
nt|ady: poor defence    trump should have beden played|pg||
nt|ady: been|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3 spades 2 hearts 3 dims and 2 clubsthere are tricks but unfortunatley there are more than four tricks for the defence|pg||
nt|roswolf: safely done|pg||
nt|sharynr: agree|pg||
nt|lestergold: best defence only 7 ttricks available in the hearts contract|pg||
nt|sharynr: but as was commented earlier, e-w need imps!|pg||
nt|chick: maybe, but the best way to get imps is not by being silly, upgrading a 4333 14 count|pg||
nt|lestergold: well said Chick I thought yuou had disappeared|pg||
nt|lestergold: vanished|pg||
nt|chick: nope :)   you just beat me to everything I want to say :)|pg||
nt|pelu: but to win 24-6 in 12 board match - u have to create several swings|pg||
nt|lestergold: dont tell people i beat you ill get arrested|pg||
mb|p|nt|monsted: yes this could give som action|pg||
nt|lestergold: and sharp defence could threaten 4S|pg||
mb|1D|nt|roswolf: an easy game|pg||
mb|2C|nt|nielsfoged:  6@c is ok|pg||
nt|sfoxa: hard to avoid 3 NT here as well|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 3 nt has a flaw here|pg||
mb|2D|nt|roswolf: 3@S?|pg||
nt|snorris:  180 not 210 surely|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rnmalik: 3NT by EW on a @S lead, |pg||
nt|monsted: 3 clubs non vul is not much here|pg||
nt|ady: this will not be a success|pg||
nt|lestergold: 9 top tricks 3n|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  but somewhat Roland style|pg||
nt|jcwla: An overtrick IMP on 2 as 4@S made on the dot.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|lestergold: but with such a thin spade guard may be difficult to bid now|pg||
nt|mmmakela: w might bid 3 nt now|pg||
nt|lestergold: potential here for e/w to get overboard|pg||
nt|ady: 5@D  looks on for n/s|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: not any more lol|pg||
nt|rnmalik: No @C lead and made|pg||

nt|christinas: 2@d multi|pg||
nt|sybarra: optimistic |pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting multi |pg||
nt|rnmalik: costly 4@S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this is worth noting about those 55 borderline openers, though--when you really would prefer playing in the lower suit if partner has equivalent holdings, you could pass hoping to ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: get to show your 2 suiter later. if the auction does allow you to do that, you will get to the right suit as with equal holding partner will bid hearts. with the actual hand, of ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: course, it is not clear you do want hearts if partner is equal in the suits|pg||
nt|sybarra: e/w make 4 hts |pg||
nt|christinas: I think it is down 3 for -500, and 4@h probably make|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ritong: east took a risk doubling 1@s|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @S lead by N|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: he wanted to show his @h xxxx, we guess$|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 3NT after the 3@D bid optimistic|pg||

nt|roswolf: 3@S emerged boldy dont see why at these colors|pg||
nt|lestergold: You wanna see what emerged form Bilde at these colours yesterday!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at these colors i am a bit surprised S did not double, but maybe that would have some special meaning in NS methods, such as "i have a trump stack"|pg||
nt|roswolf: well the neck was stretched out for axing|pg||
nt|sybarra: would have been an expensive axe !|pg||
nt|lestergold: It was Bilde who offered his non vul opps something like a 4 figure penalty but they went on to bid 5 which was easy to defeat then bilde carved up the defence so there was no ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: happy endiong|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: i might have called again as east|pg||
nt|monsted: pass in North ?? - should have bid 4 spades I think|pg||
nt|sfoxa: sometime you'll find @d 4-4 by opps|pg||
nt|christinas: so principally it is right to bid 4@s|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: looks down 4   -400|pg||
nt|mmmakela: u like Dorthe's bids Peter?|pg||
nt|lestergold: Bilde may be colour blind|pg||
nt|christinas: N knows they have at least 9 spades|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lestergold: best defence this is one off i fear|pg||
nt|lestergold: or Bild may be wild|pg||
nt|pelu: I have the official result now: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub6/Turneringer/KampResultat642.html|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ritong: but the scenario was relatively predictable with his @s single|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  but in 6@c do not play on double finesse - which would be rather natural after the 2@s bid|pg||
nt|jcwla: I would also open 1@C with West but a minority of players might choose something else.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 4s lucky to go obly three off reverse the heart honours and its 4 off|pg||
nt|lestergold: I dont think in an imps game its good business to o for such a potentially expensive save- especially when the game doesnt always make|pg||
nt|lestergold: it does here and it would profit but nothing to write home about|pg||
nt|monsted: not a safe - but to make it difficult for EW to make the rigth decision|pg||
nt|snorris:  credit to east for threding carefully|pg||
nt|lestergold: but makes now on the lead|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|sybarra: and overboard they went |pg||
nt|cindy:  might not make 3@h even   oops  that lead helps the cause|pg||
nt|pelu: OEJ need 25-5!|pg||
nt|sharynr: good stop in 3@D here|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ritong: so, if the system allows it, i think that bidding @ds immediately is more sound|pg||
nt|ritong: and, if pard has @hs, it will be good for @d trump as well|pg||
nt|sybarra: or "c"  all of the above|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ady: n/s should get a plus if they dont  mangle the diamond suit|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: not an easy lead i must admit but my choice would have been a passive club when the bididnmg shows the contract is likely to be tight|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Thought so, Shirley:) 2@H and 3@C discouraging bids but even then|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|Walddk4: Did he really make 4 overtricks on board 2?|pg||
nt|lestergold: not possiblem Roland|pg||
nt|cindy:  think so|pg||
nt|lestergold: must have lost the AD at the end|pg||
nt|vugraphzyy: sr - no 10 tricks|pg||
nt|snorris:  must have been operators mistake|pg||
nt|lestergold: having already lost two hearts|pg||
nt|marlowepi: before we heap any more scorn on 3S, we should bear in mind that there is plenty of room in principle for his partner to hold useful values--S has opened at favorable and N has ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: announced 7-9. W could have up to  13 HCP, more than enough for EW game if they are nicely situated|pg||
pc|d3|nt|monsted: no 4 down - I would have bid 4 spades om E - strange not to|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dT|pc|d4|pc|d5|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @S lead would be interesting|pg||
nt|lestergold: so OEJ need Roland to deal the cards|pg||
nt|chick: swinging is overrated :)|pg||
mc|9|nt|lestergold: there is some equity in it but north apart form spade support has a working yarboroug in tnhe side suits|pg||
nt|cindy:  on the lead  there is a tiny inference that S might have doubled 2@d|pg||
nt|chick: you win by playing very good solid steady bridge and let the opps make the mistakes|pg||

nt|benno:  showing @d+@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is it good enough for 4@D? I think so|pg||
nt|benno:  they play 3rd hand openings in any position|pg||
nt|benno:  me to|pg||
nt|benno:  but double is also interesting|pg||
nt|benno:  you would be happy with a pass from partner|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there are several reasons for opening W hand, though obviously pass is fine: (1) trailing opp likely to do it in the other room   (2) your majors are the wrong way round for a ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2-suited bid later, and at the 2 level it is not that tasty to show spades alone|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|sfoxa: a kib pointed out, that even grand in @d is good - double-dummy, of course|pg||
nt|benno:  mmm, more imps|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|sfoxa: even this spot brings lot of imps|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The first 12 IMPs one would think|pg||
nt|benno:  yes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: slam would only bring 4 more|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If Dorthe had been really inspired, she might have raised to slam, given the state of the match|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes Marshall, but Dorthe does not know that|pg||
nt|Walddk2: She may well be up against game at the other table too|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i did not mean it as a criticism, it was just an observation. my comment preceded yours|pg||
nt|thorvald: In the closed room declarer mistimed the play, I think he should have won it even though it wasnt the best contract|pg||
nt|benno:  if anyone should bid slam it must be south|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i agree martin|pg||
nt|benno:  he is the one with extras|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N shd also have two places to play to bid 5C|pg||

pc|h6|pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||
nt|marlowepi: depends how much of that hand is in spades. if N has 2 places to play, increased chances she has the right cards. |pg||
nt|benno:  and he knows that Dorthe already has counted in he's extra value|pg||
nt|marlowepi: still, this is the sort of hand where you may have already won IMPs just by bidding to your game|pg||
nt|benno:  sure|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h9|pc|d6|pc|d7|pg||

nt|mmmakela: but 4 @S is down|pg||
nt|marlowepi: leave us note that N is above his announced range--quite rare at these colors, and S has about 70% more values than he promised by opening 1H|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think pen dbls should be used when you have such a bols opp|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S lead far from unreasonable also|pg||
nt|sharynr: will tie with 25-5 and also will need Blaksett to win no more that 23 vps|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: wet is picking  up so big hands|pg||

mb|3H|nt|lestergold: what on earth is east up to why is he slamming with 1 flattish points hios pard has not promised extras|pg||
nt|pelu: very aggressiv X by West - spec with @CK in front of the @C-opening|pg||
nt|roswolf: 6@C by west might have some play on another day|pg||
nt|christinas: On board 1 One-eyed earned imps playing strong nt, because N opened a weak nt in stead of a @d and so S did not lead a @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy:  W isn't shy|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6N too|pg||
nt|lestergold: but neither sound to bid|pg||

nt|mmmakela: could even call it foolish|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Board 1 that is|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well sanity has crept back in here|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, E does have some extras, but predictably W's reasonable 4@D was based partially on distribution.  At some point they recognized this.|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes butnoslam going extras|pg||
nt|lestergold: enough to make 11 tricks a proposition|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1NT +2 in this room|pg||

nt|mmmakela: dias lead now?|pg||

nt|sfoxa: very tiny game, but possible with unaccurate defence|pg||

nt|christinas: so when pairs play different nt-openings, you are almost sure to have swings during a relatively long match|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Well, I think E's sequence was reasonable, show some extras (slam is possible opp some 4@D hands there), then pull back.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I am all wrong It is N to lead|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: my principle against suit part scores where there is unlikely to be anything to spare is to not get busy |pg||
nt|snorris:  this should make|pg||
nt|lestergold: communications between the defnders are fotunately not too ood|pg||
nt|lestergold: good|pg||
nt|cindy:  would have been easy with a @d lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: somewhat odd silence on first round by N, who is usually a forward bidder|pg||
nt|snorris:  yes..a good 4 card suit|pg||
nt|snorris:  in @hs|pg||
nt|lestergold: i overcall a heart on first round in case my partner is on lead and other reasons|pg||
nt|cindy:  now will declarer think its possible for W to have singleton @d ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W bidding would be 100% for me if NV, but vul more questionable. could go for several hundred against nothing even undoubled, and possession of spades may buy you time--less urgent ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: to bid first round|pg||
nt|cindy:  he can always get rid of losing @d later but might not realize there is no hurry|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: Hi olks sorry late |pg||
pc|s7|nt|roswolf: hmm inconsistent|pg||
nt|lestergold: more reasonable than some weve seen today i agree|pg||
nt|ady: cards lay well   spade finesse on  Q10 hearts doubleton with north   and diamonds 3-3|pg||
nt|vugraphzyy: control in cl  - and two aces for hearts|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|mmmakela: probs with my dogs brb|pg||
nt|lestergold: Marshall are you evenmore old fashioned than me|pg||
nt|roswolf: c'est la vie|pg||
nt|sharynr: not their best contract here|pg||
nt|sharynr: 3nt or 5@D better|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|pc|dK|nt|lestergold: but lets bearin miond that making 5d here does depend on everything behaving reasonably well|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|sybarra: ace of clubs on side helps this hand |pg||
nt|rnmalik: Friendly placement|pg||
nt|ady: hi Mike|pg||
nt|ady: may well make 7|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ritong: i will spare you my usual titade about raptor:)|pg||
nt|ritong: tirade*|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  2nd hand t.o. Dbl would require shorter @ss/longer @cs - closer to 1NT i.mo.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mmmakela: even 7 makes this time if u somehow end up there|pg||
nt|lestergold: well here a dull ll tricks will be made |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|lestergold: the risks of NOT biodding with north's hand are arguably much greater|pg||
nt|snorris:  very clever..|pg||
nt|lestergold: but as acrds lie will probably lose 2 hearts and a diamond|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ritong: if you want a possible solution to these problems, just google " raptor"|pg||
nt|rnmalik: even 2 @C by P has rebid of 2@D|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hi Markku and hi David|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sybarra: so I can pour the coffee now |pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||
nt|sybarra: now can make 5 |pg||
nt|roswolf: sunny in Hove at present|pg||
nt|sharynr: and a spade now too|pg||
pc|c8|nt|christinas: EW have often represented Denmark in international events|pg||
nt|roswolf: i prefer T-Rex|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  ..still I agree that it was strandge (and expensive for EW) that Jepsen didn't bid 2@d rather than Dbl on former hand|pg||
nt|mmmakela: himike|pg||
nt|mmmakela: @C K was led in OR in 3 nt  3|pg||
pc|c6|nt|pelu: some spects tell me: tto kind with peter Schaltz - the X is not only aggressiv - but bad bridge! OK:)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|nielsfoged:  EW pushed into 6@c in closed and won it (S only bid 1@s not 2@s - probably ensured right handling of @h's)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: tide in?|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|snorris:  south didnt fall for it|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sharynr: unless he drops that @DQ|pg||
pc|d7|nt|lestergold: what am i talking about?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mmmakela: bidding was little different must admit|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||

nt|roswolf: nope|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ritong: or are you referring to marc bolan|pg||

mb|1C|mb|1D|nt|sfoxa: or even @h game...|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|thorvald: making strange bid - trying to create some results|pg||

mb|3C|nt|benno:  not that strange|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sfoxa: this time, this convention wasn't the best method|pg||
nt|marlowepi: seems quite strange to me|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Sveta, given the SOTM anything is possible by a trailing team over just 12 boards|pg||
nt|benno:  its tough to defend against 2@d after your 1@c opening|pg||
nt|jcwla: Sabine Auken in "I Love This Game" extols the virtues of overcalling 2@D over 1@C. (and 2@C over 1@D).|pg||
mb|5H|nt|marlowepi: its tough when pd takes a phantom too|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sK|nt|marlowepi: yes but extolling the virtues doesnt mean u should do it every time you have 5 diamonds|pg||
nt|benno:  but W might have shown @h afterwoods|pg||
nt|thorvald: while we talk, the result in CR suddenly seems OK :-)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|pc|s3|pg||

pc|c8|pc|cT|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|hA|mc|10|nt|sfoxa: yes, lot of spec pointed it out. I was wrong|pg||
nt|benno:  maybe just pass|pg||
nt|sfoxa: but anyway - few more imps for OEJ|pg||

nt|ritong: yeah|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  avoid 3NT?|pg||
nt|roswolf: a potentially dangerous hand|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yep 5@D better contract|pg||
nt|ritong: 4@s has charm|pg||
nt|roswolf: also bidding a slam is all too possible|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 4 @S here brb cig br|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  3NT cold (if you know @d blocks)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well N/S likely to get overboard her|pg||
nt|ady: part score in spades for n/s here|pg||
nt|roswolf: and perhaps some fun here|pg||
nt|sybarra: yeah |pg||
nt|pelu: and old rule: set up the sidesuit first (before taking @HA)|pg||
nt|lestergold: what happens if declarer simply plays three round of dims (no finess) before drawing second round of gtrumps even if that lost to the q of dims he would be better placed|pg||
mb|1C|nt|snorris:  looks like 3nt |pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 2 I was wondering if 3 nt made as it did in the other room |pg||
mb|2D|nt|marlowepi: yes even 6H has practical chances here:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: and has added equity of dropping doubleton q in any case|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: good 4@H for EW|pg||
nt|lestergold: neither side can quite mak game here|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sharynr: they would tap him again (especialy if east can win diamond)|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy:  the other table has made one trick less on each hand played so far|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: doubt its easy to get there is it....W has to blast into it|pg||
nt|ady: e/w   should be in 4@S    likely 11 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and he did|pg||
nt|mmmakela: imaginative that 3 H|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N not a cake walk|pg||
nt|sfoxa: good stop - for "plus" record for NS|pg||
nt|lestergold: however anything could happen as defences may not be perfect|pg||
nt|vugraphzyy: just an ifo - board nr, 1 WILL count in this match !|pg||
nt|pelu: if losing til East then @S back win force him to ruff - and he is short|pg||
nt|lestergold: true|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lestergold: I have to go sorry for brief visit but guests arrived early|pg||
nt|jcwla: 5@H not in the picture here, so double and pass the only choices and double it is -- though I wouldn't love being on lead.|pg||
nt|lestergold: bye all or now|pg||
nt|pelu: 2NT from DS = (15)16-18(19) :)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jcwla: Bye for now Mike.|pg||

nt|roswolf: well west has 4@S in his locker surely|pg||
pc|c9|nt|nielsfoged:  @d8 a beauty|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|sybarra: again a black ace in a friendly place,  (@S this time)|pg||
nt|lestergold: Not a hand here to povide much work for three or so commentators|pg||
nt|marlowepi: EW make 4S if S cashes both clubs instead of leading small at trick 2|pg||
nt|lestergold: at these colours i do not see e/w risking defending|pg||
nt|roswolf: but bd 1 was flat!!:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 1 was thrown out |pg||
nt|sharynr: missing 4@H here could cost.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: without a heart lead  possible to make 13 tricks with ruffing diamond finesse|pg||
nt|monsted: King of dia whas the best lead - now it is agaion :)|pg||
nt|chick: all kinds of good contracts in this hand, and none of them bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: or play as he did but postpone second trump before diamond|pg||
pc|s4|nt|nielsfoged:  Money in the Bank?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: nooooooooooooo|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|rnmalik: This board will hurt|pg||
nt|monsted: lol no - looks like 11-13 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: and i dont think any risk whatsoever trying for it|pg||
nt|lestergold: kind of hand west has where he knows that two spades may stand up and his opartner may find his void but cannot be sure|pg||
pc|c3|nt|pelu: I donmt know what S had for dinner - but it most have bene very special :):)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: got the H shift N wanted|pg||
nt|snorris:  so 4. suit is gf|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  still mayb too long way to 9|pg||
nt|cindy:  lots of combined hcp but not so many tricks|pg||
nt|snorris:  well Boysen has a natural lead..|pg||
nt|lestergold: entry probs are such that declarer unlikely to have the luxury of playing the hearts for 4 tricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why not 3C by S instead of 2N?|pg||
nt|sharynr: the play in 4@S NS could get awkward if they save|pg||
pc|c2|nt|roswolf: west did well not to havehad a punt now|pg||
nt|cindy:  good question, marshall|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  would have better chances in N|pg||
nt|cindy:  why is that ?  isnt J of @d lead just as scary ?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 6 @C ?|pg||
nt|ady: could make 9 tricks   attack diamonds next   or hearts|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mmmakela: now only -1|pg||
nt|mmmakela: or 6 @D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: looks better for everyone in the Times if they can report that the result was based on the normal number of boards|pg||
nt|roswolf: west has a deathwish - his bidding is illogical|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: better lead small at trick 2|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont blame west has to take insurance|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at these colors I think S has a close decision as to whether or not to compete over 3C|pg||
pc|dA|nt|nielsfoged:  yes, but @d block|pg||
nt|lestergold: but how is declafrer going to come to nine tricks?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sure, it isscary, but as it turns out it cant hurt you|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  not likely|pg||
nt|cindy:  scary for halloween|pg||
nt|marlowepi: "better chances in N" mention better chances to make, not to have a sacre-free ride:)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ritong: not very convincing, though|pg||
nt|roswolf: but east fell into the trap|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  I think most of us would have ended up this way?|pg||
nt|lestergold: hes already lost a spade cant develop hearts without losing 2 hearts and cant develop clubs without similar|pg||
pc|d6|nt|marlowepi: of course, even then S might find wrong shift, esp if N gives SP for D|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|sybarra: website I have:  http://www2.bridge.dk/Default.aspx?ID=409|pg||
nt|monsted: 12 tricks by ruffing out the diam|pg||
nt|cindy:  dress up like J of @d|pg||
nt|mmmakela: phone brb|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ritong: mm..|pg||
nt|lestergold: even if he double dummies the diamodn and why should he, i cant see 9 tricks|pg||
nt|snorris:  if south goes for @cs now he can win|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a one-eyed jack. film was directed by brando too, only one he ever directed i think|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|monsted: and now 11|pg||
nt|lestergold: and as w e can see 4s may and WILL make now!!|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lestergold: not clear whether the successfrul line for 12 tricks was better odds here|pg||
nt|cindy:  you are having a groundhog moment, marshall|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the point is not about defending in 4S, it is about the way W got there|pg||
pc|c6|nt|pelu: here u see the problem with signals - if u signal distribution East no that there are no @C-ruff in Dummy - if u signal for high cards pd dont kniw the distribution|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mmmakela: or -2|pg||
nt|roswolf: west may now come up smelling of roses|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|ritong: i would offer my @ds, and if opener is not interested, he falls back on 4 NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup dangerous for experienced bidders - novices would have done better on this hand|pg||
nt|mmmakela: think W has a clear @C 2 to play on the lead|pg||

nt|marlowepi: leaving 4C behind, there is something to be said for a 2N overcall with that awkward W hand|pg||

nt|lestergold: Roland loves deals like this|pg||
nt|sfoxa: W knows partner's suit, will he lead it?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|marlowepi: even without heart honor lead, could discard a D on 3rd heart|pg||

pc|dA|nt|christinas: EW struggling to find the best place to play|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @S might have been best |pg||
nt|roswolf: south hoping pard has his bidding - which he does of course|pg||
nt|christinas: hm, this board looks dangerous. Both N and S have max for their bid. 4 spades always makes and shouldn't be difficult to bid|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sharynr: east-west have been warned against bidding @H with the 2@S response|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|pg||
nt|ritong: first reason, ofc, is that you can have a @s game or slam, even playing a strong @c system|pg||
nt|roswolf: north to bid again - surely not|pg||
nt|lestergold: anyone tell me free virtual Danish pastry  for first one to tell me|pg||
nt|mmmakela: might not be easy|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ady: 3 level looks 1 too high for both sides|pg||
nt|lestergold: and this is a typical outcome for a roland favourite hand type|pg||
nt|monsted: is nt this a winner|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: no entrants to my comp?|pg||
nt|monsted: 2 loser in hearts 1 in dia and 1 in clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: high card points distributed 20/20|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|christinas: this is trickt because of the @s split.|pg||
nt|sybarra: big card is 8 of spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: draw trumps play spade to K and run ten of spades defence gets a spade a club two hearts but NO diamonds|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1C-2D as a good club raise works pretty reasonably, but the flip side of the usual method is to use 1D-3C as an equivalent raise of 1D, and that is problematic due to the space ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: consumed. an interesting compromise is to play that 2D over EITHER minor is that kind of raise, but such an arrangement requires more detailed infrastructure|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|christinas: You have to play A and small to the ten to avoid 3 @s losers|pg||
nt|roswolf: incroyable|pg||
nt|ritong: second reason is that you tend to obstruct the bidding when hand belongs to opponents if it does not cost you a penalty too often|pg||
pc|sT|nt|marlowepi: undoubtedly N would have liked to do more, but the cuebid already puts them at 4H so she made the practical underbid|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like finding the qc is the critical matter here|pg||
nt|lestergold: on the bidding more likely to place it with wet|pg||
nt|lestergold: west|pg||
nt|pelu: East almost endplayed|pg||
nt|pelu: only @s-back will give decl a losing option|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ady: can make with A@D right for a spde discard   and clubs 3-3|pg||
nt|lestergold: well played|pg||
nt|lestergold: by east|pg||
nt|pelu: he will not play @H - bidding has placed N with 4-5 @Hs|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rnmalik: Lead favourable|pg||
nt|sybarra: but you will lose 3 @S that way |pg||
nt|sybarra: need ot lead low from dummy I think |pg||
nt|sybarra: then towards the 10 |pg||
nt|christinas: nonsens, S of course always gets 3, sry|pg||
nt|sybarra: so 3 sp and a @H,  = -1 |pg||
nt|ady: alyes sorry  3@H a make|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  EW must be careful|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|pelu: wd by Lars|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: took a cautious approach didnt they?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|nielsfoged:  not the day to choose the 4-4 Ma fit!|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 4/5 have been 3 NT|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: in spite of the hearts wrong everything else is very ight|pg||
nt|lestergold: right|pg||
nt|sfoxa: quite an interesting position for W - he has to find 2 more spare cards|pg||
nt|mmmakela: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub6/Turneringer/KampResultat638.html  for results and standings after round 6|pg||
nt|mmmakela: the holders OYJ leading but in trouble now in this match|pg||
nt|mmmakela: once again: we have a new policy amongst the commentators, private messages only answered if whole name included in the profile|pg||
nt|sfoxa: if E's first discard - @h7 - shows @h values, W shouldn't be in trouble. if not...|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: declarer played my line- I do not believe it!|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  wd|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: declarer may choose another losing option which is to play west for KH- maybe cash top clubs when nothing happens play heart finesse through west to discard losing club- then sadly ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: two off tho|pg||
pc|c8|pc|h4|nt|mmmakela: has 9 so not great excitement here|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lestergold: now will run spades and ope to get clue/count on hand|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|rnmalik: absolutely|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h2|nt|lestergold: grosvenor!!|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sfoxa: would you suggest greedy throw-in? |pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|christinas: Unless there is an endplay if E can shorten himself|pg||
nt|lestergold: by west|pg||
nt|lestergold: hagh|pg||
nt|lestergold: hah!|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mmmakela: y|pg||
nt|lestergold: problem is what does declarer discard on the third spade|pg||
pc|c2|nt|roswolf: accurate defence|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sfoxa: yes!!!|pg||
mc|8|nt|lestergold: w ecan see doubloe dummy the squeeze|pg||
pg||
qx|c7|st||md|1SKJ87HJ986DQ652CT,S962HAK43DAK843CK,ST3HT52DJT9CAQJ93,SAQ54HQ7D7C876542|sv|b|nt|nielsfoged:  more interesting if N could find a small @c in tr2|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  (not likely!!)|pg||
nt|roswolf: more fun here if south opens|pg||
nt|monsted: 6 spades makes here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if you want to call it that. but it was a technically correct play, which is not too grosvenorish|pg||
nt|mmmakela: no!!!!|pg||
nt|sfoxa: not exactly...|pg||
nt|ady: good result for e/w|pg||
nt|lestergold: well read by declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: Im not sure how he judged that|pg||
nt|chick: maybe he just sighed and guessed :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: As Mare Winningham asked in "Miracle Mile," "What's the hurry, Harry?"|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mmmakela: y |pg||
nt|mmmakela: will play 4 S here|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w will probably buy this in 3H|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|mmmakela: but won't bid it|pg||
nt|ady: n/s bound to be ing ame    likely going down in both 4@S and 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: an ill-fitting hand for east-west|pg||
mb|2H|nt|monsted: maybe - when East shows spades it looks good|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: i dont like the heavy 2@C bid|pg||
nt|monsted: now 4 clubs|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 5 dias -3 w h ruff|pg||
nt|cindy:  i dont like 2@h|pg||
nt|snorris:  a rear convention|pg||
nt|cindy:  at all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he has 2 hearts, so very descriptive|pg||
nt|cindy:  lolol|pg||
nt|cindy:  sorry to be so blunt|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it might show 4 spades and longer minor rather than michaels|pg||
nt|sybarra: IF they get into the bidding |pg||
nt|roswolf: well they must bid now|pg||
nt|lestergold: well east shouldnt sell out to 2S|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind you not clear what action he should take|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@C is possible i suppose|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i have never heard anyone say "fortune favors the wimp"|pg||
nt|sharynr: and choosing to reverse will make matters worse|pg||
mb|3N|nt|nielsfoged:  Dbl 1st round anyone with W?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why wouldnt W bid directly over 1N?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3c a reasonable stab it will work cos pard wuill 'correct' to 3h|pg||
mb|p|nt|christinas: On the 6@s hand Århus got 3 imps - the contract was 5@sXX in the open room...|pg||
nt|jcwla: 12 points and five quack cards, what a thing of beauty.|pg||
nt|cindy:  yeh well   i still wouldnt like it|pg||
nt|lestergold: blunt is good Cindy|pg||
nt|mmmakela: Dorthe's and Peter's son is in the audience, Hi Martin!|pg||
nt|sfoxa: or may be it's normal to open vulnerable Multi with 5 points only?|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 3 was a push in 4 @SX -500|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: trouble ahead maybe|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: any chance for 3NT by EW has a play|pg||
nt|monsted: 4 hearts - 4NT|pg||
nt|cindy:  u mean smoking a blunt ?|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  @ss are good enough for @c now|pg||
nt|snorris:  -1..if Peter doesnt pull ALL his aces|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  sorry next trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: no being honest direct blunt etc is good i dont know about smoking i dont smoke|pg||
nt|lestergold: reverse seems perfectly normal|pg||
pc|h6|nt|nielsfoged:  @sQ?|pg||
nt|chick: This won't help the OEJ cause|pg||
nt|sharynr: not to me...singleton K, no spots in suits...should be downgraded|pg||
nt|pelu: Not so diff - he has seen 13 HCP in West @DAK + @SAQ now for sure @HK in East - and if @HJ in West then @cQ in W - D= 13-15, with 16-19 2NT by West|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n combined 17 count 5th round club stop stops in all suits and the square root of no play|pg||
nt|lestergold: Yes but then rebid 2D hardly does justice|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: small slam on club position      cant go wrong with  QX onside|pg||
nt|ady: if diamond is not cashed there are 13 tricks here|pg||
nt|monsted: I dont understand Frederik - when 4 clubs he must follow with 4 NT - only when 3 clubs whitout the Q it is bad|pg||
nt|pelu: what is going on in S? - He could open 1Nt or bid 1NT in sekund round - but 2@C????|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i prefer double--or possibly1S==with W hand also, but maybe EW dont play equal level conversion|pg||
nt|rnmalik: another 3NT|pg||
pc|h5|nt|roswolf: i would have been tempted|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  me too|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  beyond resistance|pg||
nt|ady: might make 4@S     |pg||
nt|sfoxa: yes, if E finds @d lead|pg||
nt|christinas: well, they play very aggressive overcalls, so N had a huge max for his 1@s bid. On the other hand it was difficult for him to see a S hand good enough to make game without showing ...|pg||
nt|christinas: a good @s raise by bidding 2@h instead of 2@s|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well these two are obviously not pupils of Roland|pg||
nt|lestergold: he will be very disspointed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I am not|pg||
nt|lestergold: wont allow them in his bridge centre|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear You are here|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  maybe not so fond of 1NT opening?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mmmakela: he always is......|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh why didnt someone tell me|pg||
nt|pelu: no but 2@c?|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  yes a foreseeable situation after the "expected" 1@s|pg||
nt|mmmakela: bad bidding got what it deserved imo|pg||
nt|pelu: even bigger problem if pd bid 1@H - now I dont like 1NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: well if 2s is defeated he will be vindicated for his conservatism|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: maybe now |pg||
nt|sybarra: I assume 2 @d was game force |pg||
nt|rnmalik: have 12 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4th suit forcing |pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  how would you bid after 1NT-opening (15-17)?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@C+5@H+1@S+1@D=12|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe on their way,  but W have to be dragged along,  his spade suit is not "robust" |pg||
nt|jcwla: The double gained 2 IMPs for N/S on 5.|pg||
nt|sharynr: i dont like 2@D either, maybe a cheat with 1NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: there isno satisfactory bid with this hand its a choice of which of the lesser of various evils|pg||
nt|sharynr: exactly|pg||
nt|chick: the kind of hand that makes Europeans wonder why the ACBL hates 1N with singletons|pg||
nt|sharynr: 1NT as opener, if 15-17...rebid 1NT if 12-14|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lestergold: you mean all these Waldks? they are all the one and only same person??|pg||
nt|rnmalik: strange first the 2@S and now 4@S|pg||
nt|mmmakela: guess 3 dias call indicated 5 spades|pg||
nt|sfoxa: that's more intersting contract than 3nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: nope he stayed at home - but 3@C on this hand was sounder than his 3@S call a few hands ago |pg||
nt|lestergold: and actually 2S looks like going one off here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E has good enough defense that it is far from obvious to enter with his hand--with his uglkyu shape he could easily be truning a plus into a minus. in contrasts, it is easy for W ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: to bid over 1N|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2H has the merit that its truthful about shape and point count and you get to show your good 4 card major- will work well on a lot of hands i think the other bids have less merits|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|christinas: i think it is a potential loss for one-eyed|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h3|pg||
nt|mmmakela: can still make after dias lead;3x hearts|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry about the typing. i need a secretary|pg||
pc|c8|nt|nielsfoged:  expecting fit in at least 1 black suit|pg||
nt|pelu: better play 1D4 - now pd is endplayed|pg||
pc|s7|pc|d3|nt|sybarra: maybe west leading not being dragged |pg||
nt|ady: problem i is east can get a club ruff together with 2 trump tricks   and A@D|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is simply an unlucky hand and will probably be flat|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi I am back - some didnt like my comments - and pulled the plug :):)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mmmakela: 1@D-2@D seems ok to me even with 16 points|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no offers from specs yet:(|pg||
nt|roswolf: unlucky:(|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sybarra: 6 @C not a bad spot |pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  EW gained 5 imps for missing 3NT in  3!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We have results!   http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub6/Turneringer/Resultat633.html   All favourites won big in round 1|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  I think the 15 nice hcps can be used for opening 1@d and rebidding 3@d - but depends one style|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sybarra: I was looking at nt also |pg||
nt|rnmalik: good slam, in duplicate|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Realistically, only four teams can win this year. One-Eyed Jacks and Blakset (both Copenhagen), Århus BK and BK Nord (Aalborg). OEJ are the holders|pg||
nt|ady: e/w did not get beyond 3NT on hand 1  with 6@D a certainty  and 7 actually makes    they only lost 1 imp|pg||
nt|mmmakela: no probs with dias 2-2 and spades optimally|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mmmakela: if pd passes we can't have a laydown game|pg||
nt|sybarra: Rob Brown thinks we need commentators spell checker|pg||
nt|lestergold: cos they are all working for me Marshall|pg||
nt|roswolf: great idea|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|Walddk4: Bridgewise, Denmark is divided into 11 districts. The district winners, and an extra team from the district with the holders (Copenhagen), compete for the honours|pg||

nt|sfoxa: yes, from our point of view.|pg||

nt|jcwla: 6 a push at 4@H making.|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h4|pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the one saving grace about 2H is that it increases chances of making a heart trick on defense. but that isnt enough upside to come close to outweighing the downside, IMHBAICO|pg||
nt|sfoxa: altough, experienced declarer can see his only chance - no others in view|pg||
nt|rnmalik: well played|pg||
pc|s8|nt|pelu: for sure I need a better suit for 3@D|pg||

nt|mmmakela: 4H|pg||
nt|lestergold: well altho 4h can bemade N/S i dont expect them, to be in it|pg||
nt|jcwla: The intermediates definitely came into play there.|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  maybe the bid is 1NT 2nd round even if it shows just 12-14?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: why not 2@D?|pg||
nt|sfoxa: but this time - 3nt for sure :-) |pg||
nt|rnmalik: 9 top as we count and see|pg||
nt|roswolf: another possible fun hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 4@S NS, interesting hand otherwise|pg||
nt|pelu: when u support on a singleton u can also open 1NT on a 6 card minor|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I once commentated in a 8 board match where all 8 deals were played in 3 nt|pg||
nt|ady: likely 3NT n/s|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5C needs accurate bidding tho|pg||
mb|1H|nt|nielsfoged:  sorry!|pg||
nt|lestergold: what about 4S?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2s and a dim and maybe no diamonds??|pg||
nt|lestergold: to lose depending|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  Easy 3NT NS LOL!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: one should prepare for best case scenarios too in the bidding, and usually best case scenario for overcall is partner has a fit. If N was not willing to show extra strength over a ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: spade raise, maybe she should have bid 1N instead of 1S|pg||
mb|p|nt|christinas: N didn't bid 1nt - they might not get there now|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I will bid 2@S after forced pass by N|pg||
nt|sybarra: how many spades to you bid as S ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: is 2 @S strong or weak?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or just a good suit?|pg||
nt|monsted: how many clubs from East |pg||
nt|jcwla: Lots of possible contracts here, from 4@SX to a N/S (save?).|pg||
nt|lestergold: like for example n orth opening it?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not necessarily. i have seen people get to 5C in one bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: i beat u to it Marshall|pg||
nt|marlowepi: exactly mike|pg||
nt|roswolf: not the best time for this gadget|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there never is one|pg||
nt|sybarra: no likely to be played from S |pg||

nt|sybarra: *now|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rnmalik: weak but good balancing|pg||
nt|ritong: not fair of you to remind geoff about his age|pg||

nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|nielsfoged:  3@d keeps your skin smooth|pg||
nt|marlowepi: showing the 2 of clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: and east will lead hearts|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for me this and Muiderberg are tied  for silliest gadget in common use|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4th highest works|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lestergold: oh|pg||
nt|lestergold: and 5th best too|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok 3/5|pg||
mb|p|nt|nielsfoged:  if you open 1d with down to 10 and distribution, these 15 hcps seems to give a too wide interval|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well-reasoned lead|pg||
nt|ady: looks clear for south to bid 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4@S  not makable on a club lead and forces|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so then we all agree on 1 nt opening, case closed|pg||
nt|sfoxa: special deals? |pg||
nt|sfoxa: or nt-loving randomizer  )))|pg||
nt|mmmakela: even my grandma wd bid 3 nt as S|pg||

mb|p|nt|mmmakela: I like direct 5|pg||
nt|sfoxa: how do you say? coffee-board?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not that 1N is a thing of beauty, but i like it better than 1S followed by pass|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rnmalik: DBL only strong call as I play|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm well south likes his shapely 3 count|pg||
nt|monsted: 3 or 4 clubs from East would have been better|pg||
nt|lestergold: the ruff is in effect going to be with east's money|pg||
nt|lestergold: a very dull no trump partial|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jcwla: @D shift here.|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: might make 5 here|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|christinas: this is in my opinion an example of why if ofgten doesn't pay not to bid in bridge. I had bid on both the N and S hand. None of them did, and now they missed not only a partscore, ...|pg||
nt|christinas: but a game|pg||
nt|ritong: is it undiscreet to ask you about yourse, niels?|pg||
nt|sybarra: but 4 should be easy |pg||
nt|christinas: very pessimistic bid - again|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ady: yes    this looks to be a make      fortunate diamond position|pg||
nt|lestergold: will make 8 tricks i expect|pg||
nt|sharynr: 5@D bid and made on bd 4....for a 12 imp gain|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mmmakela: dbl showing pos hand|pg||
nt|christinas: i don't understand how he could resist the temptation of bidding 5 @c|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sybarra: as I had conversation with several specs,  this is all by agreement,   some play 2 @S stronger than this hand |pg||
nt|roswolf: making the position crystal clear|pg||
nt|marlowepi: unlucky--unlucky that a cow flew by when we were filling out our convention card|pg||
nt|lestergold: the convention is fine providing you stick to it north had one club too many|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes it is fine if you love playing 3N from the wrong side on a regular basis|pg||
pc|d6|nt|rnmalik: true|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lestergold: surely not?|pg||
nt|snorris:  good result for e-w as n-s have at least 4 @cs|pg||
nt|lestergold: is tis correct operator?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyy: yes|pg||
nt|ady: thats what usually happens to me   I lead something against 3NT and opps play is straight back|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lestergold: a very lucky contract indeed with favourable red high card positions|pg||
nt|pelu: some would bid 2@h in East - (making)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub6/Turneringer/KampResultat638.html  for results and standings after round 6|pg||
nt|christinas: but he probably thinks his partner has a 12-14 nt - but still 5@c could easily be right|pg||
nt|marlowepi: personally i would bid 2S with S hand to show the club fit & offensive potential immediately. when opps have spades the other suits are the same, and when you have this hand & ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: auction goes 1C-1S partner almost always has real clubs|pg||
nt|christinas: 1@c opening can be only 3 card @c, so I would always show 4 @h by D|pg||
nt|sybarra: S tried to get the @H suit in play |pg||
nt|marlowepi: neg double is not as well-prepared as 2S. if LHO raises to 4S--hardly unforeseeable--S is poorly placed after a neg X|pg||
pc|dK|nt|nielsfoged:  too old to boogie- but would consider opening 3NT|pg||
nt|jcwla: E/W failed by one in 3NT in the OR on 7, so 12 back to Blakset to nose out in front 19-15.|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sfoxa: S succeded with lead-showing bid. how ofter would you lead Qx to strong hand?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: unluckily for no gain this time the way cards are|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sfoxa: 12 tricks now|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sybarra: I agree Christna esp. in imps |pg||
nt|christinas: I think 2@s should be strong, there is no reason to preempt 2@s when you can just pass the hand out|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rnmalik: 1@S shows weak and 5 cards where as 2@S 6+|pg||
nt|lestergold: the bidding marking the diamonds of course|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lestergold: sorry i made a mistake i se that the 2d bid was club support not a natural bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: however entries do not give declarer the option of doubnle diamond finesses|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|mmmakela: Fully understand W's timeout, he can't see the cards as we do|pg||

nt|marlowepi: a club|pg||
mb|1N|nt|marlowepi: 2 huge swings needed for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|thorvald: then there are 9 trciks|pg||
nt|jcwla: 12, where N/S here played 3@S-4, they gained 2 IMPs as E/W bid 4@H in the CR, making with two overs.  CR has finished and we welcome all those who've joined us from in there.|pg||
mb|2C|mb|d|nt|Walddk2: Enormous swings since they must win by at least 37 IMPs|pg||

nt|marlowepi: NS can win big now if they pounce|pg||
nt|thorvald: Interesting - Where did he get that bid from ?|pg||
nt|sfoxa: is 3@c a game? :-)|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|sfoxa: help comes|pg||

nt|sfoxa: pity,Ns missed their chance for first swing - 3@c doubled would have been bloody|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this can make 9 tricks with a good spade guess|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or without, if defence plays a third club|pg||

nt|thorvald: @C back to secure the @C-trick|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E annoyed about 6 of spades in dummy|pg||

nt|roswolf: this might have some interesting goings-on|pg||
nt|monsted: yes but then 2 flat board|pg||
nt|mmmakela: my bet no 3 nt this deal|pg||
nt|ady: n/s need to stay low with their 24 hcp and heart fit|pg||
nt|lestergold: i like taking up in effect the extra space when i have a solid 7 card minor which is too good for a 3 opener|pg||
nt|sharynr: as Mike predicted 8 tricks|pg||

mb|p|nt|mmmakela: another interesting deal|pg||
nt|mmmakela: won't happen|pg||
nt|lestergold: you dont have to curse me in some obscure foreign language  Marshall|pg||
nt|sybarra: now the n/s pessimism will work out for them |pg||
mb|1N|nt|mmmakela: was a 1-hit wonder Sniff n' Tears|pg||
mb|p|nt|christinas: so the last two boards which are not yet scored are both potential good boards for EW|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our match in round 3 (in about 45 minutes) will be Blakset vs BK Nord|pg||
nt|mmmakela: sry priv|pg||
nt|lestergold: i get into trouble on slam hands cos of running out of fingers|pg||
nt|chick: must be tough for slams then :)|pg||
nt|sharynr: once again, an ill-fitting hand|pg||
mb|2C|nt|christinas: the slam and missed game|pg||
nt|sybarra: not exactly the bid E wanted to hear,   |pg||
nt|mmmakela: can they avoid 4 H here|pg||
nt|lestergold: cards are spitting here against E/W could get overboard|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry, crashed. probably best to play for 22 hearts by ruffing high & leading another high trump, as i think mike was implying|pg||
nt|marlowepi: to each his own. thought some of you folks had learned a bit of french since 1066:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: what does that mean? you are a gouty old fool?|pg||
mb|d|nt|marlowepi: and the hearts are so weak they are scarcely worth mentioning. they rank below spades anyway. and you have a good diamond suit which may provide heart discards if you play in ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: clubs, but if you are in hearts u r stuck with them|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mmmakela: wd|pg||
nt|ady: well stopped    |pg||
nt|ady: 3 hearts pushy|pg||
nt|roswolf: i once played a system where 3@C was used instead of 3nt and it did have its successes - 3@C - 7NT WAS ONE|pg||
nt|lestergold: I thought you lot had learned sometihng about an english sense of humour at some point|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well 9 card fit combined 24 hcp and they have chosen a good moment  to vote conservative|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sfoxa: and S has to accept - with points in @d|pg||
nt|ady: you were right Markku    too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: a misfit, W could pass 2@H|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  That could be a championships match - both sides combines bold attitudes with high skills|pg||
nt|lestergold: i was Marshall of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: many would invite w W hand|pg||
nt|pelu: 6@S down on a @C-lead|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  and also on a trump lead|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@H = 4. suit, 3@S = slaminvit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well that would get 7N played from the right side  :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: nah limeys dont have a sense of humour!?|pg||
nt|sybarra: taking advantage of vulnerability here maye to no avail |pg||
mb|p|pc|h4|nt|christinas: no, I think 3@h is too aggressive by W. He has a good hand, but he is vul, so if 2@d shows 5-5 he has already bid his hand once|pg||
nt|lestergold: well two 3 card qs to the umph needs circumspection/ devaluation milton opvervlaues these things|pg||
nt|pelu: West has some very good cards|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry East|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  but may win on a red lead even if trump shift when in on @dA|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Good pass by S and resultantly game missed by EW|pg||
nt|sharynr: sounds like an invitational auction|pg||
nt|chick: another boring partscore|pg||
nt|sharynr: was 2@C alerted?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|marlowepi: not like you merely to imply:)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|christinas: they bid the wrong games at this table, although this could be a fine contract if the @s were not badly placed. Not at all unreasonable|pg||
nt|christinas: Board 6 was a surprising gain for one-eyed. They missed 4@s but at the other table NS were in 3nt without a @d stopper|pg||
nt|sybarra: E is hoping pard brought a trick also |pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think i have been frozen for several minutes|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ady: defence has got off to a good lead     |pg||
nt|sfoxa: good start for defence|pg||
nt|ady: might try a diamond fineese in desperation|pg||
nt|mmmakela: if play strong club it's clear to bid 3 H in nat I'd just bid 2 H, if pd won't make a move then usually ok|pg||
nt|sfoxa: in teams - almost a must|pg||
nt|sfoxa: @d finess i meant|pg||
nt|mmmakela: joo kyllä me vaan ollaan biljardikansaa...|pg||
nt|pelu: it is - 2@C= puppet to 2@D - next bid invitation|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mmmakela: joo tanja sen nokki tyhmä etten vetäny tota kaksaria|pg||
pc|d8|nt|nielsfoged:  "surely not" is not merely implying imo!|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: and we can see that the values on this hand are about zro points|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|rnmalik: I agree|pg||
nt|monsted: BK Nord bid 6 spades in hand 7|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  one @h ruff and 1@h+1@c discard on @dQJ|pg||
nt|pelu: but look at Ns hand - for sure a @C lead|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mmmakela: if not VERY surprised|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  unlucky for EW|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lestergold: zero points for those two holdings|pg||
nt|jcwla: There should be no signaling problem here.|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|ritong: says he when they are playing a 4/2 fit|pg||
nt|sfoxa: polish systems foresee 1nt - 1 round forcing bid -with 4-6 points and fit (for W hand)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: was frustrated had 11|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lestergold: that six of spades is looking very BIG|pg||
nt|lestergold: but declarer doesnt want to use it|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|lestergold: well it is always a danger with thes 50% on a finesse type slams - they are an often foundluck element in team match results|pg||

nt|nielsfoged:  It will be interesting to see the results from all matches of Board  5 - does anyone have the methods to avoid 3 NT and reach 5@d? - Most likely would be the strong 1@c pairs (even better Relay-Precision)|pg||
nt|lestergold: do not understand|pg||
nt|monsted: must be !! ??|pg||
nt|lestergold: two asafe ways to rry for an overtrick and instead tries for one offski and succeeds|pg||
nt|jcwla: W happy to defend 1NT and even happier to defend 3NT if it comes to that.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well surprised me that e/w didnt attack trumps til too late|pg||
mb|1C|nt|pelu: the bidding ask for @S-lead, so N only lead @C if he has a good @C-lead|pg||
nt|mmmakela: but would he lead one from dbltn looking at S's hand|pg||
nt|murat: baþlýyo|pg||
nt|marlowepi: strange play and defense on Bioard 1 in other room. maybe that is why it will count--some sadist wants the details published:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: spades breaking badly makes this a challenge |pg||
nt|marlowepi: hard luck in 4S here|pg||
nt|christinas: some interesting hands here - 4@s is down because of the @s split|pg||
nt|sybarra: in 4 @S I mean |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: did this really take place?|pg||
nt|monsted: looks like a big wictory for BK Nord|pg||
nt|vugraphzyy: he was playing 3 H !!|pg||
nt|sybarra: reminding you that bd 1 is thrown out |pg||
nt|sybarra: X looks like singlesuited bid |pg||
nt|rnmalik: I think we will some action in this board|pg||
nt|rnmalik: see|pg||
nt|lestergold: and 7S of course much better |pg||
nt|sharynr: good point Peter|pg||
mb|1D|nt|marlowepi: presumably this shows a onesuiter|pg||
nt|christinas: no, it is penalty here against weak nt- then he will just bid @s the next round|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: well we did suggest a possibility|pg||
nt|ritong: first, you give up on puppet stayman|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what if there IS no next round and declarer makes 580?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ah he is taking advantage of EW methods|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he is guaranteed a next round|pg||
nt|christinas: then it is bad luck, but as you can see his partner pulls - they D weak nts with 13+|pg||
mb|1N|nt|marlowepi: VG operator said no|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: second, you bid your suits|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  yes but none of the players heard that|pg||
nt|mmmakela: YES peter|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have 25 hcp  and east a good 6 card heart suit   but again likely to go down in game|pg||
mb|2C|nt|rnmalik: simple bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: ah hah that explainis it oyall|pg||
nt|vugraphzyy: he thourght|pg||
nt|monsted: WAS plaing or ? |pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  2@h is probably showing @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: yeh sure we can se that|pg||
mb|2D|nt|christinas: now they may avoid 4@s, that would be sensational to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: and third, if opener is not interested, he comes back to NT at the 4 level|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: weve all done it|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  may end in 4@H   which could be difficult     3NT  looks more likely to make|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Next match in 30 minutes: Blakset vs Århus BK|pg||
nt|ady: clb lead    cuts of trick supply|pg||
nt|marlowepi: probably showing a sounder raise to 2S than a dirct 2S|pg||
nt|lestergold: a very poor game|pg||
nt|lestergold: I thnk West may have downgraded his Qx of hearts on the aucion|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at these colors i would judge the E hand to be very marginal for that action in a 2-way structure, and W also has some soft bits|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  but neither action is a distortion|pg||
nt|marlowepi: where i come from that is a 1H opener. are NS using canape?|pg||
nt|lestergold: i do not follow the logic here why open the shorter suit when you can show the actual distribuition by reversing ith this strength|pg||
nt|christinas: oh my god...870 coming up...|pg||
mb|p|nt|christinas: It works fine in this case, but I would be worried about the 2 little clubs - if I had the same hand with 4333 it is another story|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Pure HCP points 15-17 + 10 and 2 Ts|pg||
nt|ritong: here, opener gladly accepts ( via 4@s) and 5@d is the final contract|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  problem is that most of us do not have a natural @d-bid after 2NT- or 2@c-openings|pg||
nt|rnmalik: so may finesses and 6 makes|pg||
nt|lestergold: but the lead couldnt be more helpful|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  No I just try to find explanation of why he didn't choose the (almost) obvious @c return|pg||
nt|pelu: keep looking :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: can they stay low here?|pg||
nt|christinas: no|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think that mainly in bridge--as in life--we make our own luck. i dont see the advantage of doubling on S hand. if spades are coming in they are running, and if not they could ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: make 2 redoubled overtricks|pg||
nt|christinas: 710?|pg||
nt|pelu: here the Puppet 2@C was used to stop in 2@D|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: still may have difficult making|pg||
nt|sfoxa: looks like first imps for OEJ|pg||
nt|mmmakela: finally 2 imps to OEJ|pg||
nt|sfoxa: and what will N lead?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: i must admit wild horses would nt have ;produced this lead from me|pg||
nt|lestergold: i must learn these sophisticated bidding systems so i can find my three three fits too im so envious|pg||
pc|h4|nt|monsted: another 12 imps to BK Nord in board 8 ! - 6 spades bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm didnt seem to work|pg||
nt|christinas: ok, now!|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|sfoxa: little bit of help comes|pg||
nt|ady: lead ok for declarer|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now might make|pg||
nt|lestergold: i mean strong enough for a jump shift on second round then strong enuf for a reverse|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe S would need a 2-loser hand instead of 3-loser to do that|pg||
nt|sybarra: look like take out of 2 @s but now what?|pg||
nt|christinas: can he pass?|pg||
nt|christinas: now his partner must have shown a weak hand?|pg||
nt|sharynr: tough for N-S to balance but have a chance at 2@H contract|pg||
pc|h3|nt|christinas: W has a huge hand, wonder why he wanted his partner to Rd?|pg||
nt|christinas: Why not bid 2@h?|pg||
nt|sybarra: might be system |pg||
nt|marlowepi: or at least bid 3H over 2S. unless pass-and-pull shows a stronger hand. but then in that case shouldnt the next pass be forcing??|pg||
nt|christinas: anyway, it is hard not to imagine this a good board dor one-eyed. 140 plus|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ritong: mind you, your question was " does anyone have methods..."|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am not sure about this line. if W feels like assuming from the lead that N does not have both top hearts (very reasonable but not guaranteed), then he will have all the rest of ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the artillery. and this lead is surely a singleton. so it seems right toi me to win the ace in dummy and lead a heart to the card of your choice. you cant ruff with spade ace and ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: also use it to draw a trump|pg||
nt|pelu: @cK in trick 2 work better|pg||
nt|christinas: yes, it is strange|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: a club return might have been stronger but the clubs can still be cut off|pg||
nt|ady: west must remove club when in with A@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: west cannot be bl;amed for playing pard for a stifff space|pg||
nt|lestergold: i mjean why on earth would he expect his pard to resolve a qx position against an opp'sbid suit|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  S in open room may not have agreed fully with his partners lead and continuation against 2@s (@cA and @h5 to @hT and @hQ)!|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|mmmakela: good lead although not my choise|pg||
pc|c6|nt|marlowepi: yes this board will be a success story. but sort of an embarrassing one i would think|pg||
nt|sybarra: highly likely the OR will be in 4 @S -1 or 2|pg||
nt|christinas: but of course he hasn't made it yet, the @c don't break|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would be proud to be in 4S down 1 on this hand|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|ritong: i do, and i am not alone|pg||
nt|lestergold: here comes the club?|pg||
nt|roswolf: south needs to take care here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe S wanted to attract a spade lead in case the opps bought it for 3C or something|pg||
nt|pelu: @c10 drop out so decl can plsy @D from dummy|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ady: heart switch best|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hT|nt|lestergold: i think holding strong hand with two boss suirts more important to bid accurately|pg||
nt|lestergold: now declarer is going to get tapped|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lestergold: i mean he better not have any fantasies about promoting trump by playing a spade|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|roswolf: sometimes i do too|pg||
nt|ady: still now a club after A@D ok|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh derar|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c5|nt|nielsfoged:  yes an my bet is that at most 1-2 of the 12 pairs bidding  5 will have that capacity (I actrually expect 12/12 3NT-1)|pg||
nt|ady: squeeze on declarer|pg||
nt|marlowepi: club ace queen and small is marked|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|pg||
nt|jcwla: 9 a push at 2NT-2.|pg||
nt|mmmakela: how to get the 8th|pg||
nt|lestergold: whats the name for a three three trump fit?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|marlowepi: before trumps i meant|pg||
nt|christinas: so unless the defence helps he3 might go down|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mmmakela: still needs to guess clubs I suppose|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lestergold: its not Moysian|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|rnmalik: +1|pg||
nt|sfoxa: now N has to give @h trick - other play is more costly|pg||
nt|mmmakela: surely H 10 now|pg||
nt|ady: might play club|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lestergold: i can understand hiom not expecting partner to hopld six clubs which he might have led from in preference to Qx of spades|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  a 25 imp swing when not returning @c - the other table stayed in 4@s (13 tricks - @d duck to singleton K)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: cant go down with proper play|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s6|nt|ritong: admittedly, on bd 5 west has a decision to make on 3 NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: it coukld be called unburnian|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|roswolf: you might well be right|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s2|nt|lestergold: cos it contradicts burn's law|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jcwla: OR is finished.  Welcome to all who have joined us from in there.|pg||
nt|roswolf: south is in control|pg||
nt|lestergold: burn's law crollary- in the endgame it is better not have less trumops than the  opposition|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lestergold: or it could be called broadmoorian|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mmmakela: S10 now|pg||
nt|christinas: great fun, now he has to play @h otherwise W will be squeezed!|pg||
nt|christinas: apparently he tried to cash the A of @d|pg||
nt|sybarra: the 4 @C on bd 8  another + score as the OR tried to play 6 @C|pg||
nt|vugraphzyy: no west disc a club !|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: well this has turned into a rout|pg||
nt|lestergold: still off tho|pg||
nt|ady: what happened?|pg||

pc|s9|nt|lestergold: for the benfit of non brits broadmoor is britain's fmous litle hostel for the criminally insane|pg||
mc|6|nt|chick: a 3-3 fit was played in an earlier vugraph today and it was called insane-moysian|pg||

mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: No update after rd 10 yet I'm afraid|pg||
mb|3D|nt|thorvald: These pairs have met so many times, latest at the Vinoble Cup 2009, where Graversen-Clemmensen won after being down with almost 70 imps|pg||
nt|benno:  thank you for mentioning :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: lol|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Martin was on the receiving end of that one|pg||
nt|vugraphzyz: BK Nord are leaders by approximately 20VPs|pg||
nt|jcwla: We'll start with 11 and 12 and pick up the comparisons from the CR when we circle back to 1.|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|Walddk2: Th Matias|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|nt|sfoxa: hello, Roland! hi to all!|pg||
nt|thorvald: 5@S = 2 aces and @SQ ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: what is 4NT and 5@S?|pg||
nt|benno:  strange|pg||
nt|vugraphzyz: the expression on Clemmensens face says - 5@s was the wrong bid - concentrate!|pg||
nt|benno:  but he's right|pg||
nt|vugraphzyz: Graversen didn't see it fortunatly enough|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Where did he find @SQ?|pg||
nt|benno:  with partner|pg||
nt|jcwla: Any queen will do. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh, great method|pg||
nt|thorvald: Graversen might just bid 6NT, to protect the @CK now, |pg||
nt|Walddk2: He is bidding partner's hand too|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|thorvald: Thinking pd have 6 spades I think its a nice bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzyz: Clemmensen looks annoyed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the 3D call could obviously work out, but i am not sure that the potential upside outweighs its disadvantages. it is unlikely to prevent EW from finding hearts, attracts the wrong ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lead, and risks luring pd into a phantom save|pg||
nt|sfoxa: but the contract looks better than 6@s|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|dT|pc|d5|pg||
nt|jcwla: I'm with you, Marshall.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: Yes, 6NT is slightly better than 6@S|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: First of all because they can't ruff anything|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and did i mentioned it tells eventual declarer a lot about your hand?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|pc|sQ|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|benno:  I like the 3@d bid. P has passed, its not our board - why not  make it harder for the OPPs|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|c5|pc|d2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am in Martin's camp|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|h8|pg||

nt|roswolf: hmm the 4-4 heart fit not mentioned in the other room|pg||
nt|lestergold: probably a premature attempt to cash clubs for some strange reason|pg||
nt|monsted: last chance for Blakset to get imps|pg||
nt|jcwla: The last two were @S partials in the OR, we'll see what unfolds here.|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  Good result for OEJ in Open|pg||
nt|mmmakela: and some more here?|pg||
nt|lestergold: lucky to get away with it on this particular hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: the ace of clubs in N (stopping clubs once) saved declarer |pg||
nt|lestergold: another suggestion from imaginative spec 9thx by the way) is.... silly|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: what a misfit here|pg||
nt|mmmakela: actually any card was fine|pg||
nt|pelu: so the champs only down 7 after a gift of 25 IMP :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not a big deal, N-S can make 4@C|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 35 to 2 in 10 boards, are outplayed|pg||
nt|mmmakela: meaning after the C K play|pg||
nt|ady: likely to reach 4@S as in OR|pg||
nt|sharynr: finally....a real fit|pg||
nt|pelu: after 1@C - 1@D - 1Nt West exp better @Ds by pd - not 4-4 in major|pg||
mb|1S|nt|nielsfoged:  4@h seems ok|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT or 4@H  both making games for n/s     west may get into some trouble in spades if bidding high|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  5@c|pg||
nt|sfoxa: uh-hu, i wonder, if 6@d bid as attack or defence?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: close to a flat board 100 or 130|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You sure?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: north wondering which major S holds|pg||
nt|roswolf: interesting result from the other rooom but no double no trouble|pg||
mb|2N|nt|monsted: af in OR|pg||
nt|lestergold: well west has stuck neck out a little more conservatively here than in the open room|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I don't think you can make 5|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: at least north didnt open here|pg||
mb|3C|nt|nielsfoged:  no you are right|pg||
nt|lestergold: dont think you can get rid of two spades in south's hand|pg||
nt|pelu: tell us how u make 11 tricks, Niels?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: looks like 3 losers to me|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  sorry|pg||
nt|mmmakela: has pretty good support for both|pg||
nt|mmmakela: needs H lead to beat|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That is the easy part when partner has 5+ spades|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But he may fancy 5@S|pg||
nt|christinas: again a funny result from the other room - NS only bid 4 clubs, and at the other table they were in 6 down 1...|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 4333 8 count,  sort of funny |pg||
nt|christinas: so twice NS in open have been too aggressive, NS too passive - but lucky|pg||
nt|christinas: too slow i am|pg||
mb|3D|nt|rnmalik: NT opening with stiff @SK was the reason in the OR|pg||
nt|roswolf: the offcentre 1nt in the other room didnt work too well|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 43o or so will give 9 imps to Blakset|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Which major to lead against 3NT is the question|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  I will absolutely NOT :)|pg||
nt|pelu: no Niels - u are welcome - now we are the clever ones :):)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: i guess bidding went 1 NT 3NT or something like that|pg||
nt|ady: unusual opening  West|pg||
mb|3S|nt|marlowepi: 3N needs spade lead, good chances|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: do you think 3NT has a chance played by W|pg||
nt|sharynr: maybe they respond a major to 1@C so west denied one?|pg||
nt|sharynr: 6NT from east is best spot|pg||
nt|sharynr: thanks to the diamond Q|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i fear that OEJ's chances ar going to nosedive seriously unless they too bid the making slam in either spader or no trumps as cards lie|pg||
nt|sharynr: (and @CA onside :))|pg||
nt|lestergold: played by east spade slam is enormous and no trump slam good|pg||
nt|lestergold: played by west it all depends on ace club position 50 /50ish|pg||
nt|lestergold: today they had just better bid either played by either|pg||
nt|sharynr: well if they lead a club, at least west has the Jack!|pg||
mb|4N|nt|cindy:  what was opening 2@c on 8    the hand was pretty similiar to this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: simple auction here|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and correct|pg||
nt|ritong: oh we have the two rooms today, so we have auctions|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: wd N|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S looks a long way away now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: cold|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yep|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|ady: maybe not|pg||
mb|6S|nt|rnmalik: marked difference in bidding as compared with OR|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 3 nt better than 4 S|pg||
nt|christinas: well done|pg||
mb|p|nt|nielsfoged:  No one took your bet on 1NT-3NT, Henry?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: 1 more to go, ty all and hope see u tomorrow!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: an uncomfortable but logical 3N bid. partner has a very strong hand and very likely to catch a heart honor|pg||
nt|christinas: strange not to bid 2@dby W in the ogther room instead of supporting @s right away|pg||
nt|christinas: you have 7 of them|pg||
mb|p|pc|dT|nt|ritong: we did not yesterday|pg||
nt|ritong: no:(|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  not so easy to get the tempo, maybe would have been best chance to let the @c go?|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  (looks easy from here|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ady: Jepson did not ruff 3rd spade high enough on hand 10    got overruffed and East played a club   hence the result of 2 down|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you mean you would show 7 decent diamonds before supporting on a small doubleton, christina? how retro of you:):)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mmmakela: this has straight 4 losers|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|sfoxa: but anyway - 4 imps for OEJ|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good defense|pg||
nt|ady: North will cash the 2 aces|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|nielsfoged:  back in tempo now?|pg||
nt|ritong: but if @d AK are not with @c Q, defense can certainly establish a @c, so your option looks better|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 6 IMPs I think|pg||
nt|ady: sit back and wait for 2 trump tricks|pg||
pc|s2|nt|nielsfoged:  they go on stealing imps|pg||
nt|mmmakela: ok last 1 coming up|pg||
nt|christinas: I assume it is because Peter Schaltz knows his wife is a better declarer than himself|pg||
nt|christinas: the worst is that @h block, but W doesn't know that...|pg||
nt|christinas: so he probably ducks one time|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|sybarra: this will play nicely |pg||
nt|sybarra: that lead didnt hurt |pg||

nt|jcwla: Hmm -- this is a light action.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|benno:  but they are behind and need swing|pg||

nt|jcwla: Hmm...East's pass surprising.|pg||
nt|benno:  well EW are cold for game|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is not a standard 2@C overcall vulnerable as Martin said|pg||
nt|benno:  or actually 6@h|pg||
nt|thorvald: EW are not gonna be happy after this :) - But its no big loss|pg||
nt|sfoxa: vulnerable 3 down - doubtful reason to smile, isn't?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Walddk2: I am told that BK Nord need 7 VPs to be certain of winning the championship|pg||
nt|benno:  so if this is not too expensive it worked out well|pg||
nt|thorvald: 4 down, and a couple of imps out|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|pc|h9|pc|hT|pg||
nt|sfoxa: E can well suppose to be only one spade holder for EW |pg||
nt|marlowepi: for me W has a clear value bid of 4H over 2H, so this aklternative approach suggests to me that she was afraid 4S might be making, but that seems paranoid to me|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|d8|pc|d5|pc|d9|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: So OEJ knows that they need to win by at least 24-6 to overtake Nord. That's why we will see some non-traditional bids, and perhaps anti-percentage plays|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c4|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|s2|pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
nt|thorvald: How many imps is 24-6 ?|pg||

nt|sfoxa: so, the evening promises to be hot|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cT|pc|cQ|nt|marlowepi: well, if EW are going to sell to 3S on their holdings, maybe NS dont need to roam too far from normal actions|pg||

nt|Walddk2: We have an update ....|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub6/Turneringer/KampResultat642.html|pg||

nt|roswolf: Niels Aagaard) for ensuring that this fine event is brought to BBO vugraph. Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentators Henri, Niels, Rashed and Roland for their wit and ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: perceptive comments and to our specs whose contributions keep us on our toes!|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  too much work in 4@s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4H down 1 a good save against 3N making on wrong lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe they start that way with 18-19 bal|pg||
nt|cindy:  yeh but she opened 1@d on 11|pg||
nt|lestergold: another dull 3n|pg||
nt|sfoxa: yes, 6 - I was wrong with counting:- 200 - 50 (not 300 - as it is).|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 27 IMPs = 22-8 VPs|pg||
nt|mmmakela: thx to Tom our splendid operator, Sveta and Rashed and all u kibs!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub6/Turneringer/KampResultat638.html  for results and standings after round 6|pg||
nt|ady: next hand the last of the set     thx all thx kibs|pg||
nt|roswolf: pooor decision that|pg||
nt|sharynr: how to get to 3@S?!?!|pg||
mb|1H|nt|roswolf: this hand was fun in the other room|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But 11 was not balanced|pg||
nt|roswolf: last board now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: last board thanks all, but more coming soon|pg||
nt|chick: here is a chance for a big OEJ pickup|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|sharynr: OEJ went down 400|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 11 was 2-2 in major|pg||
mb|3D|nt|nielsfoged:  always difficult to play in 4th suit|pg||
nt|ady: seems 3@H has a play    went down in OR|pg||
nt|mmmakela: ty Tom our splendid operator, David,Sveta,kibs!|pg||
nt|sfoxa: seems, they finish with quiet partscore, like in OR|pg||
nt|ady: likely to  be a similar contract as OR    looks like a narrow win for Storeslemmen|pg||
nt|sybarra: back in about 10 minutes or so |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: this is last board of this set '|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 27 IMPs = 22-8 VPs at this point. Last board of the match now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks to Tom Nørgaard, our splendid operator in Århus|pg||
nt|ady: 8 tricks looks ok in spades|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and to our commentators: David, Mike, Nils and Markku|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  actually I think Knut did well to be just 1 down in 3@h|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  and 3rd hand with 18 incl Qx|pg||
nt|sybarra: not easy to stay out of 4 @H here |pg||
nt|sybarra: no matter what method you ue|pg||
nt|sybarra: *use|pg||
nt|chick: oops, right :)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk4: Rømer is not giving up|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our last match in about 15 minutes: One-Eyed Jacks vs BK Nord, 2nd against 1st. You can't ask for better timing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would be wanting this played by W. if no transfers, i would bid stayman hoping to get lucky. worst case scenario bid 4H later|pg||
mb|p|nt|christinas: I think a welldeserved victory to Århus|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  3NT?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3@S surely|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Thanks all, this should be a flat board.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Next match in 20 minutes: Storeslemmen vs One-Eyed Jacks|pg||
nt|mmmakela: this shd be flat|pg||
nt|roswolf: lots of tricks now|pg||
nt|sharynr: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: Many thanks, to our excellent operator Tom Nørgaard.   .A job well done!|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  ..to be honest I never actually succeeded in that|pg||
nt|sfoxa: hm...|pg||
mb|p|nt|christinas: the missed slam and game made the big difference|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks also to my co commentator Rashed and Christiana. We appreciate your time, your insights |pg||
nt|rnmalik: Board 7 and 8 damaging for NS|pg||
nt|sybarra: Our gratitude to the Danish Bridge Federation and Jeppe G. Knappe and Niels Aagaard for bringing this wonderful tourney to BBO.  Much appreciated by bridge fans all over the world|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks also to our specs who give us helpful comments and some humor!|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but maybe they can manage it|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  minors are too awful|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  ...for 4@s|pg||
nt|ritong: talking about that, the problem arises when opàener has a big hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think there is a case for passing here|pg||
nt|ritong: and can t raise @ss too high|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  that would be a well-deserved 13 imps|pg||
nt|ritong: because it is 4th suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: may try 2nt|pg||
nt|ritong: a possibility is he uses an " impossible" 3@h bid|pg||
nt|ritong: to show 4@s and strong|pg||
nt|cindy:  i guess there is 1 card diff|pg||
nt|mmmakela: bye all see ya in 20 mins|pg||
nt|mmmakela: btw Storeslemmen=grand slam in danish|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe E wanted to shut out spades, but the relevance of that is only hypothetical. the desirability of right-siding 4H is under your nose|pg||
nt|lestergold: well the bidding was broadmoor|pg||
nt|chick: I confuse easily :)|pg||
nt|sharynr: but might pick up 2 imps anyway :)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sybarra: PS   Special thanks to Roland for his tireless efforts organizing the vugraph!|pg||
nt|lestergold: the interesting point here is the issue of overtricks|pg||
nt|cindy:  you dont like my boring questions ?   :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|roswolf: intersesting henri|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  a little easier to pass when non-vuln|pg||
nt|mmmakela: The play will resume 9.30 Danish time tomorrow(remember to adjust your clocks for winter time!)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, but we have one more match today, Markku|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In 20 minutes|pg||
nt|ady: north must have presumed 4 carfds in clubs for the 1NT response|pg||
pc|sK|nt|nielsfoged:  wd EW|pg||
nt|roswolf: but a good stop|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good a misfit and well assessed|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  good lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  could he be 1 down?|pg||
nt|monsted: 4 spades looks like a winner|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR @S from N - decl played 3x@s and was endplayed in dummy - @h's blocked|pg||
nt|christinas: this will make now - only 3 losers|pg||
nt|sybarra: may take the club hook now |pg||
nt|pelu: to make u have to play @C in trick 3 - and do right|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You assume he will guess clubs, Christina|pg||
nt|sybarra: I do  |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Pessimist :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sfoxa: and why not 5 in diamonds? with 5332 split? |pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|jcwla: Well, as we approach the end of this segment, a big thank you to Roland Wald, to our excellent operator Tom, to Mike, Nils and all specs.  I'll be back with you in 22-1/2 hours for ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: the 11th RR segment.|pg||
nt|christinas: yes I do, because otherwise he has to hope @h are 2-2|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|lestergold: can west develop an overtrick in clubs safely?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: seems better to play queen and lead a club if it holds|pg||
nt|lestergold: double dummy eay|pg||
nt|lestergold: easy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No, he doesn't have the entries|pg||
nt|pelu: he can try - but after @Dagain - no chance|pg||
nt|ady: this might be a swing for east west|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk4: Rødovre vs One-Eyed Jacks|pg||
nt|mmmakela: oops some excitement after all|pg||
nt|sfoxa: no more - with this lead|pg||
nt|pelu: is D? Dorte or dennis?|pg||
nt|christinas: Dennis|pg||
nt|sharynr: might even make 6|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mmmakela: ok sry was concerned ab time change|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|nielsfoged:  defense: like brothers in arms |pg||
nt|roswolf: i think an overtrick is more likely|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  at least 7 tricks, but...|pg||
nt|po-s: west might continue with diamonds|pg||
nt|lestergold: broadmoor i remind as spec has asked is where we send our criminally insane|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He can advance @C9 now, but then he can't play on clubs any more|pg||
nt|pelu: but DD he can|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Anything is possible with all cards in view|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Dorthe was always going to make 5|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Walddk4: Don't worry, you can sleep one hour more :)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|nielsfoged:  but OK those @c's are prettyu high|pg||
nt|ady: general opinion 3@H should go down    not an easy contract    but I think it is makable if going up with K@C first round|pg||
pc|h2|nt|po-s: too late|pg||
nt|sfoxa: let's imagine, S doesn't play @c ace in the first round of suit|pg||
nt|sfoxa: yes,  they can get 2 ruffs now  |pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks likerun for home|pg||
nt|pelu: homerun or run for home :)|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|cindy:  that's all folks|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk4: 6 IMPs to OEJ but 16-14 VPs to Åkirkeby|pg||
pc|dK|nt|nielsfoged:  ...tricky!|pg||
nt|roswolf: why not overuff|pg||
nt|ritong: operator s miss, clearly  lets wait for the claim|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks to Tom, Peter and Markku|pg||
nt|sharynr: so 2 imps it is|pg||
pc|dA|nt|nielsfoged:  ty all|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 9 IMPs = 17-13 VPs|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks all and good night|pg||
nt|lestergold: good night all |pg||
nt|lestergold: hen one partner is trying to invite the men in whire coatds to the table its bad enough when its compounded by partner adding his own invitation well...|pg||
mc|12|nt|sharynr: thanks to all for watching|pg||
