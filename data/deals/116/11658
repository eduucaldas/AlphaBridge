pc|c5|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome|pg||
nt|jcwla: E would probably double at matchpoints, but at IMPS penalty doubles into game should be made only if confident of setting the contract (some say by 2 tricks).|pg||

nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub6/Turneringer/KampResultat635.html  for results and standings after round 3|pg||
nt|monsted: this is 4 spades - but with this weak opening they will go too high I think|pg||
nt|jcwla: A Rule of 20 opener here and this seems to be the rare right time for a trump lead.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Singleton trump lead that is.|pg||
nt|lestergold: work to deo to get at ten tricks but opps even with trump lead cannot get enough trump plays in|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
nt|cindy:  was it a risk   i guess i should have been paying attention :-)|pg||
nt|snorris:  I guess q of @s|pg||

mb|1N|nt|ady: 20 pts eac h this time|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: will NS find it|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Yep|pg||
nt|snorris:  as if west MIGHT come in .|pg||
mb|p|nt|christinas: EW play weak NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 5 spades 2 dims a heart and two club ruffs is ten tricks what if south ducks a diamond lead towards dummy?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Wow.|pg||
nt|lestergold: At unfavourable vulnerability??|pg||
nt|lestergold: is south colour blind?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the Schaltz team name is also the title of an outstanding Western from late 50s or early 60s starring Marlon Brando and Karl Malden|pg||
nt|lestergold: E/W playing a weak no trump?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sybarra: no transfer, interesting  |pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  Youth displays courage|pg||
nt|lestergold: obviously|pg||
nt|snorris:  very popular in Denmark|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  Again: @cQ behind J for winning 3NT - so now it is proven 100%|pg||
pc|h5|nt|roswolf: 4@S IS AN INSPIRED CHOICE|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  ...and will become older|pg||
nt|lestergold: its youth|pg||
nt|lestergold: well doube dummy there are 9 tricks available in 3N |pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: Japenese?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: not much chance of this making  |pg||
nt|lestergold: kamikaze trained|pg||
nt|mmmakela: for englishorientated audience EW team name is quite exotic|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ady: club values bad for declarer|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  ...and richer|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh my west has let vul opps off hook|pg||
nt|monsted: Dennis is normaly very solid - despice of Junior|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ritong: first board was a clue about north s style|pg||
nt|lestergold: and 11 tricks i think is a distance too far|pg||
nt|jcwla: This sure looks like the time for a double by W.  E appears to have wasted @C values and W has the reds locked up, no comprendo.|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|christinas: unpleasant to balance for NS, but they can make 3@c|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ritong: brutal.|pg||
nt|lestergold: on this defence a lot of tricks available |pg||
pc|d6|nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
nt|ady: likely 2 down|pg||
nt|lestergold: look at the mountain that south had offered|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: the children would have to be sent to bed early|pg||
nt|lestergold: and south was warned by the splinter that clubs were NOT breaking|pg||
nt|lestergold: well nmot the sharpestr defence ive ever seen |pg||
nt|lestergold: so far that is|pg||
nt|vugraphzyy: 4 cl = void|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Weak NT has its advantages aswell|pg||
pc|c5|nt|pelu: 2@H = 4. suit - tto strong for direct 4@S - but 3@S is in my book and overbid - 4.suit + 4@S is the hand!|pg||
pc|c8|nt|roswolf: well with a bit of luck on their side they are formidable|pg||
pc|cK|nt|marlowepi: given that you dont really want S on lead, i predict 4 club tricks|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|jcwla: If West's splinter showed the void -- then it's incomprehensible.  If not, then the Rule of 20 opener combined with W's feeling of still having hidden extra values and a possible ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: slam at least makes it comprehensible, though still not my choice...|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|pelu: 4.suit + 4@s = mild slaminvit , 4.suit + 3@S = strong slam invit|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ady: +200 should be a useful score for e/w on a non event hand|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h9|nt|lestergold: am i seeing things|pg||
nt|lestergold: how many tricks has south given away to declarer?|pg||
nt|jcwla: 6 to Blakset on 1, while their N/S failed by 2 in 3@C here, their E/W failed by 3 in 3NT in the OR.|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h8|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|jcwla: Enough that this is now coming home.|pg||
nt|lestergold: in spite of south';s best efforts to give his oppos an early xmas one way or the other, declarer shgould still be left with an inescapable club loser|pg||

nt|roswolf: a hand of promise now|pg||
nt|ady: e/w may end in 4@s  going down|pg||
nt|jcwla: In the OR, E passed, S opened 1@D, and the contract is a quiet 4@S.|pg||
nt|pelu: No Martin is not - the team is from the Copenhagen Club One-Eyed Jacks - a club with 16 teams - only playing teams (and a few IMP-pair)|pg||
mb|p|nt|monsted: yes this could give som action|pg||
nt|lestergold: and sharp defence could threaten 4S|pg||

nt|monsted: 3 clubs non vul is not much here|pg||
nt|ady: this will not be a success|pg||
nt|lestergold: 9 top tricks 3n|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  but somewhat Roland style|pg||
nt|jcwla: An overtrick IMP on 2 as 4@S made on the dot.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lestergold: but with such a thin spade guard may be difficult to bid now|pg||
nt|mmmakela: w might bid 3 nt now|pg||
nt|lestergold: potential here for e/w to get overboard|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: not any more lol|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ritong: east took a risk doubling 1@s|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @S lead by N|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: he wanted to show his @h xxxx, we guess$|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: i might have called again as east|pg||
nt|monsted: pass in North ?? - should have bid 4 spades I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: looks down 4   -400|pg||
nt|mmmakela: u like Dorthe's bids Peter?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: best defence this is one off i fear|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ritong: but the scenario was relatively predictable with his @s single|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  but in 6@c do not play on double finesse - which would be rather natural after the 2@s bid|pg||
nt|jcwla: I would also open 1@C with West but a minority of players might choose something else.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 4s lucky to go obly three off reverse the heart honours and its 4 off|pg||
nt|lestergold: I dont think in an imps game its good business to o for such a potentially expensive save- especially when the game doesnt always make|pg||
nt|lestergold: it does here and it would profit but nothing to write home about|pg||
nt|monsted: not a safe - but to make it difficult for EW to make the rigth decision|pg||
nt|snorris:  credit to east for threding carefully|pg||
nt|lestergold: but makes now on the lead|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sybarra: and overboard they went |pg||
nt|cindy:  might not make 3@h even   oops  that lead helps the cause|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ritong: so, if the system allows it, i think that bidding @ds immediately is more sound|pg||
nt|ritong: and, if pard has @hs, it will be good for @d trump as well|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: not an easy lead i must admit but my choice would have been a passive club when the bididnmg shows the contract is likely to be tight|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rnmalik: Thought so, Shirley:) 2@H and 3@C discouraging bids but even then|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Did he really make 4 overtricks on board 2?|pg||
nt|lestergold: not possiblem Roland|pg||
nt|cindy:  think so|pg||
nt|lestergold: must have lost the AD at the end|pg||
nt|vugraphzyy: sr - no 10 tricks|pg||
nt|snorris:  must have been operators mistake|pg||
nt|lestergold: having already lost two hearts|pg||
pc|s3|nt|monsted: no 4 down - I would have bid 4 spades om E - strange not to|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: there is some equity in it but north apart form spade support has a working yarboroug in tnhe side suits|pg||
nt|cindy:  on the lead  there is a tiny inference that S might have doubled 2@d|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|cT|pc|c2|pg||
nt|rnmalik: absolutely correct Henri bidding 2 @D would not hurt|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i think leading away from an unsupported Q is an unnecessary risk on this bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: and it cost as we have seen|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: wet is picking  up so big hands|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Board 2 corrected|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|christinas: most players would bid either an artificial 2nt to show @s support and GF or 4@h to show a void|pg||

nt|marlowepi: seem dynamic -- if pd has nothing there u havent done much for your side, and if you are hoping to find an honor in partner's hand, why not look for it in a suit where it can do ...|pg||

nt|mmmakela: how can u pass as E?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lestergold: what on earth is east up to why is he slamming with 1 flattish points hios pard has not promised extras|pg||
nt|pelu: very aggressiv X by West - spec with @CK in front of the @C-opening|pg||
mb|3D|nt|cindy:  W isn't shy|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ady: this may well be a swing against Blakset|pg||
nt|lestergold: 13|pg||
mb|p|nt|nielsfoged:  optimal contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: well some excitement any way|pg||
nt|rnmalik: very strang last hand E had better @D and he DBLED and now he has better @H and bids 2@D|pg||
nt|mmmakela: if W promises his cards|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 1820|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Board is cancelled. One player, accidentally, saw a card belong to N and one belonging to E|pg||
nt|mmmakela: could even call it foolish|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Board 1 that is|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well sanity has crept back in here|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, E does have some extras, but predictably W's reasonable 4@D was based partially on distribution.  At some point they recognized this.|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes butnoslam going extras|pg||
nt|lestergold: enough to make 11 tricks a proposition|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1NT +2 in this room|pg||
nt|pelu: I agre Markku - I also hate specs with "no name"|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Well, I think E's sequence was reasonable, show some extras (slam is possible opp some 4@D hands there), then pull back.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: my principle against suit part scores where there is unlikely to be anything to spare is to not get busy |pg||
nt|snorris:  this should make|pg||
nt|lestergold: communications between the defnders are fotunately not too ood|pg||
nt|lestergold: good|pg||
nt|cindy:  would have been easy with a @d lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: somewhat odd silence on first round by N, who is usually a forward bidder|pg||
nt|snorris:  yes..a good 4 card suit|pg||
nt|snorris:  in @hs|pg||
nt|lestergold: i overcall a heart on first round in case my partner is on lead and other reasons|pg||
nt|cindy:  now will declarer think its possible for W to have singleton @d ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W bidding would be 100% for me if NV, but vul more questionable. could go for several hundred against nothing even undoubled, and possession of spades may buy you time--less urgent ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: to bid first round|pg||
nt|cindy:  he can always get rid of losing @d later but might not realize there is no hurry|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: Hi olks sorry late |pg||

pc|h8|pc|h5|pc|hA|nt|lestergold: but lets bearin miond that making 5d here does depend on everything behaving reasonably well|pg||

pc|sT|nt|ritong: i will spare you my usual titade about raptor:)|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|lestergold: the risks of NOT biodding with north's hand are arguably much greater|pg||
nt|snorris:  very clever..|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ritong: if you want a possible solution to these problems, just google " raptor"|pg||

nt|mmmakela: himike|pg||
pc|s6|nt|pelu: some spects tell me: tto kind with peter Schaltz - the X is not only aggressiv - but bad bridge! OK:)|pg||

nt|nielsfoged:  It will be interesting to see the results from all matches of Board  5 - does anyone have the methods to avoid 3 NT and reach 5@d? - Most likely would be the strong 1@c pairs (even better Relay-Precision)|pg||
nt|lestergold: do not understand|pg||
nt|monsted: must be !! ??|pg||
nt|lestergold: two asafe ways to rry for an overtrick and instead tries for one offski and succeeds|pg||
nt|jcwla: W happy to defend 1NT and even happier to defend 3NT if it comes to that.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: the bidding ask for @S-lead, so N only lead @C if he has a good @C-lead|pg||
nt|mmmakela: but would he lead one from dbltn looking at S's hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: did this really take place?|pg||
nt|monsted: looks like a big wictory for BK Nord|pg||
nt|vugraphzyy: he was playing 3 H !!|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|ritong: well we did suggest a possibility|pg||
nt|ritong: first, you give up on puppet stayman|pg||
mb|2H|an|good 2 spade|mb|p|nt|ritong: second, you bid your suits|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  yes but none of the players heard that|pg||
nt|mmmakela: YES peter|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rnmalik: simple bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: ah hah that explainis it oyall|pg||
nt|vugraphzyy: he thourght|pg||
nt|monsted: WAS plaing or ? |pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  2@h is probably showing @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: yeh sure we can se that|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: and third, if opener is not interested, he comes back to NT at the 4 level|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: weve all done it|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  may end in 4@H   which could be difficult     3NT  looks more likely to make|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Next match in 30 minutes: Blakset vs Århus BK|pg||
nt|ady: clb lead    cuts of trick supply|pg||
nt|marlowepi: probably showing a sounder raise to 2S than a dirct 2S|pg||
nt|lestergold: a very poor game|pg||
nt|lestergold: I thnk West may have downgraded his Qx of hearts on the aucion|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at these colors i would judge the E hand to be very marginal for that action in a 2-way structure, and W also has some soft bits|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  but neither action is a distortion|pg||
pc|s6|nt|christinas: It works fine in this case, but I would be worried about the 2 little clubs - if I had the same hand with 4333 it is another story|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Pure HCP points 15-17 + 10 and 2 Ts|pg||
nt|ritong: here, opener gladly accepts ( via 4@s) and 5@d is the final contract|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  problem is that most of us do not have a natural @d-bid after 2NT- or 2@c-openings|pg||
nt|rnmalik: so may finesses and 6 makes|pg||
nt|lestergold: but the lead couldnt be more helpful|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  No I just try to find explanation of why he didn't choose the (almost) obvious @c return|pg||
nt|pelu: keep looking :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: still may have difficult making|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|lestergold: i must admit wild horses would nt have ;produced this lead from me|pg||
pc|h9|nt|monsted: another 12 imps to BK Nord in board 8 ! - 6 spades bid|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|ritong: mind you, your question was " does anyone have methods..."|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am not sure about this line. if W feels like assuming from the lead that N does not have both top hearts (very reasonable but not guaranteed), then he will have all the rest of ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the artillery. and this lead is surely a singleton. so it seems right toi me to win the ace in dummy and lead a heart to the card of your choice. you cant ruff with spade ace and ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: also use it to draw a trump|pg||
nt|pelu: @cK in trick 2 work better|pg||
pc|c8|nt|lestergold: a club return might have been stronger but the clubs can still be cut off|pg||
nt|ady: west must remove club when in with A@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: west cannot be bl;amed for playing pard for a stifff space|pg||
nt|lestergold: i mjean why on earth would he expect his pard to resolve a qx position against an opp'sbid suit|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  S in open room may not have agreed fully with his partners lead and continuation against 2@s (@cA and @h5 to @hT and @hQ)!|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mmmakela: good lead although not my choise|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||

nt|lestergold: here comes the club?|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lestergold: i mean he better not have any fantasies about promoting trump by playing a spade|pg||
pc|dK|nt|roswolf: sometimes i do too|pg||
nt|ady: still now a club after A@D ok|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh derar|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  yes an my bet is that at most 1-2 of the 12 pairs bidding  5 will have that capacity (I actrually expect 12/12 3NT-1)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|jcwla: 9 a push at 2NT-2.|pg||

pc|hT|nt|lestergold: i can understand hiom not expecting partner to hopld six clubs which he might have led from in preference to Qx of spades|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  a 25 imp swing when not returning @c - the other table stayed in 4@s (13 tricks - @d duck to singleton K)|pg||

nt|roswolf: hmm the 4-4 heart fit not mentioned in the other room|pg||
nt|lestergold: probably a premature attempt to cash clubs for some strange reason|pg||
nt|monsted: last chance for Blakset to get imps|pg||
nt|jcwla: The last two were @S partials in the OR, we'll see what unfolds here.|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: what a misfit here|pg||
nt|mmmakela: actually any card was fine|pg||
nt|pelu: so the champs only down 7 after a gift of 25 IMP :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not a big deal, N-S can make 4@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|nielsfoged:  4@h seems ok|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT or 4@H  both making games for n/s     west may get into some trouble in spades if bidding high|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  5@c|pg||
mb|1D|nt|pelu: close to a flat board 100 or 130|pg||

mb|p|nt|monsted: af in OR|pg||

nt|nielsfoged:  sorry|pg||
