nt|yo_yo: they might bid this 20 point game though|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2D|mb|4H|nt|athene: The Law Of Total Tricks is far out here - NS have 11 hearts and only make 8 tricks; EW have a double fit and can't make anything themselves.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they can make game if they get @D right|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D is diamonds + major; West will perhaps bid 4@S now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now they will|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah but is that asptro again?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzh: I think so|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: Close decision for West; he has 6 defensive HCP in the rounded suits and the @SA is useful defensively too.|pg||
nt|vugraphzzh: No - woolsey|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|viren169: Hi David|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: around 9 or 10 tricks in d iamonds for e/w|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|viren169: Looks like all the specs have gone to the YC and watch it live!|pg||

pc|s5|pc|hA|nt|viren169: No fireworks on the 1st hand...|pg||
pc|h6|pg||

mb|1C|mb|1H|mb|d|an|4+ !S|mb|3C!|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|athene: double showing 4+ spades rather than precisely four, as in traditional methods|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|athene: the idea is you use 1@S as t/o without sapdes|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|athene: which is necessary when 1@C can be very loose|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: Also you tend to put the overcaller on lead more, which is usually preferable|pg||
nt|yo_yo: North shows a mixed raise  here,  is that 8-10 with 4@S or thereabouts?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 4@H i mean|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 3@C is 4-card heart raise with some vague number of points, i assume|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hQ|pc|h7|pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
nt|athene: a 7-loser hand is quite aggressive to bid 4@H on facing a mixed raise|pg||
nt|athene: Perhaps Rosen was hoping to push Robson into a phantom 4@S sac.|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well it's a lot of points  and yes  some of that too|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|pc|dT|pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: the battle of hearts vs. spades can get quite interesting - if you know your opponents will "always" bids 4@S over 4@H, you can happily bid doomed 4@H contracts on very defensive ...|pg||
nt|athene: hands and then swing the axe of judgement happily when they bid 4@S|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes a good point |pg||
nt|vugraphzzh: no reason to assume it in this auction though surely|pg||
nt|athene: and if opponents know you are capable of such unsporting behaviour, they might back down a bit and fail to bid 4@S when it's actually right|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i assume 4@H was bid to make|pg||

mb|1C!|mb|1H|nt|viren169: All the way to 4H by Victor?|pg||
mb|1S!|an|5+ !s's|nt|ady: another heart contract for n/s    defence should be able to take 4 trick|pg||
mb|3C|mb|d|nt|viren169: Maybe not...|pg||
nt|viren169: a few undos!|pg||
nt|viren169: I cant believe Chris/Victor are playing a complicated system... so early on in the day!|pg||
nt|vugraphzzg: lots of Q s from Carroll|pg||
nt|ady: 4@C and 4@D  may hav e been some sort of cu bids    perhaps the opening could be stronger than it is|pg||
nt|viren169: Carroll is just waiting to see where they end up before trying 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: this  a pre-empt I think in either major|pg||
nt|viren169: This cant be happening!|pg||
mb|3D|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|viren169: couldnt wait to find out!|pg||
mb|p|pc|c7|nt|viren169: 5@S is a lucky make...|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S  can make as they lay   but not more  because of the force in hearts and 4 trumps in one hand|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|hT|pc|h3|pc|s3|pg||
nt|dburn: he ought to have been aggressive sooner|pg||
nt|dburn: if he had bid 4@h over 1@s, there would have been considerable pressure on West to bid 4@s|pg||

mb|2S!|an|weak|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: what's the 2@S?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: a weak 2 or a weak 2 suiter?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzh: just weak|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|yo_yo: are there any car mechanics out there to tell me how to get my car key out of the ignition?|pg||
nt|athene: Turn the engine off?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzh: to get the BAM VP you need 20 total points|pg||
nt|yo_yo: done that :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzh: Are you commentating whilst driving - impressive Kath!|pg||
nt|athene: declarer only has 8 tricks and ideally he wants to lose the lead to east first|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|athene: so usually you would prefer to take the diamond finesse before knocking out the spade|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: but that's just not really convenient here|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: Now if East clears the clubs, you just hope the @DK is right.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|cA|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h2|pc|sT|pc|s8|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: There's also the possibility of a throw-in against East if he does have the @DK|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h8|pc|h6|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h5|nt|athene: cash @SQJ throwing hearts from hand; if East wants to keep three clubs and @DKx you lead to @HA and throw him in with the @C9|pg||
pc|h9|nt|yo_yo: now  @D and cross fingers|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|d6|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|h3|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|nt|athene: right; he is just going for the straightfoward finesse, which must be better odds|pg||

pc|dT|pc|c8|pc|d8|pc|d7|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hQ|pc|hT|pc|h7|pg||
mc|11|nt|athene: a 10-point difference doesn't count as a win in the BAM, though does it?|pg||

nt|dburn: as it was, by fiddling around with some "mixed raise" or other, he gave both opponents a chance to describe their hands better|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|dburn: and decide to defend|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C!|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|viren169: p/s hand now... agressive 3@D by Carroll|pg||
nt|ady: I think a heart lead indicated Gas  if 3NT shows a solid major and opps are playing spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: 2@d bad weak two in a major|pg||
nt|dburn: 4@c please transfer to your major|pg||

mb|2D|mb|2H|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: North passes 2@S and awaits the t/o double...|pg||
nt|yo_yo: another 20-20 hand  |pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: Super-accepting with only three hearts was costly in the other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzzh: winning finesses aren't so evenly distributed though :)|pg||
nt|athene: the "free" finesse doesn't help declarer here|pg||
nt|athene: he must win @CA and lead to the @CJ if he wants three club tricks|pg||
nt|yo_yo: does that low @C promise an honour,  usually does|pg||
nt|athene: certainly not impossible; give south a big heart and north has to have everything else for his double|pg||
nt|vugraphzzh: if sure about the C4 he might do that I suppose|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|pc|cA|pg||
nt|athene: i don't know; many people lead small from xxx|pg||
nt|athene: Robson did on board 1, for instance|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: @D3 from @D653|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pc|s4|pg||
nt|yo_yo: aka MUD |pg||
nt|vugraphzzh: not NS method though|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hated leads but sometimes nothing else |pg||
nt|athene: I am not a huge fan of MUD although it's pretty popular in England|pg||
nt|athene: i prefer to lead small to tell partner i have three, or high and tell him i haven't got an honour|pg||
nt|athene: rather than lead some indeterminate six and watch him look at it in puzzlement|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cT|pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|pc|h7|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|yo_yo: me just the opposite, i like small to tell me about honours and hi to show nothing|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h2|pc|s3|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|hQ|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pc|s7|pc|s5|pg||
nt|athene: declarer loses trump control but it doesn't matter as north runs out of hearts|pg||
nt|athene: declarer eventually comes to a diamond, for one down|pg||
nt|athene: a good hand for the Law - EW make 7 tricks in their 7-card fit; NS made 8 tricks in their 8-card fit|pg||

nt|aupillon: Hello all|pg||

nt|aupillon: some 4 @s but with some trobles. Play has to be very accurate|pg||
nt|ady: this might be another good result for YC|pg||
nt|dburn: because he had shown 4+ spades with his negative double, and he had six of them|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: oh, he only has six, he isn't opening 3@C at these colours :)|pg||
mb|p|pc|d7|nt|athene: but he has no way to come in over 1NT|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|dA|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: as a passed hand you can use double artificially so you should be able to show all 1- and 2- suiters at the 2-level|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|pc|cQ|pc|c4|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|cJ|pc|c9|pg||
nt|athene: it's vital to bid after 1NT P P because partner is never going to hit your suit on opening lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: too dangerous to bid 3@C at red, surely|pg||
nt|athene: yes, you can't bid at the 3-level, for sure|pg||
nt|athene: but he should have some way to get into 2@C on the second round?|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|nt|athene: an interesting issue here of defensive strategy - if you have no entry, should you go ahead and clear your suit or not?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: surely it's still asptro |pg||
nt|athene: the problem is, if you don't, you have told declarer you have no entry|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes always a dilemma|pg||
nt|vugraphzzh: 2C would be clubs and a major|pg||
nt|athene: of course the @H10 might be an entry if declarer plays @HQ, heart and robson ditches his @HJ|pg||
nt|yo_yo: we look forward to that happening then|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if anyone can do it then Andy Robson can|pg||
nt|athene: he could throw the @HJ here, even :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzh: the problem is that to force that he needed to do it on the previous round i think|pg||
