nt|vugraphzyr: that's right Jon|pg||
mb|2H|mb|d!|nt|Walddk3: double = unbid suits|pg||
nt|hedyg: upgraded weak NT?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Normally on BBO the Closed Room result is simply not present when the board has not been played there. They are using 'Passed Out' for this purpose here, apparently.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|haans: trying 4@H?|pg||
nt|hedyg: we best ignore the CR results|pg||
nt|brolucius: Liv told us what it meant earlier.|pg||
nt|vugraphzyr: yes, other wise it will show a random score from last segment, having some problems with the computer here|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5 either minor works well for EW if they can get there|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: and usually tolerance (doubleton) for partner's suit|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok ty Liv|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@S is adventurous!|pg||
nt|haans: but 4@S a make|pg||
nt|hedyg: adventurous? ( is foolhardy allowed?)|pg||

mb|p|nt|drorp:  Good morning everyone|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Dror|pg||
nt|jbgood: looks as if 2@d was intended as inverted minor (alerted) - common way after inbid is to cue opp's suit|pg||

nt|haans: do not bid Moysian if you cannot play them|pg||
nt|brolucius: A clever line of play, hoping that trumps are 3-3 and that he can take a further heart force in one hand and then draw trumps in the other. Unlucky. |pg||

nt|brolucius: It seemed he was in some danger of getting the @CK ruffed.|pg||

mb|p|nt|brolucius: Liv, the VG operator, is kindly putting in the results from the other table by hand. We do not have a linked BBO table, so the auction at the other table is not available.|pg||
nt|brolucius: We can guess here that South rebid 3@C at the other table.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@D/@H for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: and some times the club queen is beheaded - and the contract makes even with 4 losers|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|ahri: I would :)|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D for me|pg||
nt|brolucius: Probably, but I would have bid more as South.|pg||
nt|hedyg: unexpected lead|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|nt|drorp:  if they found the switch to spade in time, it'll be 120, if they don't, 180, not much of an interesting hand|pg||

nt|haans: 4-0 in spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: looks as if 4@s can be beaten |pg||
nt|mdgraham: perennial problem for North over a 1@S opener |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: acceptable|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@H with a bad suit, a (possibly) light 1NT...|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jbgood: di ace, two hearts and a third heart promotes a trump trick|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2D!|mb|2S|nt|haans: no minus 200 for NS :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: You need some system to describe all the heart-support hands for West. 3@H is usually played as pretty weak with four trumps.|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S and 2NT for better hearts hands|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@D probably means a strongish raise to the two-level.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Chance for East to bid his clubs.|pg||
nt|brolucius: That is the lead that he might have needed against 4@S.|pg||
mb|3C!|an|inv|nt|haans: its a vul game guys|pg||
nt|jbgood: but of course on a club lead 4@s is an easy make|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South perhaps thinking that double would be a overdoing things a bit |pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: and he was right|pg||
mb|3D|mb|4H|nt|haans: how could they have avoided 4@S i OR|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: hard to do right from east|pg||
mb|d|nt|brolucius: North has a good diamond holding to match South's bid. Against thatm the @HK may be no good. Well, he has bid 4@S anyway. Very reasonable.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: he plays for N to hold the @d king|pg||
nt|jbgood: not unreasonable|pg||
nt|jbgood: but he is likely to go down now|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@c by W would not have been a minispinter but rather show @Cs + @Hs as passed hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c4|nt|brolucius: East's lead-directional bid has got the defence off to a good start.|pg||

nt|mdgraham: now there's a bad result|pg||
nt|jbgood: 5 level ....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one off in five of a major - probably bid under their own steam |pg||
nt|haans: bad only for some|pg||
nt|brolucius: Even if it starts 1@H - 4@H, West can enter with a double and East will bid 4@S.|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: or pass pass 3@D ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 4@S|pg||
mb|3D|nt|drorp:  interesting choice to double with east, on the 7-4|pg||
nt|haans: hard to find 5@D save|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NOT a result team-mates have sympathy for |pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@D is bold, at this score.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|haans: save?|pg||
nt|drorp:  after Aa bids 3@h, atleast, Molberg is not going to let his opponents play when he's white VS red|pg||
nt|haans: GF relay or natural|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3NT is a good bid, but as the cards lie it is not the best contract.|pg||
nt|haans: i can not see N leading low hearts :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: No reason whatsoever, of course, for East to bid 4@S. West might have a long minor and a singleton spade (as he does in hearts, on this lay-out).|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hard to guess who is thinking...|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 1@D=11-16|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: yes 5@D or 5@H both makes|pg||
nt|drorp:  he went with 4@h, knowing his partner has void spade|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Perhaps North is thinking of doubling, hoping that he can score 4 hearts. |pg||
pc|d4|nt|haans: only east know that he has a distributional hand|pg||
nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
nt|haans: still no make|pg||

nt|drorp:  now Molgberg should pull it|pg||
nt|drorp:  well done|pg||
nt|drorp:  Aa doesn't know if it's 6-4 or 7-4, but i think it should be 7-4|pg||
nt|drorp:  note that 5@h goes down if the defense attack spades continously|pg||
nt|haans: opps may get a hearts ruff in 5@D|pg||

nt|haans: to|pg||
nt|hedyg: N cannot see him maybe|pg||
nt|brolucius: North can hardly expect South to hold seven diamonds to the K-Q, or West would have held up the ace on the first round.|pg||
nt|hedyg: the screen seperates them|pg||
nt|haans: still lead @D will get @H switch|pg||
nt|hedyg: but S has disced 1@h...|pg||
nt|hedyg: K@H and @d?|pg||
nt|hedyg: a bit DD|pg||

pc|d6|pg||

nt|hedyg: or ace|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hT|nt|drorp:  I'm being asked about the double of 5@d, it's true that it's not a clear action, or a good action, but maybe he felt like they're making 4@s|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|hedyg: so only -1 now|pg||

nt|drorp:  surely the pass on 4@h wasn't forcing, so why would a pass on 5@d be?|pg||
nt|haans: AGAIN: Remember: Ace from AKx is a trick one convention only|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Much easier to screw up a defence like that than it may seem when we can see all four hands. (He said from bitter experience...)|pg||
nt|haans: i do think Zia said that in one of his books|pg||

mb|3N|nt|hedyg: the strong NT version of Multi|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: 4 @d a good bid|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c3|nt|jbgood: this looks difficult|pg||
nt|haans: many play that 1nt show 18-19 bal 1@S waiting|pg||
nt|jbgood: not many in Norway, Hans:)|pg||
nt|haans: maybe going to 6nt?|pg||
nt|hedyg: more and more are playing this as showing 20-21|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jbgood: doubt that - they are on the diamond route|pg||
nt|haans: at least now :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: with 22+ they open 2@c and use kokish relays to show 24 +|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|jbgood: (I dont know a single one:))|pg||
nt|haans: no know that i rean BIN :)|pg||
nt|drorp:  establishing the spades would work, but he should start with clubs because other wise east can theoretically jump with K@s and play his 2nd heart, and west will have 2 more entries to establish his hearts and set the contract|pg||
nt|jbgood: rdbl - 4 sp - 4 NT |pg||
pc|c9|pc|cA|nt|jbgood: well - he skipped the xx|pg||
nt|mdgraham: will find out they are off a key, so should stop in 6@D|pg||

pc|c8|pg||
nt|drorp:  well, he didn't very hard ofcourse|pg||
nt|drorp:  so i think it's over now|pg||
nt|haans: kokish relay rarely needed (you do not have 24+ often)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|haans: nice to watch|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jbgood: a diamond return might have worked for the defense|pg||
nt|jbgood: job done|pg||
nt|jbgood: does Tundal know he is on the lead?|pg||
nt|haans: minor suit slams harder to find|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jbgood: spade does not work|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|drorp:  he would be okay with a diamond return, playing the 9, and in control (again has to choose correctly to continue with spades so the defense communication is lost)|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|nt|drorp:  can safely play diamond to 9 now, trying for an overtrick maybe|pg||

nt|frululu: DD says its always 1 down|pg||

nt|brolucius: Declarer has one diamond discard on the second heart winner, and the diamond finesse is onside. But N/S have some chance of scoring a ruff or two.|pg||
pc|cA|mc|10|nt|mdgraham: effective competition form EW|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer should not take the trump finesse.|pg||

nt|jbgood: when i come back with a cup of coffee i guess 4 hearts has been bid and made|pg||
nt|haans: good guess :)|pg||

nt|brolucius: On a diamond lead, say, he just plays ace and another trump and makes easily.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Good afternoon to Hans Sjöström and Hedy Grey|pg||
mb|1D!|an|4+!h|nt|Walddk3: and hello David|pg||
nt|hedyg: good afternoon :)|pg||
nt|haans: Ha all|pg||
nt|haans: Hi|pg||
nt|brolucius: A common idea, among experts, to play transfer responses to 1@C.|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|haans: among many today|pg||
nt|haans: spreading|pg||
nt|brolucius: North would perhaps like to bid, but he has a very flat hand.|pg||
nt|haans: nice 3@D bid :) will they find spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: E wont ike his K@D anymore now|pg||
nt|hedyg: not for continuing to bid|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Is 3@S limit with three-card support?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Do they go through 2NT with 4?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyr: yes|pg||
nt|brolucius: If East saw that North was considering a bid (and was therefore likely to hold diamond length), he might conclude that West was short in diamonds.|pg||
mb|4D!|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Probably a 'choice of games' cue-bid, since West cannot be thinking of a slam once he has passed 3@D.|pg||
nt|haans: N and E on the dsame side of a screen|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: @S lead?|pg||
nt|hedyg: nothing else looks good|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|Walddk3: Awkward hand to play|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Aa would have liked to be in dummy after  trick 1|pg||
nt|jbgood: but he will make it I think, ruffing a club and throwing a heart on the di king|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|haans: 4@S safer than 4@H|pg||
nt|haans: this time|pg||
nt|jbgood: that surely didnt complicate matters|pg||
nt|Walddk3: No, but Aa must be wondering why he got a diamond into dummy's tenace|pg||
nt|haans: we all are :)|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|hedyg: can still switch|pg||
nt|hedyg: Q@D meant as preferential here |pg||
nt|haans: lavinthal @DQ?|pg||
nt|haans: sry|pg||
nt|brolucius: Since no further diamond tricks can be taken, North's card would normally be suit preference. Here a high card requests a spade switch, so that the defenders can set up a spade ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: before declarer has discards on the clubs.|pg||
nt|hedyg: unlikely that E bid 3@h with K963 in @D|pg||
pc|d2|nt|haans: or ...|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d6|pc|d9|pg||
pc|c8|nt|hedyg: but it seems Eide believes his pd had singleton Q@D|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hedyg: not too late yet|pg||
nt|brolucius: There was more chance of making 4@S than 4@H.|pg||
nt|haans: triumph for Eide|pg||
nt|brolucius: If 4@D was intended as a 'choice of games' cue bid, East should have chosen 4@S. He had already overstated his heart suit. |pg||
