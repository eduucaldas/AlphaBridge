nt|haans: what a start|pg||
nt|xenya: well strictly speaking, there is no game here for EW, though 3N might have a practical chance|pg||
nt|yo_yo: slam time|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Slam for NS, 6@S better|pg||
mb|p|nt|chthonic: Slam a bit ambitious and does not make with 3-1 hearts|pg||
nt|xenya: sp 3 off might not be a great disaster -- we shall see|pg||
mb|1H|nt|haans: 3@C lead directing?|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: assume puppet|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|chthonic: Either in diamonds or hearts.|pg||
nt|chthonic: Dealing with multi -- assume NS will cope|pg||
nt|yo_yo: @H looks off|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and North might support them eventually|pg||
nt|yo_yo: or @D|pg||
mb|2S|nt|haans: multi been on for 40 years now time to find defense|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6NT is also a possibilty|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: but not for long :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: of course NT ok too :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so anything but @H OK  we think|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree|pg||
mb|3D|nt|chthonic: That may spur action that will be regretted.|pg||
nt|chthonic: Nope.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 9 off the top  |pg||
nt|chthonic: Well done|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: they are playing bds 1 - 14|pg||

nt|yo_yo: ok ok mos  @C might not make :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am never good in 2/2 fits |pg||
mb|4D|nt|sybarra: now the lead of a @S could give another |pg||
nt|sybarra: actually can always lead up towards the q of QS |pg||
nt|haans: my choice for sure|pg||
nt|chthonic: 11 tricks should be easy|pg||
nt|haans: spade finesse = 12|pg||
nt|haans: low risk|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: q of @S |pg||
nt|yo_yo: the good old strong jump shift in action here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I like it|pg||
mb|4N|nt|haans: in imps you must lead spades best chance to get them down|pg||
nt|haans: time to pass|pg||
nt|xenya: vulnerable, i would sell out here|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: N would like it be a declarer in 6 NT, protecting K@C|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not very fashionable here any more though|pg||
nt|sybarra: we may play 6 @D?|pg||
mb|5H|nt|sybarra: with a puppet sequence Hughes may have thought the club was better |pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: looks as if @D are agreed |pg||
nt|rnmalik: except @H|pg||
nt|yo_yo: need to get that suit right ...|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont see S setting NT  given the qx of clubs|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah but he will|pg||
nt|rnmalik: on this bidding I think it would be 6@S|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no, agree shirley|pg||
mb|5S|nt|haans: many americans say S was not good enough for x + suit only simple overcall|pg||
nt|xenya: S feels more optimistic -- and perhaps he is right|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: ooops now North has to think|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he didnt give correct reply if @S is meant|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont see where @S's agreed however|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no |pg||
mb|p|nt|chthonic: Might have played a club at trick two to prevent third trump lead, maintaining control|pg||
mb|p|pc|cA|nt|haans: no gain in finesse sorry|pg||
pc|c4|nt|yo_yo: Vorster took control then didnt know what to do, it seems to me|pg||
pc|c9|nt|rnmalik: qx@C became threat cards|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe should have tried4 @S over 4 @D wonder if that would have helped?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i think if you blackwood, you have to go for it|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|Walddk4: How did 5@CX make on board 1?|pg||
nt|haans: S decarded a hearts on clubs|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk4: Thx|pg||
nt|sybarra: and it was a @H  lead |pg||
nt|haans: so dedcl 5th hearts was good|pg||

mb|2S|nt|chthonic: 3N?|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: had jumpt to 2@H or 3@H = not preemtive|pg||
nt|xenya: since NS play a weak NT, S opens 1@D intending to rebid 1N -- that would show a strong NT hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|chthonic: With North's failure to double clubs, can south bid 3N?|pg||

nt|mcphee: honor twice in @D also a consideration, as is a low @H toward the Q|pg||
nt|chthonic: due to boards 4 and 5, where they had disasters|pg||
nt|haans: 5@C?|pg||

nt|haans: they have 5@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|xenya: an everyday 12-card spade fit for NS here -- let us see where all that will end|pg||

mb|p|nt|mcphee: yes|pg||
mb|1S|nt|haans: and they are on|pg||
nt|xenya: and now...|pg||
mb|p|nt|chthonic: 3-3 spades with AK onside mean that 4S makes here|pg||
mb|3S|nt|chthonic: as well as 3NT|pg||
nt|haans: bloddy|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|sybarra: likely to make a bunch here  +2 or +3|pg||

nt|chthonic: Oh, a club lead....|pg||
nt|mcphee: sigh, 4@S is simply a poor bid IMHO|pg||
nt|chthonic: right.|pg||
nt|haans: 3@S FORCING|pg||
nt|mcphee: he has a game going hand, fantasic Q@C and great @D cards|pg||
nt|chthonic: was only looking at trump and heart losers.|pg||
nt|mcphee: 2@D is rather clear|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s6|nt|haans: cry a little|pg||
pc|s7|nt|haans: not all say 3@S had been forcing then 2@D now 3S later|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s8|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|lestergold: and therefore didnt realise hat running the spade to the q had an upside I was cetain that she wsnt thinking in terms of an endplay|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: now 2@h, east overcalls and south tries for game|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ritong: 1 NT looks a bit unsound|pg||
nt|lestergold: it is if they are playin  card majors|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5 card majors|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, probable|pg||
mb|2D|nt|lestergold: now North ha splaced herself under pressure|pg||
nt|lestergold: west has helped because noe 2H shows positive support|pg||
nt|lestergold: Please frogive me but there are more than one off centre bids here|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lestergold: 2D is an attempt to o for 800 when N/S do not have a game lucky here that east has diamonds|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ritong: it is not uncommon people try for spectacular bids playing on vugraph|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|lestergold: well they will earn spectacular criticism if thats what they want|pg||

nt|mcphee: like a weaker hand with a 6th @S|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|nt|athene: normal multi-2@D auction?|pg||
nt|newmoon: This is round 4.  Round 3 results and standings are up:  http://www.sabf.co.za/interprov/index.htm|pg||
nt|newmoon: This is the MEDWIN cup competition|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: except many people would respond 2@S, rather than 2@S, to a multi, with the north cards|pg||
mb|2C|nt|andyv:  yes, but why bid 2@h with N hand?|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|athene: 2@S rather than 2@H|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I can never think about a multi on a hand like S´s a good 4-card @h beside a 6-card @s|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|athene: if north plays hearts, the defence do best to lead trumps, but east might find that hard from @HQx|pg||
mb|4C|nt|andyv:  E decided not to make leading a problem|pg||

pc|cA|pc|cT|pc|c5|pc|c7|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s3|nt|athene: it's surprising how often, if you have a borderline "double them or not?" decision, and you decide not to, you get a chance to double again a level higher|pg||

pc|s3|nt|rodal f: Will be hard for S|pg||

pc|h5|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Why not 4@D as suggested by Jordan, W does not lose anything|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, on 20, the difference between playing the @H9 and the @HQ was 14 IMPs.  3NT making vs. -3.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|marlowepi: hard? not harder than the hard-headed bidding:)|pg||
nt|petergill: East simply has to retain 2 spades to beat 3NT|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
nt|rodal f: :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Should declarer have gotten that right after west showed length in two suits?|pg||
nt|fann4: Declarer went wrong here - the 4@C bid told him that West was heavily 2 suited, usually 10+cards in @C and @H|pg||

nt|haans: if it wasnt call TD|pg||
nt|bobh1: i agree; but he may have assumed it was a splinter|pg||
nt|othered1: in ACBL, I don't think 4@C is alertable -- at 4-level after first round of auction|pg||
nt|fann4: Now E makes both his trumps, either by ruffing or by tapping dummy|pg||
nt|bobh1: in acbl not alertable i agree|pg||

nt|newmoon: what else, he muses|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N is obviously squeezable|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|othered1: certainly should be explained after auction over or south should have asked, since it's not a normal bid.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|s9|pc|d7|nt|petergill: North's 3@C bid is not a great advertisement for the Acol style of bidding - I prefer a more flexible negative double of 2@D|pg||

mb|1C|nt|athene: this might be another close struggle|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: bizarre 2@H - that's usually played as forcing to game|pg||

nt|rodal f: Nice press, but obvious|pg||
nt|petergill: If EW reach 5@C, it's not impossible that North could get squeezed in @D's and @S's in the ending|pg||

mb|p|nt|rnmalik: not possible|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lestergold: north min nt if south conservative now they go plus|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, with 4@H making in the OR and failing by one here, 12 IMPs and it's a 1-IMP match.|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: i think he has fogotten that board allready :)|pg||
nt|haans: i do not like Vosters pass many x or bid 1@S saying no spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: LOL|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: actually S may have had better chances if he played small on the ten of spades|pg||

pc|c8|nt|lestergold: by conservative i mean inviting with 3S|pg||
nt|jcwla: That was on 21.|pg||
nt|petergill: With screens, we see N and E's bids simultaneously, so the pause for thought would be East before the Dbl, not North|pg||
nt|haans: screen = alert|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c9|pg||
nt|haans: or if decl played any little clubs|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@C is high enough, unless North gets squeezed out of a trick|pg||

nt|fann4: Was 4@S actually 3 off on bd 23?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: yes |pg||
nt|haans: give them 23|pg||
nt|rodal f: I mean 2 is enough, but declerer might explained him self down for 3|pg||

nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Was 2:)|pg||
nt|fann4: I can't see why it was 3 off the way the play went. Dummy had 2 trumps left, East one, and declarer had top @D|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c5|pc|sT|pg||
nt|haans: all adrian have to do is wait with @DA 1 trick = no squeeze|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3 time @S and -1|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|nt|jcwla: E/W never got a @S on the table on 21 in the OR.  Meanwhile, as specs note, 3NT the DD spot here.|pg||

nt|newmoon: Kaprey regretting not ruffing that 1st @S... he also has something to answer his team-mates   :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|petergill: It's usually less revealing to the defenders if declarer plays @DQ (higher of equals) not @DJ on the first round of @D|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: in theory you might have some chances of surviving a heart misguess if you can come to a long spade but in practice the defence will usually get five tricks first if that happens|pg||

nt|marlowepi: well, sometimes pd has   xxxx   x     KQ    Qxxxxx|pg||
mb|p|nt|fann4: 3NT will be very interesting. Declarer can take a @H finesse into the safe North hand, but that will be 8 tricks.|pg||

nt|rodal f: Forget those few times u sucseed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes well that is the whole point, N has NOT told all of his story, he has a second suit and a void and a 5 loser hand and the colors are in favor of bidding|pg||
nt|newmoon: he was influenced by that 3@C bid, I think.   Expected an ace more in N|pg||
nt|haans: agree there 3@C were not to find any game|pg||

mb|p|nt|othered1: Why is 7@S good, fishing for @DQ?|pg||
mb|4N|nt|haans: or ruffing |pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Scores after 2 rounds at http://www.sabf.co.za/interprov/log2m.htm. This is Round 3|pg||
nt|bobh1: its good because it makes :)|pg||
nt|fann4: No not KC. just a sort of mark time bid as W feels he is too strong to sign off in 4@S|pg||
mb|5D|nt|rnmalik: should be to play, don't know what they are playing|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this is not likely to make|pg||
nt|fann4: 3 key cards|pg||
nt|haans: AKJxxx do not need the Q|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|nt|rodal f: But this board still. Would it be unnormal to find KQX@S and a single @H at S?|pg||
nt|newmoon: I do not understand.  3@C promises 4@Hs?   East showing 6-5 or 5-5 good hand now|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: from E's point of view bringing the @ds home is at worst a finesse|pg||
nt|haans: 0 3|pg||
nt|haans: good old style|pg||
nt|bobh1: he doesn't know his pard has 3 small|pg||
nt|haans: 5@S-6@S-7@S|pg||
nt|bobh1: the worst holding he could have|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: what?|pg||
nt|fann4: right. AKJxxx will only pose a problem opposite xxx|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: nor me|pg||
nt|bobh1: could this be 0 or 3 confusion?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|othered1: but picking up that suit, prima facie, is only about 58 percent, and north's bid make make that lower.|pg||
nt|haans: 4nt mean = if you had 3 or 4 rebid|pg||
nt|fann4: It shouldn't have been. 4@D was surely forward-going in some way, else he'd have signed off in 4@S.|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think if W has 3 he is supposed to go on on this auction|pg||
mc|13|nt|othered1: And another reason for 7@S to be silly, is thqt the opponents mightn't bid small slam, in which case you need a much better play for 7|pg||

pc|cT|nt|athene: an auction which ends in 2nt is unlikely ever to win a beauty prize but this was all just about fair enough|pg||
pc|c5|nt|newmoon: Weide's 2nt was probably a game try, but West hastened to pass|pg||

nt|petergill: EW have had 5 plus scores in a row, are doing well|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks Roz|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: back on track|pg||
nt|bobh1: if he had shown a strong hand, maybe not|pg||
nt|fann4: I suppose E was expecting W to continue with 3 key cards.|pg||
nt|haans: i say that is a MUST|pg||
nt|rodal f: @D 2-2=40,7%       3-1 and 1-3=49,7%        4-0 and 0-4=9,6% so odd on for 7@S if EW know they have 9: http://www.bridgehands.com/P/Probability_of_Card_Distribution.htm|pg||
nt|bobh1: here he had shown nothing so if his pd is bidding blackwood, 3 KCs must be enough|pg||
mb|1D|nt|haans: odds for 2 diamonds in dummy|pg||
mb|d|nt|newmoon: OR started with bds 27-28, so we now have comparisons|pg||
nt|othered1: Just add that to the annals of good pairs having trouble with key card Blackwood.  |pg||
nt|fann4: Of course you would want to be in a grand after the 4@D bid - it would mostly have the @DQ|pg||
mb|2D|mb|d|nt|lestergold: is 2D meant to be weak intermediate or strong?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: intermediate|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|lestergold: on normal methods North has a good one diamond overcall much too good for a weak|pg||
nt|rodal f: And a push to come|pg||
nt|fann4: You can look at that disaster from different angles - but what did E think the 4@D bid meant.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|newmoon: 4@C pre-accept,  now 4@H = retransfer|pg||
nt|petergill: Weide chose the old-fashioned style of doubling first; the other East followed the more modern tendency to overcall one's long suit first with about 16 points|pg||
nt|fann4: From West|pg||
pc|d7|nt|rnmalik: agree|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4H depends on spade K onside plus only one heart loser a bit less than 50% and today its sadly zero percent|pg||
nt|rodal f: Again I will follow ORDER. 3@S. What if W was by 0 honors. 4@C????|pg||
nt|bobh1: i blame West|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|lestergold: not unreasonable to bid i think quite normal the clubs and diamonds well duiplicated here|pg||
nt|newmoon: or pass = re-transfer|pg||
nt|haans: maybe spades are spades :)|pg||
nt|haans: what do you think it did mean?|pg||
nt|fann4: From West's viewpoint, despite the splinter they could have been off 2 key cards.|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|haans: weak hand for 4@C|pg||
nt|haans: in love|pg||
nt|rodal f: Vug might can tell. I have no idea:) |pg||
nt|bobh1: his partner couldn't have a blackwood bid with no keycards|pg||
nt|fann4: It was surely some slam interest, else 4@S|pg||
pc|d4|nt|petergill: The more modern style is intended to cope better with those modern opponents who sometimes preempt you if you double |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|haans: yes not fair|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dT|nt|jcwla: Well, opposite passed partner, there is something to be said for 2@D.  Makes opps' auctions more difficult -- though all roads lead to 4@H here.|pg||
nt|haans: right|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rodal f: Full speed. No first controll in @C but have @D que pard:)|pg||
nt|petergill: If @HK is played here, a club switch is needed|pg||
nt|petergill: I meant "if @HA at Trick"|pg||
pc|d5|pc|c5|pg||
nt|haans: got that|pg||
pc|h3|nt|haans: he should have gone strat for Blackwwod|pg||
pc|h6|nt|petergill: NS give count  usually|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|jcwla: Right, I agree and would bid 1@D in std methods.|pg||
nt|haans: strait|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|nt|lestergold: yes its a standard tactic but North's hand is the kind which can make game opposite  a passed partner- look how little ios needed|pg||
nt|haans: sloppy|pg||
nt|petergill: so North thinks South has 3 or 5 @Ds|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|bobh1: 4@d was a meaningless bid...he just wanted to mention that he had support for the suit E had opened|pg||
nt|othered1: I must go.  Thanks all and bye|pg||
nt|rodal f: By Ed|pg||
nt|fann4: One shouldn't make meaningless bids, and he didn't. |pg||
nt|haans: Bye Ed|pg||
pc|cT|nt|bobh1: W had shown nothing; all he did was respond to 1@d, which players sometimes do on virtual yarboroughs|pg||
pc|c7|nt|lestergold: i mean Ks q dim to three or fourand a stiff club for example|pg||
nt|jcwla: A third overtrick in 3NT (not 6@D) on 25 means 1 to Western Province to within 8 with 3 comparisons to come.|pg||
nt|rodal f: I'm might a bit hard, but here have been many funny bids:)|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|fann4: Though as Ed said, put it down to another Keycard disaster. Could West really expect pard to have zero key cards?|pg||
nt|bobh1: it was meaningless in the sense that it didn't show a SI|pg||
nt|haans: all the more reason for 5@S-6@S-7@S|pg||
nt|fann4: West did not say nothing. he bid 1@S and then 4@D.4@D is not nothing. 4@S is nothing.|pg||
nt|haans: that would have been a bidding to remember|pg||
nt|bobh1: 4@d doesn't show a great hand|pg||
nt|fann4: Yes it does|pg||
nt|bobh1: it just shows a few @ds|pg||
nt|fann4: No it doesn't - not in my book anyhow.|pg||
nt|bobh1: so you think it's a slam try?|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
nt|fann4: You sign off in trumps when not interested in anything.|pg||
nt|haans: very old Acol,4@D was a natural slam try|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|nt|fann4: I said so earlier, and have no doubt about it.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|petergill: East also was taken in by the false count card|pg||

pc|c8|pc|sJ|pc|s3|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|nt|rodal f: Still. At the last 4@S is normal|pg||
nt|bobh1: then that was the crux of the matter . . . a slam try could not have 0 KCs|pg||
pc|s9|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|d6|pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|rodal f: As long as 4@C was a splinter, asume so, 4@D needed to be cards but made it hard for E to read since he had the controls there. Waited a single might|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|fann4: What W should have done or could have done is another matter. 4@D generally shows a control (with @S firmly agreed) or at worst @DQx(x) and keeping the pot boiling.|pg||
