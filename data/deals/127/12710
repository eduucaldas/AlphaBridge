nt|vugraphzcv: not very good at guessing the plays here are we?! :-)|pg||
nt|hlortz: apparently not to north :)|pg||
nt|gambit: speak for yourself :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: isnt it obvious that South isnt getting in to give him a club ruff?|pg||
nt|lestergold: very poor defence|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: particularly now declarer is giving him a chance to ruff one|pg||
nt|gambit: he will pitch |pg||
nt|lestergold: ruff a loser but then he can only play one round of trumps|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|gambit: how many spades? not too many otherwise double and troube|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: only needs double club finesse 255 double roland's requirement|pg||
nt|lestergold: 25%|pg||
mb|d|nt|gambit: no Drury? When will they learn?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|gambit: or 2S|pg||
nt|lestergold: meanwhile the conservative Edwin has to find a bid to even get into auction|pg||
nt|othered1: I like east's inaction here, though at these colors it might not be a universal choice|pg||
nt|hlortz: ew had their pockets picked|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: Men in white coats where are u?|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: south to north: i forgot i was a passed hand!|pg||
mb|4S|mb|d|mb|r|mb|p|mb|5H|nt|othered1: South's "psych" didn't help east, either.  Over a known preempt, I don't th ink east has an automatic passout.|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|nt|lestergold: I think east has to bid 3N in the passout seat|pg||
nt|gambit: is double takeout or penalty? prob the former due to prior pass|pg||
nt|lestergold: it cannot be natural it must deny hearts and imply minors as well as likely to hold something in spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: only as long as it denies hearts!|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: i would tend to overcall 1NT at my first turn|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree with 3N if south's bid is preemptive.  But if south has the 5-8 points promised, game is much more unlikely.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s4|nt|lestergold: I would think of 1N immediate certainly wouldnt heitate with a stiff heart with a void it does feel a little unnatural|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s3|pc|s6|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzcv: but you did have a stiff heart to start with!|pg||
nt|hlortz: I'd try 1N as E. Pard could bury you in @H but the opps can steal from you too easily at these coulors|pg||
pc|s7|pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
pc|hK|pc|s5|nt|lestergold: however 3N now tells partner that he was fixed over the 1@s bid|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|dA|nt|othered1: My partners don't want the pressure of dealing with way off-shape 1N overcalls.|pg||

nt|lestergold: even textbook|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|lestergold: you are allowed to overcall 1N with this kind of hand |pg||
nt|othered1: certainly.  Or even 2N, but neither is particularly wise.|pg||

nt|othered1: 5N - 6@D - 7@H?|pg||

nt|othered1: Fine decision by north, trusting EW to  have 10@D for their auction|pg||
nt|hlortz: hinden wil be nervous before seeing dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: well south surely has to be void in diamionds with points in clubs for her bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: likely but not a certainty|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: south to north: imagine you've got a better hand than i have!|pg||
