nt|brolucius: Might as well have played off the two trumps first.|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: other table more slow/circumspect|pg||
nt|lestergold: another dull 3N plus 2 odd |pg||
nt|lestergold: as cards lie 6D is frigid|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2C|an|majors|nt|brolucius: There could have been a show-up squeeze, to let him drop a singleton @H10 offside.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|an|ask for better|nt|ralfwil: If I rebid 1nt after i@s from P I promise a 2-card support|pg||
nt|lestergold: less than 50% contract tho|pg||
mb|d|mb|2H|nt|brolucius: I like the 3@H opening.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d7|nt|athene: hi good evening everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: and hard to bid|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lestergold: absolutely unlikely to be bid at many tables|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h3|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|c8|pg||
nt|brolucius: Opening one level higher than many would have done, made it much harder for E/W. They would probably have found their diamond fit otherwise.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@H made it very difficult on Osborne, and it is no surprise that E-W did not his their best fit|pg||
nt|daman: oddly enough     this has a chance|pg||
nt|Walddk2: *did not find|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|cT|pc|cA|pg||
nt|athene: the best declarer can do is just draw trumps and cash the diamonds, for one down|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: an unexpected 3nt from Gunnar! As I know him he normally will check a slam in @d|pg||

pc|s4|pc|c5|pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: Good evening to Sabine Auken|pg||
nt|athene: she might not know the hearts are blocked so doing anything else looks like risking a big disaster|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|jcmax: Good evening everyone|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Sabine|pg||
nt|athene: hi|pg||
pc|d2|nt|brolucius: If North had opened 2@H, South would have raised to 3@H, so the effect would be the same.|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps west should pull 4@C, on equal level conversion principles, but few people agree to play it so high|pg||

nt|latwy: chyba jak tak dociskaj¹ bez karty to czuja ¿e maj¹ s³aby stó³|pg||
nt|burypies: Witek z nadmiarem karty sobie nie poradzi³|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: Note that Wrang should have returned the king of clubs, not the 8, for getting down 2|pg||
nt|kaapo: Nystöm could hope his partner has @SA and declarer 3 @Hs, so that seemed a good try|pg||
nt|mmmakela: your pd DID respond immidiately|pg||
nt|mcphee: i this they will lose imps to than board|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: I asked the players, and 1NT was just NT, nothing more, nothing less.. :)|pg||
nt|col3435: just a low card encouraging a retun then|pg||
nt|yuval10: well played by declarer|pg||
nt|col3435: but they are trailing in the overall standings now, so they need a few more like this|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1@C opening and then...?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: after pd bids @Ss you lead a @D2 9 cards in rounded suit to me a sure finnese|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Why do they call themselves the Texan Aces? Texas isn't anywhere near India|pg||
nt|suketbombi: ok buddy not elegeant but you got your ots|pg||
nt|suketbombi: very close indeed left to himself last 3nt wud be lot of work on a @S lead may go down often|pg||
nt|joemanjo: 3N will be reached here as well |pg||
nt|joemanjo: may find South as declarer here.|pg||
nt|hlortz: that result hard to explain to teammates if QXX of @D onside!|pg||
nt|hlortz: but no matter here|pg||
nt|lestergold: absolutely Henry|pg||
nt|vugraphj77: http://www.pzbs.pl//wyniki/2010/krajowe/gpp/01elblag/eteamleaderb.html|pg||
nt|vugraphj77: wyniki na biezaco|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mmmakela: partscores here|pg||
nt|kaapo: Can Mikael show 5-6 majors?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: Awfully lot of strong clubs today!|pg||
nt|kaapo: Try 6NT here?|pg||
nt|mcphee: @H and NT will bring the slam bonus in|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I see that there was some slightly less disciplined bidding on board 22 in the other room |pg||
nt|vugraphzck: NE discussing|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 12 opoosite 12 they too wud be in this game|pg||
nt|lestergold: didnt see why he didnt take an honest palooka's finesse on this hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: Ah, I now remember Markku told that NS play 13-17 1NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: south will be a bit surprised when his partnern supports his spades :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: Still more IMPs for Lavec: Johan Sylvan didn't consider the West hand with queens and jacks worth a move on board 5. They played at 2@S|pg||
nt|joemanjo: with S as declarer, 3N will make|pg||
mb|2D|nt|varange: thx staffan|pg||
nt|kaapo: Perhaps West has something to say too|pg||
nt|suketbombi: their Sponsor is Venkatesh from Texas and he is called texan|pg||
nt|suketbombi: the @S can be blocked even if led no other reason to go dn in 3nt|pg||
nt|othered1: a wee bit aggressive by north|pg||
nt|lestergold: certainly not textbook 4H|pg||
mb|p|nt|burypies: nie ma nic gorszego ni¿ silna karta w s³¹bej rêce:)|pg||
nt|abunio: tak, bezpieczny przedzial to 13-14|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: trying to swing something back perhaps?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|chick: there is a club slam, if declarer can catch the K|pg||
nt|kaapo: I suppose the style is that with 13-14 it's always without a 4-card major|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I agree with 1 H|pg||
nt|kaapo: Yes, nice overcall|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1@D shows 4+@H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ok, just wondered :)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: nice guy plays with Mike Lawarence often in USA|pg||
nt|suketbombi: satya does not have confortable rebid may setle for 2nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|abunio: interesujaca kontra, wlasciwie zrozumiana|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 3 nt promising shortness I suppose|pg||
nt|col3435: hmm. 3@d?|pg||
nt|varange: nah|pg||
nt|suketbombi: comfortable|pg||
mb|3D|nt|burypies: Misiak nie mia³ nic do wygrania to spasowa³|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Jakby W ial @CDW, to po wiscie w @H bylby piekny kontrakt...|pg||
nt|kaapo: And meanwhile, the match is almost even. Zang lost some expected IMPs on 17 and 19|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1@C was either 11-13 NT or 17+|pg||
nt|mmmakela: wet pass from S|pg||
nt|suketbombi: easy 3nt for sumit|pg||
nt|lestergold: as this is no one's hand it simply leads toa poor result here Hindesn going minus in both rooms|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: or asking cues up the line|pg||
nt|varange: gotta bid that spade suit some time|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  does 2NT mean fit? at least invitational?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|chick: but now he has nothing else to do, no cuebid, etc|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: N-S plays 14-16NT|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1@H 8+ with 4+@H (could have longer minor)|pg||
nt|varange: ah. well.|pg||
nt|col3435: heh, I didn't think of pass :)|pg||
nt|varange: there's that|pg||
nt|col3435: you'd bid 4@s then?|pg||
nt|joemanjo: North decides to pass without a fight this time.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kamyk: a Wejknis ma do wygrania 4@S:)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: @H lead from Subhash|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: 2@C either balanced or clubs, and 17+|pg||
nt|kaapo: Hmm... 2@D might show extras|pg||
nt|kaapo: At least that was how I played it|pg||
nt|kaapo: I guess he could try something|pg||
nt|kaapo: And 1@C could be 2 cards, either natural unbalanced, or balanced|pg||
nt|col3435: I'd rather West bid 3@d the first time|pg||
nt|suketbombi: from Dalas Aces to Texan Aces:)|pg||
nt|lml: good morning|pg||
mb|d|nt|mmmakela: ok sound contract, 5 can be in jeopardy|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: I see, tack Staffan|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2NT apparently shows a balanced hand, and now 4@C looks like a control bid with @H support|pg||
nt|suketbombi: he has a chance tho but unlikely since if he concedes @Cs will loose 3 @Hs a @c and a@S|pg||
nt|lml: and good evening to you|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: good evening there|pg||
mb|p|nt|varange: here's the knr hand evaluator for the East hand|pg||
nt|varange: http://www.jeffgoldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=AQ9xx+Kxx+AKx+Kx|pg||
nt|varange: 19.85 HCP|pg||
nt|othered1: East can get @D ruff, if they're really careful|pg||
nt|suketbombi: oh?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: followed by @SJ and dec has some work will eventualy make this|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: I'd bid 3, also|pg||
pc|s5|nt|varange: yes, provided the X promised spades|pg||
nt|varange: how many will declarer be off?|pg||
nt|varange: 3?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kaapo: Yes, lots of working finesses too|pg||
nt|kaapo: If @Hs are 4-1, you might still make 6NT while 6@H fails|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mdgraham: he has to get the ruff with a low trump|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so South has to lead @SQ (no entry to dummy) and West has to duck it - very difficult |pg||
nt|suketbombi: @SJ has to be ducked by JM|pg||
nt|othered1: But possible, as play of interion @S would be very tricky from AQJ|pg||
nt|othered1: interior|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: S thinking.....|pg||
nt|suketbombi: :) you need to know your customer|pg||
nt|lml: I think North has to just bid game as he did here.  South can't possible realize that what he has is useful|pg||
nt|lml: North has a huge hand really|pg||
nt|lml: of course the spades are friendly which is going to make this pretty easy|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mmmakela: perfect for action dbl/2 NT choose the minor|pg||
pc|c5|nt|chick: If 2N is Jacoby, 3N shows 14-15.  |pg||
nt|mmmakela: 10 and next|pg||
nt|kaapo: It seems South is just relaying here|pg||
pc|c9|nt|suketbombi: easy now|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|kaapo: 5@H likely normal RKCB response, two key cards without the queen of hearts|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes, but I think they will play @H|pg||
nt|suketbombi: not tested|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mmmakela: needed a H lead and cashout|pg||
nt|chick: needed a heart back, now S can pitch the 2nd heart|pg||
nt|mmmakela: was too late|pg||
nt|kaapo: South had no fast entry to dummy?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: it was too late when east returned a club. East could return a diamond since South has no direct entry to dummy for a club finesse|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|burypies: po kierowym tak|pg||
nt|kaapo: And North has likely described his full shape by now|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: North has shown 4315, 8-9p|pg||
nt|lestergold: techinically of cours its e/ws hand in 3|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kaapo: And strength within one point range (likely restricted due to not opening the bidding)|pg||
nt|kaapo: Ed Schapiro prefers 5@C to 3NT|pg||
nt|suketbombi: well played sumit|pg||
nt|lml: diamonds 3-2, spades 3-3 with split honors ... piece of cake|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: fast play - tricks missed - claiming|pg||
nt|lml: not really a great NV game|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3D i mean|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|kaapo: North did have an unexpected high singleton|pg||
nt|suketbombi: if he concedes @C will get a @S back Misguess and a @D back still chance for def|pg||
pc|hA|nt|frankaus: 2@S or 3@D would have had EW licking their lips|pg||
nt|joemanjo: back|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|suketbombi: oops:)|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|kaapo: This shouldn't take PO long|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h9|pc|d2|pc|d8|pg||
nt|mmmakela: either action will find 3 clubs|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Why not a @h instead of @d? declarer played like he held a 3-card @h|pg||
pc|c6|nt|varange: Orebrodge are winning by 17/2 this session|pg||
nt|col3435: definitely headed that way|pg||
nt|varange: he'll make his ace, and that is that|pg||
nt|kaapo: Both majors behave, so he'll just lose a club|pg||
pc|c2|nt|yuval10: yep, 12 tricks|pg||
nt|joemanjo: To those who asked, "3 Idiots" is a new movie released in India.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|pg||
nt|suketbombi: N has a promotable trump + @CQ and a @D trick not after @@S return|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes wil earn an imp here|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kaapo: Näsby on the score board after taking all the tricks in 4NT on board 6|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|cJ|nt|suketbombi: kamal may bear his @D K or else he gone|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|suketbombi: oh beats me|pg||
nt|joemanjo: y spade now would have endplayed him|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|burypies: tu nie bronili perfekcyjnie|pg||
pc|c7|nt|kamyk: jak tylko sie w³¹czy³em, to Walerek zacz¹³ wygrywaæ rozdania - jestem ¿yczliwy kibic:)|pg||
nt|kaapo: This is the usual weakness in relay bidding: you get to describe your suit lengths, but not suit strength|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d4|nt|kaapo: And he's safe for 10 even if East happened to have 4 trumps|pg||

nt|brolucius: Hi to the kibitzers!|pg||
nt|daman: Nice hand to start    3NT for NS|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 10-12 in this room first, followed by comparisons from the closed room when we roll over to board 1|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Frances Hinden and Jeffrey Allerton are also a pair away from the table|pg||
nt|brolucius: Frances Hinden is rated one of the best female players in the country, but she took no part in the recent women's trials.|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: NS playing 15-17 and 4 card majors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: OK, Jeffrey replaced by Graham Osborne now|pg||
nt|daman: Nicola didn't play either|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: EW playing 15-17 NT, 5 card majors, transfer responses|pg||
nt|lestergold: well it appeared he made slam in no trumps|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe with a poor diamond suit and partner having shown a minimum opener Gunnar judged slam remote|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: east west under lots of pressure in diamonds|pg||
nt|lestergold: it is a bit of a perfecto after all|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ralfwil: 9 tricks in nt on EW?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: just the right cards hardly anything wasted etc|pg||
mb|2D|mb|d|mb|p|nt|brolucius: No. The recent trials were for the home internationals (Lady Milne Trophy) only. Nicola is already selected for the Europeans.|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind you K@c wasted i suppos|pg||
mb|2S|nt|hlortz: great result 3n in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: good lead!|pg||
nt|davidstern: Hi all from a tardy me|pg||
nt|davidstern: Hi Mike|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: here comes the punt to 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Well bid.|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lestergold: hi David|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: indeed!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: wotcher|pg||
nt|davidstern: and Mike 2|pg||
pc|dK|nt|daman: that card fit into North's cusp in @S|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hinden: 'My @SQ should solidify partner's suit.'|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: this is a very unlucky situation for E/W|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes 4@H seems the normal spot|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N does not look like a superior contrat to 4H |pg||
nt|davidstern: The lead was spot on - not sure if it was indeed possible but avoids any possibility of a strip and endplay|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||
nt|daman: better cash the @H Ace|pg||
nt|daman: otherwise he will be squeezed for 12 tricks|pg||
nt|brolucius: He will still be hoping to beat it, at this stage.|pg||
nt|daman: unlikely|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: no as cards lie it cannot be made now i would have thought that 3N making needed some help from the defence|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cJ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|daman: 12 guaranteed now|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|nt|lestergold: it was played of course by west|pg||
nt|davidstern: In the CR a diamond lead low from East Queen from South so |pg||
nt|davidstern: A diamond was ninth trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes diamond lead did it|pg||
nt|davidstern: Had north led a more 'normal' @D10 it would have also gone down|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: @D10 seems normal|pg||
nt|lestergold: if played by east spade lead likely and that would give it too|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: in OR i mean not here!|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|cT|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: sometimes there is bad luck on a hand nothing you can do- thats why serious matches are played over a large number of boards|pg||

nt|vugraphzbf: i zapowiada siê ciekawa koñcóka tego meczu|pg||
nt|mmmakela: was 14-16 short hearts|pg||
nt|kaapo: At least not in time when it comes to deciding wheter to stop at 3NT or not|pg||
nt|kaapo: Bob's guess was right: in the other room 4@s was made on board 20 for 13 IMPs|pg||
nt|varange: i'm not sure why west didn't bid the spades after the overcall|pg||
nt|yuval10: wow|pg||
nt|yuval10: quite a hand N has here|pg||
nt|joemanjo: fast pace of play. more than a board ahead for the hour.|pg||
nt|joemanjo: in this room atleast|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 5@D exclusion blackwood od |pg||
nt|mdgraham: ...of some kind, by the look of it|pg||
nt|othered1: quite an auction in the CR|pg||
nt|suketbombi: making things diffcult tor texans now|pg||
nt|vasanti: hi all|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 1 imp and 3 bds one of those very close well faught match|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: waiting for W to return to seat|pg||
nt|lml: now I cant say that this is a great VUL game!|pg||
nt|lml: you really ought to be able to cash out here|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: deal out of turn condoned|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4C a bit strange contradicting burn'slaw|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: after 2H-pass-3H-it's hard for west not to double and for eastt not to bid 4C|pg||
mb|1N!|an|14-17 bez singla|nt|mmmakela: honestly how can u pass S hand on previous?|pg||
nt|lml: lets see what happened at the other table|pg||
nt|joemanjo: 4@h though 6 is also on|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: after C return|pg||
nt|kaapo: How high will he get to start describing it?|pg||
mb|2S|an|transfer na trefle badz invit 3NT|nt|kaapo: She|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4NT now?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 5@S perhaps?|pg||
nt|yuval10: follows by 6@c over 5@d |pg||
nt|yuval10: quite hard|pg||
nt|joemanjo: 3N or 4@S?|pg||
mb|d|nt|kaapo: Many would open the South hand nowadays. Surprising to see a strong clubber pass it|pg||
nt|frankaus: not many would pass|pg||
nt|col3435: I thought it was because he didn't feel the hand was good enough with a misfit, but evidently it was more because he wanted the penalty|pg||
nt|vasanti: does 4 hcp warrant a bid?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: 1@C was either balanced or natural|pg||
nt|othered1: @D split makes 4@S a potential problem|pg||
nt|mdgraham: could this be 6@S in one room and 2@S in the other.....|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: 2@D looks like natural, nonforcing call|pg||
nt|kaapo: And 3@H likely a fit jump|pg||
nt|ralfwil: nice score in OR!|pg||
nt|varange: hmm|pg||
nt|vasanti: in desperation yes they are at the moment not|pg||
mb|2N|nt|xenya: no, but later you might have to guess whether partner has a 3-card support for @Ss|pg||

nt|suketbombi: :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: sorry private|pg||
nt|suketbombi: and both N_s think they had a bad result|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: this contract has some flaws.....|pg||
nt|mmmakela: phone brb sry|pg||
nt|yuval10: 5@s from N , 5NT from S |pg||
nt|kaapo: 7@H could be in danger|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 3nt by satya is a good contaract whille 4@S by him will fetch a @H lead from kamal|pg||
nt|suketbombi: other semis Maya Mira Sneha were up 30 imps 12 bds to go dont have the running scores|pg||
nt|joemanjo: N and E sharing screen. |pg||
nt|vugraphzck: N dealt before E|pg||

nt|vugraphzbf: piki trzyma rewelacyjnie :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you don't have to take much care drawing trumps when you have thirteen of them |pg||
nt|joemanjo: So bid by North can be taken back|pg||
mb|p|nt|burypies: sorry myla³am ¿e  ta karta nie jest trudna do licytacji|pg||

nt|abunio: w sumie niewielka odchylka|pg||
nt|kaapo: North does not get wildly interested|pg||
nt|kaapo: This appears to have about 6 losers|pg||
nt|mmmakela: pd opened in fav zone 10 points....|pg||
nt|kaapo: Wow, a natural system played in Swedish premmier league!|pg||
nt|yuval10: pass, if forcing, is very good by S|pg||
nt|joemanjo: Screens on I assume|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: they seem to have stopped at a makeable spot|pg||
nt|varange: i'm just trying to figure out how it made!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: easy -1 here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: or -2|pg||
nt|varange: small club led|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: easy down 2 i would say|pg||
nt|col3435: I'd have just bid 4@h I think, can slam be that good?|pg||
nt|col3435: don't see how North can bid it|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  :-)|pg||
nt|othered1: I'd guess that in CR the NS *Know* they have a bad result . . .|pg||
nt|mdgraham: superficially, yes :) but one result is worse than the other, depending on your point of view  |pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  what is the probability of finding all 13 cards?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure|pg||
pc|s2|nt|col3435: well, like that, evidently :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: after Pass by S i think she MUST bid it|pg||
nt|kaapo: By eptying the box save 7@S and 7NT|pg||
nt|col3435: if pass is forcing|pg||
nt|yuval10: the play will be interesting...... she might know that W has only 3 @s's from the bid|pg||
nt|yuval10: she can ruff 2 @d's..... and see that E has 3|pg||
nt|kaapo: Has West still something to think about?|pg||
nt|yuval10: then 8-1-3-1|pg||
nt|suketbombi:  ok the result wud be the same  460|pg||
nt|suketbombi: the other semis lot of Puneiets have been asking as there latest Hero kaustub bendre is batlling out against MMS|pg||
nt|lml: it might have worked better for east west if east had bid 1@S over 1@H|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|chick: its not impossible that S will switch to spades, hoping to remove the entry to diamonds|pg||
nt|kaapo: North seems to have a chance for 10 tricks, if he raises the heart suit first|pg||
nt|yuval10: i belive she'll make it|pg||
nt|yuval10: sry HE will make it|pg||
nt|yuval10: because S is declarer|pg||
nt|kaapo: Cilla might make a comment about him never presenting a good dummy, and her showing an example :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think S will like the dummy he'll see :)  he knows it's a reasonable grand, now only have to make!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I think he will|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Would Haglund bid 6@S with @CQx?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: here too they wud think 10 imps gone|pg||
pc|sK|nt|burypies: czasami nawet Witek ma piki|pg||
nt|kaapo: Apparently their 2NT opening was something like 22-24|pg||
nt|mmmakela: -1|pg||
nt|kaapo: So 2@C followed by 2NT would be say 20-21|pg||
nt|varange: agreed|pg||
nt|suketbombi: sridhar your Favoraite pd Sudhir Inamdar has come out of retirement and playing in other room|pg||
nt|suketbombi: he will lead 2 rather than unconfortable 8|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: play out of turn....claiming at the end|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Must have a lot of shape for that|pg||
nt|yuval10: lead @d will make it easier for him |pg||
nt|lml: East also might have made a move over 2NT or balanced|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|nt|kaapo: This seems to lose 2 spades, @D and @C|pg||
nt|kaapo: After North's fine spade switch|pg||
pc|s8|nt|chick: this works to kill the diamonds, but let's W have 2 diamond tricks|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now 8|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: might endplay North|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|sA|nt|xenya: lucky layout for EW|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 2 bds i Imp subhash must be aware the match is close specialy after the 6@H went dn here|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mdgraham: looks like 4@c was an auto-splinter (a splinter agreeing my suit), but the values outside are quite soft|pg||
nt|mdgraham: incidentally, that last board - why did East play a club back after the @SA?|pg||
nt|lestergold: Cant blame Edwin for finding second best lead only lead tov pose a little challenge is a heart of course but woulodnt defeat the contract|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sT|pg||
nt|mmmakela: yes although obvious many wouldn't make it|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kaapo: Still more IMPs for Skalman on boards 19 (stopped at 3@S) and 20 (3NT went down)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lml: well I suppose that east-west had already lost this board at the other table so this isnt aas costly as it might have been|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mmmakela: next a club and then N must find H switch|pg||
nt|kaapo: Interesting lead holding AK|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|joemanjo: now can afford to misguess the clubs after the @h lead.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|abunio: jakos sie przeczolgal|pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: imp straty?|pg||
nt|varange: there is no justice!|pg||
nt|joemanjo: Cards lie so that the @h lead, though it attacked the weak spot, does not cause substantial dent to EW hands.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|yuval10: @h to T, A@d and @d ruff|pg||
nt|kaapo: So it's very important for Örebridgen that Mikael makes this, which does seem quite likely|pg||
pc|d5|nt|suketbombi: !A and Comfortable @C to T|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|joemanjo: did North bid only 2@h?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|chick: good time to play a spade and find an endplay|pg||
pc|hA|nt|burypies: piki zaj¹³ tonie musia³ ich kilka razy trzymaæ|pg||
nt|suketbombi: he will step up with @DA i presume|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kaapo: Two more boards of the match left|pg||
nt|suketbombi: may be when in with @SA he cud have playe a @C to T keeping all options open|pg||
nt|joemanjo: y|pg||
nt|joemanjo: or after @h q|pg||
nt|suketbombi: other semis Maya Mira Sneha were up 30 imps 12 bds to go dont have the running scores|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|lml: South was lucky to have no choice in diamonds too... the @D10 would have been a bad card to hold|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugraphzbf: boj¹ siê otworzyæ tego pika...|pg||
nt|kaapo: Perhaps EW need to start with @DA, @HA, @DK and a diamond ruffed with the 9|pg||

pc|c7|pg||
nt|joemanjo: wd give west a suspicious sideways glance now|pg||

nt|mdgraham: well, maybe North contributed to the luck factor with a slightly odd opening lead  |pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: 10 minus scores for EW on the trot....and they are in the lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: agree|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|davidstern: In the OR on this hand West opened 1@C, South reopened with a double, West redoubled to show his fine hand and then E/W lay down and let the opps play a normal heart partscore|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|daman: and in Denmark    they have a club with the same name   TGR      for The Great Roland|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: At the week-end, on BBO, David Gold said that he hated the idea of playing four-card majors alongside the weak 1NT. I rather agree with him.|pg||
nt|lestergold: there is a reason for opening leads from those holdings recommended as top from the interior sequence|pg||
nt|davidstern: This wont be much fun but likely win 1 imp|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|c4|nt|davidstern: And that was a fine example of why those are good leads|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|d5|pc|d8|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|nt|brolucius: When you have a balanced 12 opposite 11, the bidding goes 1@H - 2@D - 2NT - 3NT. No space for a game try.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|davidstern: I am not sure why North would NOT lead the 'normal' @D10|pg||

pc|s4|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||

pc|hT|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|lestergold: they have reputation as good players but I would guess there is an element of sponoprshi[p involved |pg||
pc|h9|pc|c6|pg||
nt|daman: some people play 2NT as asking pd   if I could have made a game try     what suit would have moved you to accept?|pg||
nt|brolucius: I'm sorry, my last comment was nonsense (as a few tactful kibitzers may have noticed). That is what happens when you play the strong 1NT and the 1NT rebid is therefore weak. ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: Apologies.|pg||

pc|s2|pc|c9|pc|hK|nt|daman: uh oh|pg||

nt|kaapo: After all, other table did avoid 3NT on board 5: East doubed 1@D and EW found their @S fit. Without a stopper, NS settled for 3@C|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2-way clubbers were able to stop low here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: @HQ makes this an excellent club slam|pg||
nt|col3435: another flat game here?|pg||
nt|varange: is this within their NT range?|pg||

nt|joemanjo: @c lead wd have put maximum pressure though|pg||
nt|xenya: but declarer didn't know that -- was he playing for 5 @Ds coming in? -- anyhow, good @D duck by S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but the West hand is quite suitable|pg||

nt|vasanti: he runs away with 7|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: yup....all playing the last few tricks fast|pg||
nt|suketbombi: so 2 imps now 2 bds sounds like cricket 20/20|pg||
nt|suketbombi:  no the auction was 1@C from Subhash and so on|pg||

nt|vugraphzpx: depends on the standings... :) so i have no idea|pg||
nt|varange: nope|pg||
nt|suketbombi: nicely executed good to watch |pg||
nt|joemanjo: other room played in 3N which is also equally dull|pg||
nt|suketbombi: nothing is routinr maoj they will never get @S fit|pg||
mb|1C|nt|varange: yes, another push methinks|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: Anyhow, we're on the last two boards and have comparisons from the open room|pg||
nt|kaapo: Richie Reisig, who by the way has partnered PO, might approve of 1@D, even if it were natural|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kaapo: And the score table looks still very interesting|pg||
nt|suketbombi: good reslt for e-w in other romm they have to get to this lucky game tho|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I agree with east's pass.  With 3 spades South knew his partner didnt have a trap pass|pg||
nt|lml: and so he didnt protect|pg||
mb|3N|nt|frankaus: brb|pg||

nt|kaapo: AKQx makes for a perfect overcall suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: board inverted. player names will differ|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: 5@D certainly looks like a good contract, but will likely fail with the spade finesse off|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That won't happen|pg||
nt|ralfwil: "who says that crime doesn´t pay" from Bridge in the menagery (about Hidgeous Hog)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: I'd have guessed North would open 1NT. Perhaps they play 15-17 1NT in third and fourth seat|pg||
nt|chick: and a non-transfer runout|pg||
nt|joemanjo: when in doubt ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5D looks the sensible contract here|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vugraphzpx: they play 14-16NT. Dont know why Olof didnt go for 1NT|pg||
nt|kaapo: Fredin - Lindkvist also missed the slam on board 7, playing at the 5 level...|pg||
nt|kaapo: However it was doubled, with an overtrick|pg||
nt|kaapo: Which was worth 11 IMPs, as you can see in the movie|pg||

nt|suketbombi: ok they will surely make this probably with an ot|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mmmakela: S's dbl???|pg||
nt|kaapo: I suppose most are old-fashioned with doubles facing a weak NT (if it was one) :)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Maybe Osborne did not realise that diamonds were blocked|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: He didn't|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: He has just said|pg||
nt|davidstern: In Australia it seems that almost every top player is playing in a sponsored partnership - and I do mean EVERY|pg||
nt|davidstern: It has very much changed the landscape of the game here|pg||
nt|lestergold: In UK most of the top players play in sponosred teams and often in sponosred partnerships too|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: The fields in top events are more compact around the middle |pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: Than they used to be 20-30 years ago|pg||
nt|lestergold: its the only way that a top player can play professionally basically|pg||
mb|1C|nt|davidstern: Very few teams to be feared|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I like 3NT very much|pg||
nt|daman: super bid|pg||
mb|2D!|an|18+ relay 3+!H - odwrotka|nt|daman: and bought Jxx of @H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, you get like that as you get older |pg||
nt|davidstern: That too|pg||
nt|hlortz: same in the USA|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: And partner is kind enough to produce @HJxx|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hallberg has a worldwide reputation for being an excellent pro to hire he has a lot of work in the US|pg||
nt|davidstern: I am on the seeding committee for our National Open Teams and I can tell you it has become a very different scene|pg||
mb|2H|an|=4!H 7-9|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Last time I watched one of these mid-week matches I said something about the difficulty of playing good bridge after a hard day at the office. The replies were along the lines of: ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: How many of this crowd actually work during the day?' Very cruel. Frances Hinden has quite a serious role in her company, I believe.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|davidstern: Gunnar is a great partner for a sponsor|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Indeed she has. Shell|pg||
nt|daman: take the money and run|pg||
nt|brolucius: All this thought and the @CQ will appear.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lestergold: we are singing frrom the same hymn sheet David|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d8|pg||
pc|hA|nt|davidstern: He is respectful and doesn't go around rubbishing his partner as some others do|pg||

nt|Walddk4: How can that be a psyche over a strong club?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He had what he promised|pg||
nt|Walddk4: One major, bad cards|pg||
nt|kaapo: Thanks a lot to Staffan Hed, our splendid operator!|pg||
nt|kaapo: Trust me, it's rather tiring operating the vugraph whole day|pg||
nt|chick: Staffan has been such an outstanding operator today!  Can't say enough good about him :)|pg||
nt|varange: last board of the session now|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 3 bds 24 to get|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: last board for this round|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: next round at 11:30am IST|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: there will be 4 rounds of semi finals|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: last board for this round|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: 2 more semi final rounds to go|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: next round at 2pm IST|pg||
nt|vasanti: partial hand again does not give much chance to swing|pg||
nt|suketbombi: does not matter namdev too will make ten tricks here|pg||
nt|joemanjo: 4@h anyone?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 63 63:):):):)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: oh they have missed a game there:)|pg||
nt|lml: what do you think?  I don't think that this north south will sell to 2@C,  Let's see|pg||
nt|lml: perhaps 1@H-1@S-dbl|pg||
nt|lml: operator has the play stopped?|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: nope. still thinking. small discussion at the table.|pg||
nt|lml: discussion between hands is usually not a good sign|pg||
nt|joemanjo: 3N (preempt or gambling?) was opened in the other room. North with controls in all suits should have perhaps DBLed and waited.|pg||
nt|joemanjo: Once he bid 4S, South took a shot at slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: Tack så mycket Staffan Hed, bra jobbat!|pg||
nt|kaapo: A great thank you for our marvellous operator, Staffan Hed, who had to wake up ridiculously early this morning to bring this show to us!|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 1nt any one?|pg||
nt|lml: I try to avoid it ... except for the good morning and well done parts|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: I don't object to that but I think it would be fair to state that 1NT is usually not 14 in 3rd hand then|pg||
nt|mmmakela: last here, thx kibs,Kaapo, Chick and Staffan for outstanding operator job!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: thank you, will try to keep myself from commentating though :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1@C 2+@C, natural or balanced|pg||
nt|yuval10: NS can find a good sacrifice in a major|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: not that early, about 7.50am.. :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: only -4|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with a little bit more @c lay, 5@c could have been better than 7-trumps @s game|pg||
nt|vasanti: 4hrt sld be on if they do find it agst boss suit|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mmmakela: hard to match the OR result here|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1@C 2-way|pg||
nt|kaapo: More tiring than actual playing, because you need to keep focused all the time|pg||
nt|kaapo: "Early bird opens the can of worms" or how does the saying go?|pg||
nt|col3435: hehe, almost|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: 2@D looks like natural and game forcing|pg||
nt|kaapo: Um, sorry, 1@C may have been strong for EW :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|kaapo: 1@D either 11-13 NT or unbalanced with a 4-card major; does not promise dimonds|pg||
nt|kaapo: And thanks Cornelia, Bob and Roland + kibs|pg||
nt|col3435: looks hard to avoid this one|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  anyway - game was poor|pg||
nt|vasanti: seems to be some systematic fit+club|pg||
nt|suketbombi: even intra finese working does not help 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzck: 3 more to go|pg||
nt|lestergold: same auction in open!|pg||
mb|2D|nt|sfoxa:  not so this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|jkmjanusz: 7IMP - ale raczej p³asciochy...|pg||
nt|burypies: nawet Wacek mo¿e mieæ problem|pg||
nt|mmmakela: needs the @S A lead to make 6|pg||
nt|kaapo: Would anyone try 3@C as North?|pg||
nt|lml: I might have bid 2@D with a spade tolerance but south thought his clubs were misplaced|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kaapo: Hmm, have they incorporated transfers into the system?|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2@S might show something like 8-12 here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 10-13|pg||
nt|vasanti:  anybody 4 4sp?|pg||
nt|lml: this is fine anyways|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: If he had a long minor instead of a major, it would be a psyche, but 1@H surely was not|pg||
nt|kaapo: That seems to be a raising trend in Sweden|pg||
nt|chick: no dummy-time naps :)|pg||
nt|col3435: club lead?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: subhash does not like to rebid weak suits ahead of his 6 card @S|pg||
mb|3H|nt|kaapo: Very standard bidding here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: except for when sundelin is on... then you get a nap or two... :)|pg||
nt|joemanjo: other room playing strong club both ways ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: so last board now thx all for watching!|pg||
nt|chick: hehehe|pg||
nt|lml: two spades should go down |pg||
mb|4C|nt|kaapo: Oh, I see. Glad you're there to correct us Staffan :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: should go one down |pg||
nt|joemanjo: in practise, almost impossible to get to @h contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzck: announcement at the venue|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: Dr. Sudhir Bapat has expired about half an hour back at the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: condolence meeting being held|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: may his soul rest in peace|pg||
nt|suketbombi:  2- here w/o @SQ lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: Q@d now?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 11 tricks?|pg||
nt|lestergold: or clubs in case?|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: east is asking questions about the 1D bid - it's either unbal with diamonds or 4441 with singleton club|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|kaapo: Det är sant det :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: thanks all|pg||
nt|lestergold: hasd north folloed low would Edwin have finessed the club? Not much room for south to hold much having shown up with K@h|pg||
nt|lestergold: at any rate very academic|pg||
nt|lestergold: well hope to c most of u for the second session|pg||
nt|hlortz: when do we restart?|pg||
nt|hlortz: the one big swing - 4@S in OR defender started K from KX of @D and set 4@S to win 13|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: Perhaps there's case for playing 5@C here too? Or 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|jkmjanusz: A, nie: zagrali vtylko 3@H|pg||
nt|abunio: chyba, ze drugi stol co postawi z paleczka|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Nie dograli popartyjnej koñcówki...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: After this it will be dinner break and the play will continue at 1915, maybe 1920|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes but they will loose 6/8 imps on this bd|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: Tied with 1st place now!|pg||
nt|kaapo: Tack!|pg||
nt|lml: this hand is easy peasy|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk4: wow, they stayed out of the laydown grand slam|pg||
nt|joemanjo: club Jack|pg||
pc|dA|nt|arvid: well done by Bergström to bid on 3NT|pg||
nt|col3435: I'm sure there are some who would give it away on the lead|pg||
nt|suketbombi: ok another push now 24 in 2|pg||
pc|d5|nt|abunio: Witus byl bezkompromisowy, a tam chyba dwukolorowka nie zagrala|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Tak: 2@C (dwukolor.) - 3@H invit...|pg||
nt|varange: that heart lead wasn't at all obvious|pg||
nt|suketbombi: :)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 3 Iidiots and the unsung +1 are in finals now:) |pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|chick: if he had bid 6, the @SA is a possible lead, but not at 4|pg||
nt|chick: Thanks to our excellent vugraph operator, Staffan Hed!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: Thank you all for watching and commentating :)|pg||
nt|chick: and thanks to my co-commentator, Markku Makela!    We'll be back soon with the next segment :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: thx Cornelia|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Anyway, well bid small slam by N-S next door|pg||
pc|hA|nt|suketbombi: life ban gaya|pg||
pc|h3|nt|joemanjo: 4 more boards and the win is now clear. Congratulations to "3 Idiots +1". 3 Idiots is the name of a movie that was released in India recently.|pg||
nt|joemanjo: I need to leave. Bye all.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kaapo: Here we saw the 3rd/5th lead versus notrumps|pg||
nt|lml: west of course doesnt know that hearts break but he can ruff one and throw one even if they dont|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|h2|nt|xenya: looks like NS can make 8 tricks in spades... -- perhaps on a different lead|pg||
pc|hK|nt|chick: should make this easily, even with the @HQ off|pg||
nt|kaapo: NS lack some aces to bring this home|pg||
nt|joemanjo: what?|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: missed play - claiming at the end|pg||
nt|joemanjo: certainly looked like that|pg||
nt|suketbombi: misplay or misclick?|pg||
nt|joemanjo: miskey|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: speed play....missed a trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: finals coming up soon|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: will be back shortly.....|pg||
pc|h6|nt|vugraphzck: next round coming up in a few minutes.......round 4 / 4 for semi finals|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kaapo: West cannot quite have @DAK so little chance to bring this down|pg||
nt|chick: if both A's in W would be ok|pg||
mc|12|nt|Walddk4: Back in 15 mins|pg||
nt|kaapo: Nicely fitting pair of hands|pg||
pg||
