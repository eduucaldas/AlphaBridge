mb|1D|mb|p|nt|gracelin: but then the contract is not down yet unless East can find a third round entry to West.|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|gracelin: 3rd round H entry|pg||
nt|petergill: Light openings at fav vulnerability are commonplace among experts nowadays|pg||
nt|mmmakela: both norths opened that hand 1 @D|pg||
mb|2H|mb|d!|an|3s|nt|gracelin: So the more I thk of it , the more I believe Piekarek's line is the best.|pg||
nt|petergill: As a result, when you are vul versus not vul against an expert, you can overcall 1NT fairly safely on 15 counts as their patrner might not double you, expecting a light opening ...|pg||
nt|petergill: opposite|pg||
mb|3H|mb|4D|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|d|mb|p|nt|petergill: The alert of 1@s is that they sometimes bid it on 3 cards|pg||

nt|mmmakela: 5422 and pd has 3 spades, I'd try my luck in defence|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|nt|petergill: 1@D = either 5+ @D 11-18 or 4441 , thus must be 5+ @D after Support Dbl|pg||

mb|2H|nt|Gerben42: i think with expected 22 HCP or so, you should take your plus|pg||
nt|jaapfr: re all|pg||
mb|d|nt|mdgraham: a somewhat attenuated 1@D opening, but has an easy rebid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: support double, by the look of it - showing three-card spade support|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mmmakela: absolutely no reason to bid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hi rashed  and Gudni|pg||
nt|mdgraham: playing that, a raise to 2@S would show four-card support.  |pg||
mb|3S|nt|mmmakela: good lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: has East done enough?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello from a snowy Manchester|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vinbtech: helo and wc to all|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is that bidding correct gudni?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello  vinay|pg||
nt|vugraphzcx: yes there are misunderstanding at the table |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: spade contracts played by east arent so threatened by a club lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Keep Alt down with your left hand while you type  0222 with your right hand. It's not difficult|pg||
nt|lestergold: well bullets nice suit poor and stuffingh non exiastent 2s was a free bid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i/ve tried that 15 times|pg||
nt|vinbtech: likely 3n interpreted as both majors !|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 3s would be an overbid|pg||
nt|sybarra2: welcome Martim|pg||
nt|jaapfr: difficult word Mike but got what you meant about 1@D:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: i never heard of that |pg||
nt|rnmalik: cards are very friendly for 4@H and 3NT for NS|pg||
pc|s7|nt|vinbtech: y a lucky break|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Gerben42: dont want to lead from honors behind the big NT|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s8|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|yo_yo: it's teams|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk4: What makes you think  TEAMS  is  MP?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: So it follows that Zia is pushing the boat out bidding 3@S with only three spades, but it has pushed EW to 4@H, where there should be four losers  |pg||
nt|jaapfr: not much chance to make this|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: very lucky for North South|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|mcarroll: Hi Shirley|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Sometimes I wish people would read what I write|pg||
nt|lestergold: in my dotage i forget what i read two days ago u know that roland|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vinbtech: but 3N should also make w/ 4 each in red suit and 1 black suit K at least|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk4: So take notes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i like that when i get it right|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|pg||
pc|c9|nt|vugraphzcx: N alert 3nt and say it is 5-5 major|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it looks as if the culprit is South  ( forgetting system)|pg||
nt|vinbtech: that explains it ! not 4-4 as i hazarded but 55|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but then Zia has been pushing the boat out for years, and it does not seem to have done huim any  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: ...him any harm|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Gerben42: will just scratch home|pg||
nt|chick: just cashing out for 7 tricks|pg||
nt|yo_yo: rise with the king, hurray|pg||
nt|lestergold: at any rate i think that 2s is quite enough on the east hand tatcics at imps are not to bid dodgy games non vul|pg||
nt|mcarroll: It looks like the defence will grab 5 tricks, then declarer 2 or 3, then the defence another - and Declarer gets the rest - 1NT making|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course the bidding and the layout lucky in some ways so ten tricks made|pg||

nt|xenya: Landin) for bringing this interesting event to the BBO audience. Thanks to my co-commentators  Patrick, Peter and Markku  --  and, of course, to all the spectators.   |pg||
nt|petergill: Admittedly, Lawrence and Wirgen's book is very hard to read, but one of its points - that the LoTT is good at 2 and 3 levels, no good at 4 and 5 levels - is a good one. |pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 1@S 11-15 5+ spades|pg||
mb|d|nt|gracelin: this is the sort of hands that I saw Meckwell open the south hand and bid to 3NT making from time to time.|pg||

nt|Gerben42: been in worse slams - 6@D |pg||
nt|mmmakela: here red slams|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i think partner would be surprised that you had 2 aces|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: yes it is max for the bid but it falls between stools its not really a 3S bid unless your methods can allow you to expres these values more accurately|pg||
nt|rnmalik: if that is a system then it is strange-one might get a hand in 200 deals where responder to 2NT has 5/5 majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: anyway that alt0222 doesnt work with my keyboard|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i agree Rashed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so the 1@D opening pays dividends|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i think 9 out of 4@H plays was down 1|pg||
nt|po-s: on the result page you can translate via Google (upper right corner)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 9 out of 10|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Gerben42: 6@S has issues with the trump distribution|pg||

nt|Gerben42: 6@H you cant bid - how would you find out about @HJ|pg||
nt|pelu: 1NT? 12-14 or 15-17?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: 2@C could be either natural or strong (Gazilli)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: iceland you have a wonderful bridge site with great photos|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: so can they locate 4-4 dias|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: but no names |pg||
nt|rnmalik: it also meand that with 3 cards of a major the contract would be 4 of that major|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Will EW talk NS out of their @H game?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 1@S could even go for 500|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lestergold: trump lead or heart lead and trump switch will leave declarer a trick short here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i like to see the participants photos|pg||
nt|rnmalik: EW can make 9 tricks as the cards are placed|pg||
nt|pelu: 15-17 I see :)|pg||

nt|jaapfr: indeed 3nt theoretically chance to make here but who will bid that:)??|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, when south didn't open his 11 count|pg||
nt|po-s: Hi Patrick|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Gerben42: no slam interest opposite 2@H (minimum)|pg||
nt|vinbtech: 2D= what they call Ekrens in this part 44+ H+S 5-10 i think|pg||
pc|s3|nt|yo_yo: looks like it but gib thinks differently|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|chick: 2@H is an artificial bid showing minimum hand?|pg||
nt|lestergold: no often a singleton trump in dummy is the contract making trick!|pg||
pc|c5|nt|yo_yo: set up @D?|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, South will open the bidding at some tables, I imagine|pg||
nt|gracelin: I will go to the other room where they are short of commentators. See you.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Bye|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, at some tables South will open, and then North might steamroller on|pg||
pc|c7|nt|yo_yo: Gudni,  can anyone tell us which photos are of the players here?|pg||
nt|pelu: decl need a lot of entries in dummy - will he top-play @Cs?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: then would make:)|pg||
nt|xenya: 16 pairs will play a complete round robin of 8-board matches. The format is IMPs converted to VPs using a 60:0 scale. This is Round 1 of 15. |pg||
pc|c8|pc|cQ|nt|Gerben42: yes, if 2@C was gazilli then 2@H shows 6-7 without 6-card @S|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so once again N gave up too easily, could investigate well below 4H-level|pg||
pc|c9|nt|yo_yo: anyone leading @C gives up a trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: not like this tho|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the only one i recognise is David Stevenson from Liverpool|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d8|nt|dburn: might also encourage North to do more bidding - slow stuff in opponent's suit usually good for notrump|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: well-judged by Welland?|pg||

pc|s8|pc|h9|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h6|nt|po-s: but I perhaps East could have 3136 as 2D was probably only a relay|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
mc|10|nt|jaapfr: 1@S1@H4@D and 3!@C so unbeatable even with x@H lead imo|pg||

mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|xenya: what a hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 5-11, at least 5/5 in @h and another|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hA|nt|gracelin: only 4S with the East hand ? |pg||

nt|dburn: and the way things have gone, 3@h will make anyway|pg||
nt|dburn: so I guess he should have bid it|pg||
nt|jaapfr: or opps max 3@H and 1@C so unbeatable it was even DD|pg||
nt|mdgraham: my word|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mmmakela: will watch more closely now I promise, was on the phone|pg||
nt|chick: partscores best possible here :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 4@H might depend on getting clubs right|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: in precision that used to be a club opening in the old days|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i bet east will go to game|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if @HA x@H x@S then it could down?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: interesting choice for East|pg||
mb|5S|nt|yo_yo: it was quite nice for declarer when South tackled trumps|pg||
nt|vinbtech: y the result justified 3H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If you subscribe to the Principle of Restricted Choice, you will get it right|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: a fit jump?|pg||
nt|vinbtech: a fit jump more likely |pg||
nt|rnmalik: very good hans for 5@D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@S is reasonable, but what about 5@S? Would that be the same as a 5@S opening  bid?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sorry for confusion i referred to x@H lead as unbeatable but with @HA x@H and @S switch it was DD down|pg||
mb|6S|nt|chick: "precision" has so many variations that its very name is a contradiction :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Tony Forrester did in the other room with no opponent bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_restricted_choice_(bridge)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's even more evident here where Kwiecien has shown a two-suiter by opening 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: http://www.slavacup.ru/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR the @D-lead gave Forrester a help to "see" 2 x singleton by West - with singleton @H (and no bid) u would not play the @Cs right|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 6@S pls|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rnmalik: hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: There's no Four-and-a-half spades card in the bidding box |pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphzdp: you can find current results here: http://www.slavacup.ru/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I bet Zia will get it right too if 4@H is the final destination|pg||
nt|jaapfr: vwd 5@S bid|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|nt|yo_yo: 2 10s, East will go |pg||
nt|po-s: dynamic 5S?|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|yo_yo: West i mean|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Same contract in Open|pg||
nt|jaapfr: dynamite?|pg||
mc|12|nt|mmmakela: E promising clubs with dbl so maybe 3 nt by south was the right bid, n must have some stuff in majors and often a 4th dia|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ruff and finesse @D?|pg||
pg||
qx|o16|st||md|2ST2HA7542D6CT8652,S875HK983DQT54C43,SAKQ3HQJDAJ7CAQJ9,SJ964HT6DK9832CK7|sv|e|nt|petergill: How would you bid it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: north made a clever pass over 2C, looks like unfit in both red suit, which made East believe his partner is all red.|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|gracelin: I would double, Peter, or Cue 3C if their system allows it.|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|p|nt|petergill: True. And North's pass helped South not bid to the five level with his 6-6|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|mmmakela: 3 @C 1st and then 4 spades for me, N surely showed long clubs|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|p|mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|petergill: Polish Club, or more precisely Baltic Club they (NS) call it|pg||
nt|gracelin: 6C is a good contract but not making here with both finesses wrong.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d3|nt|petergill: 1@D 0-6 any,  or 7+ no 4M |pg||
nt|petergill: 3@D transfer|pg||
nt|petergill: 2NT 23-24 balanced|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|gracelin: an interesting play problem.  What shud declarer do after winning the first D.  Play CA and club is risky if West has CK.|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, the right line is not clear|pg||
nt|gracelin: on the other hand if you finesse HK and that is wrong, you may also go down in a makeable contract.|pg||
nt|mmmakela: E must have @C K in 3 nt|pg||
nt|petergill: If @CK is onside nonsingleton, you have to play @H to ace then finesse in @C|pg||
nt|gracelin: in the end I thk declarer may still choose to play CA and another club|pg||
nt|mmmakela: or singl in W|pg||
nt|xenya: nasty dilemma|pg||
nt|gracelin: because no line is comletely safe.|pg||
nt|petergill: I think @CA is best play, looking at 26 cards|pg||
nt|xenya: :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: he may also try to combine both chances, HQ, then if no cover, take HA and finesse CK. But that will g down here.|pg||
nt|petergill: @SA first, to check for singleton jack|pg||
nt|gracelin: Good point.  Those extra chances, no matter how slim, some bring you fruitful outcome.|pg||
nt|petergill: Cannot pick up @CKxxx if 4-0 break on the finesse line |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|xenya: following Peter's line...|pg||
nt|gracelin: the SA play distinguished a world class player with just ordinery experts.|pg||
nt|petergill: Most people I know rate Piekarek and Smirnov as Germany's number one pair these days. They did top the datums in the Bermuda Bowl in Sao Paulo. |pg||
nt|petergill: In Round 1, Gromov lost to his wife - not that embarrassing, as she is a World Champion. |pg||
nt|gracelin: so that makes them not only top pair in Germany, but the wole world. :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I bet on @C A|pg||
nt|gracelin: The bet is not accepted.|pg||
nt|petergill: In Round 1, NS beat their countrywomen Daniella von Arnim and Sabine Auken. It's good organization in these Round Robin events to have you play friends and countrymen in Round 1. |pg||

nt|xenya: Landin) for bringing this interesting event to the BBO audience. Thanks to my co-commentators  Roland, Peter and Rashed  --  and, of course, to all the spectators.   |pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: yes, 9 imps on board 1 when NS sacrificed in 5@Dx|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|mmmakela: that kind of 3-way 2@C  opening isn't allowed in many countries because itdoesn't include an anchor suit|pg||

nt|vugraphzcx: yes as far as I know|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: now it is clear after @H and @S bids and instead of DBL N could bid 4NT with that hand|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Only a 5 imp swing I miscounted the undertricks in the Open|pg||
nt|jaapfr: my quess team 2 to win this with 1 imp:)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|yo_yo: bye and quick recovery |pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5 matches of 8 boards today, 6 tomorrow and 4 on Monday. I believe the upcoming Monday is a public holiday in Russia. Maybe Vladimir can confirm|pg||
nt|xenya: actually the holiday is on 23rd, but Monday is a non- working day too|pg||

nt|Walddk4: The results of rounds in IMPs will be converted to VPs using a 60:0 scale. In calculating the datum score (= average score) on each board, about 50% (but not more) of the scores (a ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: quarter from the top and a quarter from the bottom) will not be taken into account|pg||
nt|pelu: and 44-16 = win by 14 IMPs = a gameswing! - hard scale|pg||
