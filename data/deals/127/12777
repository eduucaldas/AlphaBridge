nt|mdgraham: reached 7@C|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulhac:  They are running hot|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|paulhac:  Do not think they can make it unless they get the trumps right|pg||
nt|gracelin: they already scored 2140 :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|paulhac:  I am on this hand Patrick:)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hT|nt|petergill: pitch club on spade, then ruff club with @H6 ---> gets interesting|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|gracelin: just noticed|pg||
pc|c7|nt|petergill: Two top clubs first, to see if queen drops?|pg||
nt|gracelin: unfortunately, East's H8 will prevent dealcrer from ruffing the 3rd club.|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Yes needed a trump back from Fu|pg||
nt|petergill: Fu is worried that the @d's will set up - hence the club switch when a trump works better if he can see all 52 cards|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|cJ|nt|petergill: good duck of @HAKx by Jack Zhao|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h8|pc|d4|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|gracelin: so Fu needs not return a trump, he can score one with his H8|pg||
pc|d2|nt|petergill: Yes, I missed that|pg||
nt|paulhac:  True|pg||
mc|9|nt|petergill: Normal play by everyone|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and that's that....thanks all, and thank you operator |pg||
nt|gracelin: tks all and bye|pg||
nt|vugraphzdn: http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm|pg||
nt|vugraphzdn: we will continue in about 1.5 hours|pg||
nt|petergill: In the rankings, Zia and Roy Welland still lead the event, from Forrester - Malinowski and Fu - Jack ref http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm|pg||
nt|petergill: At http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava10/slava10t16r8.htm Table 5 has entered the 1020 for 6NT on Bd 62 instead of Board 61. That scoring error will be fixed up.|pg||
nt|petergill: so that means Zia and Welland are the only pair of 7 pairs so far to bid the grand slam|pg||
nt|xenya: There will be  a break for dinner now. Play will resume in about an hour and half. Stay tuned|pg||

nt|ady: likely slam for n/s to start|pg||
nt|ady: only danger is they get to a grand and fail|pg||
nt|ady: maybe an old hand  |pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: hello cornelia|pg||
nt|mmmakela: not much here for either side|pg||
nt|Gerben42: still might land in 3N|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 1 nt NS best|pg||
nt|Gerben42: will you bid stayman over 1N? then they play 2@H|pg||
nt|mmmakela: no I pass gladly|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what does it mean?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and i've been trying alt0222 |pg||
nt|yo_yo: nothing happens|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no idea what Roland meant|pg||
nt|lestergold: E/W could find a thin spade game here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: To get the  Þ|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i tried it roland|pg||
nt|lestergold: have to guerss hearts to have a chance|pg||
nt|vugraphzcx: Hello and welcome |pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome to Moscow|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good morning/afternoon all|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: Hello|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello and welcome back|pg||
nt|mdgraham: two very strong pairs here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hi Jaap :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: exciting hand to start|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@S unbeatable:)?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: hello everyone|pg||
nt|jtr: It is written:)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jaapfr: re all|pg||
nt|sharkey: We're back|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: hello|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello and welcome all|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk4: Get a chat line and press Alt0222|pg||
nt|vugraphzcx: My name is Gudni and I´ll be your operator to day in closed room|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi Jaap|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@S sharp but can|pg||
nt|rnmalik: hello and 4@S EW makes only 3 losers|pg||
nt|sharkey: starting with a tie hand - 20 points a side|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|yo_yo: nothing|pg||
nt|granguru: in effect Zia itself is here |pg||
nt|jtr: Welland opened a worse hand in this position last match|pg||
nt|sharkey: Hi Rashed & Ivan|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: i think with expected 22 HCP or so, you should take your plus|pg||
nt|jaapfr: re all|pg||
nt|roswolf: slam in diamonds is makeable|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi rashed|pg||
nt|jaapfr: asks minor|pg||
nt|jtr: I thought this might be thrown in|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi Carl,Ivan|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mdgraham: a somewhat attenuated 1@D opening, but has an easy rebid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: support double, by the look of it - showing three-card spade support|pg||
nt|jaapfr: true but biddable?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: absolutely no reason to bid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hi rashed  and Gudni|pg||
nt|mdgraham: playing that, a raise to 2@S would show four-card support.  |pg||
nt|roswolf: well west has to show them now|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mmmakela: good lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: has East done enough?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello from a snowy Manchester|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Pointwise it is 21 vs 19|pg||
nt|xenya: http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm  for standings|pg||
nt|jtr: I guess he will raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|vinbtech: helo and wc to all|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is that bidding correct gudni?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello  vinay|pg||
nt|vugraphzcx: yes there are misunderstanding at the table |pg||
nt|roswolf: welland +zia wont sit quietly|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Its different when you are leading|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: spade contracts played by east arent so threatened by a club lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Keep Alt down with your left hand while you type  0222 with your right hand. It's not difficult|pg||
nt|lestergold: well bullets nice suit poor and stuffingh non exiastent 2s was a free bid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i/ve tried that 15 times|pg||
nt|vinbtech: likely 3n interpreted as both majors !|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 3s would be an overbid|pg||
nt|sybarra2: welcome Martim|pg||
nt|jaapfr: difficult word Mike but got what you meant about 1@D:)|pg||
nt|jtr: Trump lead best|pg||
nt|sharkey: Zmudzinski-Witel are placed 14th of 16 - shows the quality of this field|pg||
nt|sharkey: Looks like 4@H may have a play...|pg||
nt|sharkey: Have to guess a little...|pg||
pc|dK|nt|yo_yo: i never heard of that |pg||
nt|rnmalik: cards are very friendly for 4@H and 3NT for NS|pg||
nt|sharkey: some may not open N hand....|pg||
nt|jtr: I guess East has shown hs shape and West will be interested facing a single @d|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@H|pg||
nt|sharkey: 11 tricks in @H and 10 or 11 in NT|pg||
nt|jtr: although 3NT maybe also shows a minimum (seems to use up a lot of space)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Standings - http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava10/slava10t16r7.htm|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes but a better contract, makeable|pg||
nt|jaapfr: re|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vinbtech: y a lucky break|pg||
nt|roswolf: the 3@H bid interfered nicely with the e/w auction|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 5@C vuln safe -1 is a good result but unbiddable|pg||
nt|jaapfr: although 3nt and 5@C fine too|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Gerben42: dont want to lead from honors behind the big NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: and this is mps not right to push for dodgy games|pg||
nt|sybarra2: *Martin|pg||
nt|jaapfr: indeed 6@S DD and unbeatable DD|pg||
nt|sharkey: Yes - Zmud looking for slam?|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true|pg||
nt|xenya: this rates to make -- particularly after W's overcall|pg||
nt|rnmalik: by X showed 5M and 4 major, is that it|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, i meant E"s overcall|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S was quite aggressive since it's likely to be only a 5-3 fit|pg||
nt|granguru: It has some merits...some|pg||
nt|jtr: 4@c KC probably|pg||
nt|sharkey: give up 3 @H tricks perhaps|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rnmalik: agree but cards are very friendly here|pg||
nt|athene: west judges that he has enough entries to his hand (trumps and @HK) that the defence can't kill them all before the clubs are up and running|pg||
nt|po-s: what about a small club?|pg||
nt|jtr: No, not Gerber!|pg||
nt|jaapfr: allergy:)?|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Key card for clubs|pg||
pc|h3|nt|granguru: giving a lead..f.i.|pg||
nt|granguru: opps may err Q-A position|pg||
nt|jtr: Why is he thinking?|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Of all the conventions which most top players dislike Gerber is No 1|pg||
nt|sharkey: Everyone's thinking today David...|pg||
pc|hT|nt|yo_yo: it's teams|pg||
nt|jtr: He played rather quickly to trick one|pg||
nt|sharkey: Flannery  2?|pg||
nt|jtr: The play will be quicker than the bidding|pg||
nt|jtr: One hopes........|pg||
nt|jaapfr: claim 11 in tr 3?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Zia still has to lead...|pg||
nt|jtr: @s probably|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: What makes you think  TEAMS  is  MP?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: So it follows that Zia is pushing the boat out bidding 3@S with only three spades, but it has pushed EW to 4@H, where there should be four losers  |pg||
nt|jaapfr: not much chance to make this|pg||
nt|jtr: Mere mortals lead the @dJ:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and duck too K for 12 tr:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y  but now down SD logic but DD we all would make:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi Jaap|pg||
pc|c7|nt|yo_yo: very lucky for North South|pg||
nt|jtr: Oh duck this even|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but N should know E short in @D|pg||
nt|sharkey: Dont think makeable now|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3@H and @C|pg||
pc|c8|nt|rnmalik: 1@H+1@D+1@C=3|pg||
nt|athene: yes, a small club from north might work a treat|pg||
nt|jtr: God knows what his plan is|pg||
nt|jtr: why no @d finesse there?|pg||
nt|jtr: Ah:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi rashed|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mcarroll: Hi Shirley|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh u sure it bwa pairs last time i commentated yesterday|pg||
nt|lestergold: even tho it said imps are u sure Kath|pg||
nt|yo_yo: tomorrow is another day :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Mike, it's all in your e-mail|pg||
nt|sharkey: Take @CA and dump a @S?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|po-s: nine will force kng, hen all over|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might draw all the trumps and finesse clubs|pg||
nt|po-s: small club may result in trump drawing and club finesse!!|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 8@H very vital card in E|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rnmalik: but sequence have no knowledge|pg||
pc|cA|nt|yo_yo: http://reykjavikbridgefestival.com/index.php?m=E1&id=M_TEAMS2010&iid=IF_OPENTEAMS2010&m=D3|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Sometimes I wish people would read what I write|pg||
nt|lestergold: in my dotage i forget what i read two days ago u know that roland|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|sharkey: may make this...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm  for standings|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|nt|vinbtech: but 3N should also make w/ 4 each in red suit and 1 black suit K at least|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk4: So take notes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i like that when i get it right|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|paulhac:  Hi everyone|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzcx: N alert 3nt and say it is 5-5 major|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it looks as if the culprit is South  ( forgetting system)|pg||
nt|vinbtech: that explains it ! not 4-4 as i hazarded but 55|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but then Zia has been pushing the boat out for years, and it does not seem to have done huim any  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: ...him any harm|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Gerben42: will just scratch home|pg||
nt|chick: just cashing out for 7 tricks|pg||
nt|yo_yo: rise with the king, hurray|pg||
nt|lestergold: at any rate i think that 2s is quite enough on the east hand tatcics at imps are not to bid dodgy games non vul|pg||
nt|mcarroll: It looks like the defence will grab 5 tricks, then declarer 2 or 3, then the defence another - and Declarer gets the rest - 1NT making|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ok 12 claim in tr 6|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|xenya: thoughtful play, @D from hand|pg||
nt|xenya: Welcome to Paul Hackett|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi|pg||
nt|xenya: but the @SK was not so good |pg||
nt|jaapfr: now @HJ|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi |pg||
nt|athene: these hands are always tricky, both to play and defend|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, i think East will overfuff the 3rd @c and play trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The results of rounds in IMPs will be converted to VPs using a 60:0 scale. In calculating the datum score (= average score) on each board, about 50% (but not more) of the scores (a ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: quarter from the top and a quarter from the bottom) will not be taken into account|pg||
nt|jtr: 4th @c|pg||
nt|granguru: so how many are taken into account?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: of course the bidding and the layout lucky in some ways so ten tricks made|pg||
nt|rnmalik: someone surely did:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: lol|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sorry i have no link to running scores   who has?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nor me, sorry|pg||
pc|h8|pc|d4|pc|cQ|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h8|nt|petergill: On Bd 25, Artur Malinowski really could have safely opened 1@S - upgrading 5332 19 counts with a small doubleton to open 2Tt is an overall losing philosophy, in my opinion|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hT|pg||
pc|h9|pc|d7|pc|d5|pc|d8|pg||
nt|gracelin: agree, hishand is suit oriented.|pg||

nt|Gerben42: been in worse slams - 6@D |pg||
nt|mmmakela: here red slams|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i think partner would be surprised that you had 2 aces|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: yes it is max for the bid but it falls between stools its not really a 3S bid unless your methods can allow you to expres these values more accurately|pg||
nt|rnmalik: if that is a system then it is strange-one might get a hand in 200 deals where responder to 2NT has 5/5 majors|pg||
nt|xenya: oh he can of course|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt from zia i assume|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Hi everyone|pg||
nt|jaapfr: again 4@S-1?|pg||
mb|1C|nt|yo_yo: anyway that alt0222 doesnt work with my keyboard|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i agree Rashed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so the 1@D opening pays dividends|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i think 9 out of 4@H plays was down 1|pg||
nt|po-s: on the result page you can translate via Google (upper right corner)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 9 out of 10|pg||
nt|jtr: Nothing makes here|pg||
nt|jaapfr: will they beat 4@H (we must assume Zia will:)|pg||
nt|jtr: I think North will be on lead|pg||
nt|jtr: At this table anyway|pg||
nt|paulhac:  On a good day 4@H would make|pg||
nt|sharkey: W may bid 2 NT|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if played by E much more chance:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: 6@S has issues with the trump distribution|pg||
nt|athene: hi good afternoon|pg||
nt|rnmalik: hi and welcome|pg||
nt|athene: now 4@S looks likely although it's just about possible north might go for 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: there are certainly hands where 3nt is better but it's a swingy view to take|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mmmakela: 6 spades needs guessing|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the youngsters tend to remember these things.  Are NS youngsters?|pg||
nt|jtr: 2@s|pg||
nt|jtr: surely|pg||
nt|rnmalik: partial available all round|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: oh|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jaapfr: now simple 3nt+2 or so so coffee break|pg||
nt|jtr: Not that it will matter|pg||
mb|p|nt|vinbtech: one of them is surely NOT  he FORGOT ! lol|pg||
nt|jaapfr: will he pass???|pg||
nt|sharkey: Welland may push Vul...|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3@S I bet|pg||
nt|sharkey: If invitational|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and 3@S would make|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/y8rdsoc  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 6@H you cant bid - how would you find out about @HJ|pg||
nt|pelu: 1NT? 12-14 or 15-17?|pg||
nt|jtr: Nicely organised as it happens|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @S lead or @CA not easy|pg||
nt|jtr: @cA possible|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Whats the betting Zia leads a diamond|pg||
nt|sharkey: Why wud W want the lead into East's hand? Peeked?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: 2@C could be either natural or strong (Gazilli)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: iceland you have a wonderful bridge site with great photos|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i bet that this makes|pg||
nt|jtr: Well done Paul:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: so can they locate 4-4 dias|pg||
nt|roswolf: one tip about playing against zia was that if he didnt bid you should assume a bal hand of less than 7/8 hcp!! true on this hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: but no names |pg||
nt|rnmalik: it also meand that with 3 cards of a major the contract would be 4 of that major|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Will EW talk NS out of their @H game?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 1@S could even go for 500|pg||
nt|roswolf: this also applies to all very aggressive players|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2 NT some kind of relay I presume|pg||
nt|jaapfr: you win|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lestergold: trump lead or heart lead and trump switch will leave declarer a trick short here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i like to see the participants photos|pg||
nt|rnmalik: EW can make 9 tricks as the cards are placed|pg||
nt|pelu: 15-17 I see :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: an upgraded 15-17|pg||
nt|mdgraham: big view to pass though. |pg||
nt|jaapfr: y|pg||
nt|roswolf: can be sometimes a valuable inference in the play|pg||
pc|dA|nt|xenya: yes i know|pg||
nt|pelu: in on @CQ NS has to take the 4 @S-tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: sorry private|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @C play would determine the fate of the contract after this lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Operator, please delete the  h  in Kwiecien|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|rnmalik: hi Peter, Vladinir|pg||
nt|rnmalik: vladimir-sorry|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I suppose a pair of loonies might, but NS are definitely not that|pg||
nt|athene: Jxxx is a horrible lead, but all west's lead choices were horrible :)|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Zia will be delighted with the lead|pg||
nt|athene: i'm told it's actually against the rules to lead from Jxxx in Sweden|pg||
nt|rnmalik: interesting even if your P has bid the suit|pg||
nt|po-s: no, no, not when it is right|pg||
nt|athene: EW play 4th best leads i guess?|pg||
nt|athene: so east knows zia has five hearts|pg||
nt|paulhac:  East is thinking about whether his partner could have the K@S in which case dummy could be dead or whether he needs to win and switch|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lestergold: now 6 top losers|pg||
nt|athene: his problem is, if he takes the @HA right away and switches, that sets up the @HQ as an entry|pg||
nt|sharkey: View the bonus for game Vul players tend to stretch.  Experts will bid games when the chance of success is no more than 37-38% due to the game bonus available|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello Patrick|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hello Roland|pg||
nt|jaapfr: indeed 3nt theoretically chance to make here but who will bid that:)??|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, when south didn't open his 11 count|pg||
nt|po-s: Hi Patrick|pg||
nt|athene: it's normal for opener to prefer the suit contract with three, so east is assuming his partner has four spades|pg||
nt|athene: so it's not impossible he has the king|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3@D may deny @C control - thus W places the final contact|pg||
nt|sharkey: *contract|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Gerben42: no slam interest opposite 2@H (minimum)|pg||
nt|vinbtech: 2D= what they call Ekrens in this part 44+ H+S 5-10 i think|pg||
pc|h4|nt|yo_yo: looks like it but gib thinks differently|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: all lines now can not go wrong|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rnmalik: true but after NT by Zia, Wellan could count more than 3 losers|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|chick: 2@H is an artificial bid showing minimum hand?|pg||
nt|lestergold: no often a singleton trump in dummy is the contract making trick!|pg||
pc|h8|nt|yo_yo: set up @D?|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, South will open the bidding at some tables, I imagine|pg||
nt|gracelin: I will go to the other room where they are short of commentators. See you.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Bye|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|nt|jaapfr: not surprisingly ns do end in 4@H with no ot|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, at some tables South will open, and then North might steamroller on|pg||
nt|jaapfr: +1 can if @CA @C @C|pg||
nt|xenya: stopping in 4@H was a tiny problem perhaps -- the rest should be easy|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Difficult to see this going off as he has not got entries to misguess hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|jaapfr: lol|pg||
pc|s5|nt|yo_yo: Gudni,  can anyone tell us which photos are of the players here?|pg||
nt|pelu: decl need a lot of entries in dummy - will he top-play @Cs?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: then would make:)|pg||
nt|xenya: 16 pairs will play a complete round robin of 8-board matches. The format is IMPs converted to VPs using a 60:0 scale. This is Round 1 of 15. |pg||
nt|sharkey: Give Zia @DQ instead of @CQ...|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sA|nt|Gerben42: yes, if 2@C was gazilli then 2@H shows 6-7 without 6-card @S|pg||
nt|sharkey: E masy have to guess in @C after leading low to K and 9|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so once again N gave up too easily, could investigate well below 4H-level|pg||
pc|s3|nt|yo_yo: anyone leading @C gives up a trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: not like this tho|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the only one i recognise is David Stevenson from Liverpool|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|pc|s9|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ok +1 auto now|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mdgraham: also if South opens West will bid spades, which will help in the play|pg||
nt|rnmalik: changes the whole hand and now makes 4|pg||
nt|xenya: 10 tricks now but perhaps the defence would have been different against 4@S|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: yes gib right if ducks a diamond!|pg||
pc|c3|nt|roswolf: http://www.slavacup.ru/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm is the link to results etc|pg||
nt|athene: zia is hoping that he will get a chance to set up tricks in both hearts and clubs|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think some top players may have invited with North's hand; I'm not sure S wud have accepted though|pg||
nt|jaapfr: re  vlad|pg||

mb|p|nt|petergill: the usual Gambling 3NT|pg||

nt|po-s: no entry to diamonds even if "found"|pg||
nt|athene: but when declarer runs a suit immediately, even good defenders will often give tricks away|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Good pairs result and probably an Imp|pg||
nt|jaapfr: missed why he did not play @D back (reasoning N)??|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: yes that too|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mmmakela: 1 H from N?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: again a DD slam with all cards sitting nicely|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes my kind of grand:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 7nt unbeatable|pg||
nt|jaapfr: he does not want to spend a play of 1 card too many whilst claiming: i love it:)|pg||
nt|athene: true the diamonds weren't good anyway but zia didn't know that, is what i meant|pg||
nt|po-s: 4spades might even go down|pg||
nt|granguru: 2NT looks like LSGT..3@D cue positive so game is bid|pg||
nt|granguru: Long Suit Game Try|pg||
nt|jaapfr: oh ic|pg||
nt|jaapfr: thought by disc @SJ thant he had to attack @CQ as entry|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzcx: working on the photos hehe|pg||

nt|jaapfr: to eliminate a @S win in dummy|pg||
nt|sharkey: Zhao opened 3 NT OR...|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mcarroll: N trying to make up for underbidding the last hand by going overboard on this one?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: pity that 4@H has here no chance|pg||
nt|sharkey: And I think N will raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@H looks purely competitive, so N may well pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: Hachett: 1Nt (weak) and passed out - here EW wscaped|pg||
nt|granguru: would you defend 4@S with South hand if p had never bid|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@S by EW a bit lunatic imo:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: better hand after X Zia would have bid 4|pg||
nt|sharkey: Click on flashing green light on Round 8 for Board update|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: transfer to @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Zia going for the 3NT money if partner has a @s stop|pg||
nt|sharkey: trump lead will set it 2 i think|pg||
nt|granguru: Hot second|pg||
nt|sharkey: Zia thinking x?|pg||
nt|sharkey: or 4 NT?|pg||
nt|granguru: defending|pg||
nt|jtr: X probably|pg||
nt|jtr: But he will pass|pg||
nt|granguru: a x only if it not a pen one|pg||
nt|sharkey: He will not bid 5@C as kib suggests...|pg||
nt|granguru: agree|pg||
nt|granguru: 4NT is much better|pg||
nt|jtr: X or pass the only options|pg||
nt|granguru: showing more @Cs than @D|pg||
nt|sharkey: Rite you are Vladimir|pg||
pc|cK|nt|yo_yo: great  gudni  :)|pg||
nt|xenya: seems strange W didn't open 1@D -- it does look like some version of Polish Club?|pg||
nt|jtr: He knows 5m is probably not making|pg||
pc|c5|nt|vinbtech: on a D lead; has only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a nice simple sequence, WD  EW|pg||
nt|mdgraham: slight disparity of contracts....not sure what 1N is|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS need to get @S into play|pg||
nt|jtr: tempted to bid 2@d|pg||
nt|jaapfr: -1 possible|pg||
pc|c9|nt|vugraphzcx: E/W are playing prec|pg||
nt|mmmakela: brb|pg||
nt|lestergold: game not an awful proposition here but doomed with both trump honours offside|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i feel uneasy with East's bidding thee|pg||
nt|yo_yo: there|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 1NT not enough for game ( as i understand it) then he jumps to game |pg||
nt|athene: interesting the south in the other room didn't open|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a X by E was not too standard|pg||
nt|jtr: But he should know partner has 4@hs|pg||
nt|xenya: but 3@H is not a piece of cake either|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if @D now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and to find @CT as reentry|pg||
nt|xenya: not obvious from W's perspective i think|pg||
nt|jaapfr: too much DD|pg||
pc|cA|nt|paulhac:  With the double this might well make|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe 1NT is M-m?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jaapfr: 2@S-5 no one had a X chance:)|pg||
nt|athene: it looks normal enough to me|pg||
nt|sharkey: Easier from here .....|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c2|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Though we can see this is an easy make declarer will be worried in case both spades and the Q@H are badly placed|pg||
nt|xenya: spectators in the other room had a rare chance to see a psychic transfer |pg||
nt|jaapfr: lovely 2@H bid but could end as disaster|pg||
nt|jaapfr: we  all agree:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: lol|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d3|nt|yo_yo: seems a shame it's going down |pg||
nt|mdgraham: quasi-forcing, maybe|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: on natural methods there is an argument for an invite of 3S rather than a unilateral 4 but west ould probably decline its quite a good contract but unlucky|pg||
nt|jaapfr: anyway 3nt most likely to fail so 1nt+1 optimal imo|pg||
nt|jaapfr: funny thing of bridge S is fearing now to go down: even in 3nt|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We are in Moscow for the annual Slava Cup|pg||
nt|roswolf: but he will be happy soon|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Good 7@D|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mcarroll: Communications are not very fluid for declarer, and the defence will try not to help him, but may be forced to |pg||
nt|mcarroll: S should probably have ducked, even though it was only postponing the problem. what to lead now?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: (opening looks normal, i mean, not passing :) )|pg||
nt|dburn: not really|pg||
nt|xenya: too late -- now the @D only helps declarer|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|paulhac:  Some may consider it too good for a weak 2 at the vul but would be reluctant to open 1|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.slavacup.ru/  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|jtr: Seems no rush though|pg||
nt|dburn: he did not want West to cash that @dJ - he would have made the contract if West had not done so|pg||
nt|jaapfr: defense seems appropiate until now|pg||
nt|dburn: this defence is fine - not cashing the diamond would have let the contract through|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rnmalik: good lead and -1 I think|pg||
nt|granguru: A trump lead would have been better|pg||
nt|granguru: @S of course now|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mcarroll: On board 2 in the Open NS had no difficulty bidding the @H game which was played in 1NT here generating the first significant swing|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y true specs @HT is needed not to be trown in in E to get it down|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vinbtech: y no SJ coming down in 2|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sharkey: W forced to take @H finesse to have a chance|pg||
pc|h3|nt|xenya: hardly if you play a weak NT|pg||
nt|jaapfr: psyches in general do generate tops or bottoms but mostly frustrated partners:)|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mcarroll: the defence will have to get a @D and will then take the @HA to defeat this contract|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, is that true?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jtr: I wonder if a @d would have worked|pg||
nt|jtr: At trick 3|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: 11 chunky points and an outside doubleton and also partner has opened second position at unfavourable which means his opening should be robust rather than  light|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Much too good in my style|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|roswolf: and now a show up squeeze|pg||
nt|jtr: Say he switches to a @s|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 9@D pass and claim|pg||

nt|jaapfr: 5@C down too|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes you do it to gain a tempo, so that declarer can't take the deep finesse and force the ace|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I thought T@D on Ace was to switch to @S|pg||
nt|sharkey: dont think so - N wud get a @C ruff with @S9|pg||

nt|mdgraham: possible|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y with solid 4@S|pg||
nt|sharkey: Welland didnt open with 11 and stiff - did with 10....|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulhac:  ambitious 6@S but could have worked on a different layout|pg||
nt|jaapfr: due to x@C in E 6@S down pity whilst fine contract|pg||
nt|xenya: the score on the screen only shows a comparison between 2 tables, actually there are 8 tables in play|pg||
nt|athene: 6-2 spade fit played in 3nt a moment ago|pg||
nt|athene: now a 4-4 spade fit played in 3nt|pg||

pc|sA|nt|dburn: spades? why not diamonds?|pg||
nt|dburn: at any rate, I am off to do the Junior Camrose - have fun|pg||

nt|sharkey: Neither EW ventured into the bidding - surprisingly|pg||
pc|s3|nt|po-s: bye David |pg||
nt|jaapfr: bye|pg||
nt|roswolf: makes me ashamed to be english:(|pg||
nt|jaapfr: confusing Vlad:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: anyway the 2@S bid is a clear warning which was not there in OR|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Ace less may pass|pg||
nt|xenya: not really Jaap -- there are 16 pairs in competition and the format is IMPs converted to VPs on a datum basis|pg||
nt|jaapfr: aha if trump a @C with @SQ all is well|pg||
nt|paulhac:  I agree with the kitbitzers that you can make 6@S  but not so obvious to do so on a trump lead|pg||
nt|paulhac:  6@S could be called unlucky |pg||
nt|jtr: Rebid problems and position mattered to him|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: yes, a lot of work to do with only a 4-4 fit, despite having no losers|pg||
nt|granguru: other was the other way around|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 5 dias can be made if accident but can go down too|pg||
nt|pelu: he played 4x1H first - and disc a @D|pg||
nt|rnmalik: could bid and make 6@D also|pg||
nt|xenya: NS can make 6@D here -- but that certainly looks far-fetched|pg||

nt|lestergold: diamodns reasonable 6/2 fit|pg||
nt|roswolf: 12/13 imps on a coffee hand|pg||
nt|athene: even assuming you play it the right way round|pg||
nt|po-s: not such a lot if the red suits - or one of them behaved|pg||
nt|granguru: it is like getting involved with a woman when single and when married...risks are different|pg||

nt|yo_yo: hope some of your "laws" come up|pg||
nt|vinbtech: a loser in each suit; he has to avoid 1 of them at least|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the link above shows Magnusson and elisasson   folks|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3 NT appears to be the optimal strain - EW cannot attack any suit|pg||

nt|sharkey: No - must be W|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rnmalik: the observation is after seeing all 52 cards|pg||
nt|rnmalik: would you lead a @D|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Certainly makeable on a non diamond lead|pg||
nt|athene: east thinking about 6n? but that can't be making if the double is really lightner for diamonds, since the diamonds aren't going to be a trick source|pg||

pc|s5|nt|gracelin: ths is a rare hand that grand slam can be made in all suit and 7NT.|pg||
nt|paulhac:  He needed the K@D really to look for 7 or 4 trumps|pg||

nt|lestergold: as we were discussing the merits of different denomination how many tricks were avialble in hearts??|pg||

nt|jtr: 1NT again|pg||
mb|1C|nt|yo_yo: but lots do open |pg||
nt|jaapfr: now to bid 4@H :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: May be W shud - pd's 3@D VUL must be a good hand - if not suicidal vs Pd pass opening|pg||
nt|jtr: I think they play 14-16|pg||
nt|sharkey: Slam coming up|pg||
nt|rnmalik: WOW, what a hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: pass out ? maybe|pg||
nt|jaapfr: for yours:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: in weekend no non alcoholics|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no X makes, no @D lead makes:)|pg||
nt|solex33: maybe - quite "unlucky" ? :-)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mcarroll: The Open seem to be pursuing the same line|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
nt|paulhac:  At least South has to find a ruff when the spades are 3-2|pg||
nt|po-s: all 3-2 without a direct ruff|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@H has a play here?|pg||
nt|sharkey: S remained silent in OR|pg||
nt|jtr: Nice defence next door|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: i would open the south hand though|pg||
nt|athene: West has a bit of a problem here|pg||
nt|jtr: North wants to bid something|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@H some kind of good @S raise - viw S has shown @H|pg||
nt|sharkey: Can they bid the Grand?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 35 HCP between them|pg||
mb|2N|nt|jaapfr: most E will pass after1@S and some mite bid 1nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: opposite a passed pard 2@H is bold|pg||
nt|sharkey: *view|pg||
nt|jaapfr: where this will end 3nt?|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulhac:  Is that not over 60% PO|pg||
nt|athene: double is fine as long as partner isn't so ill-mannered as to bid diamonds|pg||
nt|po-s: I would think more than 60|pg||
nt|dburn: closer to 65%, but a contract that will fail one time in three is not "very unlucky" to do so - unless you're Polish, of course|pg||
nt|rnmalik: we see the cards every key card is nicely placed for Grand:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Zia is rechecking his hand....|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|po-s: new form of Polish club?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: now 4@H|pg||
nt|jtr: Zia may think Welland has @hs|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: 2NT now?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 5@C nicer|pg||
nt|xenya: this is not a very good grand...|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|lestergold: North knows his customer|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Support double from N showing 3@Ss?|pg||
nt|pelu: with @CJ by NS 6@C would be a nice slam|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2NT balanced and old-fashioned game-forcing. No major|pg||
nt|jaapfr: my praying did help for yours:)|pg||
nt|athene: we need an adjective slightly less emphatic than "very" but more so than "mildly"|pg||
nt|sharkey: E will bid 3@S I think - showing 6 card suit|pg||
nt|jtr: 3@d did the trick anyway|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - I think Zia's initial Dbl afforded that|pg||
nt|sharkey: Running scores: http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava10/slava10t16r7.htm|pg||

nt|sharkey: Click on flashing green light on Round 8 for Board updates|pg||
nt|sharkey: One Kib counted 18 tricks....|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sybarra: have time to ruff some @D here  should not be all bad |pg||
nt|roswolf: slam try - i would play that as a splinter maybe a fit jump type bid!?|pg||
nt|athene: how about "somewhat"|pg||
nt|po-s: I´m for whoever tries a slam|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
nt|athene: 6@S was somewhat unlucky|pg||
nt|sharkey: N have shown 1-3-4-5 I think|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi all gm|pg||
nt|sharkey: Gd morning Jaap|pg||
nt|jtr: I think West devalued his hand by only bidding 2@h and is now wondering|pg||
nt|jtr: Hoi Jaap|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi carl and is ivan here?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi David|pg||
nt|sharkey: Whats W to do - two soft Q?|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe he thinks partner has a @d single|pg||
nt|jaapfr: Ivan was our operator yesterday in this CR and made 0 misclicks in all sessions:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: As long as you take the right view in Major suits 3 NT no problem...|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well third in hand yes but vul is unvafourable some might be more conservative|pg||
nt|xenya: the score on the screen doesn't mean much -- it's only a comparison between 2 tables, but there are 8 tables in play|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 13-10 makes match close again|pg||
nt|rnmalik: slightly unlucky|pg||
nt|po-s: go for very - not extremely or utterly|pg||
nt|solex33: slightly very unlucky|pg||
nt|jaapfr: true|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mmmakela: is that 1 @C 15+ precicion or upgrade|pg||
nt|vugraphzcx: prec|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 15+? or 16+? |pg||
nt|vugraphzcx: will ask after this board?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: ok ty|pg||
nt|rnmalik: interesting no 1@H-1@S|pg||
nt|po-s: very courageous 2H btw|pg||
nt|jtr: South engineered a trump promotion at the other table|pg||
nt|sharkey: or get a @D lead...|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: generally you need about 29 HCP to play 3N with a 5-5-2-1 facing a 1-2-5-5 (not quite the case here), but they do have 27|pg||
nt|mcarroll: If the defence do not lead trumps a @C @D crossruff will produce lots of tricks|pg||
mb|4C|nt|dburn: now, making a takeout double of 2@s and hearing partner want to play in clubs and not diamonds - that's more than somewhat lucky|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: one would expect 1@S response, agree|pg||
nt|sharkey: Zia jnows they're missing only 5 HCP; does he know pd is 4441?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jtr: Zia is on his way to doing the same|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: i would be afraid of bidding just 1NT with the north hand however|pg||
nt|sybarra: and now?|pg||
nt|pelu: even @C 10 would do|pg||
mb|4N|nt|athene: i guess if east had gone for diamonds, west was planning just to pass and hope for the best|pg||
nt|sharkey: East was destined to lead a red card which wud make it easier for declarer|pg||
nt|jaapfr: still enough to do|pg||
nt|sharkey: Communications may be a problem if W ducks..|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: @C @H crossruff|pg||
nt|pelu: give N@C8 and intrafiness could bring home a slam|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @C suit not very favourable|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm|pg||
nt|jaapfr: this is going very wrong for ew|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one hears the sound of falling wheels |pg||
nt|jaapfr: DD an easy board but SD a puzzle for all there|pg||
nt|xenya: if you have to bid grand, 7@C is best perhaps|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3@C checkback; 3@D one or both Majors - I presume|pg||
nt|rnmalik: same tricks|pg||
mb|5S|nt|chick: so I predict they will make this|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so they did well|pg||
nt|dburn: not really - why bid a bad suit with a good hand?|pg||
nt|po-s: what do they do with the "normal" 18-19 NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: agreed |pg||
nt|jaapfr: see beauty defense OR why 6@S went down in tr 2|pg||
nt|jtr: Here the distribution is marked for declarer|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think you can make Grand in all strains??|pg||
mb|5N|nt|xenya: well-judged by Welland?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you suspect that 5@D wasn't what East wanted to hear |pg||
nt|jaapfr: likely no X by N to encourage @H lead by pd|pg||
nt|po-s: so they never know if they have a major and wk NT|pg||
nt|jaapfr: X of 5@D i meant|pg||
nt|mdgraham: auction not over yet....|pg||
nt|po-s: couldn´t West have CA and DK?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: after an 18-19 1nt by pd if he not pass now he has to go too............................:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, 1NT can't be 18-19, that's for sure|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but it's all a bit mysterious|pg||
nt|po-s: it used to show 18, and 1M was bid with wk NT and 3+card suit|pg||
nt|jaapfr: also for them i am sure|pg||
nt|po-s: but these guys don´t play regular Polish|pg||
nt|po-s: not his style at all|pg||
nt|jaapfr: nv-v i would bid 2@H too|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: told 1NT is a one-round force, called the Dymanic NT  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: sorry, Dynamic|pg||
nt|sharkey: May be not @H|pg||
nt|xenya: not sure about 7@H|pg||
nt|xenya: but they won't bid that|pg||
mb|7C|nt|paulhac:  In the other room West bid spades|pg||
nt|jaapfr: still i think he will make it|pg||
nt|jtr: If he can manouvre things|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @HA and @C|pg||
nt|jtr: A sort of dummy reversal makes it|pg||
nt|jtr: Nothing the defence can do but declarer does not know that|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: a lot of spec ask me a lot of Q - please update your profil with names !!!!!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|rnmalik: same here and same answer|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I think at pairs 3NT was a better contract as played in OR|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@S puppet to 2NT|pg||
nt|jaapfr: dynamite 1nt?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: if we need to play in spades, partner can bid them|pg||
nt|xenya: well they sniffed at slam here|pg||
nt|athene: and if east bid diamonds and south doubled, he could reconsider (fake an urgent phone call perhaps)|pg||
nt|po-s: "quite" might be the right one in both cases|pg||
nt|rnmalik: either 7@C or 7NT:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: wd|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: i think 90% would bid 1@S   |pg||
nt|xenya: lots of messages saying 7 @H also makes|pg||
nt|sharkey: Dont think so|pg||
nt|jaapfr: we know about 18 tr but declarer will sweat:)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: defnce have done well to hold it|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 7@H can make imo|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Even I can make it after seeing all cards:)|pg||
nt|xenya: not sure Welland is happy to see the dummy|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mdgraham: still, all will be forgiven if East makes this|pg||
nt|sharkey: Zia shud have switched to @S trick 2|pg||
nt|jaapfr: take 7 tricka and trump 6x but if @H lead?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sharkey: yes - 7@H makes - 3@S 3@C 4@H 2@D and @S ruff|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|jtr: Wouldnt that make life easier?|pg||
nt|jtr: Cheap finesse|pg||
nt|jaapfr: claim|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|mcarroll: and 8 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: and this is imps, not mps|pg||
pc|sA|nt|po-s: If it needs that much from partner to make game, perhaps it isn´t the recommended action generally|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y all grands do make DD!|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|chick: N needed to cover the @DJ, now making is almost sure thing|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|nt|jaapfr: i think it was meant defensively 2@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: his rabbit's foot working overtime oerhaps?|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and turned out that pd had the goodies|pg||
nt|po-s: We can see that but how is partner to know?|pg||

nt|mdgraham: as Jaap said, North did well not to double for a diamond lead - the trump lead has left East a bit short of tricks  |pg||
nt|rnmalik: only @C 3/3 is the worry now|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jaapfr: a kib told me:)|pg||

nt|xenya: this tournament is held in the Moscow City Golf Club|pg||
mb|d|nt|mmmakela: sry can't type your name correctly dear operator!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 16 pairs taking part, by invitation only|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed, Paul|pg||
nt|athene: west needs to write "negative free bids" on his card quickly|pg||
nt|athene: so he can bid 2@S|pg||
nt|dburn: good time to have a non-forcing 2@s available|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@S makes, on the layout|pg||
nt|athene: for any specs who haven't met the term, "negative free bids" means after an overcall, as here, responder's new suit is non-forcing|pg||
nt|dburn: but if North bids 5@d, East will not be certain how to proceed|pg||
nt|athene: with a "real" 2@S bid he doubles first then bids spades|pg||
nt|athene: these methods are very popular in poland - not sure why, especially - i don't think they mesh especially well with the rest of Polish Club - just tradition, perhaps|pg||
nt|jaapfr: even 4@H doomed here|pg||
nt|sharkey: @S lead needed to beat 4@H|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Another hand where you need the spade ruff|pg||
nt|jaapfr: had only 9!!|pg||
nt|jtr: Switch is more practicable|pg||
mb|4S|nt|roswolf: very solid result in the other room for n/s maybe i can raise the flag again|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: The scores on the board make little sense, and here is why ...|pg||
nt|pelu: aggresiv 1@S by Hachett in East|pg||
nt|sharkey: Not sure - E gets to ruff one @C and can get home on low @H?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sorry reply to spec saying declarer a bad player whilst not claiming 10 tr previous board|pg||
mb|p|nt|vinbtech: 1C= precision or some some such ART club|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzcx: hehe you can say Gudni|pg||
nt|mcarroll: N managed to buy the contract on previous board in 1@S so a likely 5 imp swing|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The results of rounds in IMPs will be converted to VPs using a 60:0 scale. In calculating the datum score (= average score) on each board, about 50% (but not more) of the scores (a ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: quarter from the top and a quarter from the bottom) will not be taken into account|pg||
nt|dburn: this, though, is the wrong tempo - now if North bids 5@d East-West will double him|pg||
nt|jtr: @d overtaken and @s|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @DK @DA overtake @SA @SK x@S for -1|pg||
nt|sharkey: This won't make|pg||
nt|jaapfr: some 70% i quess|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|yo_yo: that's quite a hunky 2@C overcall|pg||
nt|yo_yo: chunky|pg||

nt|jaapfr: 4@S has a vey good chance to be made here|pg||
nt|dburn: and if he doesn't, then East-West will pick up a pretty good result|pg||
nt|po-s: long ago we met a Polish pair in the European, and my partner asked abt a "free" bid - and the opponent answered "unlimited" - It turned out he meant downwards|pg||
nt|athene: hahahaha|pg||
nt|athene: that's a good one :) i must remember that|pg||
nt|rnmalik: great|pg||
nt|athene: such a useful interpretation - for example "i have unlimited faith in teammates not to screw up our good set"|pg||
nt|jtr: 'garbage' stayman?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jaapfr: previous board the problem was that W was before 5@H not aware of the 4514 at least not the @D misfit imo|pg||
nt|jaapfr: W sweating now:)|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Even if he does not overtake what else can west switch to?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: true too|pg||
nt|sharkey: thinking 5@D....|pg||
nt|jtr: he doesnt like it|pg||
nt|jtr: But at red will pass|pg||

nt|jaapfr: has W name a meaning as  smooth (phonetically it sounds like that?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: in Polish i meant|pg||
nt|sharkey: Burden on Zmudzinski - just back from a tough loss in the NEC Cup|pg||
nt|jaapfr: anyway he does not feel ""smooth"" rite now:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Probably wondering if there's a better way to spend Sunday morning in Moscow...|pg||
nt|jtr: Afternoon:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: it is a team event|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|xenya: This is an annual event that has been set up in memory of Russian bridge player Slava Grinuk, who died at the age of 30. Slava was very fond of bridge, so a group of his friends ...|pg||
nt|xenya: (who didn't play bridge themselves) decided that the best way to commemorate him would be to hold an annual  bridge tournament in his honour. |pg||
nt|jtr: 2@h can show a weak hand with both majors|pg||
nt|jtr: either way round|pg||
nt|sharkey: View NS can only lead @S twice regardless of lead think it was always a make - previous hand|pg||
nt|jtr: Oh wow|pg||
nt|sharkey: Sry David - time flies when you have fun :)|pg||
nt|jtr: lol|pg||
nt|jaapfr: -500 due to the first X imo|pg||
nt|xenya: looks fairly routine to get to 4@S here -- but there is no play for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|rnmalik: The Law of Total Tricks also does not help in this 4@S|pg||
nt|sharkey: Surprising previous board where Zia bid Grand; four other scores reported none bid Grand!|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/y8rdsoc  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|rnmalik: system:)|pg||
nt|po-s: somehow it seems a waste to use 1NT for 20+ hands; they are so infrequent - and you must then create unclear (two-threeway) bids for all other hands|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y is only one real Zia: S:)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mmmakela: ok so it resembles a "D" good to gnow! and I assume you are a she?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: *know|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If someone had to play for my life ....it would be Zia, a spectator tells me. Not a bad choice I would say :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: results: http://www.slavacup.ru/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm|pg||

nt|mdgraham: 2@C shows 15+hcp. Thanks to Thomas Bobik|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW use Precison 2@C opening|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|po-s: It looks like 3H was a splinter...|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: heart contract does well if club q is found and dimaond ruff is not found!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: they have got this played by West - so it might make|pg||
nt|po-s: interesting lead - if we assume that opps do´t have 44 in a major then West must have 4+ hearts but may only have 3 spades|pg||
nt|rnmalik: nice one still enjoying:)|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, declarer can play @cs from hand to stop South getting in twice|pg||
nt|sharkey: After @HA NS will find their @C ruff for off 2|pg||
pc|s3|nt|chick: could make a couple of overtricks here as the cards lie favorably|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Now likely to make 12 tricks|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: unlikely tho for 4H to be misdefended here|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I think 16+ 1@C|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mdgraham: and with 3-3 clubs, making|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vinbtech: should E be bidding 3H here?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: precision to be correct|pg||
nt|mcarroll: only 11 available|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|po-s: so why did West think NT was best?|pg||
pc|sT|pc|h4|nt|vugraphzcx: no I am he|pg||
nt|mmmakela: only 1 ot|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Defence over|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jaapfr: it will:)|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|mcarroll: W should have put in the @C ten, allowing partner the option of overtaking to give a @D ruff|pg||
nt|po-s: this is interesting - 5D and 4S depend on who has the club king (apart from the rest of the conditions - NS should bid 5D|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|nt|jaapfr: not needed|pg||
nt|jtr: He will ruff it though|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jaapfr: 17-15 close|pg||
nt|yusufb: x igrenc hiç bi ele üzülmedim bu el yýktý beni|pg||
nt|mdgraham: very useful @H109|pg||
nt|jaapfr: only 3@H to lose not 1@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: suspect North will play @HA and a low one|pg||
nt|po-s: please!!! normally it is a small heart, and normally opponents will get in somewhere and can cash the hearts - and if East´s high cards are al elsewhere 5D will make|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hoping South has Q98x or similar|pg||
nt|sharkey: Agree Jaap - and I think they wud have beaten 4@H|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|sybarra: srslorryall have to dre. |pg||
nt|xenya: 5 now -- 2 tables left|pg||
nt|sharkey: Zia needs to pull a rabbit out of the hat here|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|nt|mmmakela: sryyyyyyyyy|pg||
nt|chick: depends on what finesses he takes ... got the hearts right so far|pg||
nt|yo_yo: seems a shame not to bid those @S|pg||
pc|c3|nt|dburn: maybe not, but if partner has four hearts (and three clubs) then both 3@h and 3@c might make|pg||
nt|paulhac:  3@S looks a bit of an underbid but maybe it was because of the vulnerability|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|jaapfr: think other table declarer blew up the 3@S with play of @SK too early|pg||
nt|jaapfr: at least DD:)|pg||
nt|xenya: he hasn't got either i'm afraid|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a push indeed|pg||
pc|h5|nt|chick: now clubs |pg||
pc|hA|nt|sharkey: Here 8 tricks appears cold - shud be matter of overtrick...|pg||
nt|jaapfr: do you understand why N bids 2@S?|pg||
nt|sharkey: I assume S has shown garbage hand with @H & @S - N corrects to get lead into his hand...|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h3|pg||
nt|sharkey: Thus 2@S from Zia wud have shown different hand...|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: I think North has added on one point for the five card suit and aces|pg||

nt|dburn: and the way things have gone, 3@h will make anyway|pg||
nt|dburn: so I guess he should have bid it|pg||
nt|jaapfr: or opps max 3@H and 1@C so unbeatable it was even DD|pg||
nt|mdgraham: my word|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: will watch more closely now I promise, was on the phone|pg||
nt|chick: partscores best possible here :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Welland was not sure of single @S with P|pg||
nt|athene: quite hard for north to bid at the 5-level with no shortage and a lot of defence|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 4@H might depend on getting clubs right|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3@D makes as well|pg||
nt|athene: zia had the stiff spade but he had only five diamonds - not easy at all|pg||
nt|solex33: 3 rounds of h defeats 5 dia. regardless the pos of k of c|pg||

mb|1C|nt|mmmakela: in precision that used to be a club opening in the old days|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i bet east will go to game|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if @HA x@H x@S then it could down?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: interesting choice for East|pg||
nt|dburn: here is a slightly somewhat quite very lucky slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: it was quite nice for declarer when South tackled trumps|pg||
nt|vinbtech: y the result justified 3H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If you subscribe to the Principle of Restricted Choice, you will get it right|pg||
nt|rnmalik: lets see |pg||
nt|athene: it all depends what 4@H promises - i suppose the usual rule "don't pre-empt over a pre-empt" applies here, so 4@H is a real hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry kibs - I don't speak Italian or Turkish....|pg||
nt|jaapfr: scowl back for links specs pls|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: a fit jump?|pg||
nt|vinbtech: a fit jump more likely |pg||
nt|rnmalik: very good hans for 5@D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@S is reasonable, but what about 5@S? Would that be the same as a 5@S opening  bid?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sorry for confusion i referred to x@H lead as unbeatable but with @HA x@H and @S switch it was DD down|pg||
nt|jaapfr: team 1 will gain here|pg||

mb|p|nt|chick: "precision" has so many variations that its very name is a contradiction :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Tony Forrester did in the other room with no opponent bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_restricted_choice_(bridge)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's even more evident here where Kwiecien has shown a two-suiter by opening 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: http://www.slavacup.ru/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR the @D-lead gave Forrester a help to "see" 2 x singleton by West - with singleton @H (and no bid) u would not play the @Cs right|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 6@S pls|pg||
nt|athene: maybe not quite as real as 3@S would be, but still real-ish|pg||
nt|dburn: well, 3@s would be bid on most "real hands" - 4@h is something like a decent limit raise|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i can help whilst West speaksDutch fluently:)|pg||

nt|jaapfr: vwd 5@S bid|pg||
nt|dburn: they might get to seven at this rate|pg||
nt|athene: certainly interesting that zia bids 5@C instead of 4@S - i wonder if it's a "help-suit slam try" rather than a normal control-bid|pg||
nt|dburn: that is how Zia prefers to play, certainly|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Roy trying to evaluate his Q@C|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @D finesse working can't pitch the 5th@C|pg||
nt|dburn: but for 6@c he ought to have rather better clubs - if I were Welland I would be giving serious thought to bidding seven|pg||
nt|po-s: x,Axxxx,Ax,AKJxx|pg||
nt|athene: zia needs a lot opposite for seven - @HKQ, @SA, @CK and more - that would be a 3@S bid not a 4@H bid surely|pg||
nt|dburn: still, even @sNone @hAJxxx @dAxx @cAKJxx is not a grand slam, so he may settle for six|pg||
nt|athene: (i mean zia doesn't need the @SA but he knows his partner has it, so that just means he hasn't got something else that *is* needed)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: -1|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jaapfr: a @H lead against 6@C would be helpful:) lol|pg||
nt|sharkey: shud be off 1|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Certainly  a better spot than 4@S|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3nt much better than 4@S imo|pg||
nt|sharkey: Superior contract this time - the fillers making the difference|pg||
nt|jtr: @c guess needed But he needs the entry to get it right|pg||
nt|sharkey: Problem if he plays on @S suit vs @C suit?|pg||

nt|xenya: they are on their way there|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|mmmakela: E promising clubs with dbl so maybe 3 nt by south was the right bid, n must have some stuff in majors and often a 4th dia|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ruff and finesse @D?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: plausible reasoning and a finesse involved|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Could  But even if Zia had AKxxxx@C and AD he is still a trick short|pg||
nt|athene: 6@D temporising saying "i can't bid seven but i don't want to shut up shop" - that has to mean good trumps i suppose|pg||
nt|athene: it can't be a control as he bid 5@S over 5@C|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mmmakela: *6th dia|pg||
nt|jaapfr: all other leads 6@C probably down|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Makes on a coss ruff but is that really the right line?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|pelu: here he know @S+@D by West|pg||

pc|s7|pg||
nt|jtr: Fu thought about it|pg||
nt|jaapfr: no entry left if ever for long @D in E|pg||

nt|sharkey: sry Jaap|pg||
nt|yusufb: evet|pg||
nt|jtr: Well,they can endplay dummy|pg||
nt|jaapfr: Zia will solve that D:)|pg||
nt|dburn: even Zia is not allowed to solve declarer's problems when he is dummy|pg||
nt|dburn: it is true that he usually has the solution afterwards, but for the moment he needs to keep it to himself|pg||
nt|jtr: West indicated @ss with the @h4|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sharkey: E got an opportunity to bid 1S OR - Welland's 1 NT overcall prevented that|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i suppose 2@S meant inviting and balanced|pg||
nt|sharkey: Assume showing suit and good hand Jaap?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: do not ask me:)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|po-s: so if South is in after 4 spades - no he isn´t|pg||

pc|s8|nt|xenya: regardless of the outcome, it's a fine effort by EW |pg||

nt|jaapfr: any spec KNOW what 2@S meant?|pg||
nt|jtr: ergo 2@s invite with no major|pg||
nt|dburn: depends to an extent on what 1@c meant|pg||

nt|dburn: poor Zia - about to get endplayed and squeezed, and he is only the dummy|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, Welland is left with no option now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i fail to see any problem for declarer as long as he plays @CK with E|pg||
nt|po-s: of course he has an option - he can play either club from his hand - and still make|pg||
nt|jtr: Say it is Kxx though?|pg||
nt|jtr: West just puts dummy in|pg||
nt|po-s: yes?|pg||
nt|jtr: If he can of course|pg||
nt|po-s: he cashes his clubs|pg||
nt|jtr: H9@s and they effectively cannot|pg||

nt|po-s: nice unblock in spades, should he need an entry on the spade 8|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Not so good PO if a club had been returned and teh Q played he would have gone down|pg||
nt|jtr: Declarer next door played on @ss|pg||
nt|paulhac:  But I agree with you in principle|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes it's good to investigate the grand so that opps relax, assuming the small slam is cold, and don't beat it :)|pg||
nt|po-s: well, with spades 32|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jtr: This would make if West had @cKQ|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i saw yesterday and today N some 50 boards but I am impressed by his computer brain skills (beter than my PC:)|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|nt|Walddk4: Now it's all clear for him|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Routine finesse next|pg||
nt|xenya: a complete crossruff works here it seems|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|dburn: but if 1@c showed clubs, 2@s was probably just invitational in notrump|pg||
nt|jtr: He will need to unblock here of course|pg||

nt|jaapfr: anyway we saw some firework this session:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp:  http://www.slavacup.ru/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm |pg||
nt|jaapfr: congrats to the wise specs|pg||

nt|xenya: Landin) for bringing this interesting event to the BBO audience. Thanks to my co-commentators  Rashed, Paul and Jaap  --  and, of course, to all the spectators.   |pg||
nt|athene: you can do the same thing with blackwood - ask for the trump queen, partner says he hasn't got it, so you sign off in six|pg||
nt|solex33: or dont dbl|pg||
nt|rnmalik: another one in minors now|pg||
nt|athene: now opps think a) you were looking for seven and b) you don't have the trump queen yourself|pg||
nt|athene: neither of which is true|pg||
nt|sharkey: Didnt place N with 5 @H...|pg||
nt|jtr: Last now|pg||
nt|sharkey: Blew the overtrick...|pg||
nt|jtr: last now|pg||

nt|roswolf: e/w in the other room rightsided this contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: live results|pg||
nt|po-s: hard to beat that result from closed|pg||
nt|rnmalik: when I made that observation of -1, he had ruffed a @D with 10@C|pg||
nt|jtr: Even so, the @cQ gives him a maximum and the contract makes anyway|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mdgraham: yes, 9 imps on board 1 when NS sacrificed in 5@Dx|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes north bid his weaker suit|pg||
nt|po-s: good start|pg||
nt|paulhac:  That helps|pg||
nt|po-s: just bid 6?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: as last session as well the long thinkers did not gain 1 imp with he long thinking    agree D?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: that kind of 3-way 2@C  opening isn't allowed in many countries because itdoesn't include an anchor suit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks Vladimir|pg||
nt|po-s: or are they barred from having an ace|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y|pg||
nt|sharkey: ouch - getting too high now|pg||
mb|2N|nt|athene: some pairs play a special sort of blackwood after a pre-empt|pg||
nt|athene: since partner is known to have nothing|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and Carl?\|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: The Open room started 3 boards behind us and has now caught up and is even ahead. They play this hand in 2@S|pg||
nt|athene: 4@D says "what flavour of nothing do you have here partner?"|pg||
nt|granguru: EW can make 2@C|pg||
nt|sharkey: Yes - much easier with all hands in view - also very difficult to defend |pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe he played too quickly?:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: previous hand|pg||
nt|xenya: There will be  a break for dinner now. Play will resume in about an hour and half. Stay tuned|pg||
mb|4S|nt|roswolf: 2@D =?|pg||
nt|po-s: how much is 4D RD 12 or 13 tricks?|pg||
nt|sharkey: lol|pg||
nt|granguru: only a @C lead can beat|pg||
nt|jtr: Zia will double this|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: looks like off 1...|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: see u all later - have to go shoping :(|pg||
nt|petergill: Results are at http://www.slavacup.ru/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm|pg||
nt|jtr: Nope it is getting worse|pg||
nt|jtr: Heading towards 2@s|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@D first I think|pg||
nt|jtr: well 4@s sort of|pg||
nt|granguru: which can also be made|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3@H must be weak invite i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: the bad break puts paid to this one |pg||
nt|lestergold: Please forgive me Kath but I have devlope4d a headache to a point where I cannot really continue this session- the headache not caused by any of the events here ofr course!! so i ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: must leave you all sorry|pg||
nt|lestergold: bye for now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: oh dear, take some aspirin Mike|pg||
nt|vugraphzcx: yes as far as I know|pg||
nt|po-s: let us see if West follows with the ten|pg||
nt|jaapfr: develop @D  for simple make here|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rnmalik: now it is clear after @H and @S bids and instead of DBL N could bid 4NT with that hand|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Only a 5 imp swing I miscounted the undertricks in the Open|pg||
nt|jaapfr: my quess team 2 to win this with 1 imp:)|pg||
nt|athene: interesting double|pg||
nt|solex33: lead directing if pd has A of dia|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not really|pg||
nt|dburn: made? the defenders can cash the first six tricks at least|pg||
nt|sharkey: Ty all - especially kibs with lots of valuable inputs.  Hope to see you back later|pg||
pc|dK|nt|yo_yo: bye and quick recovery |pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5 matches of 8 boards today, 6 tomorrow and 4 on Monday. I believe the upcoming Monday is a public holiday in Russia. Maybe Vladimir can confirm|pg||
nt|xenya: actually the holiday is on 23rd, but Monday is a non- working day too|pg||
nt|xenya: we will be back shortly -- 20or 30 minutes i guess|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Non-working non-holiday, I like those :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: big loss here|pg||
nt|po-s: 2D was a clever bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: this 3nt is wrong sided|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but still leads @D|pg||
nt|xenya: previous hand should produce a great score for NS|pg||
nt|jaapfr: tx all and for sure Ivan is really the greatest (family of Alexander:)?|pg||
nt|athene: asking for a diamond lead against 6nt if partner has @DAK, maybe|pg||
nt|jaapfr: specs previous board was meant that discarding a @H by W could only give the contract of 2nt away and could never be winning as JTR explained N could have had @CAQ then 2nt makes ...|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and if not @CQ then easy to discard  a @C and even @CK could not to be trown in|pg||
nt|jtr: South didnt read the lead next door|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jaapfr: 3nt-3|pg||
nt|po-s: but apparently conventional|pg||
nt|jaapfr: DD and SD:)|pg||
nt|jtr: Nor did zia|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|mmmakela: some taps coming up|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 5@C obviously best, but how can you get there?|pg||
nt|po-s: just in cas double (if they don´t know their responses|pg||
nt|jtr: Fu heading for bathroom|pg||
nt|jaapfr: because of the @H discard by W:)?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|vugraphzdp: results:http://www.slavacup.ru/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm|pg||
nt|jaapfr: tx Ivan for unnoticable excellent job:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes indeed|pg||
nt|jaapfr: whole day 0 mistakes as operator|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he means it as majors, looking for a sac, but 4@D isn't natural so it's all a bit strange|pg||
pc|h6|nt|petergill: Fu Zhong - Jack Zhao (China) and Kholomeev - Khiuppenen (Russia) lead the Slava Cup after 44-16 wins in Round 1, ref http://www.slavacup.ru/results/slava10/slava10t16r1.htm|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The results of rounds in IMPs will be converted to VPs using a 60:0 scale. In calculating the datum score (= average score) on each board, about 50% (but not more) of the scores (a ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: quarter from the top and a quarter from the bottom) will not be taken into account|pg||
nt|pelu: and 44-16 = win by 14 IMPs = a gameswing! - hard scale|pg||
nt|mdgraham: operators are a bit like cricket umpires - if they do a good job, you don't notice them |pg||
nt|jaapfr: i get -4   -3   -2 and makes replies from kibs my screen is ""blue""|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if @DA @CA @CQ then -2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: has to take @DA and play on clubs, I think|pg||
pc|h7|nt|paulhac:  txs everyone|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Thanks everyone|pg||
nt|athene: thanks all|pg||
nt|solex33: maybe a mixture of lead directing and take-out ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: thx all|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Thanks and C..................U.|pg||
nt|po-s: is there more today?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: no, that was last segment today|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: next segment starts tommorow in 11 msk time|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: I'll be gald to see you all tommorow )|pg||
nt|jtr: But it should still go down|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|rnmalik: well done:)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jaapfr: aha even make chances indeed|pg||
nt|xenya: we will be back shortly -- stay tuned |pg||
nt|sharkey: Zia won't let go now|pg||
pc|d5|nt|yo_yo: i thought Mike was unusually quiet :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If ever there is a case for a trump lead, this is the auction. Even Bill and D Bird would lead one, don't you think, David?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@S, as in OR, is more to my liking; 4333 and Qs and Js detracts from the hand|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mdgraham: although that may be a bit double-dummy|pg||
nt|jtr: Bill maybe|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS shud take the first 7 tricks|pg||
nt|jtr: It is a religious thing with Bird though i think|pg||
nt|dburn: Zhao perhaps a little unlucky not to find Fu with a three-card major after the opponents had started 1@c-1NT|pg||
nt|jtr: He can only lead trumps on thursdays|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if so then 17-12|pg||
nt|granguru: the whole day?|pg||
nt|dburn: for all that, his @cQ wasn't a bad feature for playing in clubs, so he might not have run|pg||
nt|jaapfr: although not sure comparison is with allother ?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good bridge, many doubles and redoubles|pg||
nt|jtr: Up until 10pm|pg||
nt|sharkey: Roland will explain the scoring method I think|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The results of rounds in IMPs will be converted to VPs using a 60:0 scale. In calculating the datum score (= average score) on each board, about 50% (but not more) of the scores (a ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: quarter from the top and a quarter from the bottom) will not be taken into account|pg||
nt|granguru: a heard a nice tip about leading trumps. If you are going to lead trumps before count up to ten..|pg||
nt|granguru: if that doesnt work..then count up to hundred|pg||
nt|jtr: Does Welland think Zia has doubled with xx?|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vugraphzdp: thx|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: all )|pg||
nt|jaapfr: tx ivan and all|pg||
nt|roswolf: bye for now|pg||
nt|xenya: There will be a break for dinner now. Play will resume in about an hour and half|pg||
nt|sharkey: Zia - Welland has regained the lead|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sharkey: W played @H10 - otherwise Zia may have read the falsecard|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
nt|jaapfr: this normal way is down 2|pg||
nt|jtr: Before this hand i assume?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jaapfr: -4 can even|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jaapfr: so all kibs were rite -4 -3 -2 make everything was DD possible|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jaapfr: ty all esp Ivan again 0 wrong|pg||
nt|jtr: Huge set for N/S|pg||
nt|sharkey: Looks like another crushing round for Zia Welland|pg||
nt|sharkey: 53-7 VP |pg||
nt|jtr: Bye for now people|pg||
nt|jaapfr: bye|pg||
nt|sharkey: Bye|pg||
nt|sharkey: we shud be back shortly I think|pg||
nt|po-s: if he had entered his hand with a club and played another spad North can win and play a diamond. Now he must discard a diamond on the clubs before playing another spade. Then a ...|pg||
nt|po-s: diamond will tap him so that he loses a heart and a long diamond in the end|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|s9|nt|sharkey: yes - |pg||
nt|jtr: You might have been projecting|pg||
nt|sharkey: http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|nt|jaapfr: even the last imp if so  will be for Zia cs|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|jaapfr: now a push|pg||
pc|d8|nt|vinbtech: W has no option but to play S twice towards KQxx and chalk up 9 tricks|pg||
nt|vinbtech: nice duck by N but of no avail|pg||
nt|yo_yo: North might lead a sneaky @S|pg||
pc|c4|pc|sQ|nt|jaapfr: but -1 was not mentioned lol|pg||
