nt|vugraphzer: 10 min break|pg||
nt|stc: do we have a link for the current standings ? how many boards/segment ?|pg||
nt|petergill: The direct 4@H at the other table deserved the imps it gained - it's usually best to give the opponents the last guess by bidding high earlier rather than later with good fits|pg||
nt|petergill: The only website I have for this event is http://www.locomotiva.ro/|pg||
nt|petergill: but I don't know if there is anything on that website|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 8: 4 imp gain for the weak 2@H relative to the Multi 2@D - because 2@H weak enabled EW to preempt NS more quickly. |pg||
nt|petergill: I'm scheduled to commentate on the Slava Cup from Moscow which starts some time in the next 20 minutes or so, so if I leave this table abruptly, that's why.|pg||
nt|petergill: The problem with bidding 4@H over a Multi 2@D is that you will land in many rotten 4@S contracts when the opponents can make nothing.|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@H - 1 or -2 is OK if they can make 3@S, but 4@S -1 is no good unless they can make at the four level|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@S over 2@D is perhaps the solution, if you play 3@s as "pass or correct" - my newest partner has me playing 2@D Multi - 3@S as a strong hand with hearts, so I would be unable to ...|pg||
