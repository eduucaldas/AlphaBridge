nt|chick: should easily find 3N here|pg||
nt|kaapo: Swedes love strong or 2-way club|pg||
nt|col3435: some well-fitting cards here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: bridge is one of the few sports where playing home is not that great an advantage|pg||
nt|suketbombi: HI all|pg||
nt|suketbombi: n-s play Demicoma a strong club 16+ convention and 12-15 NT|pg||

pc|s3|nt|kaapo: Hejssan :)|pg||
nt|joemanjo: Hi Vladimir|pg||
nt|lestergold: starting with a likely 4S contract not looking problematic at all|pg||
nt|hlortz: & Roland , Paul|pg||
pc|s8|nt|suketbombi: while e-w play a std convention|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|mmmakela: N has a rotten rdbl hand|pg||
nt|kaapo: Hejssan alla|pg||
nt|joemanjo: This looks like a West Bengal vs Delhi match. NS and EW respectively.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|varange: welcome to the Swedish Premier League.|pg||
nt|joemanjo: Hi all|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kaapo: 1NT is about 17-19 here I suppose|pg||
nt|col3435: at least declarer has something to think about on this lead|pg||
nt|varange: NS played pretty slowly during the previous session|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks like they're headed for an easy 4@S|pg||
nt|joemanjo: EW qualified to represent India once at China, four years back.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|joemanjo: EW play stong club|pg||
nt|joemanjo: strong|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|kaapo: Straightforward bidding|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Hello, Markku. Good evening to all|pg||
nt|kaapo: Did 3NT show clubs or @S shortness or something else?|pg||
nt|joemanjo: NS okay Standard methods|pg||
pc|hK|nt|varange: which meant that the OR caught up|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1NT = clubs or GF relay?|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: apologies, alerts in the wrong place.|pg||
nt|lestergold: A duck of this club- a continuation will lead to an overtrick|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sfoxa:  Hello, Kari.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mmmakela: 3433 and 9 with no intermeds|pg||
nt|mcphee: 3nt a nice spot|pg||
nt|xenya: good stop but still an awkward contract|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes shd be a flat bd which is a good news for Khandelwals|pg||
nt|othered1: Possible without @C system for north to be declarer, but on this hand it doesn't matter|pg||
nt|joemanjo: +120 in 1N|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: tricks missed due to late start....catching up with the score|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|kaapo: Hi Cornelia, Markku and Staffan|pg||
nt|chick: hard to pass with 2 aces though|pg||
nt|chick: and a lively first round of bidding dies quite suddenly|pg||
nt|rnc: For Running Scores, time schedule etc during the tournament: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.877|pg||
nt|kaapo: Hi|pg||
nt|mmmakela: only guess who might have all 3 trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: short @S and not min|pg||
pc|hT|nt|chick: now that E sees that he set up the spades, he has to start grabbing tricks before losers can be pitched|pg||
nt|kaapo: Clubs will easily bring enough tricks for EW and luckily South hasn't got too high a heart in order to get a chance to play twice through West|pg||
nt|chick: with no entries, N must try to get to partner's hand again for another @H through|pg||
nt|col3435: if East is showing his shape this could turn out well|pg||
nt|kaapo: Ten tricks on top and 2 diamond ruffs bring it to twelve. 4-0 clubs shouldn't do much harm|pg||
nt|vugraphj77: za chwilke porzybiegnie nasz komentator Rysiu Kielczewski|pg||
pc|h7|nt|joemanjo: Both sides play Standard with variations|pg||
pc|h3|nt|burypies: tajemnicza 8@d|pg||
nt|kaapo: Hopefully 4@H was alerted too :)|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|kaapo: Or are they playing with screens?|pg||
nt|lestergold: Edwin a highly respected senior founded and was co owner of my club for some twenty years|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mmmakela: needs C A right here for starters,now might even make this akward contract|pg||
nt|vugraphj77: ktorego witam serdecznie|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kaapo: North might have some slam ambitions, if there are no wasted @S values|pg||
nt|rnc: For Running Scores, time schedule etc during the tournament: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.877|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: north has shown 1-4 in majors with 5+@D here|pg||
nt|kaapo: Tack, Staffan|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: missed play...c\will claim at the end|pg||
nt|joemanjo: All cards are favourable, lack of entries in West hand is the immediate issue. |pg||
pc|cT|nt|mcphee: all over now|pg||
nt|varange: Ralf Willquist will be able to fill us in on most of the play as he knows the players|pg||
nt|varange: and our operator at the venue, Steffan, will keep us updated|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a big mistake to reach 6@s here. -2 if they can find the @c ruff on NS|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|burypies: Weijknis wiedzia³ ze 2! to dwukolorówka?|pg||
nt|burypies: 2@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: tak wyjanione przed wistem|pg||
nt|burypies: je¿eli tak powinien zagraæ D@d|pg||
nt|burypies: wiedzia³ ¿e  rozgrywaj¹cy ma singla @d|pg||
nt|kaapo: I believe NS play 2-way club. North would open 1@C with 11-13 balanced, so he has kind of maximum|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I surely would because now 1 @S was forcing in my book and he passed!|pg||
nt|kaapo: I tried commentating in Swedish too, but my typing was a bit too slow in that language. I might do better now that PO is playing, though ;)|pg||
nt|varange: should be bid - ask Roland :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: I doubt even Roland would approve of this one :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: no screens, no alert since swedish rules say no alerting above 3nt|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kaapo: Ok, then no alerts beyond 3NT|pg||
nt|col3435: opps had probably got the idea by that point anyway :)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kaapo: A kib suggests that 4@H was RKC in clubs|pg||
nt|suketbombi: will end up making 5@S|pg||
pc|h4|nt|varange: what systems do they play Ralf?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Staffan!|pg||
nt|joemanjo: North may be AshiM Mukherjee - if so he is a player in the Indian Railways B team.|pg||
nt|lestergold: Eginton has been a major figure in bridge and bridge administration for many years was recently chai of England selectors.|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: poprawi³a siê rednia urody w stosunku do poprzedniego meczu|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|vugraphj77: ale tempo oslablo|pg||
pc|s6|nt|col3435: mm. So presumably 3@h showed 4414 exactly|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|nt|xenya: should make with a careful play though, and he is on the right track|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: oj to napewno i to baaardzo|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|s2|nt|col3435: easy with spades breaking - but how would you play if South had five?|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|nt|ralfwil: strong @c from both pairs  - Staffan?|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ralfwil: EW does and I thing NS too|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yes, strong club, 17+, from both as far as i can see|pg||
nt|kaapo: The web site for the tournament is here http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.877|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think Edwin is endplayed here |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kaapo: You'll find running scores there too|pg||
nt|xenya: now another trump and @C hook |pg||
nt|xenya: but this line fails -- |pg||
nt|xenya: not clear why he decided to shorten himself in trumps, losing control|pg||
nt|joemanjo: a club ruff and favourable trump break seals the contract for East|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rnc: For Running Scores, time schedule etc during the tournament: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.877|pg||
pc|d6|pc|sT|pg||
nt|varange: NT is 14-16?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: guess does not matter as Ashim has only 2 @HS|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kaapo: It's very normal in Sweden to play 3rd and 5th leads, even against notrumps. Nyström - Wrang seem not to do it, though|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: I would say most swedes play 3rd-5th vs suit and 4th vs NT|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kaapo: And you can see that it's quite close in the top|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d9|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good afternoon all|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mmmakela: u right Kari 1c includes 10-12 nt so I take back my words|pg||
nt|hlortz: e was endplayed in 3 suits - unusual that|pg||
nt|lestergold: had to give overtrick onme way or the other west could have played a diamond i think that prevents the endplay|pg||
pc|c6|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kaapo: Yes, that's a sensible agreement|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mdgraham: This match seems a lot closer |pg||
pc|c2|nt|chick: S cannot afford to try for an overtrick and lose a bunch of spades|pg||

nt|vugraphzpx: i would say they are pretty good, noone knows how good he is in a speedy :) I can ask him though... :)|pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: if south has 5 spades, the best way must be to play the 8 of clubs and let it go round to north|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: or even a small one|pg||
nt|col3435: yes that's nice|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes and the favoriates are trailing makes it more interesting|pg||
nt|joemanjo: EW partnership is quite a long standing one in Indian Bridge. East, Mr Ashok Goel is the CEO of Dhampur Sugar Mills and sponsor for their team.|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: scores updated|pg||
nt|joemanjo: hi all|pg||
nt|suketbombi: hi manoj|pg||
nt|joemanjo: good start by the trailing team chalking up 10 of the deficit in the first board.|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: heart back only delays it i think|pg||
nt|vugraphj77: witram wszystkich serdecznie. Przepraszam za opoznienie, ale sprawy techniczne. Mysle ze juz powinno byc dobrze|pg||
mb|1D|nt|chick: nice 4@H contract here|pg||
nt|kaapo: Rehi Cornelia|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello, Cornelia|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1NT looks interesting|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 1 nt seems needing swings|pg||
nt|kaapo: What does that show, then? :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  if E decided to open 1nt, good ending could be 3nt |pg||
nt|kaapo: 10-13, might be off-shap?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  guess @d right - "only"|pg||
nt|joemanjo: What wd u open as North?|pg||
nt|joemanjo: Hi Raju|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: yes, 26 imps can be found in 14 boards without doing much more than playing good bridge and getting a little lucky to have active hands.|pg||
nt|lestergold: part score battle N/S can make a lucky 3S e/w 3 of a minor|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kaapo: Well, no need to interfere with his play :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
nt|kaapo: North may get to open here, unless West finds 1@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C|pg||
nt|joemanjo: :)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: witam pogr¹¿onych w depresji, czy Elbl¹g siê w niej znajduje?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mcphee: need to reach 5@D |pg||
nt|chick: is he known as a particularly slow player?  :)|pg||
nt|xenya: the 3@D preempt in the other room was overdoing it|pg||
nt|joemanjo: u can follow this tourney at the following website|pg||
nt|joemanjo: http://indianbridgepages.appspot.com/ Yashwant_Rao_Holkar/2010/Results.el|pg||
nt|joemanjo: 4@S may be reached here too. |pg||
nt|vugraphj77: nie narzekamy|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lestergold: and Howard trumps the unassuming cue bid with one of his own!|pg||
nt|vugraphj77: chociaz team ZSRR wybral przeciwnikow z jtorymi jako jedynymi przegrali mecz|pg||
mb|p|nt|varange: hi Frank|pg||
mb|5C|nt|kaapo: I suppose Johan and PO at least play 2-way club|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: chick, sundelin is known as one of the slowest swedish players ever... :)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes subhash took a not so unreasonable line rather than Relying on 50% @H Q in|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: N won't sell|pg||
nt|mdgraham: curious no 1@s overcall by North|pg||
nt|vugraphj77: mam nadzieje ze teraz juz wszystko ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: 2-way club, where 1@C shows either a strong hand or a weak notrump range, is often referred to as Swedish club|pg||
nt|joemanjo: 2@C and 2N take up valuable space to show a black two suiter.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: N-s have a good @S partial|pg||
nt|joemanjo: ah that 3@s made it simple|pg||
nt|joemanjo: Had East not opened, NS may have wandered into a 4@s game.|pg||
nt|joemanjo: now they may settle in @s partial|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well 4C undoubled is actually a good result for one off for E/W|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mmmakela: 14-16 Nt maybe?|pg||
nt|chick: certainly doesn't look like a hand that I would upgrade|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 13-17NT from start, 2@D showed 13-15 without 4c major|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: PO thinks his partners minor is @C:)|pg||
nt|chick: good thing I don't have a lot to do today then :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I am told NS play VERY sound overcalls - and it surely seems so|pg||
nt|joemanjo: wow|pg||
nt|joemanjo: good lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4C x is par something that is not often achieved at the table|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kaapo: I guess 1NT = 14-16|pg||
nt|kaapo: Some might bid some number of diamonds as West|pg||
nt|kaapo: Even if East doesn't lead a club, he'll get another chance|pg||
nt|kaapo: Unless he ducks a spade|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: this board is wrong duplicated. Not much, but the ace of heart is located at east, not at south|pg||
nt|kaapo: Makes a little more sense then|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  single?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: south stole the 9 of D from east|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: so east holds 3253 with A7 in hearts|pg||
nt|kaapo: Mikael and Cilla are in the minority for Swedish experts: they don't play strong/2-way club|pg||
nt|kaapo: Their system of choice is short club with transfers|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ogl¹da³em wyniki teamu o swojsko brzmia cej nazwie ZSRR - do 7 meczu oddawali tylko 1 impa, czy idzie im w dalszym ci¹gu adekwatnie do nazwy?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|frankaus: @D lead would have proved troublesome|pg||
nt|xenya: well if he decided to treat has hand as balanced, it makes sense|pg||
nt|vugraphj77: slyszalam ze biuro polityczne kazalo zwolnic wszystkich trenerwo|pg||
nt|vugraphj77: bo slabo na olimpiadzie|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes but any ruff By E will only promote a trunmp for def|pg||
pc|s8|nt|xenya: whether it is balanced is doubtful though|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|chick: almost any lead gives away a trick|pg||
nt|joemanjo: EW Bidding will certainly help the declarer in bringing off the 4@S|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|kaapo: Well, unless the other room plays the board similarly distorted, this has to be canceled|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so S has 10982 in dias?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: it´s the same at all other tables.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yes, south holds 10982 in @d|pg||
nt|suketbombi: a @C lead or shift wud restrict to 3 or else 4 makable|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jkmjanusz: Witam!|pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: witamy nowych komentatorów |pg||
nt|abunio: witamy z Gdanska :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: ns play 2-way club Staffan? Carrot?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 2@C asking for majors, 2@D relay with lots of different hands, 2@H/2@S/2NT/3@C/3@D invitational|pg||
nt|chick: and N puts him to the test immediately, before he can get any other info|pg||
nt|kaapo: Of couse he does have @DQ and might get a trick with it|pg||
nt|chick: but N still has to find the @DQ|pg||
nt|mcphee: sure, nice bold play before anyones knows what is up|pg||

nt|col3435: yeah, why not @sJ and run it if West follows low|pg||
pc|h7|nt|chick: W might Q-ask |pg||
nt|kaapo: In case I was about right about the early bids, 3@H could be a re-tranafer and 3NT some kind of slam try follows by two cue bids|pg||
nt|kaapo: Fredin - Lindkvist had an even more straightforward sequence to 7@H|pg||
nt|col3435: but here west shows out, and if he allows the @h7 to score it's all over|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: west has the option of discarding 2 diamonds on the 3rd and 4th round of spade, denying the 6of H to score|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: moimi prywatnymi faworytami s¹ licytacje sprzedajace te same walory po kilkakroæ|pg||

nt|kaapo: Apparently not much :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: So pitching a club here looks a reasonable plan|pg||

pc|s7|nt|chick: no one did, this hand is a nightmare in any contract|pg||
nt|col3435: (and 5VPs ahead of 9th)|pg||

nt|kaapo: I'm not very fond of West's 2@S but perhaps that was another small deception: he was trying to convince NS they should go to 4@H|pg||
nt|othered1: Probably depends on what north things their lead style would imply here.    To my eyes, 7 is an interesting card|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|jkmjanusz: Po przepuszczeniu @H Damy Kasprzak zmieni³ wista na @S !!|pg||
nt|kaapo: Apparently 2@H was a simple reverse, a little light but with nice 3-card support for partner and great controls|pg||
nt|kaapo: Diamond split is very cruel, in case they end up at some number of dimonds|pg||
nt|kaapo: What is the 1NT range here, Staffan?|pg||
nt|frankaus: 2@H will make so no real harm|pg||
nt|varange: the one is as good as the other?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|chick: not necessarily a pause... remember the operator cannot enter bids until both people on one side of the screen have bid|pg||
nt|varange: friendly breaks either way|pg||
nt|yuval10: if he guess it that would be something :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but double shows the three-suiter and is possibly more flexible, and would therefore score 10/10 in a bidding competition|pg||
nt|mdgraham: board 5 - game missed at othert table as well|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 2nt knowing there is a minor fit|pg||
nt|suketbombi: y e-w play Demicoma 1nt denies 4 card major unless 4-3-3-3|pg||
nt|suketbombi: it is about a 50% game after pd gived you full 14|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kaapo: 14-16?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: not sure, 14-16 or 15-17|pg||
nt|suketbombi: only interest left is to know who is that +1 which Subhash will call up and tell me:)|pg||

nt|mmmakela: still wd EW|pg||
nt|varange: you'd open the south hand 1@s Frank?|pg||
nt|varange: or 1NT?|pg||
nt|frankaus: many here include 5M332 in their NT range - klinger has  a great influence here a he recomends it|pg||
nt|xenya: but this is very double dummy|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @C is only 5-card - d is best|pg||
nt|hawe45:  D|pg||
nt|othered1: "Knowing" may be a bit strong, if south could have 4=3=3=3 with 4-card major|pg||
nt|suketbombi: ok but they got 4 for there 200|pg||
nt|joemanjo: 9 IMPs gift to trailing team|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|chick: that's one advantage of not bidding clubs, don't give away the bad distribution|pg||
nt|kaapo: Of course would be more cruel still, if South had them|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: they play lebensohl|pg||
nt|chick: if it promises clubs, that's ok with N|pg||
nt|mcphee: :)|pg||
nt|chick: but with a nice heart fit, it is trouble, double or not|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|arvid: If east had the jack of diamonds 6@D would have been a very good slam|pg||
nt|kaapo: Wrang saw short clubs with partner and opts for the 4-3 @S game|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: We had a lost connection at the other table which means board  15 isnt scored properly. The result in the open room was 6@S made, which should give another 14imps for Team Zang|pg||
nt|chick: he must win the @SA, so can ruff two clubs with the small trumps|pg||
nt|mmmakela: making 13|pg||
nt|yuval10: either way EW can make 10 tricks in @h because of the 87 doubleton @d so -1 in 4@s isn't so bad|pg||
nt|joemanjo: yes, missed the qj of clubs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but with these suit discrepancies I would bid 2@C - always a good overcall of 1@D|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes that is rare N is known to take chances|pg||

nt|varange: the 8@h is a big card|pg||
nt|joemanjo: lol|pg||
nt|hlortz: singleton @S lead will beat 4@H looks like|pg||
nt|lestergold: This can be beaten|pg||
nt|lestergold: it actually should be|pg||
nt|lestergold: a bit unlucky of course as its a very good contract|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|varange: AQxxx isn't that flash anyway|pg||
nt|frankaus: yes  then i play garbage 2@C and puppet 3@C for all game going hands|pg||
nt|varange: ok|pg||
nt|varange: nice treatment|pg||
nt|col3435: can East just continue hearts here?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yes he can|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: well he has only 3 carder @S and a very weak 4 card @H suit|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: easy on a @D lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East will do very well to lead a spade here|pg||
nt|suketbombi: everyone is happy here|pg||
nt|hlortz: if n later leads Q@C and w ducks S will need to rise Ace to give the ruff.|pg||
nt|lestergold: good point|pg||
nt|hlortz: tho prehaps just clearing 3 rounds of trump will leave declarer a @D loser|pg||
nt|lestergold: but south should be able to count west's hand for a stiff club|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mmmakela: well S never thinks with his 10-12.....|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: there are no screens |pg||
nt|mmmakela: against 2-way club most treat it as supposing the weak variation and W didn't bid after 1 @C so has clubs now if thinking one could assume|pg||
nt|mmmakela: even that was meant priv sry|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but, on the bidding, he may well do so - no, he has gone passive|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that's good - being happy is better than being miserable|pg||
nt|joemanjo: now @d|pg||
pc|dA|nt|burypies: a przeciwnicy siê szarpi¹ |pg||
nt|kaapo: How do you like 2@D (either direct or in the pass out seat)?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kaapo: PO Sundelin in deep thought in the other room playing 4@S on board 3|pg||

pc|h9|nt|sunsamvar: Kamal Mukherjee has been 1 of the top Indian players for a long, long time..|pg||

nt|varange: ah OK|pg||
nt|frankaus: sunday is not epicurian - quice + frankfurt|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and my money is on him to pull off this contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: play out of turn...will claim at the end.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Play out of turn? We have heard that before. They can't keep doing that, surely|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: what a pity... great hand for timing in declarer play|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You lost the play?|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: yes...dummy played before his own turn|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: play 2 @C and then the 2nd @H|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but east can take the @Ha and clear @H|pg||
nt|suketbombi: a @S ruff in Dummy will promote def trumps|pg||

nt|othered1: What was that play?|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: miskeyed....claim at the end.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: cards lie well, should make|pg||
nt|mdgraham: assumoing South plays low from dummy, there will be a Resticted Choice position on the next round of trumps |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Principle of Restricted Choice= 10 imps in the Out column |pg||
nt|suketbombi: we are stuck here?|pg||

nt|vugraphzpx: south will be a bit surprised when his partnern supports his spades :)|pg||

nt|kaapo: I guess he could try something|pg||
nt|kaapo: And 1@C could be 2 cards, either natural unbalanced, or balanced|pg||

nt|suketbombi: he has a chance tho but unlikely since if he concedes @Cs will loose 3 @Hs a @c and a@S|pg||

pc|dK|pg||
nt|mdgraham: he has to get the ruff with a low trump|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so South has to lead @SQ (no entry to dummy) and West has to duck it - very difficult |pg||
nt|suketbombi: @SJ has to be ducked by JM|pg||
nt|othered1: But possible, as play of interion @S would be very tricky from AQJ|pg||

nt|vugraphzck: S thinking.....|pg||

nt|vugraphzpx: 5@S perhaps?|pg||
nt|yuval10: follows by 6@c over 5@d |pg||
nt|yuval10: quite hard|pg||
nt|joemanjo: 3N or 4@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: Many would open the South hand nowadays. Surprising to see a strong clubber pass it|pg||
nt|frankaus: not many would pass|pg||
nt|col3435: I thought it was because he didn't feel the hand was good enough with a misfit, but evidently it was more because he wanted the penalty|pg||
nt|vasanti: does 4 hcp warrant a bid?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kaapo: 1@C was either balanced or natural|pg||
nt|othered1: @D split makes 4@S a potential problem|pg||
nt|mdgraham: could this be 6@S in one room and 2@S in the other.....|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: 2@D looks like natural, nonforcing call|pg||

nt|othered1: I'd guess that in CR the NS *Know* they have a bad result . . .|pg||

pc|cA|nt|sfoxa:  what is the probability of finding all 13 cards?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure|pg||
pc|c3|nt|col3435: well, like that, evidently :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: after Pass by S i think she MUST bid it|pg||
nt|kaapo: By eptying the box save 7@S and 7NT|pg||
nt|col3435: if pass is forcing|pg||
nt|yuval10: the play will be interesting...... she might know that W has only 3 @s's from the bid|pg||
nt|yuval10: she can ruff 2 @d's..... and see that E has 3|pg||
nt|kaapo: Has West still something to think about?|pg||
nt|yuval10: then 8-1-3-1|pg||
nt|suketbombi:  ok the result wud be the same  460|pg||
nt|suketbombi: the other semis lot of Puneiets have been asking as there latest Hero kaustub bendre is batlling out against MMS|pg||
nt|lml: it might have worked better for east west if east had bid 1@S over 1@H|pg||
pc|c2|nt|chick: its not impossible that S will switch to spades, hoping to remove the entry to diamonds|pg||
nt|kaapo: North seems to have a chance for 10 tricks, if he raises the heart suit first|pg||
nt|yuval10: i belive she'll make it|pg||
nt|yuval10: sry HE will make it|pg||
nt|yuval10: because S is declarer|pg||
nt|kaapo: Cilla might make a comment about him never presenting a good dummy, and her showing an example :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think S will like the dummy he'll see :)  he knows it's a reasonable grand, now only have to make!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I think he will|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Would Haglund bid 6@S with @CQx?|pg||

nt|mmmakela: -1|pg||
nt|kaapo: So 2@C followed by 2NT would be say 20-21|pg||
nt|varange: agreed|pg||

pc|c5|nt|Walddk4: Must have a lot of shape for that|pg||
nt|yuval10: lead @d will make it easier for him |pg||
nt|lml: East also might have made a move over 2NT or balanced|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|nt|kaapo: This seems to lose 2 spades, @D and @C|pg||
nt|kaapo: After North's fine spade switch|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|chick: this works to kill the diamonds, but let's W have 2 diamond tricks|pg||

pc|c4|pc|s2|nt|xenya: lucky layout for EW|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 2 bds i Imp subhash must be aware the match is close specialy after the 6@H went dn here|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mdgraham: looks like 4@c was an auto-splinter (a splinter agreeing my suit), but the values outside are quite soft|pg||
nt|mdgraham: incidentally, that last board - why did East play a club back after the @SA?|pg||
nt|lestergold: Cant blame Edwin for finding second best lead only lead tov pose a little challenge is a heart of course but woulodnt defeat the contract|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mmmakela: yes although obvious many wouldn't make it|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kaapo: Still more IMPs for Skalman on boards 19 (stopped at 3@S) and 20 (3NT went down)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lml: well I suppose that east-west had already lost this board at the other table so this isnt aas costly as it might have been|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|mmmakela: next a club and then N must find H switch|pg||
nt|kaapo: Interesting lead holding AK|pg||
pc|h7|nt|joemanjo: now can afford to misguess the clubs after the @h lead.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|abunio: jakos sie przeczolgal|pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: imp straty?|pg||
nt|varange: there is no justice!|pg||

pc|hK|nt|yuval10: @h to T, A@d and @d ruff|pg||
nt|kaapo: So it's very important for Örebridgen that Mikael makes this, which does seem quite likely|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|suketbombi: !A and Comfortable @C to T|pg||
pc|hA|nt|joemanjo: did North bid only 2@h?|pg||

nt|joemanjo: or after @h q|pg||
nt|suketbombi: other semis Maya Mira Sneha were up 30 imps 12 bds to go dont have the running scores|pg||

nt|othered1: By today's standards almost everyone has an opening of some sort, except maybe west in 4th seat (though with 3 quick tricks and some shape, I'd open it)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|suketbombi: it was pause Pause Pause & pause|pg||

mb|2S|nt|othered1: Now, how do Ew apply th ebrakes to the auction?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|joemanjo: needs immediate @d play to beat 4@h.|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: 4@H can be beaten -- but might prove tough to achieve that|pg||
nt|joemanjo: may not be found.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 7@C on spade finesse - dubious proposition|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes, but if you are on 7th level - you have no choice|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that double can be either for take-out or penalty - let us hope EW play it as take-out |pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: @CA, then find the @D switch |pg||

nt|suketbombi: 12 imps and Hope is eternal|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  yes, each pair has to elaborate agreement for such case|pg||
nt|mdgraham: presumably East had no descriptive bid in the direct seat |pg||

nt|suketbombi: can make rather|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: yes, there are many defences on the market|pg||

nt|lestergold: looks like a routine 4H contract will be reached routine bidding of course the play not so routine|pg||

nt|vugraphzck: last QF round 3/3 will be coming up shortly|pg||

nt|othered1: Actually 6@D from south looks rather good|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|mdgraham: yes, just spotted - 6@D quite good from the South hand |pg||

mb|4H|nt|mdgraham: I hate opening 1NT on hands like West's. Slam destroyer|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: now 2@S perhaps -- yes|pg||
nt|othered1: so your choice is pass?|pg||
nt|gambit: Perhaps with the T |pg||

nt|othered1: if @H lead found|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: defence needs to be sharp now - must switch to hearts after two spades, and take the first club |pg||
