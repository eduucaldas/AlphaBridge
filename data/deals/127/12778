pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|sK|nt|paulg:  the carding certainly looks like the diamonds are 4-4, and he cannot afford a heart switch, so I think Gyles Ellison should have won the second diamond|pg||

pc|d4|nt|garnetts: Worthwhile point made earlier if 21S is more of a prebalance than a full blooded bid then 4@S is right here--definetely somehting serious partnerships should discuss|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d9|nt|dinos1: that's why I asked)|pg||

nt|dinos1: 18.5 :)|pg||
nt|ady: surely this a throw in|pg||
nt|paulg:  i know that East-West are a new partnership, albeit of experienced players, and I believe North-South are also fairly new|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: I am sorry, but we do not have an open room at the moment. Connectivity problems at the venue in Wales|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  all four played with different partners in last year's event|pg||
nt|ady: west might fancy a 4th in hand opening|pg||
nt|garnetts: time to throw one in |pg||
mb|1S|nt|paulg:  so there will be much that they have yet to discuss|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: This is a fine grand slam|pg||
nt|paulg:  Ellison seems to have aged suddenly ... that looks like a normal 3@c opener|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 7NT is obviously laydown|pg||
nt|paulg:  I think East should really pass with a weak notrump|pg||
nt|dinos1: think 3@c promises at least 5-4|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|helene_t:  yes, 3@c shows a good hand since the double only promised hearts, not necessarily clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: can see no point in opening in fourth seat with that junk--I always get too high |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  won't get there that way|pg||
nt|jtr: I imagine 1@d shows @hs|pg||
nt|dinos1: now it's hard for W to believe they have 3 @s stoppers :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  must be from the Barry Crane school of grand slam bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 6NT is for people who have a plane to catch|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2@H leaves me speechless |pg||
nt|paulg:  well, almost |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk4: Extremely lazy|pg||
nt|garnetts: I would rather chew my own arm off than bid that |pg||
nt|ady: east was surely going down in 1NT   north has come to the rescue and should go down|pg||
nt|garnetts: We used to call such bids penalty tries |pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|paulg:  East-West CC: http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2010/ccards/corry-somerville.pdf|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c9|pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||

mb|2N!|an|Minors|nt|roswolf: yes the play is tricky|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The giveaway 2NT this is called|pg||
nt|ewj:  not any more :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdj: 1C can be two|pg||
mb|3S|nt|roswolf: and this bid will point the way in the play|pg||
nt|Walddk2: O'Connors @SQ is paper now|pg||
nt|vugraphzdj: Hence the misunderstanding/explanation|pg||
nt|roswolf: also a bidding mix up!?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ewj:  no way|pg||
nt|ewj:  if 3@S was NF, South still had an easy peasy 4@S bid|pg||
pc|d7|nt|roswolf: pass from south - must be old before his time|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess 3@S was not particularly invitational, with cue-bids in west's presumed suits covering forcing hands|pg||

nt|paulg:  they play 15-17 1NT opener according to the CC|pg||
nt|jtr: I though both sides were playing strong|pg||
nt|jtr: thought|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|dinos1: 5+? or 5@s4m?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Walddk4: Maybe the rebid was 2NT?|pg||
nt|jtr: So, the only system where the 1NT shows 18 is some variety transfers|pg||
nt|ady: n/s   should reach 4@S|pg||
mb|4S|nt|paulg:  5+@s apparently|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  3@s shows good suit and good points according the CC|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: looks like down 1|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: unless taking a very good guess in spades|pg||
nt|garnetts: may well get the spade right after the overcall|pg||
nt|ady: does 2@H show hearts and a minor?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jtr: More likely Roland|pg||
nt|paulg:  i guess it depends on what you open normally |pg||
pc|hA|nt|helene_t:  hmmm ... wouldnt it be useful to distinguish between a 5-card suit and a 6-card suit?|pg||

pc|hK|pg||
nt|paulg:  @cA now|pg||
nt|paulg:  and Boyd may lead the @sJ to tempt a cover|pg||
nt|ady: scotland did get the game swing on hand 4 in 4 spades|pg||
nt|paulg:  unless North has five clubs, it is hard to see when playing clubs is wrong|pg||
nt|garnetts: it is obviously right |pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|paulg:  2@d is game forcing checkback|pg||

pc|c4|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|Walddk4: Perhaps not as good as the last one|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Plenty good for me of course|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Ah, an open room!|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s6|nt|dinos1: 3@s4@c1@h1@d = 9|pg||
pc|sT|nt|paulg:  Morgan's play is a lot more considered ... in other words, a lot slower than his partner|pg||
nt|othered1: rehi, everyone|pg||
nt|paulg:  lacking entries here to take the spade finesse more than twice|pg||
nt|paulg:  but can still make three spades, two hearts, diamond and three clubs in total|pg||

pc|h5|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: well guessed    potential game swing for Ireland|pg||
mc|10|nt|paulg:  well done|pg||
nt|paulg:  the auction will be different in the other room, where they play a strong 1NT ... West might show 5-5|pg||
nt|garnetts: The finesse was with the odds based on the overcall and vacant spaces |pg||
nt|garnetts: cannot see west passing next door either |pg||

nt|paulg:  part of the reason is that the old guard is migrating to the seniors ... leaving space for the new|pg||
nt|paulg:  as I expected, Corry-Somerville have not let the poor 6NT contract affect them|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Nice to term getting old as migrating:)|pg||
nt|jtr: I will use that|pg||

mb|1D|nt|paulg:  the british teams are doing okay in the curling at the moment|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  but they'll be the scottish teams if they do not medal|pg||

nt|bigtrain: lol|pg||
nt|ady: slam time|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  good slam here|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|paulg:  East gives the double the respect it deserves|pg||
nt|dinos1: wasnt 2N showed supp?|pg||
nt|paulg:  although I thought 2NT was probably a good raise to 3@H|pg||
nt|dinos1: unusual to play it as nat after X|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Yes, 2N shows support, mistake by W|pg||
nt|helene_t:  yes, W must be tirred|pg||
nt|dinos1: didnt notice X card?|pg||
nt|paulg:  East might just bid 6@h|pg||
mb|6H|nt|Walddk4: 5@C is wrong young man. 4NT is the bid if you want to compete|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5@C shows preference for clubs|pg||
nt|bigtrain: just bidding his stronger minor roland|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They are stronger, admittedly|pg||
nt|ady: need to play in 6@H |pg||
mb|p|nt|dinos1: now guess @d - and make|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtr: But his clubs are better:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: to the point |pg||
nt|garnetts: no faffing about--good auction to the best spot |pg||

nt|jtr: Sandie Millership is kindly getting scores from the other table|pg||
nt|jtr: The first 3 are flat|pg||
nt|garnetts: next |pg||
nt|paulg:  unlike the rest of the team, Gyles is one for the pragmatic approach|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|pc|c6|pg||
nt|dinos1: but think he'll misguess|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jtr: This needs a squeeze to make|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|h5|pg||
pc|hA|nt|othered1: or a throw-in on east|pg||
nt|paulg:  easier to take the club finesse|pg||
nt|jtr: And no reason to look further than the @c finesse i guess|pg||
nt|jtr: Let's at least credit East for pushing them|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes he should have an idea of the hand since East cannot have 4@ds|pg||
nt|paulg:  if you happened to ruff the diamond and see that East has @dQxx, then you might start thinking|pg||
nt|othered1: they were headed for -800 and that's without things lying horribly|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5 over 5 is seldom right|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Manfield/Klinger|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The 5-level belongs to the opponents|pg||
nt|jtr: 4 is flat also|pg||
nt|jtr: The record number of consecuitive flat boards in a junior event is 6|pg||
nt|paulg:  this board will not be flat ... even if they get to 5@h it will be doubled|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That was in 1974|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes April 23rd|pg||
pc|hT|nt|helene_t:  2NT shows a 3-card limit raise, also without the double|pg||
nt|paulg:  i don't think it will matter|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|pg||
nt|othered1: I think east has to find a way to convince declarer that he doesn't have his actual hand.  Not sure how he can.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|d5|pc|c5|nt|othered1: and, just in case, that @S 10 should make it clear.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: last guess saves aren't generally productive - there are three possible results and two of them are bad|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: looks like north and south have different ideas about south's range.  |pg||
nt|vugraphzdj: 1N described by Alex as 15-18 - so it looks as if Phil has gone for it|pg||

nt|ady: there may be difficulties defeating 3@C|pg||
nt|garnetts: especially if South winds and leads a spade |pg||
