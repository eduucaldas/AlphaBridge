nt|ryskiel_: in my opinion 2@D is overbid, 3@H should be enough|pg||
nt|jfaria: wrongly as the K@s fails to coperate|pg||
nt|jfaria: anyway, not an absurd game...|pg||
mc|9|nt|marlowepi: it is not that 2D is an overbid, it is more of a misbid. here you know you wanbt to play in hearts and slam is out of the question, so just raise hearts to whatever level you think ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: is appropriarte. 2D is a bid you would make if strain were in doubt, for example with only 3 hearts|pg||
pg||
qx|o8|st||md|2SQJ7HKQ96D62CQ932,S93H432DAJ543CAK6,S852HT875DKQT87C7,SAKT64HAJD9CJT854|sv|o|mb|1D|nt|marlowepi: the layout was unlucky. the EW crds deserved to make 4H, but the EW auction deserved down 1 :)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 3 @H from East should show exactly 17/18 HCP, because 1 @H dont promise anything except 4 (sometimes 3( cards in hearsts|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|d|mb|p|nt|jfaria: must keep in mind that Carlos could bid 1@h with just 3 cards... 2@d could find out... and easily pass 2 @h|pg||
mb|2H|nt|marlowepi: agreed, 3H gets the job done. bidding 2D instead says that your hand is NOT describable by a 3H call (or any other)|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|jfaria: ok commentators desagree on tyhe auction lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: IF he was planning to pass 2H, then he should just RAISE to 2H so that W will know for sure that E has 4 hearts. 2D doesnt promise four hearts|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: case is typical, but as we see this give this same problems as in political point of view in Poland|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jfaria: :)|pg||
nt|jfaria: as NS can only make 3@h tricks, think Paz will bring 9tricks home|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: can make by spades and @C finesse|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well in that case i will say that the fundamental reason for raising hearts instead of cuebidding is that your prinmary objective should be to show SOLIDARITY|pg||
nt|jfaria: why not ? :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is IMPs, and once W could only bid 1H in reply to the TO double, EW were not going to be making a NT game on raw power--any hope for game lay with hearts. that is why E needs to ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: be sure to make a call that guarantees four hearts|pg||
