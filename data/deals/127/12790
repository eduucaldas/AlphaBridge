pc|cT|nt|paulg:  not that it has affected the final contract|pg||
nt|mdgraham: always difficult, whether to lead your own suit (as here) or partner's|pg||
nt|othered1: May depend on your minimum suit quality standard for the weak 2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: junior players are not renowned for having 100-honour suits for their weak twos, in general |pg||

nt|vugraphzdh: sorry, error on data entry.|pg||
nt|paulg:  +1? I guess Ellison must have cleared trumps|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s3|nt|garnetts: should have been planning somehting at trick two--and once the second high spade had been played only two more rounds offered a chance |pg||

nt|paulg:  this is a crucial round in the event .. Scotland need a large win as Ireland take on England|pg||
mb|p|nt|dinos1: X?|pg||
nt|paulg:  double 1@s or bid 2@h?|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2H!|an|hearts and a minor|nt|paulg:  both Scotland and Ireland will then have one match left against supposedly weaker opposition|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: a part score in spades looks all |pg||
nt|paulg:  Ireland currently 8 VPs ahead|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  i think double is a lot better than 1@h|pg||
mb|2S|nt|garnetts: not sure I would pass East's hand |pg||
nt|garnetts: intiially I mean |pg||
mb|p|nt|dinos1: yes - perfect shape for X, and h is as 4-cd|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@s is probably non-forcing|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|garnetts: For the record I prefer 2@H as I have such good pips--but it is rare to overcall with five |pg||
nt|ady: east prefered to keep silent  red against green   must be pleased once south has hearts|pg||
pc|hK|nt|helene_t:  yes but not perfect strength for x followed by 2@h|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|jtr: 4@s is the game here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If you open a hand like East's (I would too I must confess), you will get to no play games quite often|pg||
nt|jtr: But the @hs may get blocked|pg||
nt|paulg:  good hand to be playing 3/5 leads|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||

pc|c2|nt|paulg:  @c10 now, but i doubt that Ellison will underlead the @dA|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s7|pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
nt|dinos1: yes|pg||
nt|paulg:  in their defence, the Irish Open team has made its reputation by bidding a great deal and the juniors are probably used to playing in poor games ... although you'd hope they'd be a lot better than this|pg||

nt|garnetts: excellent 4@S here just losing the trump tricks |pg||
nt|ady: three trump tricks to lose in 4@S  |pg||
nt|paulg:  they are playing 5-card majors, i wonder what a 2N response is by a passed hand?|pg||
nt|paulg:  you need to win by 40 IMPs to score 25 VPs, so Scotland already in maximum territory|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|dinos1: misunderstanding|pg||
nt|paulg:  t/o for me and North|pg||
nt|dinos1: +2|pg||
nt|helene_t:  somerville plays this dbl as optional in other partnerships, I don't think these two have played long together|pg||
nt|paulg:  no mention of drury on the card|pg||
mb|p|nt|dinos1: +1 with @d promotion|pg||
nt|eamongall: LOTT  rules again .. 9 trumps 9 tricks :) |pg||
nt|dinos1: 9 trumps doesnt guarantee 9 tricks ))|pg||
nt|eamongall: oops I only counted EW half ..silly me |pg||
nt|helene_t:  at least defense will get trump promotion here but still a large swing for Ireland|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ady: can raise to 4@H    costs nothing|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  the double fit means that they have missed 4@h here|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|paulg:  John Matheson points out that this defence makes sense if declarer has @hKx and good diamonds|pg||
mb|5N|nt|paulg:  i guess if North is bidding over double then he would have bid on anyhow, but the double looks wrong|pg||
nt|garnetts: I cannot imagine ever bidding 2@S on the South tickets |pg||

nt|ewj:  reminds me of a hand i had at the europeans where I went down in a grand slam because a side suit broke 5-0 offside missing t9 to 5|pg||
nt|ewj:  of course the other room is always in game or small slam|pg||

nt|helene_t:  W rebid 3@d in the other room also|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Board wrong way round so players names will be wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  a little surprising that East did not balance in the other room|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Walddk4: This round will conclude the cycle of the first round-robin|pg||
mb|2C|mb|5C|nt|paulg:  less reason here with nothing in spades|pg||
nt|dinos1: yes - seems shd X 1@s in passout seat|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 1NT bid and played by Corry|pg||
nt|paulg:  hard to avoid 4@s here|pg||
nt|dburn: odd, that|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: gets murky now maybe|pg||
nt|paulg:  so they had this auction in their last practise match, and Gyles Ellison was admonished for not bidding 1@s with the East hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: spades are the fourth suit |pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|paulg:  they play walsh, so bid 1@s with a weak hand even with longer diamonds|pg||
nt|garnetts: I agree with 1@S intially |pg||
mb|7S|nt|dinos1: lucky lead for dcl|pg||
nt|ewj:  2@C? majors :P?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: A lead I don't understand when you have QJx in another suit|pg||
nt|paulg:  I hate to guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 2c should've been alerted as 5-4 in the majors|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It was his turn to bid is the best you can say about it|pg||
mb|p|pc|cK|nt|dburn: no doubt exclusion Blackwood for hearts, but how would East know whether he was missing @hA or not?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ady: this seems like 8 tricks|pg||
nt|paulg:  lucky that there is only one board left, because Morgan will be unhappy even when he sees the spade break|pg||
nt|ady: 4 spades should make in spite of the 4-1 spliy|pg||
nt|ady: split|pg||
pc|c3|nt|paulg:  it is a pretty good 1NT opener, some might upgrade it|pg||
nt|ewj:  has chances now|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|sA|nt|garnetts: I wondered if there was too much to do in 4@S |pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|garnetts: It can make if you don't play on trumps early on |pg||
nt|dburn: still, he has an awkward hand, and 7@s is a pretty good contract|pg||
mc|12|nt|dinos1: too strong for 1N - 17pc with good 5-cd suit and good honors|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C!|an|Can be 2|mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|ewj:  only a slight risk of one of Wests KC being spades and declarer would have to ruff diamonds anyway so might not be enough|pg||
mb|4D|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c6|nt|paulg:  As far as I can tell, in the Junior Camrose Scotland are the only team that can overtake the Republic of Ireland and they need to win by 13 IMPs to do that|pg||

nt|paulg:  Ellison knows that the hearts are not coming in|pg||
