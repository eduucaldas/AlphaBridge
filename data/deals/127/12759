pc|sT|nt|Walddk4: The Junior Camrose series, initially for those under 27, but now for those under 25, was launched in September 1971 in Glasgow. Scotland won. Members of that team, Sandy Duncan, ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Barnet Shenkin, George Cuthbertson, and Derek Diamond all went to represent Scotland in the Camrose. The other team members were David Shenkin and Cameron McLatchie|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d7|pc|s4|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: This is a fine grand slam|pg||
nt|paulg:  Ellison seems to have aged suddenly ... that looks like a normal 3@c opener|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 7NT is obviously laydown|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  won't get there that way|pg||
nt|jtr: I imagine 1@d shows @hs|pg||
pc|sT|nt|andyv:  must be from the Barry Crane school of grand slam bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 6NT is for people who have a plane to catch|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
mc|13|nt|paulg:  it appears that 1@d is natural|pg||

nt|jtr: and 1NT then?|pg||
pg||
qx|c6|st||md|4S732HAKTDJT743CA5,SK985HQ3DK62C8743,SAQJTH97DA9CKT962,S64HJ86542DQ85CQJ|sv|e|nt|Walddk4: Downgraded 15-17 I presume, not sure why|pg||
nt|paulg:  they play 15-17 1NT opener according to the CC|pg||
nt|jtr: I though both sides were playing strong|pg||
nt|jtr: thought|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Maybe the rebid was 2NT?|pg||
nt|jtr: So, the only system where the 1NT shows 18 is some variety transfers|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|jtr: More likely Roland|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|paulg:  2@d is game forcing checkback|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jtr: Another easy slam:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Perhaps not as good as the last one|pg||
nt|paulg:  my style is to respond 2@c on these hands, rather than 1@s|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Plenty good for me of course|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Ah, an open room!|pg||
nt|jtr: Wow!|pg||
pc|c3|nt|othered1: off to the open room.  See 'ya.|pg||

pc|cT|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|c9|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|h6|nt|paulg:  Morgan's play is a lot more considered ... in other words, a lot slower than his partner|pg||
nt|othered1: rehi, everyone|pg||
nt|paulg:  lacking entries here to take the spade finesse more than twice|pg||
nt|paulg:  but can still make three spades, two hearts, diamond and three clubs in total|pg||
nt|jtr: Did have them but got distracted by @cs|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||

pc|h9|pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|pc|sQ|nt|paulg:  Frazer Morgan is part of Scotland's Open team for the European Championships, so this scrutiny is good practice|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
mc|10|nt|paulg:  as is Alex Wilkinson in the Open room|pg||
nt|jtr: The new guard coming in then?|pg||

nt|paulg:  part of the reason is that the old guard is migrating to the seniors ... leaving space for the new|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jtr: Nice to term getting old as migrating:)|pg||
nt|jtr: I will use that|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Oh, I thought you were talking about curling with all those guards|pg||
mb|2N|nt|paulg:  the british teams are doing okay in the curling at the moment|pg||
mb|4H|nt|paulg:  but they'll be the scottish teams if they do not medal|pg||
nt|jtr: South may be tempted|pg||
nt|othered1: I get  unlucky when I try unusual NT with that suit length/strength disparity|pg||
nt|bigtrain: hi|pg||
mb|5C|nt|jtr: Hey Walter|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Walter|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Walter is our expert on British/Irish junior bridge|pg||
nt|bigtrain: lol|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 5@C is wrong young man. 4NT is the bid if you want to compete|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5@C shows preference for clubs|pg||
nt|bigtrain: just bidding his stronger minor roland|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They are stronger, admittedly|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|jtr: But his clubs are better:)|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|andyv:  he does prefer @cs....the 5|pg||
nt|jtr: Sandie Millership is kindly getting scores from the other table|pg||
nt|jtr: The first 3 are flat|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d7|pc|h2|pg||
nt|jtr: This needs a squeeze to make|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|othered1: or a throw-in on east|pg||
nt|paulg:  easier to take the club finesse|pg||
nt|jtr: And no reason to look further than the @c finesse i guess|pg||
nt|jtr: Let's at least credit East for pushing them|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes he should have an idea of the hand since East cannot have 4@ds|pg||
nt|paulg:  if you happened to ruff the diamond and see that East has @dQxx, then you might start thinking|pg||
nt|othered1: they were headed for -800 and that's without things lying horribly|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5 over 5 is seldom right|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Manfield/Klinger|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The 5-level belongs to the opponents|pg||
nt|jtr: 4 is flat also|pg||
nt|jtr: The record number of consecuitive flat boards in a junior event is 6|pg||
nt|paulg:  this board will not be flat ... even if they get to 5@h it will be doubled|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That was in 1974|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes April 23rd|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|pc|h5|nt|othered1: I think east has to find a way to convince declarer that he doesn't have his actual hand.  Not sure how he can.|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|nt|othered1: and, just in case, that @S 10 should make it clear.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: last guess saves aren't generally productive - there are three possible results and two of them are bad|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h6|nt|jtr: 5 is flat too|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c9|pc|c8|pc|c7|pg||
nt|jtr: He has the count now|pg||
nt|ewj:  very nice, let's assume that he would have got it right if he'd had to|pg||
pc|c2|nt|paulg:  he has count of the hand now|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtr: Silly but good:)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|Walddk4: Then this game is too deep for you and me, David|pg||
mb|3S|nt|jtr: I once bid 4@h over partner's Michaels with a singleton|pg||
nt|othered1: It's better if you're sure you're going to be on  lead.  Otherwise, partners sometimes don't have a sense of humor about it.|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|jtr: Then removed to 4@s with my 5 card suit|pg||
nt|jtr: They doubled that too|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and partner pulled to 5@H I presume|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|jtr: If he did he would be ex-partner:)|pg||
