mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: I don't think it applies at the 4-level. Do you play that, Sabine?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|athene: cautious pass from south - 1@H looks the mainstream action|pg||
mb|d|an|t/o|mb|5D|nt|Walddk2: 1@S denies a major|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcmax: East would have to avoid a passive trump lead against 4@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: a<nd shows 4+ diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S is specifically diamonds - and has to be, surely, for 3@D not to be insane :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcmax: South's original pass now made a fit-showing 3@H bid very easy|pg||
pc|sK|nt|brolucius: Only the vulnerability deterred South from bidding 1@H.|pg||
nt|jcmax: When you don't bid a suit at a lower level given the opportunity, but then bit it later at a higher level, it usually means fit with partner's suit|pg||
nt|daman: a backhanded fit-jump|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h4|pc|h7|pg||
pc|dK|nt|hlortz: at pairs might pass the double (and lead trump) but dangerous at IMPs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Against these openings, useful to play double of a relay as t/o of the opening suit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so 2@C-2@D (r)-x=t/o of @c|pg||

nt|vugraphzcu: ok - back in sequence again|pg||
mb|1C|nt|athene: It might be hard to set up a good platform for hunting them - if redouble is support, for example.|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p!|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: They don't play Support bids, I am told. Well, few players like to defend at the one-level.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jcmax: 2C doubled should go for 300 and that is no big surprise with the North hand|pg||
nt|daman: Barry Crane lovede defending and the one level|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not sure what Frances has shown here. Maybe Jeffrey can message me|pg||
nt|athene: With North's black suits as they are, the penalty auction is more appealing since you expect opps to have to go to 2@C, not 1@S|pg||
nt|brolucius: By the way, much obliged if no-one mentions any football scores. I have the Sky+ box recording the action.|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: as you might expect that pass was not alerted|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: club lead will sink this, but hard lead to find from that North hand|pg||
nt|hlortz: only a @C lead will hurt|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jcmax: what are football scores? :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@c = (i) NAT (ii) 13-17 BAL (iii) 4@s 5@h less than a reverse|pg||
nt|brolucius: Many thanks to Guy Hart for explaining some of the tricky bids.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|pc|h3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: although if South switches to a club... |pg||
nt|ralfwil: but also a @c shift from Gunnat will break 3nt|pg||
nt|hlortz: true|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|brolucius: Also to Roland, of course.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So I assume (iii) here|pg||
nt|jcmax: wow! Balancing in a non-fit auction is often very dangerous....|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not me, Jeffrey Allerton|pg||
nt|athene: I have to say, it looks more sensible for South to bid 1@S the first time rather than pass and come in later with 2@S|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|daman: nerves of steel|pg||
nt|athene: The fact that opps have stopped low (and hance don't have game values) is just irrelevant|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: he didn't flinch when dummy hit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good @S9 from West|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: Osborne's 2@d is usually a bad hand|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|s6|pc|d8|pc|d9|pg||
nt|brolucius: Simpson is an ex Scotland yard detective (a few years ago now, it is true), so we would not expect him to flinch.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: These "sound" (i.e. over-cautious) early views often mean you have to take much greater risks on a later round|pg||
nt|jcmax: The idea is to never let the opponents play on the 2-level when they have a fit. But when they don't necessarily have a fit, balancing can be a very risky undertaking.|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|pc|sK|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jcmax: East might easily have doubled 2S in my opinion|pg||

nt|daman: and you could end up with nothing from something|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|brolucius: More important to impress the kibitzers than to avoid an occasional minus 800.|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|nt|athene: spade ruff puts paid to 4@H here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 4@H seems makeable, not sure what went wrong for Eginton in the closed room|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/wat infavourable do not want to get too high here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: this double may be a bit premature|pg||
nt|lestergold: if it6s for penal.ties that is certainly true|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Walddk2: Oh right, spades|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk2: 2@c 3-card Drury|pg||
nt|jcmax: 4@H looks like a very normal contract to reach. It only goes down on a very lucky lay-out. Both @H-honours offside and a @S-ruff out|pg||
nt|jcmax: unlucky lay-out I guess that is :)|pg||
nt|athene: mind you there is a chance|pg||
nt|athene: suppose north leads the @CQ instead of a low one|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can duck|pg||
nt|athene: and now south has to overtake|pg||
nt|brolucius: Still four losers.|pg||
nt|athene: i am sure even suggesting any of this is insulting almost all the players at the table, though :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: declarer's thoughts interrupted by the collection of some table money|pg||
nt|daman: side bets|pg||
nt|brolucius: A pity. I was expecting some wonderful play after this long thought.|pg||
nt|jcmax: You make a good point. North shouldn't switch to the @CQ, but a low one when in with the @HQ. But even if he did switch to the Q, South should be able to work out to overtake. The ...|pg||
nt|jcmax: @SQ looks like quite an obvious singleton.|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might be vaguely thinking about scissors coup ideas - throwing dummy's spades on diamonds to stop the south entry|pg||
nt|daman: Sominex Coup    put the opps to sleep and make a false claim|pg||
nt|athene: but it's all just not possible|pg||
nt|daman: wjich they accept |pg||
nt|athene: for one thing even if he cashed the @DK declarer couldn't come to hand, and for another thing, south can win the last diamond anyway|pg||
nt|jcmax: How about this? Win @SA in hand, play a @D to K and a low @C off dummy. will south always hope with the A?|pg||
nt|athene: sorry i meant throwing spades, not clubs, on the diamonds :)|pg||
nt|jcmax: *hop|pg||
nt|athene: arghhh throwing clubs not spades|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mdgraham: if it is penalties, and I see no reason why it shouldn't be |pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|lestergold: its basically showing a strong defensive oriented hand but no way will west stand it|pg||
nt|hlortz: hmm dangerous to double here . but w wisely removes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: if D on 2@h is showing @h, why not 3@h from E|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however, that's just my opinion, and EW seem to disagree|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: yes low club off dummy is very cute|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: east obeys hamman's rule|pg||
pc|h7|nt|daman: this doesn't necessarily have to be a stiff either|pg||

nt|lestergold: understatement by Dhondy|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: 4H not much better|pg||
nt|lestergold: its 100 s as qwell|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: but you would look silly if north actually had the @CA|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|daman: an exciting push|pg||
nt|athene: well, Coyle didn't put his partner under pressure and/or give west a chance to duck in clubs|pg||
nt|brolucius: North avoided one problem that Bill mentioned, by leading a low club instead of the queen.|pg||
nt|athene: he had the whole defence planned out at trick 1|pg||
nt|daman: exactly    making no mistakes|pg||

nt|ralfwil: I donÂ´t like 4@s from E! do you?|pg||

nt|vugraphzcu: 1D usually nebulous in this kind of system - not explained so i can't tell you more than the fact it was alerted!|pg||
nt|lestergold: and it does no harm to give pard choice|pg||

nt|jcmax: @S means: please don't!|pg||
nt|athene: that club split enabled declarer to play his avoidance and time it correctly|pg||

nt|mdgraham: well, maybe North contributed to the luck factor with a slightly odd opening lead  |pg||

mb|1S|nt|lestergold: agree|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N!|mb|p|nt|davidstern: In the OR on this hand West opened 1@C, South reopened with a double, West redoubled to show his fine hand and then E/W lay down and let the opps play a normal heart partscore|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2H|nt|daman: and in Denmark    they have a club with the same name   TGR      for The Great Roland|pg||

mb|p|nt|brolucius: At the week-end, on BBO, David Gold said that he hated the idea of playing four-card majors alongside the weak 1NT. I rather agree with him.|pg||
nt|lestergold: there is a reason for opening leads from those holdings recommended as top from the interior sequence|pg||
nt|davidstern: This wont be much fun but likely win 1 imp|pg||

nt|brolucius: When you have a balanced 12 opposite 11, the bidding goes 1@H - 2@D - 2NT - 3NT. No space for a game try.|pg||

nt|lestergold: they have reputation as good players but I would guess there is an element of sponoprshi[p involved |pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|nt|daman: some people play 2NT as asking pd   if I could have made a game try     what suit would have moved you to accept?|pg||
nt|brolucius: I'm sorry, my last comment was nonsense (as a few tactful kibitzers may have noticed). That is what happens when you play the strong 1NT and the 1NT rebid is therefore weak. ...|pg||
