nt|jtr: I am really concerned about him|pg||
nt|viren169: good hand now|pg||
nt|rnmalik: what a board:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: would be more interesting if colours were reversed|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: 1nt should be easy enough for NS |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: then n/s would have viable club save against the 6D slam|pg||
nt|viren169: yes... N/S are likely to be a bit shy at this vul|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 1@C 2+ also makes diamonds a suit. Usually 5, but can be 4 with 4441 hands|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|athene: support double?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks an easy 1N rebid for South |pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Well, one would normally pass to show the weak NT|pg||
nt|viren169: not sure about the 2@S bis|pg||
nt|viren169: ...bid...|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6H on 3/2 break but 6D much superior except at mps|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|viren169: looks like they have decided on hearts as trumps...|pg||
nt|ady: should play 6@D|pg||
nt|rnmalik: why not 4@D instaed of 4@H|pg||
nt|viren169: RKC and 6@D as an alternative place to play|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: no mention of 2D as GF that i heard which would make 2S more sensible|pg||
nt|lestergold: now if west tries 6D it may be misinterpreted as some sort of grand slam try|pg||
nt|ady: I think 3@H was a good choice to get a suit agreed if playing rkc  then eventually play in diamonds|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but when is east gonna believe that West has 8 to the tops now!|pg||
nt|ady: could always use 6@C as a grand slam try|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but east has to know what west is doing at this level|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@H-ok, but 4@D by E that would be choice of contract and resultantly 6@D|pg||
nt|viren169: setting hearts is good to find about the Q of @H before bidding 6/7 diamonds depending on no. of keycards|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I am not a big fan of support doubles as it is, and I think they are even more useless after 1@D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you could, I suppose - but 1N shows what you have quite nicely|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mdgraham: a balanced hand with a decent spade stop|pg||
nt|dburn: question of whether 1NT is a maximum weak no trump with spade stops or whether it shows better than a strong no trump|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, maybe it is ok with a near maximum and 1.75 stops|pg||
nt|athene: some play 1nt as the support double, in fact|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, i saw that the other day and i like it|pg||
nt|dburn: sound even worse than support doubles|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|nt|rnmalik: 6@D or @H makes very friendly @H distribution|pg||
nt|viren169: are they playing 2/1?|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|dburn: and nothing is worse than support doubles|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|lestergold: second best spot as i gfeared|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|jtr: At least it is a bid that need not have another meaning|pg||
nt|rnmalik: +1|pg||
nt|viren169: 2nd best spot gets you +1 or +2 imps!|pg||
nt|lestergold: unbelievable lead|pg||
nt|viren169: strange lead|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|nt|mdgraham: why has declarer knocked out the entry to her diamonds? |pg||
pc|s8|pc|s7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: One could argue that 1NT should show 18-19 and that you pass with a weak NT|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|d2|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|dburn: because they are trumps, perhaps|pg||
nt|jtr: Tend to double with 18/19 and bid 2NT with a good suit and 17+|pg||
nt|mdgraham: oh yes - well spotted|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|nt|lestergold: why not try a diamond at leat|pg||
pc|hA|nt|viren169: would have tried a @D myself|pg||
nt|lestergold: least|pg||

nt|ady: better for west to ruff 2nd club and swsitch to a diamond|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: i thought ruffing clubs while they were blocked then D switch might be harder?|pg||
nt|lestergold: very favourable layout here for E/W|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lestergold: 3N therefore on if they bid it|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|viren169: best for West to bid 2N|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: I see the point of 1@h but you might not have a rebid|pg||
nt|dburn: well, they can get them into the auction now...|pg||
nt|dburn: ...but maybe West's double would have had more to do with the lead than with a save|pg||
nt|athene: double of 4@C might have been for a spade lead or something|pg||
nt|viren169: and raise by East to 3N|pg||
mb|2S|nt|dburn: meanwhile, North has a pretty good hand facing a real splinter and not the joke splinter that South actually has|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I think double should indicate a save at these colours|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mdgraham: you feel that West might have doubled 4@C, but maybe that's looking at the East hand as well |pg||
nt|athene: yes, optimal agreement might be to have x of splinter save-suggesting only at favourable, else lead for one of the other suits, but that's quite a lot to discuss|pg||
nt|jtr: Considering 4NT now maybe|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Apparently, Fawcett's splinter is not limited since Moore bid 4@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: No 1@s overcall and she has xxx@h|pg||
nt|lestergold: will now|pg||
nt|rnmalik: heard you:)|pg||

nt|ady: may play south to have 3 diamonds to the ace|pg||
nt|viren169: @C return is probably best...|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mdgraham: not without looking at the hand records |pg||
nt|jtr: If East cn find the @s8 lead then North can find the 9 from dummy|pg||
nt|viren169: or the J of diamonds?|pg||
nt|lestergold: the diamond concedes the contract leave declarer to own devices may go off|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||

pc|hK|nt|lestergold: spade first |pg||

pc|h2|nt|lestergold: also serves a sa discovery play|pg||
nt|lestergold: because if KS with south ace dimsm morem likely to be with North who opened weak 2 vul|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: but if defenders continued diamonds youd need s finesse anyway|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but declarer has a losing option in diamonds |pg||
nt|lestergold: so needs to know where spade is|pg||
nt|viren169: Declarer still looking for the 9th trick|pg||
nt|ady: needs to play diamond now|pg||
nt|lestergold: obviously on dim return that becomes irrelevant and spade finesse simply needed|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: agreed, though at this stage with d9 winning first trick declarer's best chance of a d trick is k onside.  could north duck sk?!|pg||

nt|lestergold: not really light by today's standards|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|lestergold: as cards lie may even make|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: may make with overtrick even|pg||

nt|viren169: Back to the AK leads!|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: this one pretty clear!|pg||
nt|viren169: A or K?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5H on double dummy so interesting hand|pg||
nt|viren169: or a small heart!|pg||
nt|viren169: or the 9 of hearts!|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphzdb: we were all wrong!|pg||

nt|lestergold: double heart finess club guess|pg||

nt|viren169: I have been told the 2@S is a girlie lead by ____|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: trump leads show doubt don't they? :-)|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry 5H cant bemae double dummy because of shortage of entries for taking all the necessary finesses|pg||
nt|lestergold: however 5H a good save|pg||
nt|lestergold: spades played by west also cant make 11 ricks|pg||

nt|vugraphzdb: no reason to do that surely?|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h7|pg||

pc|h6|pc|h9|nt|viren169: Not sure I would open 1@H here...|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course neither side knows about the double fit which usually creates high level contracts for both sidesw|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Rotaru has nothing to think about in my opinion. A limited hand that doubles wants to defend|pg||
mb|p|nt|garbisro: and W-E on red, must be passed imediatelly|pg||

nt|vugraphzdb: only noticed a board later!  will sort at break|pg||
mb|1H|nt|vugraphzdb: :)|pg||
nt|dburn: 4@s reasonable here, but lie of cards unlucky|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|dburn: still, might make anyway, but will need some good views|pg||
nt|jtr: Rather|pg||
nt|dburn: not impossible to take them either, if South produces a two-suited overcall|pg||
mb|2N|nt|dburn: not sure about this one, though - wny not 2@s?|pg||
nt|dburn: ah - hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|dburn: useful method here|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: 3@c "clubs but not hearts stopped for 3NT", I guess|pg||
nt|jtr: Somewhat esoteric|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: thanks, done!|pg||
nt|ewj: Fairly boring hand here|pg||
nt|ewj: Expect it'll end in 2@S by South|pg||
mb|3N|mb|d|nt|vugraphzdb: 1 level too high ed!|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: Old style was to x on the S hand of course, but in the world where no-one lets you play at the 1 level, I think Penfold's style better|pg||
nt|mamos:  maybe even 1â |pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: I guess you might make it now|pg||
mb|p|pc|h5|pc|hA|nt|dburn: certainly in with a shot on this auction|pg||
nt|dburn: enterprising stuff at the other table, though Klingons on starboard bow|pg||
pc|hT|nt|jtr: Interesting lead|pg||
nt|dburn: now, why when partner has shown hearts and clubs would you lead a diamond?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: declarer asking lho about agreement couldnt hear answer|pg||
nt|jtr: I dont think you will get many answers|pg||
nt|dburn: not that a diamond lead will work badly - may cut declarer off from dummy's suit|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, now you can even cash the @sAK|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jtr: After the @c ruff|pg||
nt|ewj: can make 10 of course|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: you'd never find your 5-3 spade fit by doubling unless you overbid your hand|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|ewj: diamond back, ruffed, @C to J, then can take a force in the dummy and a nice kx of spades onside for 10 tricks :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: should be 10 tricks now unles dec misguesse clubs|pg||
nt|ewj: Will probably make 10 trivially now|pg||
nt|eggy: sometimes of course it doesn't work so well, as here, where a thin 4S comes in|pg||
