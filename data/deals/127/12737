nt|mmmakela: then they run to 5 clubs, now S had a "chance" to find dias lead|pg||
nt|petergill: Jeff, if NS have that agreement, then they should do so - but if their advance agreemtn is that Dbl means lead hearts, then "no way"|pg||
mb|2N!|an|5h-5cl|mb|3S|nt|petergill: @C and @H of course|pg||
nt|fann4: I do think that on balance it must pay for doubles like this not to be penalty, but steering partner to another suit.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|petergill: 1@D is part of a strong club system|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think EW play a strong club system -- it's just that they open 1@D with 4 @Ds and 5 @Cs|pg||
nt|fann4: On Bd 23 in the CR, EW were winning the part score battle, but overeached to 3NT, which is going 2 down.|pg||
nt|fann4: So they will lose 3 imps instead of gaining 6.|pg||

nt|ady: likely slam for n/s to start|pg||
nt|ady: only danger is they get to a grand and fail|pg||
nt|ady: maybe an old hand  |pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: hello cornelia|pg||
nt|mmmakela: not much here for either side|pg||
nt|Gerben42: still might land in 3N|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 1 nt NS best|pg||
nt|Gerben42: will you bid stayman over 1N? then they play 2@H|pg||
nt|mmmakela: no I pass gladly|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what does it mean?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and i've been trying alt0222 |pg||
nt|yo_yo: nothing happens|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no idea what Roland meant|pg||
nt|lestergold: E/W could find a thin spade game here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: To get the  Þ|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i tried it roland|pg||
nt|lestergold: have to guerss hearts to have a chance|pg||

nt|mdgraham: two very strong pairs here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hi Jaap :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: exciting hand to start|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@S unbeatable:)?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|Walddk4: Get a chat line and press Alt0222|pg||
nt|vugraphzcx: My name is Gudni and I´ll be your operator to day in closed room|pg||
mb|1H|nt|yo_yo: nothing|pg||
mb|1S|an|5+|nt|Gerben42: i think with expected 22 HCP or so, you should take your plus|pg||
nt|jaapfr: re all|pg||
nt|roswolf: slam in diamonds is makeable|pg||
mb|3H|an|pre|nt|mdgraham: a somewhat attenuated 1@D opening, but has an easy rebid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: support double, by the look of it - showing three-card spade support|pg||
nt|jaapfr: true but biddable?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mmmakela: absolutely no reason to bid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hi rashed  and Gudni|pg||
nt|mdgraham: playing that, a raise to 2@S would show four-card support.  |pg||
nt|roswolf: well west has to show them now|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mmmakela: good lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: has East done enough?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello from a snowy Manchester|pg||
mb|4S|nt|vinbtech: helo and wc to all|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is that bidding correct gudni?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello  vinay|pg||
nt|vugraphzcx: yes there are misunderstanding at the table |pg||
nt|roswolf: welland +zia wont sit quietly|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: spade contracts played by east arent so threatened by a club lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Keep Alt down with your left hand while you type  0222 with your right hand. It's not difficult|pg||
nt|lestergold: well bullets nice suit poor and stuffingh non exiastent 2s was a free bid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i/ve tried that 15 times|pg||
nt|vinbtech: likely 3n interpreted as both majors !|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 3s would be an overbid|pg||
nt|sybarra2: welcome Martim|pg||
nt|jaapfr: difficult word Mike but got what you meant about 1@D:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: i never heard of that |pg||
nt|rnmalik: cards are very friendly for 4@H and 3NT for NS|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vinbtech: y a lucky break|pg||
nt|roswolf: the 3@H bid interfered nicely with the e/w auction|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Gerben42: dont want to lead from honors behind the big NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: and this is mps not right to push for dodgy games|pg||
nt|sybarra2: *Martin|pg||
nt|jaapfr: indeed 6@S DD and unbeatable DD|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dQ|nt|yo_yo: it's teams|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk4: What makes you think  TEAMS  is  MP?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: So it follows that Zia is pushing the boat out bidding 3@S with only three spades, but it has pushed EW to 4@H, where there should be four losers  |pg||
nt|jaapfr: not much chance to make this|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|yo_yo: very lucky for North South|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|mcarroll: Hi Shirley|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: oh u sure it bwa pairs last time i commentated yesterday|pg||
nt|lestergold: even tho it said imps are u sure Kath|pg||
nt|yo_yo: tomorrow is another day :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Mike, it's all in your e-mail|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Sometimes I wish people would read what I write|pg||
nt|lestergold: in my dotage i forget what i read two days ago u know that roland|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h8|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vinbtech: but 3N should also make w/ 4 each in red suit and 1 black suit K at least|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk4: So take notes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i like that when i get it right|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vugraphzcx: N alert 3nt and say it is 5-5 major|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it looks as if the culprit is South  ( forgetting system)|pg||
nt|vinbtech: that explains it ! not 4-4 as i hazarded but 55|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but then Zia has been pushing the boat out for years, and it does not seem to have done huim any  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: ...him any harm|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Gerben42: will just scratch home|pg||
nt|chick: just cashing out for 7 tricks|pg||
nt|yo_yo: rise with the king, hurray|pg||
nt|lestergold: at any rate i think that 2s is quite enough on the east hand tatcics at imps are not to bid dodgy games non vul|pg||
nt|mcarroll: It looks like the defence will grab 5 tricks, then declarer 2 or 3, then the defence another - and Declarer gets the rest - 1NT making|pg||
pc|h9|pc|c4|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course the bidding and the layout lucky in some ways so ten tricks made|pg||
nt|rnmalik: someone surely did:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: lol|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sorry i have no link to running scores   who has?|pg||

nt|Gerben42: been in worse slams - 6@D |pg||
nt|mmmakela: here red slams|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i think partner would be surprised that you had 2 aces|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lestergold: yes it is max for the bid but it falls between stools its not really a 3S bid unless your methods can allow you to expres these values more accurately|pg||
nt|rnmalik: if that is a system then it is strange-one might get a hand in 200 deals where responder to 2NT has 5/5 majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: anyway that alt0222 doesnt work with my keyboard|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i agree Rashed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so the 1@D opening pays dividends|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i think 9 out of 4@H plays was down 1|pg||
nt|po-s: on the result page you can translate via Google (upper right corner)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 9 out of 10|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Gerben42: 6@S has issues with the trump distribution|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: 6 spades needs guessing|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the youngsters tend to remember these things.  Are NS youngsters?|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|jaapfr: now simple 3nt+2 or so so coffee break|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vinbtech: one of them is surely NOT  he FORGOT ! lol|pg||
nt|jaapfr: will he pass???|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/y8rdsoc  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 6@H you cant bid - how would you find out about @HJ|pg||
nt|pelu: 1NT? 12-14 or 15-17?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: 2@C could be either natural or strong (Gazilli)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: iceland you have a wonderful bridge site with great photos|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: so can they locate 4-4 dias|pg||
nt|roswolf: one tip about playing against zia was that if he didnt bid you should assume a bal hand of less than 7/8 hcp!! true on this hand|pg||
pc|c7|nt|yo_yo: but no names |pg||
nt|rnmalik: it also meand that with 3 cards of a major the contract would be 4 of that major|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Will EW talk NS out of their @H game?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 1@S could even go for 500|pg||
nt|roswolf: this also applies to all very aggressive players|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lestergold: trump lead or heart lead and trump switch will leave declarer a trick short here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i like to see the participants photos|pg||
nt|rnmalik: EW can make 9 tricks as the cards are placed|pg||
nt|pelu: 15-17 I see :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: an upgraded 15-17|pg||
nt|mdgraham: big view to pass though. |pg||
nt|jaapfr: y|pg||
nt|roswolf: can be sometimes a valuable inference in the play|pg||
pc|cK|nt|xenya: yes i know|pg||
nt|pelu: in on @CQ NS has to take the 4 @S-tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: sorry private|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @C play would determine the fate of the contract after this lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Operator, please delete the  h  in Kwiecien|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|rnmalik: hi Peter, Vladinir|pg||
nt|rnmalik: vladimir-sorry|pg||

pc|d5|nt|gracelin: Hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello Patrick|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hello Roland|pg||
nt|jaapfr: indeed 3nt theoretically chance to make here but who will bid that:)??|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, when south didn't open his 11 count|pg||
nt|po-s: Hi Patrick|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Gerben42: no slam interest opposite 2@H (minimum)|pg||
nt|vinbtech: 2D= what they call Ekrens in this part 44+ H+S 5-10 i think|pg||
pc|d3|nt|yo_yo: looks like it but gib thinks differently|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|h2|nt|chick: 2@H is an artificial bid showing minimum hand?|pg||
nt|lestergold: no often a singleton trump in dummy is the contract making trick!|pg||
pc|h5|nt|yo_yo: set up @D?|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, South will open the bidding at some tables, I imagine|pg||
nt|gracelin: I will go to the other room where they are short of commentators. See you.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Bye|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mdgraham: yes, at some tables South will open, and then North might steamroller on|pg||
pc|dK|nt|yo_yo: Gudni,  can anyone tell us which photos are of the players here?|pg||
nt|pelu: decl need a lot of entries in dummy - will he top-play @Cs?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: then would make:)|pg||
nt|xenya: 16 pairs will play a complete round robin of 8-board matches. The format is IMPs converted to VPs using a 60:0 scale. This is Round 1 of 15. |pg||
pc|dT|pc|d7|pg||
nt|Gerben42: yes, if 2@C was gazilli then 2@H shows 6-7 without 6-card @S|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mmmakela: so once again N gave up too easily, could investigate well below 4H-level|pg||
pc|h4|nt|yo_yo: anyone leading @C gives up a trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: not like this tho|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the only one i recognise is David Stevenson from Liverpool|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hT|nt|mdgraham: also if South opens West will bid spades, which will help in the play|pg||
pc|h9|nt|lestergold: yes gib right if ducks a diamond!|pg||

pc|d9|nt|fann4: The stronger, only needs the J to help|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|cT|nt|xenya: that's right Peter|pg||
nt|petergill: I also like the heart lead, partly as North will often have five or so clubs on this auction as a source of tyricks, so I want to attack.|pg||
nt|fann4: The CR (Closed Room) started on board 17, so no comparisons for a little while.|pg||

mb|3S!|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|yo_yo: great  gudni  :)|pg||
nt|xenya: seems strange W didn't open 1@D -- it does look like some version of Polish Club?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vinbtech: on a D lead; has only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a nice simple sequence, WD  EW|pg||
nt|mdgraham: slight disparity of contracts....not sure what 1N is|pg||

nt|mmmakela: brb|pg||
nt|lestergold: game not an awful proposition here but doomed with both trump honours offside|pg||

nt|yo_yo: there|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: 1NT not enough for game ( as i understand it) then he jumps to game |pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h5|nt|yo_yo: seems a shame it's going down |pg||
nt|mdgraham: quasi-forcing, maybe|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: on natural methods there is an argument for an invite of 3S rather than a unilateral 4 but west ould probably decline its quite a good contract but unlucky|pg||
nt|jaapfr: anyway 3nt most likely to fail so 1nt+1 optimal imo|pg||
nt|jaapfr: funny thing of bridge S is fearing now to go down: even in 3nt|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We are in Moscow for the annual Slava Cup|pg||
nt|roswolf: but he will be happy soon|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mcarroll: Communications are not very fluid for declarer, and the defence will try not to help him, but may be forced to |pg||

pc|c2|nt|mcarroll: On board 2 in the Open NS had no difficulty bidding the @H game which was played in 1NT here generating the first significant swing|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vinbtech: y no SJ coming down in 2|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|c8|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mcarroll: the defence will have to get a @D and will then take the @HA to defeat this contract|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|nt|lestergold: 11 chunky points and an outside doubleton and also partner has opened second position at unfavourable which means his opening should be robust rather than  light|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|roswolf: and now a show up squeeze|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s6|pc|s2|nt|yo_yo: well North didnt have to cash the @C|pg||

nt|fann4: Was it necessary to 'look for' 3NT on a hand like this?|pg||

nt|petergill: Opposite KQx, Jxx, K10xx, J9x or the like, 3NT is best. |pg||
nt|fann4: Why is North to blame? His hand is pretty flat, and if pard had say @HK10x, the J would bolster the suit.|pg||
nt|petergill: I think South should have called 3@C, not 3@H, preserving space. That reaches 4@s immediately when oartner has good clubs, as you want to. |pg||

nt|po-s: somehow it seems a waste to use 1NT for 20+ hands; they are so infrequent - and you must then create unclear (two-threeway) bids for all other hands|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y is only one real Zia: S:)|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|mmmakela: ok so it resembles a "D" good to gnow! and I assume you are a she?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: *know|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If someone had to play for my life ....it would be Zia, a spectator tells me. Not a bad choice I would say :)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|yo_yo: this looks a good spot|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@C shows 15+hcp. Thanks to Thomas Bobik|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW use Precison 2@C opening|pg||
pc|h4|nt|po-s: It looks like 3H was a splinter...|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: heart contract does well if club q is found and dimaond ruff is not found!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: they have got this played by West - so it might make|pg||
nt|po-s: interesting lead - if we assume that opps do´t have 44 in a major then West must have 4+ hearts but may only have 3 spades|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|chick: could make a couple of overtricks here as the cards lie favorably|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|mcarroll: Now likely to make 12 tricks|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: unlikely tho for 4H to be misdefended here|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I think 16+ 1@C|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and with 3-3 clubs, making|pg||
pc|h8|nt|vinbtech: should E be bidding 3H here?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: precision to be correct|pg||
nt|mcarroll: only 11 available|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|po-s: so why did West think NT was best?|pg||

nt|mmmakela: only 1 ot|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Defence over|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jaapfr: it will:)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mcarroll: W should have put in the @C ten, allowing partner the option of overtaking to give a @D ruff|pg||

nt|yusufb: x igrenc hiç bi ele üzülmedim bu el yýktý beni|pg||
nt|mdgraham: very useful @H109|pg||
nt|jaapfr: only 3@H to lose not 1@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: suspect North will play @HA and a low one|pg||
nt|po-s: please!!! normally it is a small heart, and normally opponents will get in somewhere and can cash the hearts - and if East´s high cards are al elsewhere 5D will make|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hoping South has Q98x or similar|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sybarra: srslorryall have to dre. |pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|mmmakela: sryyyyyyyyy|pg||
nt|chick: depends on what finesses he takes ... got the hearts right so far|pg||
nt|yo_yo: seems a shame not to bid those @S|pg||
pc|c6|nt|dburn: maybe not, but if partner has four hearts (and three clubs) then both 3@h and 3@c might make|pg||

pc|h9|nt|petergill: Some winners might bid 3@D - it is a bidder's game, after all|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|fann4: Clear at matchpoints I think, but vul at teams?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: hadn't prebal cards in vul period.|pg||
nt|xenya: so although NS did steal a partial on very slender values here, this may well be duplicated at other tables |pg||
nt|petergill: The 2@H overcall on the 4 count was a winner, Dbl of 1NT on the 18 count would have been a winner, 3@D here - it does seem that bridge is a bidder's game |pg||

nt|dburn: and the way things have gone, 3@h will make anyway|pg||

nt|mdgraham: my word|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 4@H might depend on getting clubs right|pg||

nt|mdgraham: interesting choice for East|pg||
mb|2D|nt|yo_yo: it was quite nice for declarer when South tackled trumps|pg||
nt|vinbtech: y the result justified 3H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If you subscribe to the Principle of Restricted Choice, you will get it right|pg||
mb|d|an|3c h|nt|yo_yo: a fit jump?|pg||
nt|vinbtech: a fit jump more likely |pg||
nt|rnmalik: very good hans for 5@D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@S is reasonable, but what about 5@S? Would that be the same as a 5@S opening  bid?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sorry for confusion i referred to x@H lead as unbeatable but with @HA x@H and @S switch it was DD down|pg||
nt|jaapfr: team 1 will gain here|pg||
mb|2N|nt|chick: "precision" has so many variations that its very name is a contradiction :)|pg||

nt|fann4: On bd 22 in the CR it's NS's turn to skip the Major fit, they're in 3NT but it will be easy too.|pg||

nt|mmmakela: good play had the clubs been 4-1, although the defence shd be different then|pg||
mb|2C!|an|prec|nt|petergill: or might go for 1100 - Pass puts all the eggs in one basket, bidding 3@D opens up many baskets, some of which win and some lose|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|petergill: 2@H = who needs good suit quality when you have good shape - can run if doubled for penalty|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|fann4: Dbl presumably replacing a 2@D inquiry?|pg||

mc|10|nt|fann4: A top player kibitizing has suggested that N should dbl 3NT to tell pard not to lead a @H. any comments?|pg||
nt|petergill: Perhaps EW play that 3@C bans partrner from bidding towards 3NT, whereas Dbl then 3@C shows some interest in 3NT - that might explain East's t/o dbl. |pg||
