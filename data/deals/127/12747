nt|vugraphzdn: )|pg||
nt|flash: too quick for me, Ivan  :)|pg||
mb|1N|mb|d|mb|p|an|F|mb|p|nt|flash: Fu and Zhao still lead comfortably; quite tight for 2nd...|pg||
mb|r|mb|p|mb|2D|an|D + M|mb|p|mb|2H!|an|to M|nt|roswolf: surely they will find the spade fit|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: 2@H seems a bit mild to me|pg||
nt|flash: playing weak NTs, it's imperative to have a run-out method|pg||
nt|gracelin: but will they go to game ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed may wimp out here perhaps|pg||
nt|flash: here, Pass forced the XX to show a 2-suiter|pg||
nt|mcphee: i think Gromov has a terrific hand for this bidding|pg||
nt|mcphee: working K@D and a a sure 8 card major fit|pg||
nt|gracelin: but south didn't pass 1NT reduble and his shape could be 5-4 or even 4-4.|pg||
nt|flash: 2@H was pass or correct|pg||
nt|mcphee: might die in 2@H surely is worth more|pg||
nt|gracelin: I presume south could have a hand like  : Qxxx  xxx  Qxxx  xx|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: north will have to pubt game himself|pg||
nt|flash: yes, Patrick|pg||
nt|roswolf: a very poor decision|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: might have raised to 3@S (but then, why (as Bob pointed out) only bid 2@H)|pg||
nt|mcphee: even when 4-4 suits the N hand is worth a bounce to me|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mcphee: if he bids 3@H first time they reach 4@S easy I am sure|pg||
nt|flash: perhaps we'll leave it as E-W playing in form and N-S not having a good day/weekend|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|gracelin: what will south bid with xxxx  xxx  xxxx  xx, I am sure he cannot stand 1NT redouble, and his runaway method is 2D showing D plus M.|pg||
nt|roswolf: very nicely put|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d7|pg||
nt|mcphee: that would give W a far better hand and not likely to pass as he is vul|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|pc|h3|pc|h8|pg||
nt|gracelin: that the reason I first give Qxxx  xxx  Qxxx  xx in suth hand.  Anyone want t be in 4S Vs. that hand ? |pg||
pc|s3|nt|flash: part of the issue might be the NT range?   what was a weak (12-15?) NT here was a strong (15-17) NT at the comparison table|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mcphee: they you are in 3 only|pg||

nt|gracelin: ok, raise to 3S looks ok to me under EW's silence.  But I am explaining Gromov's pass which also looks reasonable to me.|pg||
mc|9|nt|roswolf: bye all for now|pg||
nt|flash: back in 10 minutes or so with the last set of the day|pg||
nt|mcphee: he is worried about his football bets:)|pg||

nt|ady: likely slam for n/s to start|pg||
nt|ady: only danger is they get to a grand and fail|pg||
nt|ady: maybe an old hand  |pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: hello cornelia|pg||
nt|mmmakela: not much here for either side|pg||
nt|Gerben42: still might land in 3N|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 1 nt NS best|pg||
nt|Gerben42: will you bid stayman over 1N? then they play 2@H|pg||
nt|mmmakela: no I pass gladly|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what does it mean?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and i've been trying alt0222 |pg||
nt|yo_yo: nothing happens|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no idea what Roland meant|pg||
nt|lestergold: E/W could find a thin spade game here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: To get the  Þ|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i tried it roland|pg||
nt|lestergold: have to guerss hearts to have a chance|pg||
nt|vugraphzcx: Hello and welcome |pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome to Moscow|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good morning/afternoon all|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: Hello|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello and welcome back|pg||
nt|mdgraham: two very strong pairs here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hi Jaap :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: exciting hand to start|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@S unbeatable:)?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jaapfr: re all|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk4: Get a chat line and press Alt0222|pg||
nt|vugraphzcx: My name is Gudni and I´ll be your operator to day in closed room|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi Jaap|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@S sharp but can|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|yo_yo: nothing|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|Gerben42: i think with expected 22 HCP or so, you should take your plus|pg||
nt|jaapfr: re all|pg||
nt|roswolf: slam in diamonds is makeable|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi rashed|pg||
nt|jaapfr: asks minor|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mdgraham: a somewhat attenuated 1@D opening, but has an easy rebid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: support double, by the look of it - showing three-card spade support|pg||
nt|jaapfr: true but biddable?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: absolutely no reason to bid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hi rashed  and Gudni|pg||
nt|mdgraham: playing that, a raise to 2@S would show four-card support.  |pg||
nt|roswolf: well west has to show them now|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mmmakela: good lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: has East done enough?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello from a snowy Manchester|pg||
mb|p|nt|vinbtech: helo and wc to all|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is that bidding correct gudni?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello  vinay|pg||
nt|vugraphzcx: yes there are misunderstanding at the table |pg||
nt|roswolf: welland +zia wont sit quietly|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: spade contracts played by east arent so threatened by a club lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Keep Alt down with your left hand while you type  0222 with your right hand. It's not difficult|pg||
nt|lestergold: well bullets nice suit poor and stuffingh non exiastent 2s was a free bid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i/ve tried that 15 times|pg||
nt|vinbtech: likely 3n interpreted as both majors !|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 3s would be an overbid|pg||
nt|sybarra2: welcome Martim|pg||
nt|jaapfr: difficult word Mike but got what you meant about 1@D:)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|yo_yo: i never heard of that |pg||
nt|rnmalik: cards are very friendly for 4@H and 3NT for NS|pg||
pc|c9|nt|vinbtech: y a lucky break|pg||
nt|roswolf: the 3@H bid interfered nicely with the e/w auction|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 5@C vuln safe -1 is a good result but unbiddable|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Gerben42: dont want to lead from honors behind the big NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: and this is mps not right to push for dodgy games|pg||
nt|sybarra2: *Martin|pg||
nt|jaapfr: indeed 6@S DD and unbeatable DD|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true|pg||
nt|xenya: this rates to make -- particularly after W's overcall|pg||
nt|rnmalik: by X showed 5M and 4 major, is that it|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, i meant E"s overcall|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s3|pc|c4|nt|yo_yo: it's teams|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|Walddk4: What makes you think  TEAMS  is  MP?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: So it follows that Zia is pushing the boat out bidding 3@S with only three spades, but it has pushed EW to 4@H, where there should be four losers  |pg||
nt|jaapfr: not much chance to make this|pg||
pc|h4|nt|yo_yo: very lucky for North South|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|nt|mcarroll: Hi Shirley|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh u sure it bwa pairs last time i commentated yesterday|pg||
nt|lestergold: even tho it said imps are u sure Kath|pg||
nt|yo_yo: tomorrow is another day :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Mike, it's all in your e-mail|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|rnmalik: but sequence have no knowledge|pg||
pc|d2|nt|yo_yo: http://reykjavikbridgefestival.com/index.php?m=E1&id=M_TEAMS2010&iid=IF_OPENTEAMS2010&m=D3|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Sometimes I wish people would read what I write|pg||
nt|lestergold: in my dotage i forget what i read two days ago u know that roland|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s9|nt|vinbtech: but 3N should also make w/ 4 each in red suit and 1 black suit K at least|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk4: So take notes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i like that when i get it right|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|sK|nt|paulhac:  Hi everyone|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vugraphzcx: N alert 3nt and say it is 5-5 major|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it looks as if the culprit is South  ( forgetting system)|pg||
nt|vinbtech: that explains it ! not 4-4 as i hazarded but 55|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but then Zia has been pushing the boat out for years, and it does not seem to have done huim any  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: ...him any harm|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Gerben42: will just scratch home|pg||
nt|chick: just cashing out for 7 tricks|pg||
nt|yo_yo: rise with the king, hurray|pg||
nt|lestergold: at any rate i think that 2s is quite enough on the east hand tatcics at imps are not to bid dodgy games non vul|pg||
nt|mcarroll: It looks like the defence will grab 5 tricks, then declarer 2 or 3, then the defence another - and Declarer gets the rest - 1NT making|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|xenya: thoughtful play, @D from hand|pg||
nt|xenya: Welcome to Paul Hackett|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi|pg||
nt|xenya: but the @SK was not so good |pg||
nt|jaapfr: now @HJ|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: of course the bidding and the layout lucky in some ways so ten tricks made|pg||
nt|rnmalik: someone surely did:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: lol|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sorry i have no link to running scores   who has?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nor me, sorry|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|pc|h6|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone and welcome to Moscow|pg||

pc|dK|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|jaapfr: realistic finesse|pg||
nt|xenya: still he will manage to survive?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: he was sure E to have1 @H max 2 min 0:)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|yo_yo: it's really annoying when partner forgets the system  |pg||
nt|jaapfr: yes he will make it|pg||
nt|paulhac:  if he ruffs with the Q@S and plays the 10@S back?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: even then makes it|pg||
nt|paulhac:  True|pg||
nt|rnmalik: wins the T in hand and small @S to J|pg||
nt|jaapfr: even hen:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: then|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: http://www.slavacup.ru/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ok but DD easier than SD:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Pitches the T @H on Q@D that is if E ruffs with Q@S and plays T@S|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if @C away as specs suggest does not help defense|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: welland made a claim|pg||
nt|jaapfr: he is brite|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: TD called|pg||
nt|jaapfr: claim is correct|pg||
nt|xenya: maybe just a little bit premature|pg||
mc|10|nt|yo_yo: of course when I forget, there's a good reason :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You can click on Round Number (1) for results for each board in Round 1 - website design by Anton Osipov. |pg||
nt|mdgraham: only chance was that @CJ dropped. Unlucky  |pg||
nt|jaapfr: if he sees this miniature correct why he can not claim?|pg||

mb|3D!|mb|d|nt|mcphee: no way N pass this|pg||
nt|roswolf: pass from north surely not|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: better|pg||
nt|flash: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdn: sorry )|pg||
nt|mcphee: oh my this could see a 4@S bid|pg||
nt|gracelin: I ight just jump to 6H with the north hand.|pg||
nt|gracelin: might|pg||
mb|3S|nt|roswolf: indeed and a 5@H bid from north|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: no problem, Ivan - helps keep us on our toes|pg||
nt|roswolf: south clearly knows his customer|pg||
nt|mcphee: you are just saying that Patrick:) you would never bid 6@H|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|mcphee: 5@H is no laydown|pg||
nt|gracelin: Trust me, I am talking seriously.  I see no scientific way after 3D to bid a confident 6H or a cnfident stop in game.|pg||
nt|mcphee: too much risk to 6@H|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcphee: uh oh|pg||
nt|roswolf: south thinks spades are agreed|pg||
nt|gracelin: but there are also the fat bonus.|pg||
nt|roswolf: clearly n/s are on tilt|pg||
pc|d7|nt|flash: a delicate sequence by North, but CHO (that's the one between left-hand opponent and right-hand opponent) wasn't on the same wave length|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mcphee: well this 2 way @D bid worked out very well|pg||
pc|dA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|c2|nt|gracelin: in the comparing room, north has a chance to open a strong two, then after south negative and repeated spade bid, north did have some confidence to stop in 4H.|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s were lemmings|pg||
nt|mcphee: he bought a terrible dummy|pg||
nt|roswolf: you could say this was 50% on the club finesse with 2-2 trumps + + +|pg||
nt|gracelin: no trump shift will see this slam home.|pg||
nt|gracelin: but  am sure either E or W will shift to trump after taking this trick.|pg||
nt|mcphee: i would be will to lay 50-1 they shift ot a trump:)|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|pc|cT|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|mcphee: i would have gone higher:)|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|pc|dQ|pc|h8|pg||
mc|10|nt|flash: E-W, for the most part, playing quite well (and, sadly, the same can't be said for N-S)|pg||
nt|mcphee: massive loss|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup might be 60 -0|pg||
nt|mcphee: must give big credit to e/w that hand|pg||
nt|flash: almost half of the jump on our scoreboard was E-W at the comparison table reaching 6@C|pg||
pg||

nt|Gerben42: been in worse slams - 6@D |pg||
nt|mmmakela: here red slams|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i think partner would be surprised that you had 2 aces|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: yes it is max for the bid but it falls between stools its not really a 3S bid unless your methods can allow you to expres these values more accurately|pg||
nt|rnmalik: if that is a system then it is strange-one might get a hand in 200 deals where responder to 2NT has 5/5 majors|pg||
nt|xenya: oh he can of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: anyway that alt0222 doesnt work with my keyboard|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i agree Rashed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so the 1@D opening pays dividends|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i think 9 out of 4@H plays was down 1|pg||
nt|po-s: on the result page you can translate via Google (upper right corner)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 9 out of 10|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: 6@S has issues with the trump distribution|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|mmmakela: 6 spades needs guessing|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the youngsters tend to remember these things.  Are NS youngsters?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|jaapfr: now simple 3nt+2 or so so coffee break|pg||
mb|p|nt|vinbtech: one of them is surely NOT  he FORGOT ! lol|pg||
nt|jaapfr: will he pass???|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/y8rdsoc  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 6@H you cant bid - how would you find out about @HJ|pg||
nt|pelu: 1NT? 12-14 or 15-17?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: 2@C could be either natural or strong (Gazilli)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: iceland you have a wonderful bridge site with great photos|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mmmakela: so can they locate 4-4 dias|pg||
nt|roswolf: one tip about playing against zia was that if he didnt bid you should assume a bal hand of less than 7/8 hcp!! true on this hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: but no names |pg||
nt|rnmalik: it also meand that with 3 cards of a major the contract would be 4 of that major|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Will EW talk NS out of their @H game?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 1@S could even go for 500|pg||
nt|roswolf: this also applies to all very aggressive players|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lestergold: trump lead or heart lead and trump switch will leave declarer a trick short here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i like to see the participants photos|pg||
nt|rnmalik: EW can make 9 tricks as the cards are placed|pg||
nt|pelu: 15-17 I see :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: an upgraded 15-17|pg||
nt|mdgraham: big view to pass though. |pg||
nt|jaapfr: y|pg||
nt|roswolf: can be sometimes a valuable inference in the play|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: yes i know|pg||
nt|pelu: in on @CQ NS has to take the 4 @S-tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: sorry private|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @C play would determine the fate of the contract after this lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Operator, please delete the  h  in Kwiecien|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|rnmalik: hi Peter, Vladinir|pg||
nt|rnmalik: vladimir-sorry|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I suppose a pair of loonies might, but NS are definitely not that|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lestergold: now 6 top losers|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: Hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello Patrick|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hello Roland|pg||
nt|jaapfr: indeed 3nt theoretically chance to make here but who will bid that:)??|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, when south didn't open his 11 count|pg||
nt|po-s: Hi Patrick|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Gerben42: no slam interest opposite 2@H (minimum)|pg||
nt|vinbtech: 2D= what they call Ekrens in this part 44+ H+S 5-10 i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: looks like it but gib thinks differently|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chick: 2@H is an artificial bid showing minimum hand?|pg||
nt|lestergold: no often a singleton trump in dummy is the contract making trick!|pg||
pc|d5|nt|yo_yo: set up @D?|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, South will open the bidding at some tables, I imagine|pg||
nt|gracelin: I will go to the other room where they are short of commentators. See you.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Bye|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|jaapfr: not surprisingly ns do end in 4@H with no ot|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, at some tables South will open, and then North might steamroller on|pg||
nt|jaapfr: +1 can if @CA @C @C|pg||
nt|xenya: stopping in 4@H was a tiny problem perhaps -- the rest should be easy|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Difficult to see this going off as he has not got entries to misguess hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|jaapfr: lol|pg||
pc|cA|nt|yo_yo: Gudni,  can anyone tell us which photos are of the players here?|pg||
nt|pelu: decl need a lot of entries in dummy - will he top-play @Cs?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: then would make:)|pg||
nt|xenya: 16 pairs will play a complete round robin of 8-board matches. The format is IMPs converted to VPs using a 60:0 scale. This is Round 1 of 15. |pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|nt|Gerben42: yes, if 2@C was gazilli then 2@H shows 6-7 without 6-card @S|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so once again N gave up too easily, could investigate well below 4H-level|pg||
pc|c3|nt|yo_yo: anyone leading @C gives up a trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: not like this tho|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the only one i recognise is David Stevenson from Liverpool|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|pc|cT|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ok +1 auto now|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mdgraham: also if South opens West will bid spades, which will help in the play|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: yes gib right if ducks a diamond!|pg||

nt|xenya: seems strange W didn't open 1@D -- it does look like some version of Polish Club?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vinbtech: on a D lead; has only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a nice simple sequence, WD  EW|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzcx: E/W are playing prec|pg||

nt|lestergold: game not an awful proposition here but doomed with both trump honours offside|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i feel uneasy with East's bidding thee|pg||
nt|yo_yo: there|pg||
pc|h4|nt|yo_yo: 1NT not enough for game ( as i understand it) then he jumps to game |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|nt|jaapfr: 2@S-5 no one had a X chance:)|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|s2|nt|paulhac:  Though we can see this is an easy make declarer will be worried in case both spades and the Q@H are badly placed|pg||
nt|xenya: spectators in the other room had a rare chance to see a psychic transfer |pg||
nt|jaapfr: lovely 2@H bid but could end as disaster|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|nt|yo_yo: seems a shame it's going down |pg||
nt|mdgraham: quasi-forcing, maybe|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|lestergold: on natural methods there is an argument for an invite of 3S rather than a unilateral 4 but west ould probably decline its quite a good contract but unlucky|pg||
nt|jaapfr: anyway 3nt most likely to fail so 1nt+1 optimal imo|pg||
nt|jaapfr: funny thing of bridge S is fearing now to go down: even in 3nt|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk4: We are in Moscow for the annual Slava Cup|pg||
nt|roswolf: but he will be happy soon|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mcarroll: Communications are not very fluid for declarer, and the defence will try not to help him, but may be forced to |pg||
nt|mcarroll: S should probably have ducked, even though it was only postponing the problem. what to lead now?|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c7|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk4: http://www.slavacup.ru/  for the tournament website|pg||

mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|gracelin: I thk this force north to Cue|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|flash: the 2@C call was artificial, so 3@S sets trumps and asks for q-bids|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@C WAS A KEY BID|pg||
nt|roswolf: north has shown his controls|pg||
nt|flash: now we see some Italian-style cue-bidding...   1st and 2nd round controls; lowest available first|pg||
nt|roswolf: south may make a try for a grand|pg||
nt|gracelin: against 6S by North, HA lead will give away the slam while DA might beat it. Any non-DA lead may also allow the slam be made.|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes that is why trappy|pg||
nt|flash: yes, Geoff - whether it's the King or a singleton, that will suggest a great source of tricks to South|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|flash: another cue-bid - looking for another @H cue to show 1st round control|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would have signed off in 6@S by now but south still interested|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|flash: although they seem to be using slightly different methods (since North doesn't have the @DA either)|pg||
nt|roswolf: as 5NT shows|pg||
nt|gracelin: still waiting for north to cue 6H|pg||
nt|gracelin: tme for north to sgn off in 6S, he has shown every bit of his hand.|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: north doesnt have an ace therefore has only 1 bid imo|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed patrick|pg||
nt|flash: with trumps 2-2, this will come home|pg||
nt|gracelin: DA lead to shorten south trump maybe the only lead to beat this slam|pg||
nt|flash: and, unless East cashes the @HA, there's an overtrick available|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h6|pc|h5|pg||
nt|gracelin: after HA, even DA won't work, since that give declarer 2 D tricks for a total of 12.|pg||
nt|gracelin: but who can complain East cashing one of his two Aces.|pg||
nt|drewsky: Now a low diamond might give declarer losing options ?|pg||

nt|jaapfr: anyway the 2@S bid is a clear warning which was not there in OR|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Ace less may pass|pg||
nt|xenya: not really Jaap -- there are 16 pairs in competition and the format is IMPs converted to VPs on a datum basis|pg||
nt|jaapfr: aha if trump a @C with @SQ all is well|pg||
nt|paulhac:  I agree with the kitbitzers that you can make 6@S  but not so obvious to do so on a trump lead|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|mmmakela: 5 dias can be made if accident but can go down too|pg||
nt|pelu: he played 4x1H first - and disc a @D|pg||

nt|po-s: it used to show 18, and 1M was bid with wk NT and 3+card suit|pg||
nt|jaapfr: also for them i am sure|pg||
nt|po-s: but these guys don´t play regular Polish|pg||
nt|po-s: not his style at all|pg||
nt|jaapfr: nv-v i would bid 2@H too|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mdgraham: told 1NT is a one-round force, called the Dymanic NT  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: sorry, Dynamic|pg||
pc|c4|nt|paulhac:  In the other room West bid spades|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|pelu: a lot of spec ask me a lot of Q - please update your profil with names !!!!!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|rnmalik: same here and same answer|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I think at pairs 3NT was a better contract as played in OR|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@S puppet to 2NT|pg||
nt|jaapfr: dynamite 1nt?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|dburn: if we need to play in spades, partner can bid them|pg||
nt|xenya: well they sniffed at slam here|pg||
pc|sT|nt|yo_yo: i think 90% would bid 1@S   |pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: defnce have done well to hold it|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, all will be forgiven if East makes this|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|h7|pc|s4|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and 8 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: and this is imps, not mps|pg||
pc|sK|nt|po-s: If it needs that much from partner to make game, perhaps it isn´t the recommended action generally|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h5|nt|chick: N needed to cover the @DJ, now making is almost sure thing|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jaapfr: i think it was meant defensively 2@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: his rabbit's foot working overtime oerhaps?|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and turned out that pd had the goodies|pg||
nt|po-s: We can see that but how is partner to know?|pg||
nt|roswolf: he cant - but ls lady luck was with him|pg||
nt|xenya: let me tell you a little secret: NS decided not to attend the opening banquet last night|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sybarra: are ok or lacking one entry  (8 tricks yes)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|yo_yo: a good board that for NS|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d6|pc|hT|nt|po-s: not playing to make it seems|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as Jaap said, North did well not to double for a diamond lead - the trump lead has left East a bit short of tricks  |pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a kib told me:)|pg||

nt|gracelin: when north didn't bid over 1S he is probably not short there. So maybe South should let 1S play.|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|3D!|an|pre|mb|d|mb|p|nt|gracelin: 2S seems ok for NS here.|pg||

mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|roswolf: actually south has a tough-ish choice here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|flash: the 4@D call suggests 2 places to play?|pg||
nt|gracelin: 4D is better than a direct 4 bid since it showed two places to play, in case north doesn't have 4-card spade fit.|pg||
nt|roswolf: he showed the black suits|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||

nt|roswolf: hi:)|pg||
nt|flash: about the only point of (vague) interest here is the 3@D call...|pg||
nt|mcphee: hi Patrick and Jim|pg||
nt|flash: while some play it as a Law of Total Tricks undisciplined pre-empt|pg||
nt|flash: (if that's not a contradiction in terms)|pg||
nt|gracelin: the 3D bid did cause some trouble for NS but the delicate cue of 4D solved everthing.|pg||
nt|flash: it's best used to show a pre-emptive raise, but able to stand 3NT if partner was going to rebid 2NT|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|pc|c2|nt|gracelin: a weaker version of 3D means no 3NT even if partner has 18-19 balanced.|pg||

pc|s5|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||

mb|d|nt|roswolf: very solid result in the other room for n/s maybe i can raise the flag again|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: The scores on the board make little sense, and here is why ...|pg||
nt|pelu: aggresiv 1@S by Hachett in East|pg||
mb|3S|nt|vinbtech: 1C= precision or some some such ART club|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzcx: hehe you can say Gudni|pg||
nt|mcarroll: N managed to buy the contract on previous board in 1@S so a likely 5 imp swing|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The results of rounds in IMPs will be converted to VPs using a 60:0 scale. In calculating the datum score (= average score) on each board, about 50% (but not more) of the scores (a ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: quarter from the top and a quarter from the bottom) will not be taken into account|pg||

mb|p|nt|yo_yo: that's quite a hunky 2@C overcall|pg||
nt|yo_yo: chunky|pg||
nt|dburn: well, at least they avoided the 3-3 diamond fit, but...|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3nt+2 most likely|pg||

nt|jaapfr: 4@S has a vey good chance to be made here|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jaapfr: previous board the problem was that W was before 5@H not aware of the 4514 at least not the @D misfit imo|pg||

pc|c4|nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/y8rdsoc  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|rnmalik: system:)|pg||
nt|po-s: somehow it seems a waste to use 1NT for 20+ hands; they are so infrequent - and you must then create unclear (two-threeway) bids for all other hands|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y is only one real Zia: S:)|pg||
pc|c5|pg||

nt|mdgraham: EW use Precison 2@C opening|pg||
pc|dA|nt|po-s: It looks like 3H was a splinter...|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lestergold: heart contract does well if club q is found and dimaond ruff is not found!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: they have got this played by West - so it might make|pg||
nt|po-s: interesting lead - if we assume that opps do´t have 44 in a major then West must have 4+ hearts but may only have 3 spades|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|chick: could make a couple of overtricks here as the cards lie favorably|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|nt|mcarroll: Now likely to make 12 tricks|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: unlikely tho for 4H to be misdefended here|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I think 16+ 1@C|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and with 3-3 clubs, making|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vinbtech: should E be bidding 3H here?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: precision to be correct|pg||

nt|mmmakela: only 1 ot|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Defence over|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jaapfr: it will:)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mcarroll: W should have put in the @C ten, allowing partner the option of overtaking to give a @D ruff|pg||

nt|yusufb: x igrenc hiç bi ele üzülmedim bu el yýktý beni|pg||
nt|mdgraham: very useful @H109|pg||
nt|jaapfr: only 3@H to lose not 1@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: suspect North will play @HA and a low one|pg||
nt|po-s: please!!! normally it is a small heart, and normally opponents will get in somewhere and can cash the hearts - and if East´s high cards are al elsewhere 5D will make|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hoping South has Q98x or similar|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sybarra: srslorryall have to dre. |pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|mmmakela: sryyyyyyyyy|pg||
nt|chick: depends on what finesses he takes ... got the hearts right so far|pg||
nt|yo_yo: seems a shame not to bid those @S|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|dburn: maybe not, but if partner has four hearts (and three clubs) then both 3@h and 3@c might make|pg||
nt|paulhac:  3@S looks a bit of an underbid but maybe it was because of the vulnerability|pg||

mb|1C|nt|roswolf: where would you like to play this e/w?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|mcphee: likely will land in 3N|pg||
nt|gracelin: 6C seems makeable on cross ruff, trouble is how to get there.|pg||
nt|flash: as Ivan reminded us,  running scores at  http://www.slavacup.ru/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@C looks probable|pg||
mb|2H|nt|flash: this is the flip side of the pre-emptive minor-suit jump raise we saw last hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well the inv minor raise is a good start|pg||
nt|gracelin: a 3D splinter here might do the work, but West chose a slow pace.|pg||
nt|flash: 2@C shows a limit raise (or more) and denies a 4-card major|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: 2nt asking for shape?|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: the usual treatment over the inverted raise is to bid stoppers up the line|pg||
nt|mcphee: this pinpoints the @D lead|pg||
pc|d2|nt|flash: some would rebid 2NT with the West hand and be able to check back for a @D stopper if needed|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|mcphee: different styles to inverted minors , I really like the criss cross method|pg||
nt|gracelin: my guess is 2-3 pairs (out of 8) in this strong field might reach 6C |pg||
pc|d9|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|c4|nt|flash: the @S slam was scored up in the other room...   Ace and a @H wasn't enough to get a plus|pg||

pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|h2|pc|c7|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|gracelin: you can get 4 side tricks plus 8 in trumps.  Both N and S have to follow suit in the ruffing of the red suit cards.|pg||
nt|flash: playing @Cs this way protects the @D holding|pg||
nt|mcphee: and now 3N is no claim|pg||
nt|flash: even had North played a low @C, i'd expect East to have taken the finesse|pg||
nt|flash: where there are 8, there are 9?|pg||
nt|mcphee: where there are 8 there are also 7:)|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, that's reasonable. now I guess H2 is a signal to welcome H.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mcphee: i know this 7 thing to be a fact, I have proven it over the years|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||

pc|dT|pc|dJ|nt|gracelin: declarer's D7 mabe his 9th trick|pg||

nt|dburn: and the way things have gone, 3@h will make anyway|pg||
nt|dburn: so I guess he should have bid it|pg||
nt|jaapfr: or opps max 3@H and 1@C so unbeatable it was even DD|pg||
nt|mdgraham: my word|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: will watch more closely now I promise, was on the phone|pg||
nt|chick: partscores best possible here :)|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|Walddk4: 4@H might depend on getting clubs right|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3@D makes as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: in precision that used to be a club opening in the old days|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i bet east will go to game|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if @HA x@H x@S then it could down?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: interesting choice for East|pg||
mb|2C|nt|yo_yo: it was quite nice for declarer when South tackled trumps|pg||
nt|vinbtech: y the result justified 3H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If you subscribe to the Principle of Restricted Choice, you will get it right|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: a fit jump?|pg||
nt|vinbtech: a fit jump more likely |pg||
nt|rnmalik: very good hans for 5@D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@S is reasonable, but what about 5@S? Would that be the same as a 5@S opening  bid?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sorry for confusion i referred to x@H lead as unbeatable but with @HA x@H and @S switch it was DD down|pg||
nt|jaapfr: team 1 will gain here|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|chick: "precision" has so many variations that its very name is a contradiction :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Tony Forrester did in the other room with no opponent bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_restricted_choice_(bridge)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's even more evident here where Kwiecien has shown a two-suiter by opening 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: http://www.slavacup.ru/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR the @D-lead gave Forrester a help to "see" 2 x singleton by West - with singleton @H (and no bid) u would not play the @Cs right|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 6@S pls|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: oops|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y 6@C has a chance specs but will not be bid:) imo|pg||
nt|xenya: on the surface, 6@C looks tempting|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3@D chance they go higher than in OR|pg||
nt|xenya: but is likely to fail|pg||
nt|paulhac:  6 @C Needs a lot of work|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|rnmalik: hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: There's no Four-and-a-half spades card in the bidding box |pg||

nt|yo_yo: ruff and finesse @D?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: *6th dia|pg||
nt|jaapfr: all other leads 6@C probably down|pg||

mb|4S!|nt|pelu: here he know @S+@D by West|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N!|mb|p|mb|5D!|nt|yo_yo: it takes a lot of courage to pull partner's double with the South hand|pg||
mb|d|nt|jaapfr: but is the non cross ruff an attractive alternative (i doubt that)|pg||
mb|5H!|mb|p|mb|5S!|nt|po-s: so if South is in after 4 spades - no he isn´t|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: ok forget all I wrote|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c5|nt|paulhac:  He still has a losing option cash two spades ruff a heart and ruff a diamond with the A@C|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|jaapfr: safe trumping with @CA|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|c9|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cQ|nt|flash: system/style comes into play here, but if i'm going to treat the East hand as worth a game force/drive, i'm going to bid my suits in natural order (2@C over 1@D)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|c5|pg||
nt|gracelin: now a passive defense might beat this.|pg||
nt|mcphee: there are a lot of players today who show the 4 card major first|pg||
nt|mcphee: not something I like either Jim|pg||
nt|gracelin: I am one of these with a modest hand.|pg||
nt|flash: sad, but true, Bob...   i have to check my bidding style out of the Smithsonian Museum for each session...|pg||
nt|roswolf: diamond looks safe |pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|nt|gracelin: when I respond 2C first and bid 3M over a 2NT rebid, I invite partner to bid 4C with 3-card club support.|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|pc|cT|pc|c9|pg||
nt|roswolf: well played|pg||
nt|mcphee: i invite them to raise with 3 when I bid 2@C Patrick:)|pg||
nt|flash: still some work to do|pg||
nt|gracelin: I want my partner to bid 2NT with a minimum balanced hand, especialy with some 4333 pattern.|pg||
nt|mcphee: in fairness i usually have 5 cards|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed but i think he is thinking on the right lines|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h2|nt|flash: needs to be a red suit here...   (the spots will allow an overtake in @Ds later)|pg||
pc|h5|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|mcphee: down now|pg||
nt|gracelin: running H8 maybe working but playing clubs to be 3-3 is also reasonable.|pg||
nt|mcphee: i think looking for 3-3 @C is a bit much to hope fore given the Q@C lead|pg||
nt|gracelin: a low H now ?|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|pc|hK|pc|h9|pg||
nt|roswolf: it is easy for us seeing all the cards but i think playing forv clubs 3-3 is anti%|pg||
nt|mcphee: who leads a @C from AQJ|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|gracelin: in this bidding sequence leading CQ from a QJx holding is quite reasnable.|pg||
mc|8|nt|mcphee: that is sensible Patrick yes|pg||

nt|vugraphzdp: live results|pg||
nt|po-s: hard to beat that result from closed|pg||
nt|rnmalik: when I made that observation of -1, he had ruffed a @D with 10@C|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mdgraham: yes, 9 imps on board 1 when NS sacrificed in 5@Dx|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes north bid his weaker suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: that kind of 3-way 2@C  opening isn't allowed in many countries because itdoesn't include an anchor suit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks Vladimir|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|mcarroll: The Open room started 3 boards behind us and has now caught up and is even ahead. They play this hand in 2@S|pg||

nt|lestergold: bye for now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: oh dear, take some aspirin Mike|pg||
nt|vugraphzcx: yes as far as I know|pg||
mb|3C|nt|rnmalik: now it is clear after @H and @S bids and instead of DBL N could bid 4NT with that hand|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Only a 5 imp swing I miscounted the undertricks in the Open|pg||
nt|jaapfr: my quess team 2 to win this with 1 imp:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: bye and quick recovery |pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5 matches of 8 boards today, 6 tomorrow and 4 on Monday. I believe the upcoming Monday is a public holiday in Russia. Maybe Vladimir can confirm|pg||
nt|xenya: actually the holiday is on 23rd, but Monday is a non- working day too|pg||
nt|xenya: we will be back shortly -- 20or 30 minutes i guess|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Non-working non-holiday, I like those :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: big loss here|pg||
nt|po-s: 2D was a clever bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: this 3nt is wrong sided|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but still leads @D|pg||
nt|xenya: previous hand should produce a great score for NS|pg||
nt|jaapfr: tx all and for sure Ivan is really the greatest (family of Alexander:)?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: 3nt-3|pg||
nt|po-s: but apparently conventional|pg||
nt|jaapfr: DD and SD:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: some taps coming up|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 5@C obviously best, but how can you get there?|pg||

nt|jaapfr: whole day 0 mistakes as operator|pg||
pc|dT|nt|petergill: Fu Zhong - Jack Zhao (China) and Kholomeev - Khiuppenen (Russia) lead the Slava Cup after 44-16 wins in Round 1, ref http://www.slavacup.ru/results/slava10/slava10t16r1.htm|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The results of rounds in IMPs will be converted to VPs using a 60:0 scale. In calculating the datum score (= average score) on each board, about 50% (but not more) of the scores (a ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: quarter from the top and a quarter from the bottom) will not be taken into account|pg||
nt|pelu: and 44-16 = win by 14 IMPs = a gameswing! - hard scale|pg||
nt|mdgraham: operators are a bit like cricket umpires - if they do a good job, you don't notice them |pg||
nt|jaapfr: i get -4   -3   -2 and makes replies from kibs my screen is ""blue""|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if @DA @CA @CQ then -2|pg||
