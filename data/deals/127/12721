nt|joemanjo: Hi all|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mmmakela: rehi Staffan|pg||
nt|mmmakela: sry meant 7|pg||

nt|vugraphzbf: na drugiej stronie zas³ony naturalny blok..|pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: ale ju¿ ustalili jak graj¹ :)|pg||
nt|chick: should easily find 3N here|pg||
nt|kaapo: Swedes love strong or 2-way club|pg||
nt|col3435: some well-fitting cards here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: bridge is one of the few sports where playing home is not that great an advantage|pg||
nt|suketbombi: HI all|pg||
nt|suketbombi: n-s play Demicoma a strong club 16+ convention and 12-15 NT|pg||
nt|hlortz: looks like NS have an easy game in @S or NT for that matter|pg||
nt|hlortz: hi Mike|pg||
mb|2H|nt|chick: Hi again, Staffan :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Commentators Cornelia Yoder and Bob McPhee|pg||

nt|joemanjo: sry 4@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: Hejssan :)|pg||
nt|joemanjo: Hi Vladimir|pg||
nt|lestergold: starting with a likely 4S contract not looking problematic at all|pg||
nt|hlortz: & Roland , Paul|pg||
mb|p|nt|suketbombi: while e-w play a std convention|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: N has a rotten rdbl hand|pg||
nt|kaapo: Hejssan alla|pg||
nt|joemanjo: This looks like a West Bengal vs Delhi match. NS and EW respectively.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|varange: welcome to the Swedish Premier League.|pg||
nt|joemanjo: Hi all|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kaapo: 1NT is about 17-19 here I suppose|pg||
nt|col3435: at least declarer has something to think about on this lead|pg||
nt|varange: NS played pretty slowly during the previous session|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks like they're headed for an easy 4@S|pg||
nt|joemanjo: EW qualified to represent India once at China, four years back.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|joemanjo: EW play stong club|pg||
nt|joemanjo: strong|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|kaapo: Straightforward bidding|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Hello, Markku. Good evening to all|pg||
nt|kaapo: Did 3NT show clubs or @S shortness or something else?|pg||
nt|joemanjo: NS okay Standard methods|pg||
pc|d2|nt|varange: which meant that the OR caught up|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1NT = clubs or GF relay?|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: apologies, alerts in the wrong place.|pg||
nt|lestergold: A duck of this club- a continuation will lead to an overtrick|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sfoxa:  Hello, Kari.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mmmakela: 3433 and 9 with no intermeds|pg||
nt|mcphee: 3nt a nice spot|pg||
nt|xenya: good stop but still an awkward contract|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes shd be a flat bd which is a good news for Khandelwals|pg||
nt|othered1: Possible without @C system for north to be declarer, but on this hand it doesn't matter|pg||
nt|joemanjo: +120 in 1N|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: tricks missed due to late start....catching up with the score|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|kaapo: Hi Cornelia, Markku and Staffan|pg||
nt|chick: hard to pass with 2 aces though|pg||
nt|chick: and a lively first round of bidding dies quite suddenly|pg||
nt|rnc: For Running Scores, time schedule etc during the tournament: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.877|pg||
nt|kaapo: Hi|pg||
nt|mmmakela: only guess who might have all 3 trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: short @S and not min|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|chick: now that E sees that he set up the spades, he has to start grabbing tricks before losers can be pitched|pg||
nt|kaapo: Clubs will easily bring enough tricks for EW and luckily South hasn't got too high a heart in order to get a chance to play twice through West|pg||
nt|chick: with no entries, N must try to get to partner's hand again for another @H through|pg||
nt|col3435: if East is showing his shape this could turn out well|pg||
nt|kaapo: Ten tricks on top and 2 diamond ruffs bring it to twelve. 4-0 clubs shouldn't do much harm|pg||
nt|vugraphj77: za chwilke porzybiegnie nasz komentator Rysiu Kielczewski|pg||
pc|c6|nt|joemanjo: Both sides play Standard with variations|pg||
pc|c7|nt|burypies: tajemnicza 8@d|pg||
nt|kaapo: Hopefully 4@H was alerted too :)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|kaapo: Or are they playing with screens?|pg||
nt|lestergold: Edwin a highly respected senior founded and was co owner of my club for some twenty years|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mmmakela: needs C A right here for starters,now might even make this akward contract|pg||
nt|vugraphj77: ktorego witam serdecznie|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kaapo: North might have some slam ambitions, if there are no wasted @S values|pg||
nt|rnc: For Running Scores, time schedule etc during the tournament: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.877|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: north has shown 1-4 in majors with 5+@D here|pg||
nt|kaapo: Tack, Staffan|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: missed play...c\will claim at the end|pg||
nt|joemanjo: All cards are favourable, lack of entries in West hand is the immediate issue. |pg||
pc|d3|nt|mcphee: all over now|pg||
nt|varange: Ralf Willquist will be able to fill us in on most of the play as he knows the players|pg||
nt|varange: and our operator at the venue, Steffan, will keep us updated|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a big mistake to reach 6@s here. -2 if they can find the @c ruff on NS|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|burypies: Weijknis wiedzia³ ze 2! to dwukolorówka?|pg||
nt|burypies: 2@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: tak wyjanione przed wistem|pg||
nt|burypies: je¿eli tak powinien zagraæ D@d|pg||
nt|burypies: wiedzia³ ¿e  rozgrywaj¹cy ma singla @d|pg||
nt|kaapo: I believe NS play 2-way club. North would open 1@C with 11-13 balanced, so he has kind of maximum|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I surely would because now 1 @S was forcing in my book and he passed!|pg||
nt|kaapo: I tried commentating in Swedish too, but my typing was a bit too slow in that language. I might do better now that PO is playing, though ;)|pg||
nt|varange: should be bid - ask Roland :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: I doubt even Roland would approve of this one :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: no screens, no alert since swedish rules say no alerting above 3nt|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kaapo: Ok, then no alerts beyond 3NT|pg||
nt|col3435: opps had probably got the idea by that point anyway :)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|kaapo: A kib suggests that 4@H was RKC in clubs|pg||
nt|suketbombi: will end up making 5@S|pg||
pc|d4|nt|varange: what systems do they play Ralf?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Staffan!|pg||
nt|joemanjo: North may be AshiM Mukherjee - if so he is a player in the Indian Railways B team.|pg||
nt|lestergold: Eginton has been a major figure in bridge and bridge administration for many years was recently chai of England selectors.|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: poprawi³a siê rednia urody w stosunku do poprzedniego meczu|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|vugraphj77: ale tempo oslablo|pg||
pc|hA|nt|col3435: mm. So presumably 3@h showed 4414 exactly|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|nt|xenya: should make with a careful play though, and he is on the right track|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: oj to napewno i to baaardzo|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|h3|nt|col3435: easy with spades breaking - but how would you play if South had five?|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|ralfwil: strong @c from both pairs  - Staffan?|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ralfwil: EW does and I thing NS too|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yes, strong club, 17+, from both as far as i can see|pg||
nt|kaapo: The web site for the tournament is here http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.877|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think Edwin is endplayed here |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kaapo: You'll find running scores there too|pg||
nt|xenya: now another trump and @C hook |pg||
nt|xenya: but this line fails -- |pg||
nt|xenya: not clear why he decided to shorten himself in trumps, losing control|pg||
nt|joemanjo: a club ruff and favourable trump break seals the contract for East|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rnc: For Running Scores, time schedule etc during the tournament: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.877|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h7|pg||
nt|varange: NT is 14-16?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: guess does not matter as Ashim has only 2 @HS|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kaapo: It's very normal in Sweden to play 3rd and 5th leads, even against notrumps. Nyström - Wrang seem not to do it, though|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: I would say most swedes play 3rd-5th vs suit and 4th vs NT|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kaapo: And you can see that it's quite close in the top|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good afternoon all|pg||
mc|7|nt|mmmakela: u right Kari 1c includes 10-12 nt so I take back my words|pg||
nt|hlortz: e was endplayed in 3 suits - unusual that|pg||
nt|lestergold: had to give overtrick onme way or the other west could have played a diamond i think that prevents the endplay|pg||

nt|vugraphzpx: i would say they are pretty good, noone knows how good he is in a speedy :) I can ask him though... :)|pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: if south has 5 spades, the best way must be to play the 8 of clubs and let it go round to north|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: or even a small one|pg||
nt|col3435: yes that's nice|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes and the favoriates are trailing makes it more interesting|pg||
nt|joemanjo: EW partnership is quite a long standing one in Indian Bridge. East, Mr Ashok Goel is the CEO of Dhampur Sugar Mills and sponsor for their team.|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: scores updated|pg||
nt|joemanjo: hi all|pg||
nt|suketbombi: hi manoj|pg||
nt|joemanjo: good start by the trailing team chalking up 10 of the deficit in the first board.|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: heart back only delays it i think|pg||
nt|vugraphj77: witram wszystkich serdecznie. Przepraszam za opoznienie, ale sprawy techniczne. Mysle ze juz powinno byc dobrze|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: nice 4@H contract here|pg||
nt|kaapo: Rehi Cornelia|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello, Cornelia|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1NT looks interesting|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 1 nt seems needing swings|pg||
nt|kaapo: What does that show, then? :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  if E decided to open 1nt, good ending could be 3nt |pg||
nt|kaapo: 10-13, might be off-shap?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  guess @d right - "only"|pg||
nt|joemanjo: What wd u open as North?|pg||
nt|joemanjo: Hi Raju|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: yes, 26 imps can be found in 14 boards without doing much more than playing good bridge and getting a little lucky to have active hands.|pg||
nt|lestergold: part score battle N/S can make a lucky 3S e/w 3 of a minor|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kaapo: Well, no need to interfere with his play :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
nt|kaapo: North may get to open here, unless West finds 1@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C|pg||
nt|joemanjo: :)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: witam pogr¹¿onych w depresji, czy Elbl¹g siê w niej znajduje?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: need to reach 5@D |pg||
nt|chick: is he known as a particularly slow player?  :)|pg||
nt|xenya: the 3@D preempt in the other room was overdoing it|pg||
nt|joemanjo: u can follow this tourney at the following website|pg||
nt|joemanjo: http://indianbridgepages.appspot.com/ Yashwant_Rao_Holkar/2010/Results.el|pg||
nt|joemanjo: 4@S may be reached here too. |pg||
nt|vugraphj77: nie narzekamy|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: and Howard trumps the unassuming cue bid with one of his own!|pg||
nt|vugraphj77: chociaz team ZSRR wybral przeciwnikow z jtorymi jako jedynymi przegrali mecz|pg||
mb|d|nt|varange: hi Frank|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: I suppose Johan and PO at least play 2-way club|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: chick, sundelin is known as one of the slowest swedish players ever... :)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes subhash took a not so unreasonable line rather than Relying on 50% @H Q in|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mmmakela: N won't sell|pg||
nt|mdgraham: curious no 1@s overcall by North|pg||
nt|vugraphj77: mam nadzieje ze teraz juz wszystko ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: 2-way club, where 1@C shows either a strong hand or a weak notrump range, is often referred to as Swedish club|pg||
nt|joemanjo: 2@C and 2N take up valuable space to show a black two suiter.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: N-s have a good @S partial|pg||
nt|joemanjo: ah that 3@s made it simple|pg||
nt|joemanjo: Had East not opened, NS may have wandered into a 4@s game.|pg||
nt|joemanjo: now they may settle in @s partial|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well 4C undoubled is actually a good result for one off for E/W|pg||
mb|d|nt|mmmakela: 14-16 Nt maybe?|pg||
nt|chick: certainly doesn't look like a hand that I would upgrade|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 13-17NT from start, 2@D showed 13-15 without 4c major|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: PO thinks his partners minor is @C:)|pg||
nt|chick: good thing I don't have a lot to do today then :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I am told NS play VERY sound overcalls - and it surely seems so|pg||
nt|joemanjo: wow|pg||
nt|joemanjo: good lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4C x is par something that is not often achieved at the table|pg||
mb|r|nt|kaapo: I guess 1NT = 14-16|pg||
nt|kaapo: Some might bid some number of diamonds as West|pg||
nt|kaapo: Even if East doesn't lead a club, he'll get another chance|pg||
nt|kaapo: Unless he ducks a spade|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: this board is wrong duplicated. Not much, but the ace of heart is located at east, not at south|pg||
nt|kaapo: Makes a little more sense then|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  single?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: south stole the 9 of D from east|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: so east holds 3253 with A7 in hearts|pg||
nt|kaapo: Mikael and Cilla are in the minority for Swedish experts: they don't play strong/2-way club|pg||
nt|kaapo: Their system of choice is short club with transfers|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ogl¹da³em wyniki teamu o swojsko brzmia cej nazwie ZSRR - do 7 meczu oddawali tylko 1 impa, czy idzie im w dalszym ci¹gu adekwatnie do nazwy?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|frankaus: @D lead would have proved troublesome|pg||
nt|xenya: well if he decided to treat has hand as balanced, it makes sense|pg||
nt|vugraphj77: slyszalam ze biuro polityczne kazalo zwolnic wszystkich trenerwo|pg||
nt|vugraphj77: bo slabo na olimpiadzie|pg||
mb|d|nt|suketbombi: yes but any ruff By E will only promote a trunmp for def|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: whether it is balanced is doubtful though|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chick: almost any lead gives away a trick|pg||
nt|joemanjo: EW Bidding will certainly help the declarer in bringing off the 4@S|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kaapo: Well, unless the other room plays the board similarly distorted, this has to be canceled|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so S has 10982 in dias?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: it´s the same at all other tables.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yes, south holds 10982 in @d|pg||
nt|suketbombi: a @C lead or shift wud restrict to 3 or else 4 makable|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jkmjanusz: Witam!|pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: witamy nowych komentatorów |pg||
nt|abunio: witamy z Gdanska :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: ns play 2-way club Staffan? Carrot?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 2@C asking for majors, 2@D relay with lots of different hands, 2@H/2@S/2NT/3@C/3@D invitational|pg||
nt|chick: and N puts him to the test immediately, before he can get any other info|pg||
nt|kaapo: Of couse he does have @DQ and might get a trick with it|pg||
nt|chick: but N still has to find the @DQ|pg||
nt|mcphee: sure, nice bold play before anyones knows what is up|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@C makes but it's not great. It takes more than the heart finesse|pg||
pc|c4|nt|othered1: That's a *really* positional style|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|cK|nt|varange: choices choices|pg||
nt|xenya: all S's honours work and he knows it|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kaapo: @H8 looked discouraging|pg||
nt|chick: club switch still isn't clear though|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sfoxa:  so, we'll be unable to follow the play right - just enter result? |pg||
nt|kaapo: This seems to happen rarely but occasionally with the duplicating machines|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: we can follow the play as long as they wont play hearts... :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: In Beijing we had a normal bidding sequence and I ended up at 3NT|pg||
nt|mmmakela: we can until certain point but did S really pitch a dia|pg||
nt|kaapo: When I examined the dummy, I noticed our side had two diamond queens!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yes, south did pitch the 2 of @d|pg||
nt|mmmakela: very strange|pg||
nt|frankaus: still makes with 3@H 3@C 2@S + 1@D|pg||
nt|col3435: I guess you finish drawing trumps and try to cash some clubs, but when that doesn't work, what do you do?|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|kaapo: It may get dangerous now, if he finesses trumps|pg||
nt|kaapo: Some also play Smith echo in the suit declarer first attacks (if count isn't relevant). If that's the case, @D2 might suggest finding another suit, too|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Must ruff one spade low and one high|pg||
nt|xenya: i think it's basically on a @H finesse -- barring something really bad in trumps or @Hs|pg||
nt|suketbombi: needs to losse 2 @HS and a ID|pg||

pc|c6|nt|kaapo: Hmm, he attacked @S first :)|pg||

pc|c8|nt|kaapo: On the other hand he seems to be home now if trumps are 3-2|pg||
nt|chick: one more round of trump, then set up clubs?|pg||
nt|col3435: of course you can get away with anything as the cards lie|pg||

nt|chick: which never works for me, but it seems to for everyone else :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all - |pg||
nt|varange: a clear violation of Burns' Law, Ralf?|pg||
nt|col3435: South must bid again here, but what?|pg||

nt|col3435: was difficult to do more though|pg||
nt|joemanjo: dbl worked |pg||
nt|xenya: agree -- double stands out|pg||

nt|Walddk2: What does West have more than he already showed with 2@S?|pg||
nt|joemanjo: caused EW to panic|pg||

nt|col3435: I guess you can just see what develops|pg||

nt|mdgraham: a key moment in any slam auction is when you agree a trump suit |pg||

nt|mmmakela: @S K and then|pg||
nt|kaapo: They didn't, and neither did the open room|pg||
nt|frankaus: well not real garbagge and not short in @C so i would not  use it here|pg||
nt|varange: yep|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes! 1nt is good enough|pg||
nt|varange: Burns' Law: As declarer, one should strive to have more trumps than one's opponents|pg||
nt|varange: in some ways easier if playing the big 2NT, SAYC style|pg||
nt|xenya: if E is weak, he can take remove to 3@S -- the position is quite clear adter W's initial pass |pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|nt|burypies: ale Witek im namiesza³ |pg||
nt|kaapo: 3@D might be 17-19 NT with 4 spades - but just guessing|pg||

pc|dA|pc|h7|pg||
nt|chick: not sure I would have led a trump on that auction|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kaapo: Without the double, North would bid 1@D to show 0-7. Difficult to tell what 1@S shows here|pg||
nt|suketbombi: got there :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well done - it looked as though that was touch-and-go for a moment|pg||

pc|c8|pc|c6|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Yuval Yener|pg||
nt|kaapo: Loser on loser play on the next spade?|pg||
nt|yuval10: hi all|pg||
nt|kaapo: Hi Yuval|pg||
nt|col3435: yeah, why not @sJ and run it if West follows low|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|chick: W might Q-ask |pg||
nt|kaapo: In case I was about right about the early bids, 3@H could be a re-tranafer and 3NT some kind of slam try follows by two cue bids|pg||
nt|kaapo: Fredin - Lindkvist had an even more straightforward sequence to 7@H|pg||
nt|col3435: but here west shows out, and if he allows the @h7 to score it's all over|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: west has the option of discarding 2 diamonds on the 3rd and 4th round of spade, denying the 6of H to score|pg||
nt|col3435: yep you're right|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ryskiel_: moimi prywatnymi faworytami s¹ licytacje sprzedajace te same walory po kilkakroæ|pg||
nt|kaapo: And 4@H could then be a "last train" kind of bid - still interested in slam but without a heart control|pg||
nt|kaapo: Apparently not much :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: So pitching a club here looks a reasonable plan|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed|pg||
nt|col3435: hmm, there's too much to do though isn't there?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 3@S showed a delayed support hence doubleton Honor and 4@H was quebid|pg||
nt|suketbombi: i assume|pg||
pc|d7|nt|burypies: ale Walerowicz 2 razy t¹ sam¹ kartê licytowa³|pg||
nt|mmmakela: E must consider the fact that in OR the most probable contract is 4 @S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North seemed to know what was going on, which is what counts.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well not easy to rel;ease AC against the strong balanced hand shown by west and equally well not obvious to bang the K@D on the table either|pg||
pc|h2|nt|col3435: or, just not enough tricks|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like 6 more tricks|pg||

pc|h2|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 4@H showed a good raise to 4@S|pg||
nt|kaapo: Perhaps West could bid a minor suit to suggest a maximum with hearts?|pg||
nt|kaapo: 8 teams remain in the top division so there's lot to play for even for Örebridgen. They're currently 6th, 4.5 VPs ahead of the 8th positioned team|pg||
nt|kaapo: You'll find running scores via http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.877|pg||
pc|h3|nt|suketbombi: lead is not bad here and subhash has 2 entries to short Trump the dummy  but can get 2 Hearts and @D if correctly played|pg||

pc|c3|nt|varange: how would one know when one bids too many slams?|pg||
nt|joemanjo: That lead is good. Now 10 wll be difficult.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the other room, West doubled 2@S and his poor partner is now in 2NT, mercifully undoubled|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: wow u have the %s at the tip of your fingers Roland|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: miskey - play out of turn - claiming at the end|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, I know when to bid my 12.89% slams|pg||
nt|suketbombi: he has not much options unless he thinks @HS are 4-4|pg||
nt|suketbombi: he has to try the @S finnesse first to know his target of @D tricks|pg||
nt|suketbombi: ?|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|chick: no one did, this hand is a nightmare in any contract|pg||
nt|col3435: (and 5VPs ahead of 9th)|pg||
nt|lestergold: It was ugly but he is  justc about minimum for that bid to be permitted it doesn promise a goodm hand just a courtesy repsponse upwards with support for the unbid suits|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphzbf: bo tylko siê Wacek denerwuje :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: well clubs are 3-2 and the A right|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kaapo: I'm not very fond of West's 2@S but perhaps that was another small deception: he was trying to convince NS they should go to 4@H|pg||
nt|othered1: Probably depends on what north things their lead style would imply here.    To my eyes, 7 is an interesting card|pg||
nt|joemanjo: thgt spade wd come back|pg||

pc|s7|pc|s9|pc|s8|pg||
nt|kaapo: He could squeeze East if nothing else works (double dummy) :)|pg||

pc|d2|nt|jkmjanusz: Ma trzy dojcia do sto³u - 11 lew powinno byc|pg||

nt|othered1: doubling does let partner infer on other hands that you have absolutley nothing or a trap pass :)|pg||

nt|yuval10: W is worried about 6 @s's from N, perhaps?|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c5|nt|frankaus: hard to fault the action but a red game was missed here|pg||

nt|mmmakela: now tough for S|pg||

nt|kaapo: If NS are good guessers, they could make 4@S|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: dbl or 2@C graham ?|pg||

nt|kaapo: Diamond split is very cruel, in case they end up at some number of dimonds|pg||
nt|kaapo: What is the 1NT range here, Staffan?|pg||
nt|frankaus: 2@H will make so no real harm|pg||
nt|varange: the one is as good as the other?|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: not necessarily a pause... remember the operator cannot enter bids until both people on one side of the screen have bid|pg||

nt|mdgraham: but double shows the three-suiter and is possibly more flexible, and would therefore score 10/10 in a bidding competition|pg||
nt|mdgraham: board 5 - game missed at othert table as well|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 2nt knowing there is a minor fit|pg||
nt|suketbombi: y e-w play Demicoma 1nt denies 4 card major unless 4-3-3-3|pg||
nt|suketbombi: it is about a 50% game after pd gived you full 14|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kaapo: 14-16?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: not sure, 14-16 or 15-17|pg||
nt|suketbombi: only interest left is to know who is that +1 which Subhash will call up and tell me:)|pg||

nt|mmmakela: if Lebens this promises values(3@C)|pg||
nt|mcphee: they blew n/s out of 3N|pg||
nt|mmmakela: still wd EW|pg||
nt|varange: you'd open the south hand 1@s Frank?|pg||
nt|varange: or 1NT?|pg||
nt|frankaus: many here include 5M332 in their NT range - klinger has  a great influence here a he recomends it|pg||
nt|xenya: but this is very double dummy|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @C is only 5-card - d is best|pg||
nt|hawe45:  D|pg||
nt|othered1: "Knowing" may be a bit strong, if south could have 4=3=3=3 with 4-card major|pg||
nt|suketbombi: ok but they got 4 for there 200|pg||
nt|joemanjo: 9 IMPs gift to trailing team|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|chick: that's one advantage of not bidding clubs, don't give away the bad distribution|pg||
nt|kaapo: Of course would be more cruel still, if South had them|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: they play lebensohl|pg||
nt|chick: if it promises clubs, that's ok with N|pg||
nt|mcphee: :)|pg||
nt|chick: but with a nice heart fit, it is trouble, double or not|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|arvid: If east had the jack of diamonds 6@D would have been a very good slam|pg||
nt|kaapo: Wrang saw short clubs with partner and opts for the 4-3 @S game|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: We had a lost connection at the other table which means board  15 isnt scored properly. The result in the open room was 6@S made, which should give another 14imps for Team Zang|pg||
nt|chick: he must win the @SA, so can ruff two clubs with the small trumps|pg||
nt|mmmakela: making 13|pg||
nt|yuval10: either way EW can make 10 tricks in @h because of the 87 doubleton @d so -1 in 4@s isn't so bad|pg||
nt|joemanjo: yes, missed the qj of clubs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but with these suit discrepancies I would bid 2@C - always a good overcall of 1@D|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes that is rare N is known to take chances|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: jaka walka w parterze, po poprzednim meczu mozna powiedzieæ wieje nud¹|pg||

nt|frankaus: will be nervous about the @D situation|pg||
nt|varange: the 8@h is a big card|pg||
nt|joemanjo: lol|pg||
nt|hlortz: singleton @S lead will beat 4@H looks like|pg||
nt|lestergold: This can be beaten|pg||
nt|lestergold: it actually should be|pg||
nt|lestergold: a bit unlucky of course as its a very good contract|pg||
pc|h4|nt|varange: AQxxx isn't that flash anyway|pg||
nt|frankaus: yes  then i play garbage 2@C and puppet 3@C for all game going hands|pg||
nt|varange: ok|pg||
nt|varange: nice treatment|pg||
nt|col3435: can East just continue hearts here?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yes he can|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: well he has only 3 carder @S and a very weak 4 card @H suit|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: easy on a @D lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East will do very well to lead a spade here|pg||
nt|suketbombi: everyone is happy here|pg||
nt|hlortz: if n later leads Q@C and w ducks S will need to rise Ace to give the ruff.|pg||
nt|lestergold: good point|pg||
nt|hlortz: tho prehaps just clearing 3 rounds of trump will leave declarer a @D loser|pg||
nt|lestergold: but south should be able to count west's hand for a stiff club|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mmmakela: well S never thinks with his 10-12.....|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: there are no screens |pg||
nt|mmmakela: against 2-way club most treat it as supposing the weak variation and W didn't bid after 1 @C so has clubs now if thinking one could assume|pg||
nt|mmmakela: even that was meant priv sry|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but, on the bidding, he may well do so - no, he has gone passive|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that's good - being happy is better than being miserable|pg||
nt|joemanjo: now @d|pg||
pc|h8|pg||

nt|varange: ah OK|pg||
nt|frankaus: sunday is not epicurian - quice + frankfurt|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and my money is on him to pull off this contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: play out of turn...will claim at the end.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Play out of turn? We have heard that before. They can't keep doing that, surely|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: what a pity... great hand for timing in declarer play|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You lost the play?|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: yes...dummy played before his own turn|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: play 2 @C and then the 2nd @H|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but east can take the @Ha and clear @H|pg||
nt|suketbombi: a @S ruff in Dummy will promote def trumps|pg||
pc|d4|nt|joemanjo: Did Satya expect only 4 trumps with Kamal?|pg||

nt|othered1: What was that play?|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: miskeyed....claim at the end.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: cards lie well, should make|pg||
nt|mdgraham: assumoing South plays low from dummy, there will be a Resticted Choice position on the next round of trumps |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Principle of Restricted Choice= 10 imps in the Out column |pg||
nt|suketbombi: we are stuck here?|pg||

nt|kaapo: At least we have scores for 15 and 16 :)|pg||
nt|chick: looks like we have lost some scores from the movie, but I'll bet our superb operators will get that fixed when they have the time|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Staffan must insert results on 17 and 18 manually in MOVIE|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: already done roland, you must be faster than that :)|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: Speedy Gonzales|pg||
nt|mcphee: trick 2|pg||
nt|kaapo: More double fits|pg||
nt|kaapo: More interesting boards|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and then declarer is a tempo short.. he plays either of the pointed suits and defence can set up a second trick there|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South must have lost his way there|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes|pg||
nt|othered1: Texam Aces now need less than one imp/board to take the lead.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 4@S here even 3nt is fine|pg||
nt|othered1: actually need exactly 1 imp/bd|pg||
nt|joemanjo: brb, get some lunch|pg||
nt|suketbombi: satya cud have salvaged a pric by play @H and another @HK needs to be unblocked|pg||
nt|suketbombi: tric|pg||
nt|suketbombi: trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: good news for eggeres is that it would have helped|pg||
nt|lestergold: not helped|pg||
nt|lestergold: i meant|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|mmmakela: 7 dias dbld par here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: so -1 on previous bd|pg||
nt|joemanjo: 5IMPs per board is the asking rate|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mmmakela: N very close to 17+ here|pg||
nt|kaapo: Ever played Speedy Gonzales at some Swedish junior camp, Staffan?|pg||
nt|kaapo: Where will this end?|pg||
nt|joemanjo: I wonder where this will end. 3N or 5C? |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: multi 2@D|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 6@Hs on a @S guess played by Subhash if trumps 3-2 can try for @C Q 3 times before commiting to the @S guess not a bad slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: 3NT seems an interesting choice - I was thinking about 2NT or 4NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, they won't get any here I fancy - this looks the flattest 4@S imaginable |pg||
nt|suketbombi: ashok is likely to pass this|pg||
nt|suketbombi: satya has no where to go and subhash must be not unhappy|pg||
nt|hlortz: some sort of mexican 2@D? 18-19 balancec?|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: i thought Edwin's original bidding was a bit conservative on a 9 count with 3 kings|pg||
mb|1N|nt|chick: E was about to bid spades, so now will he try his diamonds, or will he hide in the bushes and ambush a spade contract?|pg||
nt|chick: 2N obviously for the minors, not what N wanted to hear|pg||
nt|chick: and S violates rule  1 of preempts .... don't bid again unless forced.   But with 6-6, I can see the temptation|pg||
nt|kaapo: In the end, PO went one down and lost 12 IMPs|pg||
nt|varange: and made 10 tricks|pg||
nt|kaapo: Opening 4@S looks right|pg||
nt|col3435: agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: 3NT perhaps|pg||
nt|mcphee: too hi in everything I thinnk:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: good thing about this hand is they are not going to get dbled in 3N|pg||
nt|col3435: quick 4@s here then|pg||
nt|varange: that 4NT+2 got them 11 imps; 7@d-1 at the other table|pg||
nt|joemanjo: East has an easy defense if he starts off with @h honour|pg||
nt|othered1: @C lead can hold 3N to 4|pg||

mb|p|nt|joemanjo: 2 down without breathing hard and more if declarer discards wrong.|pg||

nt|suketbombi: tuff options for N here 3nt works fine here but|pg||
nt|suketbombi: crucial bd can be 13 imps here or there|pg||
nt|suketbombi: pick a slam happy to be in 6@H|pg||
nt|joemanjo: a heavy balancing postiion 1N in the other room by East when 1@S was passed around|pg||
nt|joemanjo: That put paid to all game ambitions there|pg||
pc|d4|nt|burypies: 1@s by³by w stylu Darlesu:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: zasuwaj¹ tak, ¿ebym nie nad¹¿y³...|pg||
nt|kaapo: I might open 4NT if that shows both minors too|pg||
nt|chick: 2@C probably a precision-like bid showing 5-6 clubs and a 4 card major|pg||
nt|varange: one of our specs is having confit du canard - hmmmm, yummy|pg||
nt|ralfwil: perhaps best lead. declarer has to do all the work himself|pg||
nt|varange: yep|pg||
nt|varange: nice and neutral|pg||
nt|mdgraham: You have to bid 3@H, really.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mmmakela: Lebensohl is a very good gimmick that can be used in many various situations|pg||
nt|mmmakela: really like this?|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2 down on a @C ruff|pg||
nt|frankaus: 5@D X will be a poor compensation for NS|pg||
nt|col3435: ah, the danger of bidding grands|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yes, the players at the other table knew about the 6-2 in @d and bid 7. Bridge isnt fair... :)|pg||
nt|varange: dontcha hate it when underbids get the imps?|pg||
nt|hlortz: ah multi|pg||
nt|hlortz: nah..|pg||
nt|hlortz: ok 18-20 bal or 4by1|pg||
pc|d5|nt|chick: It's a nearly perfect fit NS, and neither one knows about the other's singleton|pg||
nt|varange: too true Staffan|pg||
nt|suketbombi: may get a @S lead and atrick wud be returned in @D|pg||
nt|lestergold: a perfectly normal contract but the 5/1 diamond break means declarer has to look for a ninth trick elsewhere|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|mcphee: nice stab for n/s, just no tricks|pg||
nt|mcphee: maybe he can work some end play|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and how W has to attack trumps immediately|pg||
nt|suketbombi:  showed 4 Hearts and up to 10 hcp|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes the vital imp|pg||
nt|othered1: We're going through some relays and responses, it seems.|pg||

nt|suketbombi: will try for @C q three times and then close his eyes and Guess @ss|pg||
nt|suketbombi: if only Ashim had made that cold 4@S the match wud have been closer good lead satya will be welcomed by T|pg||
nt|suketbombi: @ST from Subhash|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugraphzbf: i kart nie pokazuj¹, które zagrywaj¹, chyba siê obra¿ê :)|pg||

nt|chick: it looks like a good hand, but still have to trust partner|pg||
nt|arvid: good lead|pg||
nt|mcphee: should try @D|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N is hopeless of course|pg||
nt|suketbombi: oh ace asking:)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|chick: then switch to a spade and start tapping declarer|pg||
nt|arvid: now this will be 4 or 5 down|pg||

nt|suketbombi: yes 4@C donno but looks like aces |pg||
nt|suketbombi: must be the only way to allow 7|pg||
pc|cT|pc|h9|nt|vugraphzcv: because east has SA as an entry anyway|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c9|pg||
nt|mmmakela: after S's 4 H N just can't dbl imho, must bid 5/6 H|pg||
pc|c4|nt|vugraphzpx: last time Ida Grönkvist picked me out for a speedy knowing i was the fastest one around... and we sure won at 67% too :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: The idea in a Speedy Gonzales bridge competition is that there's only a ridiculously short time per board to play|pg||
nt|arvid: sorry only 3, but much more difficult for east-west if south is declarer|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|ralfwil: Couldn´t N see that he should be endplayed and won @d9 with @dA?|pg||
nt|kaapo: 5 IMPs for Skalman on board 17: 4@S without a double in the open|pg||

nt|vugraphzck: miskeyed-claiming at the end|pg||
pc|sT|nt|chick: that's a very good clue, by the way.... when a defender cashes the trump A and then switches, it's often a singleton, so you can figure you have a bad split|pg||

nt|chick: I'll bet it means, the info is here :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: Sylvan keeps getting a lot of diamonds|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I would bid 6|pg||
nt|frankaus: Aces and singleton a re great combination|pg||
nt|varange: 4@sE in the OR|pg||
nt|varange: and another interesting layout ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: players taking a break|pg||
nt|suketbombi: could be that vital imp to texan aces here|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes 2 smokers there|pg||
nt|othered1: another easy game, likely making 4 since there's no clear reason to guess trumps correctly|pg||
nt|othered1: And no reason to overbid, unless somehow @D are thought to provide tricks|pg||
nt|suketbombi: auction will be 1@H- 2@H  and W will settle for 4|pg||
nt|suketbombi: even if E gets agressive with a Nt will get a 2@D response and will bid 3@H but sighn off after the que bid from W|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: awaiting S at the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: resuming play|pg||
nt|suketbombi: no dhampur ahead |pg||

nt|kaapo: 1@D is about 11-16 with 4+@D and suggests an unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|mcphee: 19 @S nice card for S hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: shall i ask him cornelia? :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: Surprising no pre-empt from N|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so, @c and some strenght against @s and distribution |pg||
nt|suketbombi: the old trusted 3nt best here for N-S|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 6@D a great and a superior slam here|pg||
nt|lestergold: N/S could bud an optimistic 3N here 24 combined with 5 card  susts around and good intermediates|pg||
mb|3H|nt|chick: 3 good spades|pg||
nt|kaapo: East has an interesting opening bid choice|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes he decided to underbid this|pg||
mb|p|nt|col3435: on bd6, if East continued hearts, declarer would probably play another club with West showing out. Then west would be marked with all the cards in spades and diamonds, and it seems ...|pg||
nt|col3435: declarer could throw him in|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North has plenty to raise to 2@S|pg||

nt|chick: asking partner to bid 3@C|pg||
nt|kaapo: Or perhaps a transfer to clubs|pg||
nt|mcphee: 10@S I mean|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  EW reached their limit, what about NS?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: Jm has not finished:(|pg||
nt|othered1: but west has done more and east has a maximum, so|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: would you show majs or treat S hand as 1-suiter|pg||
nt|xenya: strange pass by S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: You can understand why South bids 3@D, even though imho it is an overbid |pg||
nt|suketbombi: ashim will stick? any way 4nt makes too|pg||
nt|suketbombi: will attack with @Ds knowing Thak|pg||
nt|joemanjo: everyone had something to say so far|pg||
nt|lestergold: unfortunately 9 tricks shouldnt be available on reasonable defence|pg||
mb|p|nt|varange: can you explain Ralf?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, push-em-up|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ...onward and possibly upward.... |pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes K bendre is Kaustub Bendre and in Kibz bendre is his father|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: and direct 3 @C promising pos values|pg||
nt|chick: "transfer" implies that you have the suit.   in this case, it's more like a "relay" to clubs, with many possible hands|pg||
nt|kaapo: East had a very maximal hand and support for whatever suit West has and tries for game|pg||
nt|mmmakela: tries?|pg||
nt|kaapo: True, Cornelia, but many play real transfers in this position|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: East though seems unaware of that his partner has made a lebensohl bid |pg||
nt|kaapo: Your using keyboard input, Staffan?|pg||
nt|kaapo: *You're|pg||
nt|frankaus: nil vul is not so good to preempt|pg||
nt|kaapo: I didn't expect 2NT if EW play strong club, but I guess it's still an option|pg||
nt|mmmakela: grandmaproof 3 nt|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and West takes the bait|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  juicy 200?|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: S thinking hard|pg||
nt|suketbombi: in good time|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but seriously, East only bid 2@H |pg||
nt|suketbombi: safe to release ot this wud be 10 or even 1 tricks|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 11|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: N-E discussing|pg||
nt|suketbombi: e checking weather 3nt implied any @H support  N says Search Me:)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|abunio: sorry, private|pg||
nt|burypies: w jakim kierunku zmierzaja?|pg||
nt|chick: majors|pg||
nt|kaapo: @S lead will bring the 8th trick|pg||
nt|kaapo: And if there are 8 there are 9, as the saying goes :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, it's teams, so not that important - as long as South is not tempted to bid 3@S|pg||
nt|joemanjo: Asihm's dbl with singlesuited hand in the first round put him in a spot later|pg||
pc|d8|nt|jkmjanusz: A ³adsna? Warto dzwoniæ?|pg||
nt|chick: in competitive bidding, I think need to give as many options to partner as you can|pg||
nt|kaapo: 800 may have been very expensive, because EW's 4@S didn't seem easy at all|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1@C strong - 1@D weak|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yes, but looking at the wrong hand as well... :)|pg||
nt|varange: says he, belatedly :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  S could expect partner with relatively long @c and @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: oh ok|pg||
pc|d6|nt|abunio: nie, do mojej mamy:)|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: O, sorry...|pg||
nt|chick: if pard is not intereted, then can bid hearts|pg||
nt|frankaus: another friendly layout 4@D 2@C 1@H 2@S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no! |pg||
nt|col3435: very much so :)|pg||
nt|col3435: nice though|pg||
nt|varange: yes|pg||
nt|xenya: double showed @Hs -- it would seem natural to bid your @S at that point|pg||
nt|othered1: Maybe the overcall will help west get trumps right|pg||
nt|othered1: for the requisite 1 imp per board|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|chick: ok, but that's not lebensohl (for the benefit of kibs)|pg||
nt|kaapo: Yes, good to make the distinction clear|pg||
nt|mmmakela: not true Kaapo, most play leb here|pg||
nt|mcphee: this game may go down|pg||
nt|kaapo: As you see, D and S are adjacent on the keyboard. Easy to make "typos" if using keyboard input when operating :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yeah, and all 13 cards are next to eachother so it´s easy to have a "clickos" for that :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: @C lead bad for the N hand|pg||
nt|kaapo: Well, you've been doing marvellously well :)|pg||
nt|varange: :) dang|pg||
nt|ralfwil: perhaps some kind of transfer|pg||
nt|varange: it seems that way|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: no alert on 1NT at least so I dont think they play it as transfer|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes and a singleton @D lead may confirm the trump position for OT|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mmmakela: N likes the lead but...|pg||
nt|col3435: good prediction - spade lead didn't look clear to me|pg||
mc|11|nt|chick: as long as EW cash their minor winners, this cannot make|pg||
nt|kaapo: Some might use Lebensohl here. If it's in use, then South's 3@D shows some values; he'd bid 2NT with a very weak hand|pg||
nt|varange: wow|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: east: spade lead is awkward for defence if west putsu p SJ =- declarer has 9 tricks then|pg||
nt|lestergold: well they have in the open auction started the same way but finished with south's 1N|pg||
nt|lestergold: here Howard felt he had enough for a try and that was always going to be accepted withSouth's good 9 count|pg||
nt|hlortz: n took a rosy view to raise, all his honors in his long suits looked bullish|pg||

nt|mmmakela: wet pass from S|pg||

pc|h3|nt|kaapo: 2@C either balanced or clubs, and 17+|pg||
nt|kaapo: Hmm... 2@D might show extras|pg||
nt|kaapo: At least that was how I played it|pg||
nt|kaapo: I guess he could try something|pg||
nt|kaapo: And 1@C could be 2 cards, either natural unbalanced, or balanced|pg||
nt|col3435: I'd rather West bid 3@d the first time|pg||
nt|suketbombi: from Dalas Aces to Texan Aces:)|pg||

pc|h6|pg||
nt|mmmakela: ok sound contract, 5 can be in jeopardy|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kaapo: I see, tack Staffan|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2NT apparently shows a balanced hand, and now 4@C looks like a control bid with @H support|pg||
nt|suketbombi: he has a chance tho but unlikely since if he concedes @Cs will loose 3 @Hs a @c and a@S|pg||
nt|lml: and good evening to you|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: good evening there|pg||
pc|h8|nt|varange: here's the knr hand evaluator for the East hand|pg||
nt|varange: http://www.jeffgoldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=AQ9xx+Kxx+AKx+Kx|pg||
nt|varange: 19.85 HCP|pg||
nt|othered1: East can get @D ruff, if they're really careful|pg||
nt|suketbombi: oh?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: followed by @SJ and dec has some work will eventualy make this|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kaapo: I'd bid 3, also|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|varange: yes, provided the X promised spades|pg||
nt|varange: how many will declarer be off?|pg||
nt|varange: 3?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kaapo: Yes, lots of working finesses too|pg||
nt|kaapo: If @Hs are 4-1, you might still make 6NT while 6@H fails|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mdgraham: he has to get the ruff with a low trump|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so South has to lead @SQ (no entry to dummy) and West has to duck it - very difficult |pg||
nt|suketbombi: @SJ has to be ducked by JM|pg||
nt|othered1: But possible, as play of interion @S would be very tricky from AQJ|pg||
nt|othered1: interior|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: S thinking.....|pg||
nt|suketbombi: :) you need to know your customer|pg||
nt|lml: I think North has to just bid game as he did here.  South can't possible realize that what he has is useful|pg||
nt|lml: North has a huge hand really|pg||
nt|lml: of course the spades are friendly which is going to make this pretty easy|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|mmmakela: perfect for action dbl/2 NT choose the minor|pg||

mb|2H|nt|kaapo: Many would open the South hand nowadays. Surprising to see a strong clubber pass it|pg||
nt|frankaus: not many would pass|pg||
nt|col3435: I thought it was because he didn't feel the hand was good enough with a misfit, but evidently it was more because he wanted the penalty|pg||
nt|vasanti: does 4 hcp warrant a bid?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|kaapo: 1@C was either balanced or natural|pg||
nt|othered1: @D split makes 4@S a potential problem|pg||
nt|mdgraham: could this be 6@S in one room and 2@S in the other.....|pg||
mb|d|nt|kaapo: 2@D looks like natural, nonforcing call|pg||
nt|kaapo: And 3@H likely a fit jump|pg||
nt|ralfwil: nice score in OR!|pg||
nt|varange: hmm|pg||
nt|vasanti: in desperation yes they are at the moment not|pg||
mb|3C|nt|xenya: no, but later you might have to guess whether partner has a 3-card support for @Ss|pg||
nt|othered1: That's still 10 imps|pg||
nt|suketbombi: :)|pg||
nt|lml: tried to cash three clubs... Eric Kokish has practice lessons on hands like these|pg||
mb|3D|nt|xenya: sorry private|pg||
nt|suketbombi: and both N_s think they had a bad result|pg||
mb|3S|an|maciwoda konwencja|nt|mmmakela: this contract has some flaws.....|pg||
nt|mmmakela: phone brb sry|pg||
nt|yuval10: 5@s from N , 5NT from S |pg||
nt|kaapo: 7@H could be in danger|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 3nt by satya is a good contaract whille 4@S by him will fetch a @H lead from kamal|pg||
nt|suketbombi: other semis Maya Mira Sneha were up 30 imps 12 bds to go dont have the running scores|pg||
nt|joemanjo: N and E sharing screen. |pg||
nt|vugraphzck: N dealt before E|pg||
mb|d|nt|burypies: ale lubi pokombinowaæ|pg||
nt|abunio: bezpieczny jest 13-14, juz pisalem|pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: piki trzyma rewelacyjnie :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you don't have to take much care drawing trumps when you have thirteen of them |pg||
nt|joemanjo: So bid by North can be taken back|pg||
mb|3N|nt|burypies: sorry myla³am ¿e  ta karta nie jest trudna do licytacji|pg||

nt|latwy: ciekawe ¿e walerek w najd³u¿sze nie chodzi|pg||
nt|abunio: w sumie niewielka odchylka|pg||
nt|kaapo: North does not get wildly interested|pg||
nt|kaapo: This appears to have about 6 losers|pg||
nt|mmmakela: pd opened in fav zone 10 points....|pg||
nt|kaapo: Wow, a natural system played in Swedish premmier league!|pg||
nt|yuval10: pass, if forcing, is very good by S|pg||
nt|joemanjo: Screens on I assume|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: they seem to have stopped at a makeable spot|pg||
nt|varange: i'm just trying to figure out how it made!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: easy -1 here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: or -2|pg||
nt|varange: small club led|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: easy down 2 i would say|pg||
nt|col3435: I'd have just bid 4@h I think, can slam be that good?|pg||
nt|col3435: don't see how North can bid it|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  :-)|pg||
nt|othered1: I'd guess that in CR the NS *Know* they have a bad result . . .|pg||
nt|mdgraham: superficially, yes :) but one result is worse than the other, depending on your point of view  |pg||
mb|4D|nt|sfoxa:  what is the probability of finding all 13 cards?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|col3435: well, like that, evidently :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: after Pass by S i think she MUST bid it|pg||
nt|kaapo: By eptying the box save 7@S and 7NT|pg||
nt|col3435: if pass is forcing|pg||
nt|yuval10: the play will be interesting...... she might know that W has only 3 @s's from the bid|pg||
nt|yuval10: she can ruff 2 @d's..... and see that E has 3|pg||
nt|kaapo: Has West still something to think about?|pg||
nt|yuval10: then 8-1-3-1|pg||
nt|suketbombi:  ok the result wud be the same  460|pg||
nt|suketbombi: the other semis lot of Puneiets have been asking as there latest Hero kaustub bendre is batlling out against MMS|pg||
nt|lml: it might have worked better for east west if east had bid 1@S over 1@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: its not impossible that S will switch to spades, hoping to remove the entry to diamonds|pg||
nt|kaapo: North seems to have a chance for 10 tricks, if he raises the heart suit first|pg||
nt|yuval10: i belive she'll make it|pg||
nt|yuval10: sry HE will make it|pg||
nt|yuval10: because S is declarer|pg||
nt|kaapo: Cilla might make a comment about him never presenting a good dummy, and her showing an example :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think S will like the dummy he'll see :)  he knows it's a reasonable grand, now only have to make!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I think he will|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Would Haglund bid 6@S with @CQx?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: here too they wud think 10 imps gone|pg||
mb|p|nt|burypies: czasami nawet Witek ma piki|pg||
nt|kaapo: Apparently their 2NT opening was something like 22-24|pg||
nt|mmmakela: -1|pg||
nt|kaapo: So 2@C followed by 2NT would be say 20-21|pg||
nt|varange: agreed|pg||
nt|suketbombi: sridhar your Favoraite pd Sudhir Inamdar has come out of retirement and playing in other room|pg||
nt|suketbombi: he will lead 2 rather than unconfortable 8|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: play out of turn....claiming at the end|pg||
pc|dT|nt|Walddk4: Must have a lot of shape for that|pg||
nt|yuval10: lead @d will make it easier for him |pg||
nt|lml: East also might have made a move over 2NT or balanced|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|kaapo: This seems to lose 2 spades, @D and @C|pg||
nt|kaapo: After North's fine spade switch|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|chick: this works to kill the diamonds, but let's W have 2 diamond tricks|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now 8|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: might endplay North|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|nt|xenya: lucky layout for EW|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 2 bds i Imp subhash must be aware the match is close specialy after the 6@H went dn here|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mdgraham: looks like 4@c was an auto-splinter (a splinter agreeing my suit), but the values outside are quite soft|pg||
nt|mdgraham: incidentally, that last board - why did East play a club back after the @SA?|pg||
nt|lestergold: Cant blame Edwin for finding second best lead only lead tov pose a little challenge is a heart of course but woulodnt defeat the contract|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mmmakela: yes although obvious many wouldn't make it|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kaapo: Still more IMPs for Skalman on boards 19 (stopped at 3@S) and 20 (3NT went down)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lml: well I suppose that east-west had already lost this board at the other table so this isnt aas costly as it might have been|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|mmmakela: next a club and then N must find H switch|pg||
nt|kaapo: Interesting lead holding AK|pg||
pc|dA|nt|joemanjo: now can afford to misguess the clubs after the @h lead.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|abunio: jakos sie przeczolgal|pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: imp straty?|pg||
nt|varange: there is no justice!|pg||
nt|joemanjo: Cards lie so that the @h lead, though it attacked the weak spot, does not cause substantial dent to EW hands.|pg||
pc|d8|nt|yuval10: @h to T, A@d and @d ruff|pg||
nt|kaapo: So it's very important for Örebridgen that Mikael makes this, which does seem quite likely|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|suketbombi: !A and Comfortable @C to T|pg||
pc|h3|nt|joemanjo: did North bid only 2@h?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|chick: good time to play a spade and find an endplay|pg||
pc|h5|nt|burypies: piki zaj¹³ tonie musia³ ich kilka razy trzymaæ|pg||
nt|suketbombi: he will step up with @DA i presume|pg||
mc|11|nt|kaapo: Two more boards of the match left|pg||
nt|suketbombi: may be when in with @SA he cud have playe a @C to T keeping all options open|pg||
nt|joemanjo: y|pg||
nt|joemanjo: or after @h q|pg||
nt|suketbombi: other semis Maya Mira Sneha were up 30 imps 12 bds to go dont have the running scores|pg||

nt|abunio: nie mozna powiedziec, ze nic sie nie dzieje|pg||
nt|kaapo: After all, other table did avoid 3NT on board 5: East doubed 1@D and EW found their @S fit. Without a stopper, NS settled for 3@C|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2-way clubbers were able to stop low here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: @HQ makes this an excellent club slam|pg||
nt|col3435: another flat game here?|pg||
nt|varange: is this within their NT range?|pg||
nt|kaapo: Moving on to last two boards|pg||
nt|joemanjo: @c lead wd have put maximum pressure though|pg||
nt|xenya: but declarer didn't know that -- was he playing for 5 @Ds coming in? -- anyhow, good @D duck by S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but the West hand is quite suitable|pg||
nt|othered1: 23 imps in 4 boards is a challenge|pg||
nt|suketbombi: they need 24 imps in 4 bds now|pg||
nt|vasanti: he runs away with 7|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: yup....all playing the last few tricks fast|pg||
nt|suketbombi: so 2 imps now 2 bds sounds like cricket 20/20|pg||
nt|suketbombi:  no the auction was 1@C from Subhash and so on|pg||
mb|1C|nt|kaapo: The web site tells that the match being displayed has not been chosen yet http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.877|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes. all the values are ok, just 2 aces are missing|pg||
nt|vasanti: nothinmg over 1 for any side so whoever bids is in minus|pg||
nt|joemanjo: a routine 4@s now|pg||
nt|joemanjo: oh ok|pg||
nt|suketbombi: out of turn 1@C  and accepted by Ashim|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: Does Staffan have any guesses who we'll see?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: depends on the standings... :) so i have no idea|pg||
nt|varange: nope|pg||
nt|suketbombi: nicely executed good to watch |pg||
nt|joemanjo: other room played in 3N which is also equally dull|pg||
nt|suketbombi: nothing is routinr maoj they will never get @S fit|pg||
mb|1H|nt|varange: yes, another push methinks|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: Anyhow, we're on the last two boards and have comparisons from the open room|pg||
nt|kaapo: Richie Reisig, who by the way has partnered PO, might approve of 1@D, even if it were natural|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kaapo: And the score table looks still very interesting|pg||
nt|suketbombi: good reslt for e-w in other romm they have to get to this lucky game tho|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I agree with east's pass.  With 3 spades South knew his partner didnt have a trap pass|pg||
nt|lml: and so he didnt protect|pg||
mb|4S|nt|frankaus: brb|pg||
nt|mmmakela: as will these gentlemen if given chance|pg||
nt|kaapo: Lower still, here|pg||
mb|p|nt|burypies: a teraz co bêdzie ? Witek 10 ma|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Running a little late in this room as the next match is scheduled to start half past the hour|pg||
nt|mmmakela: oldfashioned nt dbl|pg||
nt|kaapo: AKQx makes for a perfect overcall suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: board inverted. player names will differ|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: 5@D certainly looks like a good contract, but will likely fail with the spade finesse off|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That won't happen|pg||
nt|ralfwil: "who says that crime doesn´t pay" from Bridge in the menagery (about Hidgeous Hog)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: I'd have guessed North would open 1NT. Perhaps they play 15-17 1NT in third and fourth seat|pg||
nt|chick: and a non-transfer runout|pg||
nt|joemanjo: when in doubt ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5D looks the sensible contract here|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vugraphzpx: they play 14-16NT. Dont know why Olof didnt go for 1NT|pg||
nt|kaapo: Fredin - Lindkvist also missed the slam on board 7, playing at the 5 level...|pg||
nt|kaapo: However it was doubled, with an overtrick|pg||
nt|kaapo: Which was worth 11 IMPs, as you can see in the movie|pg||
nt|kaapo: You can find Running Scores via a link here: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.877|pg||
nt|othered1: lucky hardly describes it|pg||
nt|suketbombi: ok they will surely make this probably with an ot|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mmmakela: S's dbl???|pg||
nt|kaapo: I suppose most are old-fashioned with doubles facing a weak NT (if it was one) :)|pg||
nt|chick: balance of points double maybe|pg||
nt|mmmakela: too risky in my book|pg||
nt|suketbombi: trump lead by Subhash:(|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kamyk: rednia impa na rozdanie jest imponuj¹ca|pg||
nt|varange: http://www.jeffgoldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=5+Q+KQ873+AKQ632 |pg||
nt|varange: lose three aces|pg||
nt|xenya: this won't be a success|pg||
nt|othered1: that's certainly a good start for declarer, if he guesses @S correctly|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 3nt better you can suffer a @H ruff in @Ss|pg||
nt|lml: now West should know where the @DJ is from the spots|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|hlortz: the sensible contract 5@D|pg||
pc|cA|nt|burypies: ale sobie poradzi³|pg||
nt|varange: 20HCP|pg||
nt|col3435: could be +1 ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: weight of cards allows 4H to make of course|pg||
pc|c2|nt|joemanjo: the 'wish I were taking my nap" hands.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|suketbombi: diffcult to cash here may play in for @C K and @S J  to beat and restrict in process|pg||
nt|hlortz: coffee break time nothing to the play|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|kaapo: You can access the movie by clicking the green MOVIE button bottom-right of the screen|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Exactly the same auction so far but then Åsmo chickened out|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think Ejnell could do better with that good @c support|pg||
nt|othered1: There's a purpose to the !Q play, but here it's possible declarer was going wrong|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rnc: Next match on vugraph (round 10) starts at 21.00: BK Lavec "Smile" (with Peter Fredin-Magnus Lindkvist) vs Näsby BS |pg||
nt|kaapo: Gärds - Malmström found a slam that didn't make|pg||
nt|kaapo: They chose 6@C and lost 17 IMPs|pg||
nt|varange: excitement then, after all|pg||
pc|c7|nt|kaapo: We are on two last boards of the set and have comparisons from the open room|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kaapo: Tack Carl :)|pg||
nt|varange: kinda difficult to avoid slam with that hand opposite a partner who opens the bidding|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mmmakela: small club immidiately?|pg||
nt|chick: I don't know about 'chose' ... E made a psyche overcall in hearts|pg||

nt|col3435: nope, well cashed, pity it's not MPs|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mmmakela: no|pg||

pc|d9|nt|Walddk4: For the occasion, yes|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@H was not a psyche|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It showed a bad overcall in one major|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And bad it was|pg||

pc|d3|nt|kaapo: Nice to have honest opponents like that :)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lml: 3 or 4 it seems ,, depending on the diamond play|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The fact that Ejnell did not cue bid spades should have been encouraging for East I think. Then his high cards must be in the right places|pg||

nt|lml: I try to avoid it ... except for the good morning and well done parts|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: I don't object to that but I think it would be fair to state that 1NT is usually not 14 in 3rd hand then|pg||
nt|mmmakela: last here, thx kibs,Kaapo, Chick and Staffan for outstanding operator job!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: thank you, will try to keep myself from commentating though :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1@C 2+@C, natural or balanced|pg||
nt|yuval10: NS can find a good sacrifice in a major|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: not that early, about 7.50am.. :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: only -4|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with a little bit more @c lay, 5@c could have been better than 7-trumps @s game|pg||
nt|vasanti: 4hrt sld be on if they do find it agst boss suit|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mmmakela: hard to match the OR result here|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1@C 2-way|pg||
nt|kaapo: More tiring than actual playing, because you need to keep focused all the time|pg||
nt|kaapo: "Early bird opens the can of worms" or how does the saying go?|pg||
nt|col3435: hehe, almost|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: 2@D looks like natural and game forcing|pg||
nt|kaapo: Um, sorry, 1@C may have been strong for EW :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kaapo: 1@D either 11-13 NT or unbalanced with a 4-card major; does not promise dimonds|pg||
nt|kaapo: And thanks Cornelia, Bob and Roland + kibs|pg||
nt|col3435: looks hard to avoid this one|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  anyway - game was poor|pg||
nt|vasanti: seems to be some systematic fit+club|pg||
nt|suketbombi: even intra finese working does not help 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzck: 3 more to go|pg||
nt|lestergold: same auction in open!|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sfoxa:  not so this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|jkmjanusz: 7IMP - ale raczej p³asciochy...|pg||
nt|burypies: nawet Wacek mo¿e mieæ problem|pg||
nt|mmmakela: needs the @S A lead to make 6|pg||
nt|kaapo: Would anyone try 3@C as North?|pg||
nt|lml: I might have bid 2@D with a spade tolerance but south thought his clubs were misplaced|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: Hmm, have they incorporated transfers into the system?|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2@S might show something like 8-12 here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 10-13|pg||
nt|vasanti:  anybody 4 4sp?|pg||
nt|lml: this is fine anyways|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: If he had a long minor instead of a major, it would be a psyche, but 1@H surely was not|pg||
nt|kaapo: That seems to be a raising trend in Sweden|pg||
nt|chick: no dummy-time naps :)|pg||
nt|col3435: club lead?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: subhash does not like to rebid weak suits ahead of his 6 card @S|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kaapo: Very standard bidding here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: except for when sundelin is on... then you get a nap or two... :)|pg||
nt|joemanjo: other room playing strong club both ways ?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mmmakela: so last board now thx all for watching!|pg||
nt|chick: hehehe|pg||
nt|lml: two spades should go down |pg||
mc|7|nt|kaapo: Oh, I see. Glad you're there to correct us Staffan :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: should go one down |pg||
nt|joemanjo: in practise, almost impossible to get to @h contract|pg||
nt|vugraphj77: thx all|pg||
nt|vugraphj77: jutro Grand Prix of Poland|pg||
