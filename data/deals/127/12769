mb|1D|nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: They don't exist these days I suppose|pg||
nt|andyv:  nope... red suit flannery instead:)|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pitiful:  i like to play redouble by west as strength showing with 2@s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good hand for it|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Walddk2: A little pushy by Zia to raise at these colours|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Not sure I would have been silent throughout as West|pg||
nt|pitiful:  what would you have done then paul?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1NT perhaps|pg||
nt|dburn: I suppose that despite long experience, Zia might have hoped that for once Welland would have an opening bid|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|nt|andyv:  as opposed to opening the bid|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|pg||
nt|paulhac:  I would have come back in with 2@S|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|pc|sK|pc|s8|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|d2|pc|c2|nt|dburn: you could come back in again with double, if that showed this kind of hand|pg||
pc|h2|pc|dT|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cJ|pc|h6|pc|c5|pg||
pc|d6|pc|cT|pc|h7|nt|Walddk2: The opening was justified when you are abale to stay as low as 2@H|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|pitiful:  much prefer to bid on the first round|pg||
nt|Walddk2: able  even|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cK|pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|dburn: but still, 1NT or redouble if played that way might be safer moves on the West cards, rather than guessing what to do over 2@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If you don't play your fancy method, Peter, would you have bid 1NT?|pg||
nt|dburn: fancy? I would describe this use of redouble as pretty much mainstream|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Really?|pg||
nt|dburn: sure - what else would it mean?|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: spade honour more mainstream I would say|pg||
nt|dburn: the ten is an honour|pg||

nt|ady: likely slam for n/s to start|pg||
nt|ady: only danger is they get to a grand and fail|pg||
nt|ady: maybe an old hand  |pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: hello cornelia|pg||
nt|mmmakela: not much here for either side|pg||
nt|Gerben42: still might land in 3N|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 1 nt NS best|pg||
nt|Gerben42: will you bid stayman over 1N? then they play 2@H|pg||
nt|mmmakela: no I pass gladly|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what does it mean?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and i've been trying alt0222 |pg||
nt|yo_yo: nothing happens|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no idea what Roland meant|pg||
nt|lestergold: E/W could find a thin spade game here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: To get the  Þ|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i tried it roland|pg||
nt|lestergold: have to guerss hearts to have a chance|pg||
nt|vugraphzcx: Hello and welcome |pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome to Moscow|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good morning/afternoon all|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: Hello|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello and welcome back|pg||
nt|mdgraham: two very strong pairs here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hi Jaap :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: exciting hand to start|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@S unbeatable:)?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: hello everyone|pg||
nt|jtr: It is written:)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|jaapfr: re all|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk4: Get a chat line and press Alt0222|pg||
nt|vugraphzcx: My name is Gudni and I´ll be your operator to day in closed room|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi Jaap|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@S sharp but can|pg||
nt|rnmalik: hello and 4@S EW makes only 3 losers|pg||
nt|sharkey: starting with a tie hand - 20 points a side|pg||
mb|d|nt|yo_yo: nothing|pg||
nt|granguru: in effect Zia itself is here |pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: i think with expected 22 HCP or so, you should take your plus|pg||
nt|jaapfr: re all|pg||
nt|roswolf: slam in diamonds is makeable|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi rashed|pg||
nt|jaapfr: asks minor|pg||
nt|jtr: I thought this might be thrown in|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mdgraham: a somewhat attenuated 1@D opening, but has an easy rebid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: support double, by the look of it - showing three-card spade support|pg||
nt|jaapfr: true but biddable?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: absolutely no reason to bid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hi rashed  and Gudni|pg||
nt|mdgraham: playing that, a raise to 2@S would show four-card support.  |pg||
nt|roswolf: well west has to show them now|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mmmakela: good lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: has East done enough?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello from a snowy Manchester|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Pointwise it is 21 vs 19|pg||
nt|xenya: http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm  for standings|pg||
nt|jtr: I guess he will raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|vinbtech: helo and wc to all|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is that bidding correct gudni?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello  vinay|pg||
nt|vugraphzcx: yes there are misunderstanding at the table |pg||
nt|roswolf: welland +zia wont sit quietly|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: spade contracts played by east arent so threatened by a club lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Keep Alt down with your left hand while you type  0222 with your right hand. It's not difficult|pg||
nt|lestergold: well bullets nice suit poor and stuffingh non exiastent 2s was a free bid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i/ve tried that 15 times|pg||
nt|vinbtech: likely 3n interpreted as both majors !|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 3s would be an overbid|pg||
nt|sybarra2: welcome Martim|pg||
nt|jaapfr: difficult word Mike but got what you meant about 1@D:)|pg||
nt|jtr: Trump lead best|pg||
pc|c5|nt|yo_yo: i never heard of that |pg||
nt|rnmalik: cards are very friendly for 4@H and 3NT for NS|pg||
nt|sharkey: some may not open N hand....|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vinbtech: y a lucky break|pg||
nt|roswolf: the 3@H bid interfered nicely with the e/w auction|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 5@C vuln safe -1 is a good result but unbiddable|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Gerben42: dont want to lead from honors behind the big NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: and this is mps not right to push for dodgy games|pg||
nt|sybarra2: *Martin|pg||
nt|jaapfr: indeed 6@S DD and unbeatable DD|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true|pg||
nt|xenya: this rates to make -- particularly after W's overcall|pg||
nt|rnmalik: by X showed 5M and 4 major, is that it|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, i meant E"s overcall|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S was quite aggressive since it's likely to be only a 5-3 fit|pg||
nt|granguru: It has some merits...some|pg||
pc|sT|nt|rnmalik: agree but cards are very friendly here|pg||
nt|athene: west judges that he has enough entries to his hand (trumps and @HK) that the defence can't kill them all before the clubs are up and running|pg||
nt|po-s: what about a small club?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|granguru: giving a lead..f.i.|pg||
nt|granguru: opps may err Q-A position|pg||
pc|s3|nt|yo_yo: it's teams|pg||
nt|jtr: He played rather quickly to trick one|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|Walddk4: What makes you think  TEAMS  is  MP?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: So it follows that Zia is pushing the boat out bidding 3@S with only three spades, but it has pushed EW to 4@H, where there should be four losers  |pg||
nt|jaapfr: not much chance to make this|pg||
pc|d3|nt|yo_yo: very lucky for North South|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rnmalik: 1@H+1@D+1@C=3|pg||
nt|athene: yes, a small club from north might work a treat|pg||
nt|jtr: God knows what his plan is|pg||
nt|jtr: why no @d finesse there?|pg||
nt|jtr: Ah:)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mcarroll: Hi Shirley|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh u sure it bwa pairs last time i commentated yesterday|pg||
nt|lestergold: even tho it said imps are u sure Kath|pg||
nt|yo_yo: tomorrow is another day :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Mike, it's all in your e-mail|pg||
nt|sharkey: Take @CA and dump a @S?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|po-s: nine will force kng, hen all over|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might draw all the trumps and finesse clubs|pg||
nt|po-s: small club may result in trump drawing and club finesse!!|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rnmalik: but sequence have no knowledge|pg||
pc|d5|nt|yo_yo: http://reykjavikbridgefestival.com/index.php?m=E1&id=M_TEAMS2010&iid=IF_OPENTEAMS2010&m=D3|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Sometimes I wish people would read what I write|pg||
nt|lestergold: in my dotage i forget what i read two days ago u know that roland|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|sharkey: may make this...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm  for standings|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s6|nt|vinbtech: but 3N should also make w/ 4 each in red suit and 1 black suit K at least|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk4: So take notes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i like that when i get it right|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|cA|nt|paulhac:  Hi everyone|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphzcx: N alert 3nt and say it is 5-5 major|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it looks as if the culprit is South  ( forgetting system)|pg||
nt|vinbtech: that explains it ! not 4-4 as i hazarded but 55|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but then Zia has been pushing the boat out for years, and it does not seem to have done huim any  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: ...him any harm|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Gerben42: will just scratch home|pg||
nt|chick: just cashing out for 7 tricks|pg||
nt|yo_yo: rise with the king, hurray|pg||
nt|lestergold: at any rate i think that 2s is quite enough on the east hand tatcics at imps are not to bid dodgy games non vul|pg||
nt|mcarroll: It looks like the defence will grab 5 tricks, then declarer 2 or 3, then the defence another - and Declarer gets the rest - 1NT making|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|xenya: thoughtful play, @D from hand|pg||
nt|xenya: Welcome to Paul Hackett|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi|pg||
nt|xenya: but the @SK was not so good |pg||
nt|jaapfr: now @HJ|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi |pg||
nt|athene: these hands are always tricky, both to play and defend|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, i think East will overfuff the 3rd @c and play trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The results of rounds in IMPs will be converted to VPs using a 60:0 scale. In calculating the datum score (= average score) on each board, about 50% (but not more) of the scores (a ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: quarter from the top and a quarter from the bottom) will not be taken into account|pg||
nt|jtr: 4th @c|pg||
nt|granguru: so how many are taken into account?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: of course the bidding and the layout lucky in some ways so ten tricks made|pg||
nt|rnmalik: someone surely did:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: lol|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sorry i have no link to running scores   who has?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nor me, sorry|pg||

nt|Walddk4: http://www.slavacup.ru/results/slava10/slava10t16r1.htm  for results|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: declarer wants to leave dummy's trumps to control diamonds whilst he gets the clubs set up|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|jaapfr: realistic finesse|pg||
nt|xenya: still he will manage to survive?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: he was sure E to have1 @H max 2 min 0:)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|yo_yo: it's really annoying when partner forgets the system  |pg||
nt|jaapfr: yes he will make it|pg||
nt|paulhac:  if he ruffs with the Q@S and plays the 10@S back?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: even then makes it|pg||
nt|paulhac:  True|pg||
nt|rnmalik: wins the T in hand and small @S to J|pg||
nt|jaapfr: even hen:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: then|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: http://www.slavacup.ru/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ok but DD easier than SD:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Pitches the T @H on Q@D that is if E ruffs with Q@S and plays T@S|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if @C away as specs suggest does not help defense|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: welland made a claim|pg||
nt|jaapfr: he is brite|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: TD called|pg||
nt|jaapfr: claim is correct|pg||
nt|xenya: maybe just a little bit premature|pg||
nt|athene: the defence try to disrupt this of course|pg||
pc|c8|nt|yo_yo: of course when I forget, there's a good reason :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You can click on Round Number (1) for results for each board in Round 1 - website design by Anton Osipov. |pg||
nt|mdgraham: only chance was that @CJ dropped. Unlucky  |pg||
nt|jaapfr: if he sees this miniature correct why he can not claim?|pg||

nt|Gerben42: been in worse slams - 6@D |pg||
nt|mmmakela: here red slams|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i think partner would be surprised that you had 2 aces|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lestergold: yes it is max for the bid but it falls between stools its not really a 3S bid unless your methods can allow you to expres these values more accurately|pg||
nt|rnmalik: if that is a system then it is strange-one might get a hand in 200 deals where responder to 2NT has 5/5 majors|pg||
nt|xenya: oh he can of course|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt from zia i assume|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Hi everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: anyway that alt0222 doesnt work with my keyboard|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i agree Rashed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so the 1@D opening pays dividends|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i think 9 out of 4@H plays was down 1|pg||
nt|po-s: on the result page you can translate via Google (upper right corner)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 9 out of 10|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Gerben42: 6@S has issues with the trump distribution|pg||
nt|athene: hi good afternoon|pg||
nt|rnmalik: hi and welcome|pg||
nt|athene: now 4@S looks likely although it's just about possible north might go for 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: there are certainly hands where 3nt is better but it's a swingy view to take|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: 6 spades needs guessing|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the youngsters tend to remember these things.  Are NS youngsters?|pg||
nt|jtr: 2@s|pg||
nt|jtr: surely|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|jaapfr: now simple 3nt+2 or so so coffee break|pg||
nt|jtr: Not that it will matter|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|vinbtech: one of them is surely NOT  he FORGOT ! lol|pg||
nt|jaapfr: will he pass???|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/y8rdsoc  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 6@H you cant bid - how would you find out about @HJ|pg||
nt|pelu: 1NT? 12-14 or 15-17?|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|Gerben42: 2@C could be either natural or strong (Gazilli)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: iceland you have a wonderful bridge site with great photos|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: so can they locate 4-4 dias|pg||
nt|roswolf: one tip about playing against zia was that if he didnt bid you should assume a bal hand of less than 7/8 hcp!! true on this hand|pg||
mb|4S|nt|yo_yo: but no names |pg||
nt|rnmalik: it also meand that with 3 cards of a major the contract would be 4 of that major|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Will EW talk NS out of their @H game?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 1@S could even go for 500|pg||
nt|roswolf: this also applies to all very aggressive players|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2 NT some kind of relay I presume|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: trump lead or heart lead and trump switch will leave declarer a trick short here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i like to see the participants photos|pg||
nt|rnmalik: EW can make 9 tricks as the cards are placed|pg||
nt|pelu: 15-17 I see :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: an upgraded 15-17|pg||
nt|mdgraham: big view to pass though. |pg||
nt|jaapfr: y|pg||
nt|roswolf: can be sometimes a valuable inference in the play|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: yes i know|pg||
nt|pelu: in on @CQ NS has to take the 4 @S-tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: sorry private|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @C play would determine the fate of the contract after this lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Operator, please delete the  h  in Kwiecien|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|rnmalik: hi Peter, Vladinir|pg||
nt|rnmalik: vladimir-sorry|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I suppose a pair of loonies might, but NS are definitely not that|pg||
nt|athene: Jxxx is a horrible lead, but all west's lead choices were horrible :)|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Zia will be delighted with the lead|pg||
nt|athene: i'm told it's actually against the rules to lead from Jxxx in Sweden|pg||
nt|rnmalik: interesting even if your P has bid the suit|pg||
nt|po-s: no, no, not when it is right|pg||
nt|athene: EW play 4th best leads i guess?|pg||
nt|athene: so east knows zia has five hearts|pg||
nt|paulhac:  East is thinking about whether his partner could have the K@S in which case dummy could be dead or whether he needs to win and switch|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: now 6 top losers|pg||
nt|athene: his problem is, if he takes the @HA right away and switches, that sets up the @HQ as an entry|pg||
pc|s6|nt|gracelin: Hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello Patrick|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hello Roland|pg||
nt|jaapfr: indeed 3nt theoretically chance to make here but who will bid that:)??|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, when south didn't open his 11 count|pg||
nt|po-s: Hi Patrick|pg||
nt|athene: it's normal for opener to prefer the suit contract with three, so east is assuming his partner has four spades|pg||
nt|athene: so it's not impossible he has the king|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3@D may deny @C control - thus W places the final contact|pg||
nt|sharkey: *contract|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Gerben42: no slam interest opposite 2@H (minimum)|pg||
nt|vinbtech: 2D= what they call Ekrens in this part 44+ H+S 5-10 i think|pg||
pc|s2|nt|yo_yo: looks like it but gib thinks differently|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|h9|nt|chick: 2@H is an artificial bid showing minimum hand?|pg||
nt|lestergold: no often a singleton trump in dummy is the contract making trick!|pg||
pc|h3|nt|yo_yo: set up @D?|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, South will open the bidding at some tables, I imagine|pg||
nt|gracelin: I will go to the other room where they are short of commentators. See you.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Bye|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|jaapfr: not surprisingly ns do end in 4@H with no ot|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mdgraham: yes, at some tables South will open, and then North might steamroller on|pg||
nt|jaapfr: +1 can if @CA @C @C|pg||
nt|xenya: stopping in 4@H was a tiny problem perhaps -- the rest should be easy|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Difficult to see this going off as he has not got entries to misguess hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|jaapfr: lol|pg||
pc|h8|nt|yo_yo: Gudni,  can anyone tell us which photos are of the players here?|pg||
nt|pelu: decl need a lot of entries in dummy - will he top-play @Cs?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: then would make:)|pg||
nt|xenya: 16 pairs will play a complete round robin of 8-board matches. The format is IMPs converted to VPs using a 60:0 scale. This is Round 1 of 15. |pg||
pc|sT|pc|hT|pg||
nt|Gerben42: yes, if 2@C was gazilli then 2@H shows 6-7 without 6-card @S|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mmmakela: so once again N gave up too easily, could investigate well below 4H-level|pg||
pc|s9|nt|yo_yo: anyone leading @C gives up a trick|pg||

nt|pitiful:  yes|pg||
nt|pitiful:  9 @s comes into play otherwise|pg||
nt|xenya: on normal defence, declarer can get 2 club ruffs, but that's 9 tricks|pg||

nt|po-s: no entry to diamonds even if "found"|pg||

mb|1S|nt|mmmakela: 1 H from N?|pg||

nt|granguru: would you defend 4@S with South hand if p had never bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: transfer to @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Zia going for the 3NT money if partner has a @s stop|pg||

nt|granguru: Hot second|pg||
nt|sharkey: Zia thinking x?|pg||
nt|sharkey: or 4 NT?|pg||
nt|granguru: defending|pg||
nt|jtr: X probably|pg||
nt|jtr: But he will pass|pg||
nt|granguru: a x only if it not a pen one|pg||
nt|sharkey: He will not bid 5@C as kib suggests...|pg||
nt|granguru: agree|pg||
nt|granguru: 4NT is much better|pg||
nt|jtr: X or pass the only options|pg||
nt|granguru: showing more @Cs than @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: great  gudni  :)|pg||
nt|xenya: seems strange W didn't open 1@D -- it does look like some version of Polish Club?|pg||
nt|jtr: He knows 5m is probably not making|pg||
pc|c9|nt|vinbtech: on a D lead; has only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a nice simple sequence, WD  EW|pg||
nt|mdgraham: slight disparity of contracts....not sure what 1N is|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS need to get @S into play|pg||

nt|lestergold: game not an awful proposition here but doomed with both trump honours offside|pg||

nt|yo_yo: there|pg||
pc|cT|nt|yo_yo: 1NT not enough for game ( as i understand it) then he jumps to game |pg||
nt|athene: interesting the south in the other room didn't open|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jaapfr: 2@S-5 no one had a X chance:)|pg||
nt|athene: it looks normal enough to me|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|nt|paulhac:  Though we can see this is an easy make declarer will be worried in case both spades and the Q@H are badly placed|pg||
nt|xenya: spectators in the other room had a rare chance to see a psychic transfer |pg||
nt|jaapfr: lovely 2@H bid but could end as disaster|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|c5|nt|yo_yo: seems a shame it's going down |pg||
nt|mdgraham: quasi-forcing, maybe|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: on natural methods there is an argument for an invite of 3S rather than a unilateral 4 but west ould probably decline its quite a good contract but unlucky|pg||
nt|jaapfr: anyway 3nt most likely to fail so 1nt+1 optimal imo|pg||
nt|jaapfr: funny thing of bridge S is fearing now to go down: even in 3nt|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk4: We are in Moscow for the annual Slava Cup|pg||
nt|roswolf: but he will be happy soon|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Communications are not very fluid for declarer, and the defence will try not to help him, but may be forced to |pg||
nt|mcarroll: S should probably have ducked, even though it was only postponing the problem. what to lead now?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: (opening looks normal, i mean, not passing :) )|pg||
pc|h7|nt|paulhac:  Some may consider it too good for a weak 2 at the vul but would be reluctant to open 1|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Walddk4: http://www.slavacup.ru/  for the tournament website|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good lead and -1 I think|pg||
nt|granguru: A trump lead would have been better|pg||
nt|granguru: @S of course now|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mcarroll: On board 2 in the Open NS had no difficulty bidding the @H game which was played in 1NT here generating the first significant swing|pg||
pc|s4|pc|cA|pc|sA|pg||
nt|vinbtech: y no SJ coming down in 2|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sharkey: W forced to take @H finesse to have a chance|pg||
pc|s9|nt|xenya: hardly if you play a weak NT|pg||
nt|jaapfr: psyches in general do generate tops or bottoms but mostly frustrated partners:)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|mcarroll: the defence will have to get a @D and will then take the @HA to defeat this contract|pg||

nt|jaapfr: 5@C down too|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Not sure why declarer in the other room did not take his 10 top tricks|pg||

nt|roswolf: horror result in the other room for n/s|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sybarra: can he scrape by making 1?|pg||
nt|dburn: unless... no, surely they can't be playing F***ry|pg||

nt|sharkey: Welland didnt open with 11 and stiff - did with 10....|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulhac:  ambitious 6@S but could have worked on a different layout|pg||
nt|jaapfr: due to x@C in E 6@S down pity whilst fine contract|pg||
nt|xenya: the score on the screen only shows a comparison between 2 tables, actually there are 8 tables in play|pg||
nt|athene: 6-2 spade fit played in 3nt a moment ago|pg||

mb|p|nt|dburn: spades? why not diamonds?|pg||

nt|roswolf: makes me ashamed to be english:(|pg||
nt|jaapfr: confusing Vlad:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: anyway the 2@S bid is a clear warning which was not there in OR|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Ace less may pass|pg||
nt|xenya: not really Jaap -- there are 16 pairs in competition and the format is IMPs converted to VPs on a datum basis|pg||
nt|jaapfr: aha if trump a @C with @SQ all is well|pg||
nt|paulhac:  I agree with the kitbitzers that you can make 6@S  but not so obvious to do so on a trump lead|pg||
nt|paulhac:  6@S could be called unlucky |pg||
nt|jtr: Rebid problems and position mattered to him|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: yes, a lot of work to do with only a 4-4 fit, despite having no losers|pg||
nt|granguru: other was the other way around|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mmmakela: 5 dias can be made if accident but can go down too|pg||

pc|c9|nt|chick: that makes it cashout time|pg||

pc|s3|nt|rnmalik: the observation is after seeing all 52 cards|pg||
nt|rnmalik: would you lead a @D|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Certainly makeable on a non diamond lead|pg||
nt|athene: east thinking about 6n? but that can't be making if the double is really lightner for diamonds, since the diamonds aren't going to be a trick source|pg||
nt|athene: and there's no way that north would double with something like @SQJ109 and nothing else :)|pg||
nt|po-s: and if it is for hearts it is ok for him|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jaapfr: ok bets on: make or down?|pg||

nt|rnmalik: make|pg||
nt|rnmalik: cannot be @H|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|jaapfr: imo the 3@H bid in OR useless bid|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Surely after the X a diamond stands out|pg||
nt|jtr: Players always think the longest when there is no defence|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: looks like working on @s  better but not naturaly given 8 card @H fit |pg||
nt|rnmalik: very unlucky|pg||
pc|sA|nt|yo_yo: what think of the opening lead?|pg||
nt|xenya: my money is on make|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Make|pg||
pc|c3|nt|chick: will take 11 when the @HQ falls|pg||
nt|yo_yo: sort of a gambler's lead?|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2S was ok but if bidding went to 3 level it sure has to be diamonds|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Walddk4: Some kibs asking why no Stayman by Welland with 4-4 in the majors. Search me is all I can say|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He felt like bidding 3NT is my guess|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jaapfr: i agree now: makes|pg||
nt|jaapfr: must play @S 2-2 for best chance |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|yo_yo: for those who dont know, david Burns laws, might care to look them up at: http://www.blakjak.demon.co.uk/burn_law.htm|pg||

nt|vinbtech: cant lead H and C and D too; so S ! simple|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|lestergold: west forced out but can still enjoy 9 tricks|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if i understood it correctly|pg||
nt|dburn: well, not "very unlucky" - would also have gone down with 4-1 spades|pg||
nt|po-s: or lucky...guess he would have doubled also with Jxx|pg||

mb|1C|nt|yo_yo: but lots do open |pg||

nt|jaapfr: in weekend no non alcoholics|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no X makes, no @D lead makes:)|pg||
nt|solex33: maybe - quite "unlucky" ? :-)|pg||
mb|d|nt|mcarroll: The Open seem to be pursuing the same line|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
nt|paulhac:  At least South has to find a ruff when the spades are 3-2|pg||
nt|po-s: all 3-2 without a direct ruff|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@H has a play here?|pg||
nt|sharkey: S remained silent in OR|pg||
nt|jtr: Nice defence next door|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|yo_yo: i would open the south hand though|pg||
nt|athene: West has a bit of a problem here|pg||
nt|jtr: North wants to bid something|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@H some kind of good @S raise - viw S has shown @H|pg||
mb|d|nt|jaapfr: most E will pass after1@S and some mite bid 1nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: opposite a passed pard 2@H is bold|pg||
nt|sharkey: *view|pg||
mb|2S|nt|paulhac:  Is that not over 60% PO|pg||
nt|athene: double is fine as long as partner isn't so ill-mannered as to bid diamonds|pg||
nt|po-s: I would think more than 60|pg||
nt|dburn: closer to 65%, but a contract that will fail one time in three is not "very unlucky" to do so - unless you're Polish, of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: new form of Polish club?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: now 4@H|pg||
nt|jtr: Zia may think Welland has @hs|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: 2NT now?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|lestergold: North knows his customer|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mcarroll: Support double from N showing 3@Ss?|pg||
nt|pelu: with @CJ by NS 6@C would be a nice slam|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2NT balanced and old-fashioned game-forcing. No major|pg||
nt|jaapfr: my praying did help for yours:)|pg||
nt|athene: we need an adjective slightly less emphatic than "very" but more so than "mildly"|pg||
nt|sharkey: E will bid 3@S I think - showing 6 card suit|pg||
nt|jtr: 3@d did the trick anyway|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - I think Zia's initial Dbl afforded that|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: have time to ruff some @D here  should not be all bad |pg||
nt|roswolf: slam try - i would play that as a splinter maybe a fit jump type bid!?|pg||
nt|athene: how about "somewhat"|pg||
nt|po-s: I´m for whoever tries a slam|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
nt|athene: 6@S was somewhat unlucky|pg||
nt|sharkey: N have shown 1-3-4-5 I think|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi all gm|pg||
nt|sharkey: Gd morning Jaap|pg||
nt|jtr: I think West devalued his hand by only bidding 2@h and is now wondering|pg||
nt|jtr: Hoi Jaap|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi carl and is ivan here?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi David|pg||
nt|sharkey: Whats W to do - two soft Q?|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe he thinks partner has a @d single|pg||
nt|jaapfr: Ivan was our operator yesterday in this CR and made 0 misclicks in all sessions:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well third in hand yes but vul is unvafourable some might be more conservative|pg||
nt|xenya: the score on the screen doesn't mean much -- it's only a comparison between 2 tables, but there are 8 tables in play|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 13-10 makes match close again|pg||
nt|rnmalik: slightly unlucky|pg||
nt|po-s: go for very - not extremely or utterly|pg||
nt|solex33: slightly very unlucky|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: is that 1 @C 15+ precicion or upgrade|pg||
nt|vugraphzcx: prec|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 15+? or 16+? |pg||
nt|vugraphzcx: will ask after this board?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: ok ty|pg||
nt|rnmalik: interesting no 1@H-1@S|pg||
nt|po-s: very courageous 2H btw|pg||
nt|jtr: South engineered a trump promotion at the other table|pg||
pc|dT|nt|chick: generally you need about 29 HCP to play 3N with a 5-5-2-1 facing a 1-2-5-5 (not quite the case here), but they do have 27|pg||
nt|mcarroll: If the defence do not lead trumps a @C @D crossruff will produce lots of tricks|pg||
pc|d2|nt|dburn: now, making a takeout double of 2@s and hearing partner want to play in clubs and not diamonds - that's more than somewhat lucky|pg||
pc|d5|nt|yo_yo: one would expect 1@S response, agree|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|jtr: Zia is on his way to doing the same|pg||
pc|d3|nt|yo_yo: i would be afraid of bidding just 1NT with the north hand however|pg||
nt|sybarra: and now?|pg||
nt|pelu: even @C 10 would do|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: i guess if east had gone for diamonds, west was planning just to pass and hope for the best|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mcarroll: @C @H crossruff|pg||
nt|pelu: give N@C8 and intrafiness could bring home a slam|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @C suit not very favourable|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm|pg||
nt|jaapfr: this is going very wrong for ew|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one hears the sound of falling wheels |pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|chick: so I predict they will make this|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so they did well|pg||
nt|dburn: not really - why bid a bad suit with a good hand?|pg||
nt|po-s: what do they do with the "normal" 18-19 NT?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rnmalik: agreed |pg||
nt|jaapfr: see beauty defense OR why 6@S went down in tr 2|pg||
nt|jtr: Here the distribution is marked for declarer|pg||
pc|s7|nt|xenya: well-judged by Welland?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you suspect that 5@D wasn't what East wanted to hear |pg||
nt|jaapfr: likely no X by N to encourage @H lead by pd|pg||
nt|po-s: so they never know if they have a major and wk NT|pg||
nt|jaapfr: X of 5@D i meant|pg||
nt|mdgraham: auction not over yet....|pg||
nt|po-s: couldn´t West have CA and DK?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: after an 18-19 1nt by pd if he not pass now he has to go too............................:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, 1NT can't be 18-19, that's for sure|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but it's all a bit mysterious|pg||
nt|po-s: it used to show 18, and 1M was bid with wk NT and 3+card suit|pg||
nt|jaapfr: also for them i am sure|pg||
nt|po-s: but these guys don´t play regular Polish|pg||
nt|po-s: not his style at all|pg||
nt|jaapfr: nv-v i would bid 2@H too|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mdgraham: told 1NT is a one-round force, called the Dymanic NT  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: sorry, Dynamic|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|paulhac:  In the other room West bid spades|pg||
nt|jaapfr: still i think he will make it|pg||
nt|jtr: If he can manouvre things|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @HA and @C|pg||
nt|jtr: A sort of dummy reversal makes it|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pelu: a lot of spec ask me a lot of Q - please update your profil with names !!!!!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|rnmalik: same here and same answer|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I think at pairs 3NT was a better contract as played in OR|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@S puppet to 2NT|pg||
nt|jaapfr: dynamite 1nt?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|dburn: if we need to play in spades, partner can bid them|pg||
nt|xenya: well they sniffed at slam here|pg||
nt|athene: and if east bid diamonds and south doubled, he could reconsider (fake an urgent phone call perhaps)|pg||
nt|po-s: "quite" might be the right one in both cases|pg||
pc|h4|nt|yo_yo: i think 90% would bid 1@S   |pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|lestergold: defnce have done well to hold it|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mdgraham: still, all will be forgiven if East makes this|pg||
nt|sharkey: Zia shud have switched to @S trick 2|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c8|nt|jtr: Wouldnt that make life easier?|pg||
nt|jtr: Cheap finesse|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mcarroll: and 8 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: and this is imps, not mps|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|po-s: If it needs that much from partner to make game, perhaps it isn´t the recommended action generally|pg||
pc|h2|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|chick: N needed to cover the @DJ, now making is almost sure thing|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|nt|jaapfr: i think it was meant defensively 2@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: his rabbit's foot working overtime oerhaps?|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and turned out that pd had the goodies|pg||
nt|po-s: We can see that but how is partner to know?|pg||
nt|roswolf: he cant - but ls lady luck was with him|pg||
nt|xenya: let me tell you a little secret: NS decided not to attend the opening banquet last night|pg||

nt|xenya: this tournament is held in the Moscow City Golf Club|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: sry can't type your name correctly dear operator!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 16 pairs taking part, by invitation only|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed, Paul|pg||
nt|athene: west needs to write "negative free bids" on his card quickly|pg||
nt|athene: so he can bid 2@S|pg||
nt|dburn: good time to have a non-forcing 2@s available|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@S makes, on the layout|pg||
nt|athene: for any specs who haven't met the term, "negative free bids" means after an overcall, as here, responder's new suit is non-forcing|pg||
nt|dburn: but if North bids 5@d, East will not be certain how to proceed|pg||
nt|athene: with a "real" 2@S bid he doubles first then bids spades|pg||
nt|athene: these methods are very popular in poland - not sure why, especially - i don't think they mesh especially well with the rest of Polish Club - just tradition, perhaps|pg||
mb|1N|nt|roswolf: very solid result in the other room for n/s maybe i can raise the flag again|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: The scores on the board make little sense, and here is why ...|pg||
nt|pelu: aggresiv 1@S by Hachett in East|pg||
nt|sharkey: Not sure - E gets to ruff one @C and can get home on low @H?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|vinbtech: 1C= precision or some some such ART club|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzcx: hehe you can say Gudni|pg||
nt|mcarroll: N managed to buy the contract on previous board in 1@S so a likely 5 imp swing|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The results of rounds in IMPs will be converted to VPs using a 60:0 scale. In calculating the datum score (= average score) on each board, about 50% (but not more) of the scores (a ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: quarter from the top and a quarter from the bottom) will not be taken into account|pg||
nt|dburn: this, though, is the wrong tempo - now if North bids 5@d East-West will double him|pg||
mb|2D|nt|jaapfr: i doubt you will win here|pg||
nt|paulhac:  But it is cheaper than 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: that's quite a hunky 2@C overcall|pg||
nt|yo_yo: chunky|pg||
nt|dburn: well, at least they avoided the 3-3 diamond fit, but...|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3nt+2 most likely|pg||
nt|jaapfr: mb +1|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: http://www.slavacup.ru/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@S has a vey good chance to be made here|pg||
nt|dburn: and if he doesn't, then East-West will pick up a pretty good result|pg||
nt|po-s: long ago we met a Polish pair in the European, and my partner asked abt a "free" bid - and the opponent answered "unlimited" - It turned out he meant downwards|pg||
nt|athene: hahahaha|pg||
nt|athene: that's a good one :) i must remember that|pg||
nt|rnmalik: great|pg||
nt|athene: such a useful interpretation - for example "i have unlimited faith in teammates not to screw up our good set"|pg||
nt|jtr: 'garbage' stayman?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jaapfr: previous board the problem was that W was before 5@H not aware of the 4514 at least not the @D misfit imo|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: This is an annual event that has been set up in memory of Russian bridge player Slava Grinuk, who died at the age of 30. Slava was very fond of bridge, so a group of his friends ...|pg||
nt|xenya: (who didn't play bridge themselves) decided that the best way to commemorate him would be to hold an annual  bridge tournament in his honour. |pg||
nt|jtr: 2@h can show a weak hand with both majors|pg||
nt|jtr: either way round|pg||
nt|sharkey: View NS can only lead @S twice regardless of lead think it was always a make - previous hand|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/y8rdsoc  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|rnmalik: system:)|pg||
nt|po-s: somehow it seems a waste to use 1NT for 20+ hands; they are so infrequent - and you must then create unclear (two-threeway) bids for all other hands|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y is only one real Zia: S:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: ok so it resembles a "D" good to gnow! and I assume you are a she?|pg||

nt|mdgraham: EW use Precison 2@C opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: It looks like 3H was a splinter...|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: heart contract does well if club q is found and dimaond ruff is not found!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: they have got this played by West - so it might make|pg||
nt|po-s: interesting lead - if we assume that opps do´t have 44 in a major then West must have 4+ hearts but may only have 3 spades|pg||
nt|rnmalik: nice one still enjoying:)|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, declarer can play @cs from hand to stop South getting in twice|pg||
pc|s4|nt|chick: could make a couple of overtricks here as the cards lie favorably|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Now likely to make 12 tricks|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: unlikely tho for 4H to be misdefended here|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I think 16+ 1@C|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mdgraham: and with 3-3 clubs, making|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vinbtech: should E be bidding 3H here?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: precision to be correct|pg||
nt|mcarroll: only 11 available|pg||

nt|rnmalik: Defence over|pg||

pc|cA|pg||
nt|mcarroll: W should have put in the @C ten, allowing partner the option of overtaking to give a @D ruff|pg||
nt|po-s: this is interesting - 5D and 4S depend on who has the club king (apart from the rest of the conditions - NS should bid 5D|pg||

nt|mdgraham: very useful @H109|pg||
nt|jaapfr: only 3@H to lose not 1@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: suspect North will play @HA and a low one|pg||
nt|po-s: please!!! normally it is a small heart, and normally opponents will get in somewhere and can cash the hearts - and if East´s high cards are al elsewhere 5D will make|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hoping South has Q98x or similar|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|sybarra: srslorryall have to dre. |pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|nt|mmmakela: sryyyyyyyyy|pg||
nt|chick: depends on what finesses he takes ... got the hearts right so far|pg||
nt|yo_yo: seems a shame not to bid those @S|pg||
pc|d7|nt|dburn: maybe not, but if partner has four hearts (and three clubs) then both 3@h and 3@c might make|pg||
nt|paulhac:  3@S looks a bit of an underbid but maybe it was because of the vulnerability|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|jaapfr: think other table declarer blew up the 3@S with play of @SK too early|pg||
nt|jaapfr: at least DD:)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|chick: now clubs |pg||
pc|s7|nt|sharkey: Here 8 tricks appears cold - shud be matter of overtrick...|pg||
nt|jaapfr: do you understand why N bids 2@S?|pg||
nt|sharkey: I assume S has shown garbage hand with @H & @S - N corrects to get lead into his hand...|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h7|pg||
nt|sharkey: Thus 2@S from Zia wud have shown different hand...|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ty specs i got it:)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|mmmakela: thought E got the spade ruff|pg||

pc|h5|nt|jaapfr: 17-16 even|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|nt|jaapfr: 4@D other room an overbid:)?|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, i play the same with 2@s showing 5-4 and an invite|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, North can see the singleton @HK in dummy|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|dT|pc|d5|pc|h9|pg||
nt|sharkey: shud make 10 now?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|po-s: but I perhaps East could have 3136 as 2D was probably only a relay|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|pc|d2|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 1@S1@H4@D and 3!@C so unbeatable even with x@H lead imo|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so 2 imps in it, 2 boards to play|pg||
nt|sharkey: wd|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|nt|Walddk2: Good point, Paul. Would declarer lead low from Ax? And even if he had, the trick will come back later as declarer is out of trumps|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|c9|pc|cA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would bid 3|pg||
nt|paulhac:  It would have been my choice|pg||
nt|andyv:  so, no devaluation for the K@h?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The D void points in the other direction|pg||
nt|andyv:  hand is basically a 10 count with a void|pg||

nt|dburn: and the way things have gone, 3@h will make anyway|pg||
nt|dburn: so I guess he should have bid it|pg||
nt|jaapfr: or opps max 3@H and 1@C so unbeatable it was even DD|pg||
nt|mdgraham: my word|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: will watch more closely now I promise, was on the phone|pg||
nt|chick: partscores best possible here :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Welland was not sure of single @S with P|pg||
nt|athene: quite hard for north to bid at the 5-level with no shortage and a lot of defence|pg||
mb|1C|nt|Walddk4: 4@H might depend on getting clubs right|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3@D makes as well|pg||
nt|athene: zia had the stiff spade but he had only five diamonds - not easy at all|pg||
nt|solex33: 3 rounds of h defeats 5 dia. regardless the pos of k of c|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mmmakela: in precision that used to be a club opening in the old days|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i bet east will go to game|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if @HA x@H x@S then it could down?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: interesting choice for East|pg||
nt|dburn: here is a slightly somewhat quite very lucky slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: it was quite nice for declarer when South tackled trumps|pg||
nt|vinbtech: y the result justified 3H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If you subscribe to the Principle of Restricted Choice, you will get it right|pg||
nt|rnmalik: lets see |pg||
nt|athene: it all depends what 4@H promises - i suppose the usual rule "don't pre-empt over a pre-empt" applies here, so 4@H is a real hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry kibs - I don't speak Italian or Turkish....|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|yo_yo: a fit jump?|pg||
nt|vinbtech: a fit jump more likely |pg||
nt|rnmalik: very good hans for 5@D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@S is reasonable, but what about 5@S? Would that be the same as a 5@S opening  bid?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sorry for confusion i referred to x@H lead as unbeatable but with @HA x@H and @S switch it was DD down|pg||
nt|jaapfr: team 1 will gain here|pg||
nt|jtr: I am not a fan of 1NT but Welland is a law unto himself|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm|pg||
mb|d|nt|chick: "precision" has so many variations that its very name is a contradiction :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Tony Forrester did in the other room with no opponent bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_restricted_choice_(bridge)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's even more evident here where Kwiecien has shown a two-suiter by opening 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: http://www.slavacup.ru/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR the @D-lead gave Forrester a help to "see" 2 x singleton by West - with singleton @H (and no bid) u would not play the @Cs right|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 6@S pls|pg||
nt|athene: maybe not quite as real as 3@S would be, but still real-ish|pg||
nt|dburn: well, 3@s would be bid on most "real hands" - 4@h is something like a decent limit raise|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i can help whilst West speaksDutch fluently:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: lol|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi ivan|pg||
nt|sharkey: Zia helped EW getting @S suit into play...|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|po-s: oops|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y 6@C has a chance specs but will not be bid:) imo|pg||
nt|xenya: on the surface, 6@C looks tempting|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3@D chance they go higher than in OR|pg||
nt|xenya: but is likely to fail|pg||
nt|paulhac:  6 @C Needs a lot of work|pg||
nt|jaapfr: is it so slow today? yesterday fast enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: There's no Four-and-a-half spades card in the bidding box |pg||
nt|jtr: E/W are not the quickest|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdp: you can find current results here: http://www.slavacup.ru/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I bet Zia will get it right too if 4@H is the final destination|pg||
nt|jaapfr: vwd 5@S bid|pg||
nt|dburn: they might get to seven at this rate|pg||
nt|athene: certainly interesting that zia bids 5@C instead of 4@S - i wonder if it's a "help-suit slam try" rather than a normal control-bid|pg||
nt|dburn: that is how Zia prefers to play, certainly|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Roy trying to evaluate his Q@C|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @D finesse working can't pitch the 5th@C|pg||
nt|dburn: but for 6@c he ought to have rather better clubs - if I were Welland I would be giving serious thought to bidding seven|pg||
nt|po-s: x,Axxxx,Ax,AKJxx|pg||
nt|athene: zia needs a lot opposite for seven - @HKQ, @SA, @CK and more - that would be a 3@S bid not a 4@H bid surely|pg||
nt|dburn: still, even @sNone @hAJxxx @dAxx @cAKJxx is not a grand slam, so he may settle for six|pg||
nt|athene: (i mean zia doesn't need the @SA but he knows his partner has it, so that just means he hasn't got something else that *is* needed)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jaapfr: a @H lead against 6@C would be helpful:) lol|pg||
nt|sharkey: shud be off 1|pg||
pc|s8|nt|yo_yo: 2 10s, East will go |pg||
nt|po-s: dynamic 5S?|pg||
nt|kippari: joo,ti oli se tohon jo merkittynä muistin vain väärin|pg||
nt|jaapfr: even 2nt-1 wins 10 but 3nt ???? -2 so 3 imps lost|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 10=0 imps|pg||
nt|po-s: no heart lead..|pg||
pc|sK|nt|yo_yo: West i mean|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Same contract in Open|pg||
nt|jaapfr: dynamite?|pg||
nt|xenya: they are on their way there|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|mmmakela: E promising clubs with dbl so maybe 3 nt by south was the right bid, n must have some stuff in majors and often a 4th dia|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ruff and finesse @D?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: plausible reasoning and a finesse involved|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Could  But even if Zia had AKxxxx@C and AD he is still a trick short|pg||
nt|athene: 6@D temporising saying "i can't bid seven but i don't want to shut up shop" - that has to mean good trumps i suppose|pg||
nt|athene: it can't be a control as he bid 5@S over 5@C|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mmmakela: *6th dia|pg||
nt|jaapfr: all other leads 6@C probably down|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Makes on a coss ruff but is that really the right line?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|pelu: here he know @S+@D by West|pg||
nt|jaapfr: then 1 imp the 2nt joke:)|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|pg||
pc|s3|nt|po-s: I think Zia had a fortunate escape here|pg||
pc|h5|nt|yo_yo: it takes a lot of courage to pull partner's double with the South hand|pg||
nt|rnmalik: made easy|pg||
nt|rnmalik: slightly lucky escape:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Anybody 3@S with East's hand?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jaapfr: but is the non cross ruff an attractive alternative (i doubt that)|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|jtr: Fu thought about it|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sharkey: E got an opportunity to bid 1S OR - Welland's 1 NT overcall prevented that|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i suppose 2@S meant inviting and balanced|pg||
nt|sharkey: Assume showing suit and good hand Jaap?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: do not ask me:)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|po-s: so if South is in after 4 spades - no he isn´t|pg||
nt|solex33: true. zia needs a lot for 7-  6 c prob means: "did u pd- by chance- forgot to bid 3s ? "|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mmmakela: ok forget all I wrote|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ask David|pg||
nt|sharkey: ok - since we're on the assuming track....|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|chick: hehe|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I would after 1@D opening|pg||
pc|dT|nt|xenya: regardless of the outcome, it's a fine effort by EW |pg||
nt|jtr: I guess they play 2NT as minor(s) and dont want to bid 2@c without a major|pg||
nt|jaapfr: any spec KNOW what 2@S meant?|pg||
nt|jtr: ergo 2@s invite with no major|pg||
nt|dburn: depends to an extent on what 1@c meant|pg||
pc|dK|pc|c6|nt|jaapfr: we did see in the Zia room today a lot of fireworks so ill be this 6@C|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|jaapfr: votes specs pls make or down???|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 2-4|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@s could be "either invitational in notrump or a sign-off in clubs", if the full system is on|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jaapfr: D 5 specs KNOW you were rite:)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk4: If @D8 is to believed to be an "honest" card, Jagniewski has shown an odd number of diamonds. They play upside-down count|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Rest assured that Zia will have noticed|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jaapfr: 5-12|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Maybe a heart finesse to get rid of the spade is a possible line|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 16-31 if counted correctly|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|d7|nt|pelu: here the count-signal is only a help for decl|pg||
pc|d8|nt|jtr: lol|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|yo_yo: @d behave so all is well|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 19-34 final no other bets|pg||

nt|sharkey: ty David - we needed that clarification...|pg||
nt|jaapfr: link for overall standings is ??|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes it's good to investigate the grand so that opps relax, assuming the small slam is cold, and don't beat it :)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jtr: This would make if West had @cKQ|pg||
pc|h3|pc|dA|nt|Walddk4: Now it's all clear for him|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Routine finesse next|pg||
nt|xenya: a complete crossruff works here it seems|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|dburn: but if 1@c showed clubs, 2@s was probably just invitational in notrump|pg||

nt|athene: you can do the same thing with blackwood - ask for the trump queen, partner says he hasn't got it, so you sign off in six|pg||
nt|solex33: or dont dbl|pg||
nt|rnmalik: another one in minors now|pg||
nt|athene: now opps think a) you were looking for seven and b) you don't have the trump queen yourself|pg||
nt|athene: neither of which is true|pg||

nt|roswolf: e/w in the other room rightsided this contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: live results|pg||
nt|po-s: hard to beat that result from closed|pg||
nt|rnmalik: when I made that observation of -1, he had ruffed a @D with 10@C|pg||
nt|jtr: Even so, the @cQ gives him a maximum and the contract makes anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: yes, 9 imps on board 1 when NS sacrificed in 5@Dx|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes north bid his weaker suit|pg||
nt|po-s: good start|pg||
nt|paulhac:  That helps|pg||
nt|po-s: just bid 6?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mmmakela: that kind of 3-way 2@C  opening isn't allowed in many countries because itdoesn't include an anchor suit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks Vladimir|pg||
nt|po-s: or are they barred from having an ace|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: some pairs play a special sort of blackwood after a pre-empt|pg||
nt|athene: since partner is known to have nothing|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: The Open room started 3 boards behind us and has now caught up and is even ahead. They play this hand in 2@S|pg||
nt|athene: 4@D says "what flavour of nothing do you have here partner?"|pg||
nt|granguru: EW can make 2@C|pg||
nt|sharkey: Yes - much easier with all hands in view - also very difficult to defend |pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe he played too quickly?:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: previous hand|pg||
mb|2C|nt|roswolf: 2@D =?|pg||
nt|po-s: how much is 4D RD 12 or 13 tricks?|pg||
nt|sharkey: lol|pg||
nt|granguru: only a @C lead can beat|pg||

nt|jtr: Heading towards 2@s|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@D first I think|pg||
nt|jtr: well 4@s sort of|pg||
nt|granguru: which can also be made|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: the bad break puts paid to this one |pg||

nt|yo_yo: oh dear, take some aspirin Mike|pg||
nt|vugraphzcx: yes as far as I know|pg||
mb|2D|nt|rnmalik: now it is clear after @H and @S bids and instead of DBL N could bid 4NT with that hand|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Only a 5 imp swing I miscounted the undertricks in the Open|pg||
nt|jaapfr: my quess team 2 to win this with 1 imp:)|pg||
nt|athene: interesting double|pg||
nt|solex33: lead directing if pd has A of dia|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not really|pg||
nt|dburn: made? the defenders can cash the first six tricks at least|pg||
mb|d|nt|yo_yo: bye and quick recovery |pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5 matches of 8 boards today, 6 tomorrow and 4 on Monday. I believe the upcoming Monday is a public holiday in Russia. Maybe Vladimir can confirm|pg||
nt|xenya: actually the holiday is on 23rd, but Monday is a non- working day too|pg||
nt|xenya: we will be back shortly -- 20or 30 minutes i guess|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Non-working non-holiday, I like those :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: big loss here|pg||
nt|po-s: 2D was a clever bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: this 3nt is wrong sided|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but still leads @D|pg||
nt|xenya: previous hand should produce a great score for NS|pg||
nt|jaapfr: tx all and for sure Ivan is really the greatest (family of Alexander:)?|pg||
nt|athene: asking for a diamond lead against 6nt if partner has @DAK, maybe|pg||
nt|jaapfr: specs previous board was meant that discarding a @H by W could only give the contract of 2nt away and could never be winning as JTR explained N could have had @CAQ then 2nt makes ...|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and if not @CQ then easy to discard  a @C and even @CK could not to be trown in|pg||
mb|r|nt|jaapfr: 3nt-3|pg||
nt|po-s: but apparently conventional|pg||
nt|jaapfr: DD and SD:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: some taps coming up|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 5@C obviously best, but how can you get there?|pg||
nt|po-s: just in cas double (if they don´t know their responses|pg||
nt|jtr: Fu heading for bathroom|pg||
nt|jaapfr: because of the @H discard by W:)?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphzdp: results:http://www.slavacup.ru/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm|pg||
nt|jaapfr: tx Ivan for unnoticable excellent job:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes indeed|pg||
nt|jaapfr: whole day 0 mistakes as operator|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he means it as majors, looking for a sac, but 4@D isn't natural so it's all a bit strange|pg||
mb|d|nt|petergill: Fu Zhong - Jack Zhao (China) and Kholomeev - Khiuppenen (Russia) lead the Slava Cup after 44-16 wins in Round 1, ref http://www.slavacup.ru/results/slava10/slava10t16r1.htm|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The results of rounds in IMPs will be converted to VPs using a 60:0 scale. In calculating the datum score (= average score) on each board, about 50% (but not more) of the scores (a ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: quarter from the top and a quarter from the bottom) will not be taken into account|pg||
nt|pelu: and 44-16 = win by 14 IMPs = a gameswing! - hard scale|pg||
nt|mdgraham: operators are a bit like cricket umpires - if they do a good job, you don't notice them |pg||
nt|jaapfr: i get -4   -3   -2 and makes replies from kibs my screen is ""blue""|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if @DA @CA @CQ then -2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: has to take @DA and play on clubs, I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulhac:  txs everyone|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Thanks everyone|pg||
nt|athene: thanks all|pg||
nt|solex33: maybe a mixture of lead directing and take-out ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: thx all|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Thanks and C..................U.|pg||
nt|po-s: is there more today?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: no, that was last segment today|pg||

nt|sharkey: Zia won't let go now|pg||
pc|s8|nt|yo_yo: i thought Mike was unusually quiet :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If ever there is a case for a trump lead, this is the auction. Even Bill and D Bird would lead one, don't you think, David?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mdgraham: although that may be a bit double-dummy|pg||
nt|jtr: Bill maybe|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS shud take the first 7 tricks|pg||
nt|jtr: It is a religious thing with Bird though i think|pg||
nt|dburn: Zhao perhaps a little unlucky not to find Fu with a three-card major after the opponents had started 1@c-1NT|pg||
nt|jtr: He can only lead trumps on thursdays|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if so then 17-12|pg||
nt|granguru: the whole day?|pg||
nt|dburn: for all that, his @cQ wasn't a bad feature for playing in clubs, so he might not have run|pg||
nt|jaapfr: although not sure comparison is with allother ?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good bridge, many doubles and redoubles|pg||
nt|jtr: Up until 10pm|pg||
nt|sharkey: Roland will explain the scoring method I think|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The results of rounds in IMPs will be converted to VPs using a 60:0 scale. In calculating the datum score (= average score) on each board, about 50% (but not more) of the scores (a ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: quarter from the top and a quarter from the bottom) will not be taken into account|pg||
nt|granguru: a heard a nice tip about leading trumps. If you are going to lead trumps before count up to ten..|pg||
nt|granguru: if that doesnt work..then count up to hundred|pg||
nt|jtr: Does Welland think Zia has doubled with xx?|pg||

nt|vinbtech: W has no option but to play S twice towards KQxx and chalk up 9 tricks|pg||
nt|vinbtech: nice duck by N but of no avail|pg||
nt|yo_yo: North might lead a sneaky @S|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|nt|jaapfr: but -1 was not mentioned lol|pg||
