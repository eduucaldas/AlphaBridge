nt|ady: likely slam for n/s to start|pg||
nt|ady: only danger is they get to a grand and fail|pg||
nt|ady: maybe an old hand  |pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: hello cornelia|pg||
nt|mmmakela: not much here for either side|pg||
nt|Gerben42: still might land in 3N|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 1 nt NS best|pg||
nt|Gerben42: will you bid stayman over 1N? then they play 2@H|pg||
nt|mmmakela: no I pass gladly|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what does it mean?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and i've been trying alt0222 |pg||
nt|yo_yo: nothing happens|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no idea what Roland meant|pg||
nt|lestergold: E/W could find a thin spade game here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: To get the  Þ|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i tried it roland|pg||
nt|lestergold: have to guerss hearts to have a chance|pg||
nt|vugraphzcx: Hello and welcome |pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome to Moscow|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good morning/afternoon all|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: Hello|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello and welcome back|pg||
nt|mdgraham: two very strong pairs here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hi Jaap :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: exciting hand to start|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@S unbeatable:)?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: hello everyone|pg||
nt|jtr: It is written:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: re all|pg||
mb|2C!|an|pres|nt|Walddk4: Get a chat line and press Alt0222|pg||
nt|vugraphzcx: My name is Gudni and I´ll be your operator to day in closed room|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi Jaap|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@S sharp but can|pg||
nt|rnmalik: hello and 4@S EW makes only 3 losers|pg||
nt|sharkey: starting with a tie hand - 20 points a side|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: nothing|pg||
nt|granguru: in effect Zia itself is here |pg||
nt|jtr: Welland opened a worse hand in this position last match|pg||
mb|2D!|an|ask|nt|Gerben42: i think with expected 22 HCP or so, you should take your plus|pg||
nt|jaapfr: re all|pg||
nt|roswolf: slam in diamonds is makeable|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi rashed|pg||
nt|jaapfr: asks minor|pg||
nt|jtr: I thought this might be thrown in|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: a somewhat attenuated 1@D opening, but has an easy rebid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: support double, by the look of it - showing three-card spade support|pg||
nt|jaapfr: true but biddable?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mmmakela: absolutely no reason to bid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hi rashed  and Gudni|pg||
nt|mdgraham: playing that, a raise to 2@S would show four-card support.  |pg||
nt|roswolf: well west has to show them now|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: good lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: has East done enough?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello from a snowy Manchester|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Pointwise it is 21 vs 19|pg||
nt|xenya: http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm  for standings|pg||
nt|jtr: I guess he will raise|pg||
mb|2N!|an|GF|nt|vinbtech: helo and wc to all|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is that bidding correct gudni?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello  vinay|pg||
nt|vugraphzcx: yes there are misunderstanding at the table |pg||
nt|roswolf: welland +zia wont sit quietly|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Its different when you are leading|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: spade contracts played by east arent so threatened by a club lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Keep Alt down with your left hand while you type  0222 with your right hand. It's not difficult|pg||
nt|lestergold: well bullets nice suit poor and stuffingh non exiastent 2s was a free bid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i/ve tried that 15 times|pg||
nt|vinbtech: likely 3n interpreted as both majors !|pg||
mb|3N!|an|5431 max|nt|lestergold: 3s would be an overbid|pg||
nt|sybarra2: welcome Martim|pg||
nt|jaapfr: difficult word Mike but got what you meant about 1@D:)|pg||
nt|jtr: Trump lead best|pg||
nt|sharkey: Zmudzinski-Witel are placed 14th of 16 - shows the quality of this field|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: i never heard of that |pg||
nt|rnmalik: cards are very friendly for 4@H and 3NT for NS|pg||
nt|sharkey: some may not open N hand....|pg||
nt|jtr: I guess East has shown hs shape and West will be interested facing a single @d|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@H|pg||
nt|sharkey: 11 tricks in @H and 10 or 11 in NT|pg||
nt|jtr: although 3NT maybe also shows a minimum (seems to use up a lot of space)|pg||
mb|4C!|an|key card on club|nt|vinbtech: y a lucky break|pg||
nt|roswolf: the 3@H bid interfered nicely with the e/w auction|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 5@C vuln safe -1 is a good result but unbiddable|pg||
nt|jaapfr: although 3nt and 5@C fine too|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: dont want to lead from honors behind the big NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: and this is mps not right to push for dodgy games|pg||
nt|sybarra2: *Martin|pg||
nt|jaapfr: indeed 6@S DD and unbeatable DD|pg||
nt|sharkey: Yes - Zmud looking for slam?|pg||
mb|4H!|an|1|nt|rnmalik: true|pg||
nt|xenya: this rates to make -- particularly after W's overcall|pg||
nt|rnmalik: by X showed 5M and 4 major, is that it|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, i meant E"s overcall|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S was quite aggressive since it's likely to be only a 5-3 fit|pg||
nt|granguru: It has some merits...some|pg||
nt|jtr: 4@c KC probably|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: agree but cards are very friendly here|pg||
nt|athene: west judges that he has enough entries to his hand (trumps and @HK) that the defence can't kill them all before the clubs are up and running|pg||
nt|po-s: what about a small club?|pg||
nt|jtr: No, not Gerber!|pg||
nt|jaapfr: allergy:)?|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Key card for clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: giving a lead..f.i.|pg||
nt|granguru: opps may err Q-A position|pg||
nt|jtr: Why is he thinking?|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Of all the conventions which most top players dislike Gerber is No 1|pg||
nt|sharkey: Everyone's thinking today David...|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: it's teams|pg||
nt|jtr: He played rather quickly to trick one|pg||
nt|sharkey: Flannery  2?|pg||
nt|jtr: The play will be quicker than the bidding|pg||
nt|jtr: One hopes........|pg||
nt|jaapfr: claim 11 in tr 3?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Zia still has to lead...|pg||
nt|jtr: @s probably|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk4: What makes you think  TEAMS  is  MP?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: So it follows that Zia is pushing the boat out bidding 3@S with only three spades, but it has pushed EW to 4@H, where there should be four losers  |pg||
nt|jaapfr: not much chance to make this|pg||
nt|jtr: Mere mortals lead the @dJ:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and duck too K for 12 tr:)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|yo_yo: very lucky for North South|pg||
nt|jtr: Oh duck this even|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but N should know E short in @D|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|rnmalik: 1@H+1@D+1@C=3|pg||
nt|athene: yes, a small club from north might work a treat|pg||
nt|jtr: God knows what his plan is|pg||
nt|jtr: why no @d finesse there?|pg||
nt|jtr: Ah:)|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Shirley|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: oh u sure it bwa pairs last time i commentated yesterday|pg||
nt|lestergold: even tho it said imps are u sure Kath|pg||
nt|yo_yo: tomorrow is another day :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Mike, it's all in your e-mail|pg||
nt|sharkey: Take @CA and dump a @S?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|po-s: nine will force kng, hen all over|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might draw all the trumps and finesse clubs|pg||
nt|po-s: small club may result in trump drawing and club finesse!!|pg||
pc|h7|nt|rnmalik: but sequence have no knowledge|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|yo_yo: http://reykjavikbridgefestival.com/index.php?m=E1&id=M_TEAMS2010&iid=IF_OPENTEAMS2010&m=D3|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Sometimes I wish people would read what I write|pg||
nt|lestergold: in my dotage i forget what i read two days ago u know that roland|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sharkey: may make this...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm  for standings|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|vinbtech: but 3N should also make w/ 4 each in red suit and 1 black suit K at least|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So take notes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i like that when i get it right|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|nt|paulhac:  Hi everyone|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|vugraphzcx: N alert 3nt and say it is 5-5 major|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it looks as if the culprit is South  ( forgetting system)|pg||
nt|vinbtech: that explains it ! not 4-4 as i hazarded but 55|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but then Zia has been pushing the boat out for years, and it does not seem to have done huim any  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: ...him any harm|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|Gerben42: will just scratch home|pg||
nt|chick: just cashing out for 7 tricks|pg||
nt|yo_yo: rise with the king, hurray|pg||
nt|lestergold: at any rate i think that 2s is quite enough on the east hand tatcics at imps are not to bid dodgy games non vul|pg||
nt|mcarroll: It looks like the defence will grab 5 tricks, then declarer 2 or 3, then the defence another - and Declarer gets the rest - 1NT making|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ok 12 claim in tr 6|pg||
pc|c2|nt|xenya: thoughtful play, @D from hand|pg||
nt|xenya: Welcome to Paul Hackett|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi|pg||
nt|xenya: but the @SK was not so good |pg||
nt|jaapfr: now @HJ|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi |pg||
nt|athene: these hands are always tricky, both to play and defend|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, i think East will overfuff the 3rd @c and play trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The results of rounds in IMPs will be converted to VPs using a 60:0 scale. In calculating the datum score (= average score) on each board, about 50% (but not more) of the scores (a ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: quarter from the top and a quarter from the bottom) will not be taken into account|pg||
nt|jtr: 4th @c|pg||
nt|granguru: so how many are taken into account?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: of course the bidding and the layout lucky in some ways so ten tricks made|pg||
nt|rnmalik: someone surely did:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: lol|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sorry i have no link to running scores   who has?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nor me, sorry|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  just cleaned my glasses....N was an unpassed hand:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pass is, in theory, the right decision|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like it just promises a few values|pg||
pc|s8|nt|xenya: 2@S X would have been no fun...|pg||

nt|Gerben42: been in worse slams - 6@D |pg||
nt|mmmakela: here red slams|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i think partner would be surprised that you had 2 aces|pg||
mb|2D!|an|weak 6+M|nt|lestergold: yes it is max for the bid but it falls between stools its not really a 3S bid unless your methods can allow you to expres these values more accurately|pg||
nt|rnmalik: if that is a system then it is strange-one might get a hand in 200 deals where responder to 2NT has 5/5 majors|pg||
nt|xenya: oh he can of course|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt from zia i assume|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Hi everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: anyway that alt0222 doesnt work with my keyboard|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i agree Rashed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so the 1@D opening pays dividends|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i think 9 out of 4@H plays was down 1|pg||
nt|po-s: on the result page you can translate via Google (upper right corner)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 9 out of 10|pg||
nt|jtr: Nothing makes here|pg||
nt|jaapfr: will they beat 4@H (we must assume Zia will:)|pg||
nt|jtr: I think North will be on lead|pg||
nt|jtr: At this table anyway|pg||
nt|paulhac:  On a good day 4@H would make|pg||
nt|sharkey: W may bid 2 NT|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if played by E much more chance:)|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|Gerben42: 6@S has issues with the trump distribution|pg||
nt|athene: hi good afternoon|pg||
nt|rnmalik: hi and welcome|pg||
nt|athene: now 4@S looks likely although it's just about possible north might go for 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: there are certainly hands where 3nt is better but it's a swingy view to take|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: 6 spades needs guessing|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the youngsters tend to remember these things.  Are NS youngsters?|pg||
nt|jtr: 2@s|pg||
nt|jtr: surely|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jtr: oh|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: now simple 3nt+2 or so so coffee break|pg||
nt|jtr: Not that it will matter|pg||
mb|p|nt|vinbtech: one of them is surely NOT  he FORGOT ! lol|pg||
nt|jaapfr: will he pass???|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/y8rdsoc  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 6@H you cant bid - how would you find out about @HJ|pg||
nt|pelu: 1NT? 12-14 or 15-17?|pg||
nt|jtr: Nicely organised as it happens|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @S lead or @CA not easy|pg||
nt|jtr: @cA possible|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Whats the betting Zia leads a diamond|pg||
nt|sharkey: Why wud W want the lead into East's hand? Peeked?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Gerben42: 2@C could be either natural or strong (Gazilli)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: iceland you have a wonderful bridge site with great photos|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i bet that this makes|pg||
nt|jtr: Well done Paul:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mmmakela: so can they locate 4-4 dias|pg||
nt|roswolf: one tip about playing against zia was that if he didnt bid you should assume a bal hand of less than 7/8 hcp!! true on this hand|pg||
pc|d4|nt|yo_yo: but no names |pg||
nt|rnmalik: it also meand that with 3 cards of a major the contract would be 4 of that major|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Will EW talk NS out of their @H game?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 1@S could even go for 500|pg||
nt|roswolf: this also applies to all very aggressive players|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2 NT some kind of relay I presume|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|lestergold: trump lead or heart lead and trump switch will leave declarer a trick short here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i like to see the participants photos|pg||
nt|rnmalik: EW can make 9 tricks as the cards are placed|pg||
nt|pelu: 15-17 I see :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: an upgraded 15-17|pg||
nt|mdgraham: big view to pass though. |pg||
nt|jaapfr: y|pg||
nt|roswolf: can be sometimes a valuable inference in the play|pg||
pc|hA|nt|xenya: yes i know|pg||
nt|pelu: in on @CQ NS has to take the 4 @S-tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: sorry private|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @C play would determine the fate of the contract after this lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Operator, please delete the  h  in Kwiecien|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|rnmalik: hi Peter, Vladinir|pg||
nt|rnmalik: vladimir-sorry|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I suppose a pair of loonies might, but NS are definitely not that|pg||
nt|athene: Jxxx is a horrible lead, but all west's lead choices were horrible :)|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Zia will be delighted with the lead|pg||
nt|athene: i'm told it's actually against the rules to lead from Jxxx in Sweden|pg||
nt|rnmalik: interesting even if your P has bid the suit|pg||
nt|po-s: no, no, not when it is right|pg||
nt|athene: EW play 4th best leads i guess?|pg||
nt|athene: so east knows zia has five hearts|pg||
nt|paulhac:  East is thinking about whether his partner could have the K@S in which case dummy could be dead or whether he needs to win and switch|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: now 6 top losers|pg||
nt|athene: his problem is, if he takes the @HA right away and switches, that sets up the @HQ as an entry|pg||
pc|h4|nt|gracelin: Hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello Patrick|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hello Roland|pg||
nt|jaapfr: indeed 3nt theoretically chance to make here but who will bid that:)??|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, when south didn't open his 11 count|pg||
nt|po-s: Hi Patrick|pg||
nt|athene: it's normal for opener to prefer the suit contract with three, so east is assuming his partner has four spades|pg||
nt|athene: so it's not impossible he has the king|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3@D may deny @C control - thus W places the final contact|pg||
nt|sharkey: *contract|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|Gerben42: no slam interest opposite 2@H (minimum)|pg||
nt|vinbtech: 2D= what they call Ekrens in this part 44+ H+S 5-10 i think|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|yo_yo: looks like it but gib thinks differently|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: all lines now can not go wrong|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|chick: 2@H is an artificial bid showing minimum hand?|pg||
nt|lestergold: no often a singleton trump in dummy is the contract making trick!|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|yo_yo: set up @D?|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, South will open the bidding at some tables, I imagine|pg||
nt|gracelin: I will go to the other room where they are short of commentators. See you.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Bye|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|nt|jaapfr: not surprisingly ns do end in 4@H with no ot|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mdgraham: yes, at some tables South will open, and then North might steamroller on|pg||
nt|jaapfr: +1 can if @CA @C @C|pg||
nt|xenya: stopping in 4@H was a tiny problem perhaps -- the rest should be easy|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Difficult to see this going off as he has not got entries to misguess hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|jaapfr: lol|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Gudni,  can anyone tell us which photos are of the players here?|pg||
nt|pelu: decl need a lot of entries in dummy - will he top-play @Cs?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: then would make:)|pg||
nt|xenya: 16 pairs will play a complete round robin of 8-board matches. The format is IMPs converted to VPs using a 60:0 scale. This is Round 1 of 15. |pg||
pc|hK|pc|d9|nt|Gerben42: yes, if 2@C was gazilli then 2@H shows 6-7 without 6-card @S|pg||
nt|sharkey: E masy have to guess in @C after leading low to K and 9|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mmmakela: so once again N gave up too easily, could investigate well below 4H-level|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: anyone leading @C gives up a trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: not like this tho|pg||

pc|c7|pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|jaapfr: ok +1 auto now|pg||

nt|po-s: no entry to diamonds even if "found"|pg||
nt|athene: but when declarer runs a suit immediately, even good defenders will often give tricks away|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Good pairs result and probably an Imp|pg||
nt|jaapfr: missed why he did not play @D back (reasoning N)??|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: yes that too|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: 1 H from N?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: again a DD slam with all cards sitting nicely|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes my kind of grand:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 7nt unbeatable|pg||
nt|jaapfr: he does not want to spend a play of 1 card too many whilst claiming: i love it:)|pg||
nt|athene: true the diamonds weren't good anyway but zia didn't know that, is what i meant|pg||
nt|po-s: 4spades might even go down|pg||
nt|granguru: 2NT looks like LSGT..3@D cue positive so game is bid|pg||
nt|granguru: Long Suit Game Try|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Natural, 2+|pg||
nt|mdgraham: assuming normal views|pg||

mb|d|nt|Walddk4: EW do not play Polish Club|pg||

nt|vugraphzdp: running scores at http://www.slavacup.ru/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm|pg||
nt|jaapfr: to eliminate a @S win in dummy|pg||
mb|r|nt|mcarroll: N trying to make up for underbidding the last hand by going overboard on this one?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|pelu: Hachett: 1Nt (weak) and passed out - here EW wscaped|pg||
nt|granguru: would you defend 4@S with South hand if p had never bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: transfer to @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Zia going for the 3NT money if partner has a @s stop|pg||
nt|sharkey: trump lead will set it 2 i think|pg||
nt|granguru: Hot second|pg||
nt|sharkey: Zia thinking x?|pg||
nt|sharkey: or 4 NT?|pg||
nt|granguru: defending|pg||
nt|jtr: X probably|pg||
nt|jtr: But he will pass|pg||
nt|granguru: a x only if it not a pen one|pg||
nt|sharkey: He will not bid 5@C as kib suggests...|pg||
nt|granguru: agree|pg||
nt|granguru: 4NT is much better|pg||
nt|jtr: X or pass the only options|pg||
nt|granguru: showing more @Cs than @D|pg||
mb|1N|nt|yo_yo: great  gudni  :)|pg||
nt|xenya: seems strange W didn't open 1@D -- it does look like some version of Polish Club?|pg||
nt|jtr: He knows 5m is probably not making|pg||
mb|p|nt|vinbtech: on a D lead; has only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a nice simple sequence, WD  EW|pg||
nt|mdgraham: slight disparity of contracts....not sure what 1N is|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS need to get @S into play|pg||
nt|jtr: tempted to bid 2@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzcx: E/W are playing prec|pg||
nt|mmmakela: brb|pg||
nt|lestergold: game not an awful proposition here but doomed with both trump honours offside|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i feel uneasy with East's bidding thee|pg||
nt|yo_yo: there|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: 1NT not enough for game ( as i understand it) then he jumps to game |pg||
nt|athene: interesting the south in the other room didn't open|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a X by E was not too standard|pg||
nt|jtr: But he should know partner has 4@hs|pg||
pc|d6|nt|paulhac:  With the double this might well make|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe 1NT is M-m?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jaapfr: 2@S-5 no one had a X chance:)|pg||
nt|athene: it looks normal enough to me|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Though we can see this is an easy make declarer will be worried in case both spades and the Q@H are badly placed|pg||
nt|xenya: spectators in the other room had a rare chance to see a psychic transfer |pg||
nt|jaapfr: lovely 2@H bid but could end as disaster|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dQ|nt|yo_yo: seems a shame it's going down |pg||
nt|mdgraham: quasi-forcing, maybe|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: on natural methods there is an argument for an invite of 3S rather than a unilateral 4 but west ould probably decline its quite a good contract but unlucky|pg||
nt|jaapfr: anyway 3nt most likely to fail so 1nt+1 optimal imo|pg||
nt|jaapfr: funny thing of bridge S is fearing now to go down: even in 3nt|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We are in Moscow for the annual Slava Cup|pg||
nt|roswolf: but he will be happy soon|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Good 7@D|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mcarroll: Communications are not very fluid for declarer, and the defence will try not to help him, but may be forced to |pg||
nt|mcarroll: S should probably have ducked, even though it was only postponing the problem. what to lead now?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: (opening looks normal, i mean, not passing :) )|pg||
nt|dburn: not really|pg||
pc|s8|nt|paulhac:  Some may consider it too good for a weak 2 at the vul but would be reluctant to open 1|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.slavacup.ru/  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|jtr: Seems no rush though|pg||
nt|dburn: he did not want West to cash that @dJ - he would have made the contract if West had not done so|pg||
nt|jaapfr: defense seems appropiate until now|pg||
nt|dburn: this defence is fine - not cashing the diamond would have let the contract through|pg||
pc|hT|nt|rnmalik: good lead and -1 I think|pg||
nt|granguru: A trump lead would have been better|pg||
nt|granguru: @S of course now|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mcarroll: On board 2 in the Open NS had no difficulty bidding the @H game which was played in 1NT here generating the first significant swing|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y true specs @HT is needed not to be trown in in E to get it down|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vinbtech: y no SJ coming down in 2|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sharkey: W forced to take @H finesse to have a chance|pg||
pc|h3|nt|xenya: hardly if you play a weak NT|pg||
nt|jaapfr: psyches in general do generate tops or bottoms but mostly frustrated partners:)|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mcarroll: the defence will have to get a @D and will then take the @HA to defeat this contract|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, is that true?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jtr: I wonder if a @d would have worked|pg||
nt|jtr: At trick 3|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: 11 chunky points and an outside doubleton and also partner has opened second position at unfavourable which means his opening should be robust rather than  light|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Much too good in my style|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|roswolf: and now a show up squeeze|pg||
nt|jtr: Say he switches to a @s|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sA|mc|6|nt|yo_yo: well North didnt have to cash the @C|pg||
nt|lestergold: vul games need to b bid on a sniff at imps so I wouldnt be too harsh about East's bid|pg||
nt|athene: splitting the @HQJx isn't likely to gain |pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4x @C|pg||
nt|jtr: How?|pg||
pg||

mb|3C!|nt|mdgraham: Just got the CCs from Ecats - looks like EW play a system called the Baltic Club|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|xenya: 3@C is a transfer to @Ds|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard for E to continue from here |pg||
mb|3H!|nt|xenya: tough, yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  3@h is the all purpose bid but looking at k@h you aren't expecting pd to bid 3N|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|andyv:  now 3N would probably show one stopper maximum|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He should have|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can only be made with West as declarer|pg||
nt|andyv:  why?|pg||
nt|andyv:  aren't there 10 tricks?|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|andyv:  S can only lead once|pg||
nt|andyv:  and once more we go flying off|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Looks that way, yes|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@d looks forcing|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but doesn't lead to 3NT....|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  still time for 4N:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: obviously not forcing :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  or there will be a discussion afterwards|pg||
pc|dA|nt|xenya: anyway EW will get a plus here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as a general point, the thing is: does 3@H ask for a quasi-stopper (like Qxx) or a full stopper?|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't mind the 3@s bid by W as long as E follows up with 3N to show one stopper.... but one of them has to step up and bid it.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mdgraham: Kx is dubious as a full stopper (sort of) as there are no hold-up possibilities|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|h6|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h9|pg||
nt|andyv:  right... that's why the cue first then 3N... otherwise, just bid 3N to show the suit well stopped|pg||
mc|11|nt|mdgraham: but you do feel that East might have tried 3NT over 3@S|pg||
pg||

nt|vugraphzcx: 5th photo 2 man on the left are the magnusson and eliasson in this order magnusson is W|pg||
nt|mcarroll: An 13 imps away as 3NT was made in the Open|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 5@C down too|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes you do it to gain a tempo, so that declarer can't take the deep finesse and force the ace|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I thought T@D on Ace was to switch to @S|pg||
nt|sharkey: dont think so - N wud get a @C ruff with @S9|pg||
nt|jtr: Miracle position though|pg||
nt|sharkey: kib suggested @DQ|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: part score hand for E/W best played in spades|pg||
nt|yo_yo: star pairs or open pairs ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: just to make it interesting for us |pg||
nt|dburn: not sure why Welland bypassed spades - Zia would pass 1NT also with a 4=5=2=2 minimum|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Easy 3NT with diamonds breaking|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not sure why declarer in the other room did not take his 10 top tricks|pg||
nt|rnmalik: in fact has 10 tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: horror result in the other room for n/s|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: can he scrape by making 1?|pg||
nt|dburn: unless... no, surely they can't be playing F***ry|pg||
nt|mdgraham: possible|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y with solid 4@S|pg||
nt|sharkey: Welland didnt open with 11 and stiff - did with 10....|pg||
pc|h4|nt|paulhac:  ambitious 6@S but could have worked on a different layout|pg||
nt|jaapfr: due to x@C in E 6@S down pity whilst fine contract|pg||
nt|xenya: the score on the screen only shows a comparison between 2 tables, actually there are 8 tables in play|pg||
nt|athene: 6-2 spade fit played in 3nt a moment ago|pg||
nt|athene: now a 4-4 spade fit played in 3nt|pg||
nt|sharkey: Yes - 3 NT makes - how do you bid after Opps open 1 NT?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|dburn: spades? why not diamonds?|pg||
nt|dburn: at any rate, I am off to do the Junior Camrose - have fun|pg||
nt|jaapfr: kib suggests 4@S kungfu contract here:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: bye David|pg||

pc|hT|nt|po-s: bye David |pg||
nt|jaapfr: bye|pg||
nt|roswolf: makes me ashamed to be english:(|pg||
nt|jaapfr: confusing Vlad:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: anyway the 2@S bid is a clear warning which was not there in OR|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Ace less may pass|pg||
nt|xenya: not really Jaap -- there are 16 pairs in competition and the format is IMPs converted to VPs on a datum basis|pg||
nt|jaapfr: aha if trump a @C with @SQ all is well|pg||
nt|paulhac:  I agree with the kitbitzers that you can make 6@S  but not so obvious to do so on a trump lead|pg||
nt|paulhac:  6@S could be called unlucky |pg||
nt|jtr: Rebid problems and position mattered to him|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|athene: yes, a lot of work to do with only a 4-4 fit, despite having no losers|pg||
nt|granguru: other was the other way around|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mmmakela: 5 dias can be made if accident but can go down too|pg||
nt|pelu: he played 4x1H first - and disc a @D|pg||
nt|rnmalik: could bid and make 6@D also|pg||
nt|xenya: NS can make 6@D here -- but that certainly looks far-fetched|pg||
nt|jaapfr: in OR there was no clue (here there is : odd dristibution|pg||
nt|jtr: Looks like 4@s could go down|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lestergold: hm 2N looks optimistic 16 counts very difficult to deal with opposite wide ranginmg 1 respon ses|pg||

pc|sA|nt|yo_yo: i can see East's character starting to emerge |pg||
nt|yo_yo: he's a bit of a gambler|pg||
nt|lestergold: diamodns reasonable 6/2 fit|pg||
nt|roswolf: 12/13 imps on a coffee hand|pg||
nt|athene: even assuming you play it the right way round|pg||
nt|po-s: not such a lot if the red suits - or one of them behaved|pg||
nt|granguru: it is like getting involved with a woman when single and when married...risks are different|pg||
nt|jtr: Forrester delivered an unwanted @d ruff  Not easy though|pg||
nt|jtr: lol|pg||
nt|sharkey: That's one way of putting on a Sunday morning John :)|pg||
nt|paulhac:  The 1Nt opener has kept e/w out of game|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|yo_yo: thanks   |pg||
nt|jaapfr: and do you  want to be there normally?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|paulhac:  The 2@S bid may make it easier |pg||
nt|sharkey: West opened in OR - still cudnt get there|pg||
pc|sK|nt|yo_yo: hi David  |pg||
nt|yo_yo: hope some of your "laws" come up|pg||
nt|vinbtech: a loser in each suit; he has to avoid 1 of them at least|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the link above shows Magnusson and elisasson   folks|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3 NT appears to be the optimal strain - EW cannot attack any suit|pg||
pc|d2|nt|yo_yo: and david stevenson from UK|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2+2+3+2|pg||
nt|sharkey: Zhao-Fu are one of the top pairs in the world|pg||
nt|sharkey: ...and they're leading this contest; Zia-Welland are placed third|pg||
nt|jtr: If they dont play another card i guess they win by default|pg||
nt|sharkey: zzzzzz|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|chick: that makes it cashout time|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder if 2@S in the other room was artificial? so-card "third suit forcing"|pg||
nt|athene: looks a bit weird after a 2 over 1|pg||
nt|jtr: It would be interesting to know what he is thinking about  I cant really tell|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: so-called|pg||
pc|d8|nt|yo_yo: I dont know the lady |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jaapfr: @DJ is so vitally important but can W ever know that?|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|rnmalik: the observation is after seeing all 52 cards|pg||
nt|rnmalik: would you lead a @D|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Certainly makeable on a non diamond lead|pg||
nt|athene: east thinking about 6n? but that can't be making if the double is really lightner for diamonds, since the diamonds aren't going to be a trick source|pg||
nt|athene: and there's no way that north would double with something like @SQJ109 and nothing else :)|pg||
nt|po-s: and if it is for hearts it is ok for him|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jaapfr: ok bets on: make or down?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: me down|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lestergold: they usually ome up when David is not here|pg||
nt|vinbtech: didnt avoid H loser; letssee what follows|pg||
nt|rnmalik: make|pg||
nt|rnmalik: cannot be @H|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jaapfr: imo the 3@H bid in OR useless bid|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Surely after the X a diamond stands out|pg||
nt|jtr: Players always think the longest when there is no defence|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Looking at the 2 hands if you know the points are in North Yes|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like working on @s  better but not naturaly given 8 card @H fit |pg||
nt|rnmalik: very unlucky|pg||
pc|h2|nt|yo_yo: what think of the opening lead?|pg||
nt|xenya: my money is on make|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Make|pg||
pc|h6|nt|chick: will take 11 when the @HQ falls|pg||
nt|yo_yo: sort of a gambler's lead?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lestergold: 2S was ok but if bidding went to 3 level it sure has to be diamonds|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Some kibs asking why no Stayman by Welland with 4-4 in the majors. Search me is all I can say|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He felt like bidding 3NT is my guess|pg||
nt|jaapfr: :)|pg||

mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|andyv:  how do you treat the S hand?|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@c now or 3N or what?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@C|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: which, if game forcing, is only a slight overbid |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  she took your advise, Mike:)|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@C shows a stronger hand for me|pg||
nt|andyv:  it does for me too|pg||
pc|d3|nt|andyv:  i just close my eyes and bid 3N|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think it's unreasonable to force to game with 5-5|pg||
nt|andyv:  and if we go down simply tell partner to guess better next time.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: the club suit is very good|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as it happens, North has South's void well covered|pg||
nt|andyv:  but, do you want to be in 5@c?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|xenya: but after 3N by N all looks well for NS|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|cJ|pc|c7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I disagree, more important to look for the best *game*|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Slams are rare, games are not|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|nt|mdgraham: hands like the South one are a bit difficult facing a 15-17 NT. Only limited room available below 3NT, and a lot to describe|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|c8|nt|andyv:  true...either bid can work very well|pg||
nt|andyv:  of course, pd always opens a 2-4-5-2 NT when you have these hands|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If you play Garozzo's NT system, South could show an invitational hand with 5-5 in clubs and hearts. The ideal hand for it|pg||

nt|jtr: 1NT again|pg||
mb|1N|nt|yo_yo: but lots do open |pg||
nt|jaapfr: now to bid 4@H :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: May be W shud - pd's 3@D VUL must be a good hand - if not suicidal vs Pd pass opening|pg||
nt|jtr: I think they play 14-16|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: pass out ? maybe|pg||
nt|jaapfr: for yours:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: in weekend no non alcoholics|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no X makes, no @D lead makes:)|pg||
nt|solex33: maybe - quite "unlucky" ? :-)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mcarroll: The Open seem to be pursuing the same line|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
nt|paulhac:  At least South has to find a ruff when the spades are 3-2|pg||
nt|po-s: all 3-2 without a direct ruff|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@H has a play here?|pg||
nt|sharkey: S remained silent in OR|pg||
nt|jtr: Nice defence next door|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: i would open the south hand though|pg||
nt|athene: West has a bit of a problem here|pg||
nt|jtr: North wants to bid something|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@H some kind of good @S raise - viw S has shown @H|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jaapfr: most E will pass after1@S and some mite bid 1nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: opposite a passed pard 2@H is bold|pg||
nt|sharkey: *view|pg||
nt|jaapfr: where this will end 3nt?|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulhac:  Is that not over 60% PO|pg||
nt|athene: double is fine as long as partner isn't so ill-mannered as to bid diamonds|pg||
nt|po-s: I would think more than 60|pg||
nt|dburn: closer to 65%, but a contract that will fail one time in three is not "very unlucky" to do so - unless you're Polish, of course|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|po-s: new form of Polish club?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: now 4@H|pg||
nt|jtr: Zia may think Welland has @hs|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: 2NT now?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 5@C nicer|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lestergold: North knows his customer|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Support double from N showing 3@Ss?|pg||
nt|pelu: with @CJ by NS 6@C would be a nice slam|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2NT balanced and old-fashioned game-forcing. No major|pg||
nt|jaapfr: my praying did help for yours:)|pg||
nt|athene: we need an adjective slightly less emphatic than "very" but more so than "mildly"|pg||
nt|sharkey: E will bid 3@S I think - showing 6 card suit|pg||
nt|jtr: 3@d did the trick anyway|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - I think Zia's initial Dbl afforded that|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: have time to ruff some @D here  should not be all bad |pg||
nt|roswolf: slam try - i would play that as a splinter maybe a fit jump type bid!?|pg||
nt|athene: how about "somewhat"|pg||
nt|po-s: I´m for whoever tries a slam|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
nt|athene: 6@S was somewhat unlucky|pg||
nt|sharkey: N have shown 1-3-4-5 I think|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi all gm|pg||
nt|sharkey: Gd morning Jaap|pg||
nt|jtr: I think West devalued his hand by only bidding 2@h and is now wondering|pg||
nt|jtr: Hoi Jaap|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi carl and is ivan here?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi David|pg||
nt|sharkey: Whats W to do - two soft Q?|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe he thinks partner has a @d single|pg||
nt|jaapfr: Ivan was our operator yesterday in this CR and made 0 misclicks in all sessions:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: As long as you take the right view in Major suits 3 NT no problem...|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well third in hand yes but vul is unvafourable some might be more conservative|pg||
nt|xenya: the score on the screen doesn't mean much -- it's only a comparison between 2 tables, but there are 8 tables in play|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 13-10 makes match close again|pg||
nt|rnmalik: slightly unlucky|pg||
nt|po-s: go for very - not extremely or utterly|pg||
nt|solex33: slightly very unlucky|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mmmakela: is that 1 @C 15+ precicion or upgrade|pg||
nt|vugraphzcx: prec|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 15+? or 16+? |pg||
nt|vugraphzcx: will ask after this board?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: ok ty|pg||
nt|rnmalik: interesting no 1@H-1@S|pg||
nt|po-s: very courageous 2H btw|pg||
nt|jtr: South engineered a trump promotion at the other table|pg||
nt|sharkey: or get a @D lead...|pg||
pc|h2|nt|chick: generally you need about 29 HCP to play 3N with a 5-5-2-1 facing a 1-2-5-5 (not quite the case here), but they do have 27|pg||
nt|mcarroll: If the defence do not lead trumps a @C @D crossruff will produce lots of tricks|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|dburn: now, making a takeout double of 2@s and hearing partner want to play in clubs and not diamonds - that's more than somewhat lucky|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|yo_yo: one would expect 1@S response, agree|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jtr: Zia is on his way to doing the same|pg||
pc|c5|nt|yo_yo: i would be afraid of bidding just 1NT with the north hand however|pg||
nt|sybarra: and now?|pg||
nt|pelu: even @C 10 would do|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: i guess if east had gone for diamonds, west was planning just to pass and hope for the best|pg||
nt|sharkey: East was destined to lead a red card which wud make it easier for declarer|pg||
nt|jaapfr: still enough to do|pg||
nt|sharkey: Communications may be a problem if W ducks..|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|mcarroll: @C @H crossruff|pg||
nt|pelu: give N@C8 and intrafiness could bring home a slam|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @C suit not very favourable|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm|pg||
nt|jaapfr: this is going very wrong for ew|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one hears the sound of falling wheels |pg||
nt|jaapfr: DD an easy board but SD a puzzle for all there|pg||
pc|d7|nt|chick: so I predict they will make this|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so they did well|pg||
nt|dburn: not really - why bid a bad suit with a good hand?|pg||
nt|po-s: what do they do with the "normal" 18-19 NT?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|rnmalik: agreed |pg||
nt|jaapfr: see beauty defense OR why 6@S went down in tr 2|pg||
nt|jtr: Here the distribution is marked for declarer|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|xenya: well-judged by Welland?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you suspect that 5@D wasn't what East wanted to hear |pg||
nt|jaapfr: likely no X by N to encourage @H lead by pd|pg||
nt|po-s: so they never know if they have a major and wk NT|pg||
nt|jaapfr: X of 5@D i meant|pg||
nt|mdgraham: auction not over yet....|pg||
nt|po-s: couldn´t West have CA and DK?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: after an 18-19 1nt by pd if he not pass now he has to go too............................:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, 1NT can't be 18-19, that's for sure|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but it's all a bit mysterious|pg||
nt|po-s: it used to show 18, and 1M was bid with wk NT and 3+card suit|pg||
nt|jaapfr: also for them i am sure|pg||
nt|po-s: but these guys don´t play regular Polish|pg||
nt|po-s: not his style at all|pg||
nt|jaapfr: nv-v i would bid 2@H too|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: told 1NT is a one-round force, called the Dymanic NT  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: sorry, Dynamic|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|paulhac:  In the other room West bid spades|pg||
nt|jaapfr: still i think he will make it|pg||
nt|jtr: If he can manouvre things|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @HA and @C|pg||
nt|jtr: A sort of dummy reversal makes it|pg||
nt|jtr: Nothing the defence can do but declarer does not know that|pg||
pc|h6|nt|pelu: a lot of spec ask me a lot of Q - please update your profil with names !!!!!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|rnmalik: same here and same answer|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I think at pairs 3NT was a better contract as played in OR|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@S puppet to 2NT|pg||
nt|jaapfr: dynamite 1nt?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|dburn: if we need to play in spades, partner can bid them|pg||
nt|xenya: well they sniffed at slam here|pg||
nt|athene: and if east bid diamonds and south doubled, he could reconsider (fake an urgent phone call perhaps)|pg||
nt|po-s: "quite" might be the right one in both cases|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i think 90% would bid 1@S   |pg||
pc|d8|nt|lestergold: defnce have done well to hold it|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mdgraham: still, all will be forgiven if East makes this|pg||
nt|sharkey: Zia shud have switched to @S trick 2|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s5|pg||
nt|jtr: Wouldnt that make life easier?|pg||
nt|jtr: Cheap finesse|pg||

pc|s6|pc|sA|nt|mcarroll: and 8 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: and this is imps, not mps|pg||

nt|Walddk4: 16 pairs taking part, by invitation only|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed, Paul|pg||
nt|athene: west needs to write "negative free bids" on his card quickly|pg||
nt|athene: so he can bid 2@S|pg||
nt|dburn: good time to have a non-forcing 2@s available|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@S makes, on the layout|pg||
nt|athene: for any specs who haven't met the term, "negative free bids" means after an overcall, as here, responder's new suit is non-forcing|pg||
nt|dburn: but if North bids 5@d, East will not be certain how to proceed|pg||
nt|athene: with a "real" 2@S bid he doubles first then bids spades|pg||
nt|athene: these methods are very popular in poland - not sure why, especially - i don't think they mesh especially well with the rest of Polish Club - just tradition, perhaps|pg||
nt|jaapfr: even 4@H doomed here|pg||
nt|sharkey: @S lead needed to beat 4@H|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Another hand where you need the spade ruff|pg||

nt|jtr: Switch is more practicable|pg||
mb|1N!|an|club|nt|roswolf: very solid result in the other room for n/s maybe i can raise the flag again|pg||
mb|3D|nt|Walddk4: The scores on the board make little sense, and here is why ...|pg||
nt|pelu: aggresiv 1@S by Hachett in East|pg||
nt|sharkey: Not sure - E gets to ruff one @C and can get home on low @H?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sorry reply to spec saying declarer a bad player whilst not claiming 10 tr previous board|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vinbtech: 1C= precision or some some such ART club|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzcx: hehe you can say Gudni|pg||
nt|mcarroll: N managed to buy the contract on previous board in 1@S so a likely 5 imp swing|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The results of rounds in IMPs will be converted to VPs using a 60:0 scale. In calculating the datum score (= average score) on each board, about 50% (but not more) of the scores (a ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: quarter from the top and a quarter from the bottom) will not be taken into account|pg||
nt|dburn: this, though, is the wrong tempo - now if North bids 5@d East-West will double him|pg||
nt|jtr: @d overtaken and @s|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @DK @DA overtake @SA @SK x@S for -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: i doubt you will win here|pg||
nt|paulhac:  But it is cheaper than 4@S|pg||
mb|d|nt|yo_yo: that's quite a hunky 2@C overcall|pg||
nt|yo_yo: chunky|pg||
nt|dburn: well, at least they avoided the 3-3 diamond fit, but...|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3nt+2 most likely|pg||
nt|jaapfr: mb +1|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: http://www.slavacup.ru/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@S has a vey good chance to be made here|pg||
nt|dburn: and if he doesn't, then East-West will pick up a pretty good result|pg||
nt|po-s: long ago we met a Polish pair in the European, and my partner asked abt a "free" bid - and the opponent answered "unlimited" - It turned out he meant downwards|pg||
nt|athene: hahahaha|pg||
nt|athene: that's a good one :) i must remember that|pg||
nt|rnmalik: great|pg||
nt|athene: such a useful interpretation - for example "i have unlimited faith in teammates not to screw up our good set"|pg||
nt|jtr: 'garbage' stayman?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: previous board the problem was that W was before 5@H not aware of the 4514 at least not the @D misfit imo|pg||
nt|jaapfr: W sweating now:)|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Even if he does not overtake what else can west switch to?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: true too|pg||
nt|sharkey: thinking 5@D....|pg||

nt|mdgraham: EW use Precison 2@C opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: It looks like 3H was a splinter...|pg||

nt|mdgraham: they have got this played by West - so it might make|pg||
nt|po-s: interesting lead - if we assume that opps do´t have 44 in a major then West must have 4+ hearts but may only have 3 spades|pg||
nt|rnmalik: nice one still enjoying:)|pg||

pc|c8|pg||
nt|mcarroll: W should have put in the @C ten, allowing partner the option of overtaking to give a @D ruff|pg||

nt|jaapfr: only 3@H to lose not 1@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: suspect North will play @HA and a low one|pg||
nt|po-s: please!!! normally it is a small heart, and normally opponents will get in somewhere and can cash the hearts - and if East´s high cards are al elsewhere 5D will make|pg||

nt|dburn: and the way things have gone, 3@h will make anyway|pg||
nt|dburn: so I guess he should have bid it|pg||
nt|jaapfr: or opps max 3@H and 1@C so unbeatable it was even DD|pg||
nt|mdgraham: my word|pg||

nt|chick: partscores best possible here :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Welland was not sure of single @S with P|pg||
nt|athene: quite hard for north to bid at the 5-level with no shortage and a lot of defence|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 4@H might depend on getting clubs right|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3@D makes as well|pg||
nt|athene: zia had the stiff spade but he had only five diamonds - not easy at all|pg||
nt|solex33: 3 rounds of h defeats 5 dia. regardless the pos of k of c|pg||

mb|1N!|an|semi-F|nt|mmmakela: in precision that used to be a club opening in the old days|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i bet east will go to game|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if @HA x@H x@S then it could down?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: interesting choice for East|pg||
nt|dburn: here is a slightly somewhat quite very lucky slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: it was quite nice for declarer when South tackled trumps|pg||
nt|vinbtech: y the result justified 3H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If you subscribe to the Principle of Restricted Choice, you will get it right|pg||
nt|rnmalik: lets see |pg||
nt|athene: it all depends what 4@H promises - i suppose the usual rule "don't pre-empt over a pre-empt" applies here, so 4@H is a real hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry kibs - I don't speak Italian or Turkish....|pg||
nt|jaapfr: scowl back for links specs pls|pg||
mb|2C|nt|yo_yo: a fit jump?|pg||
nt|vinbtech: a fit jump more likely |pg||
nt|rnmalik: very good hans for 5@D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@S is reasonable, but what about 5@S? Would that be the same as a 5@S opening  bid?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sorry for confusion i referred to x@H lead as unbeatable but with @HA x@H and @S switch it was DD down|pg||
nt|jaapfr: team 1 will gain here|pg||

mb|p|nt|chick: "precision" has so many variations that its very name is a contradiction :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Tony Forrester did in the other room with no opponent bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_restricted_choice_(bridge)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's even more evident here where Kwiecien has shown a two-suiter by opening 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: http://www.slavacup.ru/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR the @D-lead gave Forrester a help to "see" 2 x singleton by West - with singleton @H (and no bid) u would not play the @Cs right|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 6@S pls|pg||
nt|athene: maybe not quite as real as 3@S would be, but still real-ish|pg||
nt|dburn: well, 3@s would be bid on most "real hands" - 4@h is something like a decent limit raise|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i can help whilst West speaksDutch fluently:)|pg||

nt|xenya: but is likely to fail|pg||
nt|paulhac:  6 @C Needs a lot of work|pg||
nt|jaapfr: is it so slow today? yesterday fast enough|pg||
nt|jtr: Ah|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: There's no Four-and-a-half spades card in the bidding box |pg||
nt|jtr: E/W are not the quickest|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdp: you can find current results here: http://www.slavacup.ru/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I bet Zia will get it right too if 4@H is the final destination|pg||
nt|jaapfr: vwd 5@S bid|pg||
nt|dburn: they might get to seven at this rate|pg||
nt|athene: certainly interesting that zia bids 5@C instead of 4@S - i wonder if it's a "help-suit slam try" rather than a normal control-bid|pg||
nt|dburn: that is how Zia prefers to play, certainly|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Roy trying to evaluate his Q@C|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @D finesse working can't pitch the 5th@C|pg||
nt|dburn: but for 6@c he ought to have rather better clubs - if I were Welland I would be giving serious thought to bidding seven|pg||
nt|po-s: x,Axxxx,Ax,AKJxx|pg||
nt|athene: zia needs a lot opposite for seven - @HKQ, @SA, @CK and more - that would be a 3@S bid not a 4@H bid surely|pg||
nt|dburn: still, even @sNone @hAJxxx @dAxx @cAKJxx is not a grand slam, so he may settle for six|pg||
nt|athene: (i mean zia doesn't need the @SA but he knows his partner has it, so that just means he hasn't got something else that *is* needed)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jaapfr: a @H lead against 6@C would be helpful:) lol|pg||
nt|sharkey: shud be off 1|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Certainly  a better spot than 4@S|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3nt much better than 4@S imo|pg||
nt|sharkey: Superior contract this time - the fillers making the difference|pg||
nt|jtr: @c guess needed But he needs the entry to get it right|pg||
nt|sharkey: Problem if he plays on @S suit vs @C suit?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|yo_yo: 2 10s, East will go |pg||
nt|po-s: dynamic 5S?|pg||
nt|kippari: joo,ti oli se tohon jo merkittynä muistin vain väärin|pg||
nt|jaapfr: even 2nt-1 wins 10 but 3nt ???? -2 so 3 imps lost|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 10=0 imps|pg||
nt|po-s: no heart lead..|pg||
pc|d6|nt|yo_yo: West i mean|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Same contract in Open|pg||
nt|jaapfr: dynamite?|pg||
nt|xenya: they are on their way there|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|mmmakela: E promising clubs with dbl so maybe 3 nt by south was the right bid, n must have some stuff in majors and often a 4th dia|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ruff and finesse @D?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: plausible reasoning and a finesse involved|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Could  But even if Zia had AKxxxx@C and AD he is still a trick short|pg||
nt|athene: 6@D temporising saying "i can't bid seven but i don't want to shut up shop" - that has to mean good trumps i suppose|pg||
nt|athene: it can't be a control as he bid 5@S over 5@C|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mmmakela: *6th dia|pg||
nt|jaapfr: all other leads 6@C probably down|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Makes on a coss ruff but is that really the right line?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|pelu: here he know @S+@D by West|pg||
nt|jaapfr: then 1 imp the 2nt joke:)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jtr: 4 tricks vs 3|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|h2|nt|po-s: I think Zia had a fortunate escape here|pg||
pc|h4|nt|yo_yo: it takes a lot of courage to pull partner's double with the South hand|pg||
nt|rnmalik: made easy|pg||
nt|rnmalik: slightly lucky escape:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Anybody 3@S with East's hand?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jaapfr: but is the non cross ruff an attractive alternative (i doubt that)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: problmaking now|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|jtr: Fu thought about it|pg||
nt|jaapfr: no entry left if ever for long @D in E|pg||
nt|sharkey: Playing @H first took out East's entry|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry Jaap|pg||
nt|yusufb: evet|pg||
nt|jtr: Well,they can endplay dummy|pg||
nt|jaapfr: Zia will solve that D:)|pg||
nt|dburn: even Zia is not allowed to solve declarer's problems when he is dummy|pg||
nt|dburn: it is true that he usually has the solution afterwards, but for the moment he needs to keep it to himself|pg||
nt|jtr: West indicated @ss with the @h4|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sharkey: E got an opportunity to bid 1S OR - Welland's 1 NT overcall prevented that|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i suppose 2@S meant inviting and balanced|pg||
nt|sharkey: Assume showing suit and good hand Jaap?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: do not ask me:)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|po-s: so if South is in after 4 spades - no he isn´t|pg||
nt|solex33: true. zia needs a lot for 7-  6 c prob means: "did u pd- by chance- forgot to bid 3s ? "|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mmmakela: ok forget all I wrote|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ask David|pg||
nt|sharkey: ok - since we're on the assuming track....|pg||

nt|chick: hehe|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I would after 1@D opening|pg||
pc|c9|nt|xenya: regardless of the outcome, it's a fine effort by EW |pg||
nt|jtr: I guess they play 2NT as minor(s) and dont want to bid 2@c without a major|pg||
nt|jaapfr: any spec KNOW what 2@S meant?|pg||
nt|jtr: ergo 2@s invite with no major|pg||
nt|dburn: depends to an extent on what 1@c meant|pg||
nt|jtr: now dummy could get squeezed|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|jaapfr: we did see in the Zia room today a lot of fireworks so ill be this 6@C|pg||
nt|jaapfr: now only rite play in @C and home|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|jaapfr: votes specs pls make or down???|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 2-4|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@s could be "either invitational in notrump or a sign-off in clubs", if the full system is on|pg||
nt|dburn: poor Zia - about to get endplayed and squeezed, and he is only the dummy|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, Welland is left with no option now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i fail to see any problem for declarer as long as he plays @CK with E|pg||
nt|po-s: of course he has an option - he can play either club from his hand - and still make|pg||
nt|jtr: Say it is Kxx though?|pg||
nt|jtr: West just puts dummy in|pg||
nt|po-s: yes?|pg||
nt|jtr: If he can of course|pg||
nt|po-s: he cashes his clubs|pg||
nt|jtr: H9@s and they effectively cannot|pg||
nt|jtr: who does?|pg||
nt|po-s: assuming he plays the wrong club from hand, gets blocked but cashes the 3rd club then a spade?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: can anyone tell W it makes no difference:) Ivan:)??|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jaapfr: D 5 specs KNOW you were rite:)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk4: If @D8 is to believed to be an "honest" card, Jagniewski has shown an odd number of diamonds. They play upside-down count|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Rest assured that Zia will have noticed|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jaapfr: 5-12|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Maybe a heart finesse to get rid of the spade is a possible line|pg||

nt|paulhac:  Not so good PO if a club had been returned and teh Q played he would have gone down|pg||

nt|paulhac:  But I agree with you in principle|pg||
pc|s7|pg||

nt|roswolf: e/w in the other room rightsided this contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: live results|pg||
nt|po-s: hard to beat that result from closed|pg||
nt|rnmalik: when I made that observation of -1, he had ruffed a @D with 10@C|pg||
nt|jtr: Even so, the @cQ gives him a maximum and the contract makes anyway|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|mdgraham: yes, 9 imps on board 1 when NS sacrificed in 5@Dx|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes north bid his weaker suit|pg||
nt|po-s: good start|pg||
nt|paulhac:  That helps|pg||
nt|po-s: just bid 6?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: as last session as well the long thinkers did not gain 1 imp with he long thinking    agree D?|pg||
mb|d|nt|mmmakela: that kind of 3-way 2@C  opening isn't allowed in many countries because itdoesn't include an anchor suit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks Vladimir|pg||
nt|po-s: or are they barred from having an ace|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y|pg||
nt|sharkey: ouch - getting too high now|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: some pairs play a special sort of blackwood after a pre-empt|pg||
nt|athene: since partner is known to have nothing|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and Carl?\|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: The Open room started 3 boards behind us and has now caught up and is even ahead. They play this hand in 2@S|pg||
nt|athene: 4@D says "what flavour of nothing do you have here partner?"|pg||
nt|granguru: EW can make 2@C|pg||
nt|sharkey: Yes - much easier with all hands in view - also very difficult to defend |pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe he played too quickly?:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: previous hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 2@D =?|pg||
nt|po-s: how much is 4D RD 12 or 13 tricks?|pg||
nt|sharkey: lol|pg||
nt|granguru: only a @C lead can beat|pg||
nt|jtr: Zia will double this|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: looks like off 1...|pg||
pc|h2|nt|pelu: see u all later - have to go shoping :(|pg||
nt|petergill: Results are at http://www.slavacup.ru/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm|pg||
nt|jtr: Nope it is getting worse|pg||
nt|jtr: Heading towards 2@s|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@D first I think|pg||
nt|jtr: well 4@s sort of|pg||
nt|granguru: which can also be made|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3@H must be weak invite i think|pg||
pc|h3|nt|yo_yo: the bad break puts paid to this one |pg||
nt|lestergold: Please forgive me Kath but I have devlope4d a headache to a point where I cannot really continue this session- the headache not caused by any of the events here ofr course!! so i ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: must leave you all sorry|pg||
nt|lestergold: bye for now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: oh dear, take some aspirin Mike|pg||
nt|vugraphzcx: yes as far as I know|pg||
nt|po-s: let us see if West follows with the ten|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rnmalik: now it is clear after @H and @S bids and instead of DBL N could bid 4NT with that hand|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Only a 5 imp swing I miscounted the undertricks in the Open|pg||
nt|jaapfr: my quess team 2 to win this with 1 imp:)|pg||
nt|athene: interesting double|pg||
nt|solex33: lead directing if pd has A of dia|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not really|pg||
nt|dburn: made? the defenders can cash the first six tricks at least|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: bye and quick recovery |pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5 matches of 8 boards today, 6 tomorrow and 4 on Monday. I believe the upcoming Monday is a public holiday in Russia. Maybe Vladimir can confirm|pg||
nt|xenya: actually the holiday is on 23rd, but Monday is a non- working day too|pg||
nt|xenya: we will be back shortly -- 20or 30 minutes i guess|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Non-working non-holiday, I like those :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: big loss here|pg||
nt|po-s: 2D was a clever bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: this 3nt is wrong sided|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but still leads @D|pg||
nt|xenya: previous hand should produce a great score for NS|pg||
nt|jaapfr: tx all and for sure Ivan is really the greatest (family of Alexander:)?|pg||
nt|athene: asking for a diamond lead against 6nt if partner has @DAK, maybe|pg||
nt|jaapfr: specs previous board was meant that discarding a @H by W could only give the contract of 2nt away and could never be winning as JTR explained N could have had @CAQ then 2nt makes ...|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and if not @CQ then easy to discard  a @C and even @CK could not to be trown in|pg||
nt|jtr: South didnt read the lead next door|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jaapfr: 3nt-3|pg||
nt|po-s: but apparently conventional|pg||
nt|jaapfr: DD and SD:)|pg||
nt|jtr: Nor did zia|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mmmakela: some taps coming up|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 5@C obviously best, but how can you get there?|pg||
nt|po-s: just in cas double (if they don´t know their responses|pg||
nt|jtr: Fu heading for bathroom|pg||
nt|jaapfr: because of the @H discard by W:)?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzdp: results:http://www.slavacup.ru/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm|pg||
nt|jaapfr: tx Ivan for unnoticable excellent job:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes indeed|pg||
nt|jaapfr: whole day 0 mistakes as operator|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he means it as majors, looking for a sac, but 4@D isn't natural so it's all a bit strange|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|petergill: Fu Zhong - Jack Zhao (China) and Kholomeev - Khiuppenen (Russia) lead the Slava Cup after 44-16 wins in Round 1, ref http://www.slavacup.ru/results/slava10/slava10t16r1.htm|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The results of rounds in IMPs will be converted to VPs using a 60:0 scale. In calculating the datum score (= average score) on each board, about 50% (but not more) of the scores (a ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: quarter from the top and a quarter from the bottom) will not be taken into account|pg||
nt|pelu: and 44-16 = win by 14 IMPs = a gameswing! - hard scale|pg||
nt|mdgraham: operators are a bit like cricket umpires - if they do a good job, you don't notice them |pg||
nt|jaapfr: i get -4   -3   -2 and makes replies from kibs my screen is ""blue""|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if @DA @CA @CQ then -2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: has to take @DA and play on clubs, I think|pg||
pc|s5|nt|paulhac:  txs everyone|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Thanks everyone|pg||
nt|athene: thanks all|pg||
nt|solex33: maybe a mixture of lead directing and take-out ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: thx all|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Thanks and C..................U.|pg||
nt|po-s: is there more today?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: no, that was last segment today|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: next segment starts tommorow in 11 msk time|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: I'll be gald to see you all tommorow )|pg||
nt|jtr: But it should still go down|pg||
pc|s7|nt|rnmalik: well done:)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jaapfr: aha even make chances indeed|pg||
nt|xenya: we will be back shortly -- stay tuned |pg||
nt|sharkey: Zia won't let go now|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i thought Mike was unusually quiet :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If ever there is a case for a trump lead, this is the auction. Even Bill and D Bird would lead one, don't you think, David?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@S, as in OR, is more to my liking; 4333 and Qs and Js detracts from the hand|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mdgraham: although that may be a bit double-dummy|pg||
nt|jtr: Bill maybe|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS shud take the first 7 tricks|pg||
nt|jtr: It is a religious thing with Bird though i think|pg||
nt|dburn: Zhao perhaps a little unlucky not to find Fu with a three-card major after the opponents had started 1@c-1NT|pg||
nt|jtr: He can only lead trumps on thursdays|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if so then 17-12|pg||
nt|granguru: the whole day?|pg||
nt|dburn: for all that, his @cQ wasn't a bad feature for playing in clubs, so he might not have run|pg||
nt|jaapfr: although not sure comparison is with allother ?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good bridge, many doubles and redoubles|pg||
nt|jtr: Up until 10pm|pg||
nt|sharkey: Roland will explain the scoring method I think|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The results of rounds in IMPs will be converted to VPs using a 60:0 scale. In calculating the datum score (= average score) on each board, about 50% (but not more) of the scores (a ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: quarter from the top and a quarter from the bottom) will not be taken into account|pg||
nt|granguru: a heard a nice tip about leading trumps. If you are going to lead trumps before count up to ten..|pg||
nt|granguru: if that doesnt work..then count up to hundred|pg||
nt|jtr: Does Welland think Zia has doubled with xx?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s4|nt|vugraphzdp: thx|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: all )|pg||
nt|jaapfr: tx ivan and all|pg||
nt|roswolf: bye for now|pg||
nt|xenya: There will be a break for dinner now. Play will resume in about an hour and half|pg||
nt|sharkey: Zia - Welland has regained the lead|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|sharkey: W played @H10 - otherwise Zia may have read the falsecard|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|jaapfr: this normal way is down 2|pg||
nt|jtr: Before this hand i assume?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jaapfr: -4 can even|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|jaapfr: so all kibs were rite -4 -3 -2 make everything was DD possible|pg||
mc|8|nt|jaapfr: ty all esp Ivan again 0 wrong|pg||
nt|jtr: Huge set for N/S|pg||
nt|sharkey: Looks like another crushing round for Zia Welland|pg||
nt|sharkey: 53-7 VP |pg||
nt|jtr: Bye for now people|pg||
nt|jaapfr: bye|pg||
nt|sharkey: Bye|pg||
nt|sharkey: we shud be back shortly I think|pg||
nt|po-s: if he had entered his hand with a club and played another spad North can win and play a diamond. Now he must discard a diamond on the clubs before playing another spade. Then a ...|pg||
nt|po-s: diamond will tap him so that he loses a heart and a long diamond in the end|pg||
