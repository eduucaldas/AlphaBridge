pc|c6|nt|dburn: or even either, though both contracts may wither|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: lead problem.... |pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|paulg:  i think it is always hard to bid 4@s unless East opens 1@d|pg||
nt|paulg:  even a 3@d overcall would probably prevent it|pg||
nt|ady: e/w  may get to 3NT  and can make with J@S laying well|pg||
nt|garnetts: This may make but the auction bad --what is wrong with a 1@S rebid?|pg||
nt|paulg:  if I were going to open the East hand, as I would, I think I'd mention the spades|pg||
pc|d6|nt|paulg:  not that it has affected the final contract|pg||
nt|mdgraham: always difficult, whether to lead your own suit (as here) or partner's|pg||
nt|othered1: May depend on your minimum suit quality standard for the weak 2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: junior players are not renowned for having 100-honour suits for their weak twos, in general |pg||
nt|othered1: If it's like mine -- 3 of top 5, not KJ10 or QJ10 -- you lead partner's suit.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome back to Paul Gipson|pg||
nt|paulg:  hi everyone|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Paul!|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|s8|nt|dinos1: 1@d overcall wdnt prevent|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|paulg:  do you think you can find a junior who would bid 1@d?|pg||
nt|garnetts: I understand that the modern game involves bidding to poor contrcats like this though |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ady: fortunate contract   clubs splitting well and spade position good|pg||
nt|paulg:  but South can switch to hearts now|pg||
nt|garnetts: can't be bothered to work out the odds of it making on a @D lead  but I think it is tiny |pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|s5|nt|dinos1: )))|pg||
nt|othered1: now has to g uess the @C position|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now, play to drop the ace or to pin the jack of clubs|pg||
nt|othered1: declarer should have an almost exact count on the hand.  But that doesn't necessarily tell everything.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|paulg:  the carding certainly looks like the diamonds are 4-4, and he cannot afford a heart switch, so I think Gyles Ellison should have won the second diamond|pg||
pc|hA|nt|garnetts: which is why there is a premium on good card play--that is win the first @D and get on with it |pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|dinos1: now @sQ @c pitch, pull @h, @d10 endplay|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|d2|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hQ|pc|d5|pc|c2|pg||
pc|sA|nt|garnetts: winning the second might not be good enough if a heart was switched to at trick two|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|pc|s6|pg||
pc|sK|pc|d7|pc|c3|nt|paulg:  it seems a fair but unsuccessful defence from North ... seems more likely that partner had a singleton spade than the @cA?|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|garnetts: If EW lead spades at every chance they might just beat this--for example east can ruff the foruth round with the 10@C and I expect South will throw a @D |pg||
nt|paulg:  EW can cross ruff to six tricks|pg||
mb|p|pc|c5|nt|paulg:  but not necessarily easy for Morgan to see that|pg||

pc|dA|pc|dJ|pg||

nt|garnetts: time to throw one in |pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  so there will be much that they have yet to discuss|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|Walddk4: This is a fine grand slam|pg||
nt|paulg:  Ellison seems to have aged suddenly ... that looks like a normal 3@c opener|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 7NT is obviously laydown|pg||
nt|paulg:  I think East should really pass with a weak notrump|pg||
nt|dinos1: think 3@c promises at least 5-4|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|helene_t:  yes, 3@c shows a good hand since the double only promised hearts, not necessarily clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: can see no point in opening in fourth seat with that junk--I always get too high |pg||
pc|s3|nt|andyv:  won't get there that way|pg||
nt|jtr: I imagine 1@d shows @hs|pg||
nt|dinos1: now it's hard for W to believe they have 3 @s stoppers :)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|andyv:  must be from the Barry Crane school of grand slam bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 6NT is for people who have a plane to catch|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2@H leaves me speechless |pg||
nt|paulg:  well, almost |pg||
nt|paulg:  looks like 9 tricks with the favourable club position|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk4: Extremely lazy|pg||
nt|garnetts: I would rather chew my own arm off than bid that |pg||

nt|bigtrain: but very frequently the overcaller side has a fit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Many specs asking about this auction|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Double shows a penalty of 1NT, redouble is a weak hand with a 5-card suit somewhere. Forces 2@C and then East will correct to his suit|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|nt|dinos1: 5+? or 5@s4m?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk4: Maybe the rebid was 2NT?|pg||

mb|d!|an|penalties|nt|paulg:  5+@s apparently|pg||
nt|paulg:  i expect that they can wriggle to 2@d here, although South will bid 2@h first|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: looks like down 1|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@d possibly says diamonds and a major (spades here)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ady: unless taking a very good guess in spades|pg||
nt|garnetts: may well get the spade right after the overcall|pg||
nt|ady: does 2@H show hearts and a minor?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: More likely Roland|pg||
nt|paulg:  i guess it depends on what you open normally |pg||
nt|paulg:  will Ellison let Morgan escape in 3@h?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|helene_t:  hmmm ... wouldnt it be useful to distinguish between a 5-card suit and a 6-card suit?|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'm not sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  @cA now|pg||
nt|paulg:  and Boyd may lead the @sJ to tempt a cover|pg||
nt|ady: scotland did get the game swing on hand 4 in 4 spades|pg||
nt|paulg:  unless North has five clubs, it is hard to see when playing clubs is wrong|pg||
nt|garnetts: it is obviously right |pg||
nt|othered1: why is north not making quantitative @H bid? |pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|paulg:  2@d is game forcing checkback|pg||

pc|d5|pc|s6|pg||
nt|dinos1: 3@s4@c1@h1@d = 9|pg||
pc|cA|nt|paulg:  Morgan's play is a lot more considered ... in other words, a lot slower than his partner|pg||
nt|othered1: rehi, everyone|pg||
nt|paulg:  lacking entries here to take the spade finesse more than twice|pg||

nt|paulg:  the auction will be different in the other room, where they play a strong 1NT ... West might show 5-5|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|othered1: or a throw-in on east|pg||
nt|paulg:  easier to take the club finesse|pg||
nt|jtr: And no reason to look further than the @c finesse i guess|pg||
nt|jtr: Let's at least credit East for pushing them|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes he should have an idea of the hand since East cannot have 4@ds|pg||
nt|paulg:  if you happened to ruff the diamond and see that East has @dQxx, then you might start thinking|pg||
nt|othered1: they were headed for -800 and that's without things lying horribly|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5 over 5 is seldom right|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Manfield/Klinger|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The 5-level belongs to the opponents|pg||

nt|jtr: The record number of consecuitive flat boards in a junior event is 6|pg||

nt|Walddk4: That was in 1974|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|paulg:  both Scotland and Ireland will then have one match left against supposedly weaker opposition|pg||

mb|p|nt|paulg:  i think double is a lot better than 1@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: not sure I would pass East's hand |pg||
nt|garnetts: intiially I mean |pg||
mb|2C|nt|dinos1: yes - perfect shape for X, and h is as 4-cd|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@s is probably non-forcing|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|garnetts: For the record I prefer 2@H as I have such good pips--but it is rare to overcall with five |pg||
nt|ady: east prefered to keep silent  red against green   must be pleased once south has hearts|pg||
mb|3H|nt|helene_t:  yes but not perfect strength for x followed by 2@h|pg||

nt|paulg:  hard to avoid 4@s here|pg||
mb|2D|nt|garnetts: gets murky now maybe|pg||
nt|paulg:  so they had this auction in their last practise match, and Gyles Ellison was admonished for not bidding 1@s with the East hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: spades are the fourth suit |pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|paulg:  they play walsh, so bid 1@s with a weak hand even with longer diamonds|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: A lead I don't understand when you have QJx in another suit|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|dinos1: too strong for 1N - 17pc with good 5-cd suit and good honors|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: still seems 8 tricks    might have run spade to the ace  and played spade back  but south can rise with the king and there are no more entries in east hand|pg||

nt|garnetts: In my view yes because with a weak hand and a lot of spades you should pass 2@H or maybe bid 2@S in the first place if that is available |pg||
nt|ewj:  Well he sort of does but he still will be hoping|pg||
nt|ewj:  well what if it's not available?|pg||
