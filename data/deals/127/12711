nt|joemanjo: Hi all|pg||

nt|mmmakela: sry meant 7|pg||

nt|vugraphzbf: ale ju¿ ustalili jak graj¹ :)|pg||
nt|chick: should easily find 3N here|pg||
nt|kaapo: Swedes love strong or 2-way club|pg||
nt|col3435: some well-fitting cards here|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mmmakela: bridge is one of the few sports where playing home is not that great an advantage|pg||
nt|suketbombi: HI all|pg||
nt|suketbombi: n-s play Demicoma a strong club 16+ convention and 12-15 NT|pg||

nt|joemanjo: sry 4@d|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kaapo: Hejssan :)|pg||
nt|joemanjo: Hi Vladimir|pg||
nt|lestergold: starting with a likely 4S contract not looking problematic at all|pg||
nt|hlortz: & Roland , Paul|pg||
mb|p|nt|suketbombi: while e-w play a std convention|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mmmakela: N has a rotten rdbl hand|pg||
nt|kaapo: Hejssan alla|pg||
nt|joemanjo: This looks like a West Bengal vs Delhi match. NS and EW respectively.|pg||
mb|p|nt|varange: welcome to the Swedish Premier League.|pg||
nt|joemanjo: Hi all|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kaapo: 1NT is about 17-19 here I suppose|pg||
nt|col3435: at least declarer has something to think about on this lead|pg||
nt|varange: NS played pretty slowly during the previous session|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks like they're headed for an easy 4@S|pg||
nt|joemanjo: EW qualified to represent India once at China, four years back.|pg||
mb|p|nt|joemanjo: EW play stong club|pg||
nt|joemanjo: strong|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: Straightforward bidding|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Hello, Markku. Good evening to all|pg||
nt|kaapo: Did 3NT show clubs or @S shortness or something else?|pg||
nt|joemanjo: NS okay Standard methods|pg||
mb|p|nt|varange: which meant that the OR caught up|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1NT = clubs or GF relay?|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: apologies, alerts in the wrong place.|pg||
nt|lestergold: A duck of this club- a continuation will lead to an overtrick|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sfoxa:  Hello, Kari.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mmmakela: 3433 and 9 with no intermeds|pg||
nt|mcphee: 3nt a nice spot|pg||
nt|xenya: good stop but still an awkward contract|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes shd be a flat bd which is a good news for Khandelwals|pg||
nt|othered1: Possible without @C system for north to be declarer, but on this hand it doesn't matter|pg||
nt|joemanjo: +120 in 1N|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: tricks missed due to late start....catching up with the score|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kaapo: Hi Cornelia, Markku and Staffan|pg||
nt|chick: hard to pass with 2 aces though|pg||
nt|chick: and a lively first round of bidding dies quite suddenly|pg||
nt|rnc: For Running Scores, time schedule etc during the tournament: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.877|pg||
nt|kaapo: Hi|pg||
nt|mmmakela: only guess who might have all 3 trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: short @S and not min|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|chick: now that E sees that he set up the spades, he has to start grabbing tricks before losers can be pitched|pg||
nt|kaapo: Clubs will easily bring enough tricks for EW and luckily South hasn't got too high a heart in order to get a chance to play twice through West|pg||
nt|chick: with no entries, N must try to get to partner's hand again for another @H through|pg||
nt|col3435: if East is showing his shape this could turn out well|pg||
nt|kaapo: Ten tricks on top and 2 diamond ruffs bring it to twelve. 4-0 clubs shouldn't do much harm|pg||
nt|vugraphj77: za chwilke porzybiegnie nasz komentator Rysiu Kielczewski|pg||
pc|h2|nt|joemanjo: Both sides play Standard with variations|pg||
pc|h3|nt|burypies: tajemnicza 8@d|pg||
nt|kaapo: Hopefully 4@H was alerted too :)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kaapo: Or are they playing with screens?|pg||
nt|lestergold: Edwin a highly respected senior founded and was co owner of my club for some twenty years|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|mmmakela: needs C A right here for starters,now might even make this akward contract|pg||
nt|vugraphj77: ktorego witam serdecznie|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kaapo: North might have some slam ambitions, if there are no wasted @S values|pg||
nt|rnc: For Running Scores, time schedule etc during the tournament: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.877|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: north has shown 1-4 in majors with 5+@D here|pg||
nt|kaapo: Tack, Staffan|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: missed play...c\will claim at the end|pg||
nt|joemanjo: All cards are favourable, lack of entries in West hand is the immediate issue. |pg||
pc|c5|nt|mcphee: all over now|pg||
nt|varange: Ralf Willquist will be able to fill us in on most of the play as he knows the players|pg||
nt|varange: and our operator at the venue, Steffan, will keep us updated|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a big mistake to reach 6@s here. -2 if they can find the @c ruff on NS|pg||
pc|c2|nt|burypies: Weijknis wiedzia³ ze 2! to dwukolorówka?|pg||
nt|burypies: 2@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: tak wyjanione przed wistem|pg||
nt|burypies: je¿eli tak powinien zagraæ D@d|pg||
nt|burypies: wiedzia³ ¿e  rozgrywaj¹cy ma singla @d|pg||
nt|kaapo: I believe NS play 2-way club. North would open 1@C with 11-13 balanced, so he has kind of maximum|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I surely would because now 1 @S was forcing in my book and he passed!|pg||
nt|kaapo: I tried commentating in Swedish too, but my typing was a bit too slow in that language. I might do better now that PO is playing, though ;)|pg||
nt|varange: should be bid - ask Roland :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: I doubt even Roland would approve of this one :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: no screens, no alert since swedish rules say no alerting above 3nt|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|kaapo: Ok, then no alerts beyond 3NT|pg||
nt|col3435: opps had probably got the idea by that point anyway :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kaapo: A kib suggests that 4@H was RKC in clubs|pg||
nt|suketbombi: will end up making 5@S|pg||
pc|s6|nt|varange: what systems do they play Ralf?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Staffan!|pg||
nt|joemanjo: North may be AshiM Mukherjee - if so he is a player in the Indian Railways B team.|pg||
nt|lestergold: Eginton has been a major figure in bridge and bridge administration for many years was recently chai of England selectors.|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s4|pg||
nt|col3435: mm. So presumably 3@h showed 4414 exactly|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|cT|nt|xenya: should make with a careful play though, and he is on the right track|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pg||
nt|col3435: easy with spades breaking - but how would you play if South had five?|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c6|nt|ralfwil: strong @c from both pairs  - Staffan?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ralfwil: EW does and I thing NS too|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yes, strong club, 17+, from both as far as i can see|pg||
nt|kaapo: The web site for the tournament is here http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.877|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think Edwin is endplayed here |pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|kaapo: You'll find running scores there too|pg||
nt|xenya: now another trump and @C hook |pg||
nt|xenya: but this line fails -- |pg||
nt|xenya: not clear why he decided to shorten himself in trumps, losing control|pg||
nt|joemanjo: a club ruff and favourable trump break seals the contract for East|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rnc: For Running Scores, time schedule etc during the tournament: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.877|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|nt|varange: NT is 14-16?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: guess does not matter as Ashim has only 2 @HS|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|kaapo: It's very normal in Sweden to play 3rd and 5th leads, even against notrumps. Nyström - Wrang seem not to do it, though|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: I would say most swedes play 3rd-5th vs suit and 4th vs NT|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kaapo: And you can see that it's quite close in the top|pg||

nt|vugraphzpx: i would say they are pretty good, noone knows how good he is in a speedy :) I can ask him though... :)|pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: if south has 5 spades, the best way must be to play the 8 of clubs and let it go round to north|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: or even a small one|pg||
nt|col3435: yes that's nice|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes and the favoriates are trailing makes it more interesting|pg||
nt|joemanjo: EW partnership is quite a long standing one in Indian Bridge. East, Mr Ashok Goel is the CEO of Dhampur Sugar Mills and sponsor for their team.|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: scores updated|pg||
nt|joemanjo: hi all|pg||
nt|suketbombi: hi manoj|pg||

nt|vugraphj77: witram wszystkich serdecznie. Przepraszam za opoznienie, ale sprawy techniczne. Mysle ze juz powinno byc dobrze|pg||
mb|1S|nt|chick: nice 4@H contract here|pg||
nt|kaapo: Rehi Cornelia|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello, Cornelia|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1NT looks interesting|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 1 nt seems needing swings|pg||
nt|kaapo: What does that show, then? :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  if E decided to open 1nt, good ending could be 3nt |pg||
nt|kaapo: 10-13, might be off-shap?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  guess @d right - "only"|pg||
nt|joemanjo: What wd u open as North?|pg||
nt|joemanjo: Hi Raju|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: yes, 26 imps can be found in 14 boards without doing much more than playing good bridge and getting a little lucky to have active hands.|pg||
nt|lestergold: part score battle N/S can make a lucky 3S e/w 3 of a minor|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kaapo: Well, no need to interfere with his play :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
nt|kaapo: North may get to open here, unless West finds 1@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C|pg||
nt|joemanjo: :)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: witam pogr¹¿onych w depresji, czy Elbl¹g siê w niej znajduje?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: need to reach 5@D |pg||
nt|chick: is he known as a particularly slow player?  :)|pg||
nt|xenya: the 3@D preempt in the other room was overdoing it|pg||
nt|joemanjo: u can follow this tourney at the following website|pg||
nt|joemanjo: http://indianbridgepages.appspot.com/ Yashwant_Rao_Holkar/2010/Results.el|pg||
nt|joemanjo: 4@S may be reached here too. |pg||

nt|vugraphj77: chociaz team ZSRR wybral przeciwnikow z jtorymi jako jedynymi przegrali mecz|pg||
mb|p|nt|varange: hi Frank|pg||
mb|2D|nt|kaapo: I suppose Johan and PO at least play 2-way club|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: chick, sundelin is known as one of the slowest swedish players ever... :)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes subhash took a not so unreasonable line rather than Relying on 50% @H Q in|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: N won't sell|pg||
nt|mdgraham: curious no 1@s overcall by North|pg||
nt|vugraphj77: mam nadzieje ze teraz juz wszystko ok|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kaapo: 2-way club, where 1@C shows either a strong hand or a weak notrump range, is often referred to as Swedish club|pg||
nt|joemanjo: 2@C and 2N take up valuable space to show a black two suiter.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: N-s have a good @S partial|pg||
nt|joemanjo: ah that 3@s made it simple|pg||
nt|joemanjo: Had East not opened, NS may have wandered into a 4@s game.|pg||
nt|joemanjo: now they may settle in @s partial|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well 4C undoubled is actually a good result for one off for E/W|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: 14-16 Nt maybe?|pg||
nt|chick: certainly doesn't look like a hand that I would upgrade|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 13-17NT from start, 2@D showed 13-15 without 4c major|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: PO thinks his partners minor is @C:)|pg||
nt|chick: good thing I don't have a lot to do today then :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I am told NS play VERY sound overcalls - and it surely seems so|pg||
nt|joemanjo: wow|pg||
nt|joemanjo: good lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4C x is par something that is not often achieved at the table|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: I guess 1NT = 14-16|pg||
nt|kaapo: Some might bid some number of diamonds as West|pg||
nt|kaapo: Even if East doesn't lead a club, he'll get another chance|pg||
nt|kaapo: Unless he ducks a spade|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: this board is wrong duplicated. Not much, but the ace of heart is located at east, not at south|pg||
nt|kaapo: Makes a little more sense then|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  single?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: south stole the 9 of D from east|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: so east holds 3253 with A7 in hearts|pg||
nt|kaapo: Mikael and Cilla are in the minority for Swedish experts: they don't play strong/2-way club|pg||
nt|kaapo: Their system of choice is short club with transfers|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ogl¹da³em wyniki teamu o swojsko brzmia cej nazwie ZSRR - do 7 meczu oddawali tylko 1 impa, czy idzie im w dalszym ci¹gu adekwatnie do nazwy?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|frankaus: @D lead would have proved troublesome|pg||
nt|xenya: well if he decided to treat has hand as balanced, it makes sense|pg||
nt|vugraphj77: slyszalam ze biuro polityczne kazalo zwolnic wszystkich trenerwo|pg||
nt|vugraphj77: bo slabo na olimpiadzie|pg||
pc|c5|nt|suketbombi: yes but any ruff By E will only promote a trunmp for def|pg||
pc|d9|nt|xenya: whether it is balanced is doubtful though|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|d7|nt|chick: almost any lead gives away a trick|pg||
nt|joemanjo: EW Bidding will certainly help the declarer in bringing off the 4@S|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kaapo: Well, unless the other room plays the board similarly distorted, this has to be canceled|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so S has 10982 in dias?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: it´s the same at all other tables.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yes, south holds 10982 in @d|pg||
nt|suketbombi: a @C lead or shift wud restrict to 3 or else 4 makable|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jkmjanusz: Witam!|pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: witamy nowych komentatorów |pg||
nt|abunio: witamy z Gdanska :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: ns play 2-way club Staffan? Carrot?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 2@C asking for majors, 2@D relay with lots of different hands, 2@H/2@S/2NT/3@C/3@D invitational|pg||
nt|chick: and N puts him to the test immediately, before he can get any other info|pg||
nt|kaapo: Of couse he does have @DQ and might get a trick with it|pg||
nt|chick: but N still has to find the @DQ|pg||
nt|mcphee: sure, nice bold play before anyones knows what is up|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@C makes but it's not great. It takes more than the heart finesse|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|othered1: That's a *really* positional style|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|nt|varange: choices choices|pg||
nt|xenya: all S's honours work and he knows it|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kaapo: @H8 looked discouraging|pg||
nt|chick: club switch still isn't clear though|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so, we'll be unable to follow the play right - just enter result? |pg||
nt|kaapo: This seems to happen rarely but occasionally with the duplicating machines|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: we can follow the play as long as they wont play hearts... :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: In Beijing we had a normal bidding sequence and I ended up at 3NT|pg||
nt|mmmakela: we can until certain point but did S really pitch a dia|pg||
nt|kaapo: When I examined the dummy, I noticed our side had two diamond queens!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yes, south did pitch the 2 of @d|pg||
nt|mmmakela: very strange|pg||
nt|frankaus: still makes with 3@H 3@C 2@S + 1@D|pg||
nt|col3435: I guess you finish drawing trumps and try to cash some clubs, but when that doesn't work, what do you do?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Besides, if declarer is not careful, he may go down|pg||
pc|cK|nt|chick: now should just lose the top trumps|pg||
nt|joemanjo: East wd have done well to put up the @h ten first round.|pg||
nt|joemanjo: @h8 rather|pg||

mb|p|nt|kaapo: 4@S or 3NT here?|pg||
nt|kaapo: NS might end up at 4@H here|pg||
nt|mcphee: easy @S game, interesting to see how far N/S will push|pg||
nt|kaapo: 6@S could make but is missing two key cards|pg||
mb|1S|nt|chick: 4@H will look tasty to NS, but also to W |pg||
nt|ralfwil: first morning slam in @d|pg||
nt|col3435: perhaps South could bid 4@d over 3NT then.|pg||
nt|varange: I can see that N wouldnt be happy|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@S let through on board 2|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess north thinks this hand is too good for 15 point 1N.  I tend to agree|pg||
nt|suketbombi: the system is called Demicoma Destructive Minor Constructive Major|pg||
nt|joemanjo: can make 4@h DD on that board but ...|pg||

nt|suketbombi: trf to @H this 4@D I guess|pg||
nt|joemanjo: maybe not, @c ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|suketbombi: so 1D shows nothing about @Ds but atleast 1 or both Majors|pg||
nt|suketbombi: a 2@S doubled made by bappa in Other room making things difficult for MMS|pg||
mb|2C|nt|kaapo: Unlikely they'd get that high, though, unless really pushed|pg||
nt|mcphee: does the 2@S bid show game interest for @H?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 2@S was pass/correct. |pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: 1@D, I believe, shows about 11-16 with 4+@D and an unbalanced hand|pg||
mb|2D|nt|chick: N will expect partner to have @s singleton|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 10-15 actually|pg||
nt|mcphee: or just an invitation + for @H?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes, but @d is better|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: do i start with a Roland slam :) ?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: dont think subhsah will take any action|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: supp dbl in spades|pg||
nt|chick: do you suppose 1@H is transfer advance showing spades?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: y|pg||
nt|kaapo: Nyström made a slight overbid with 4@D, but his @DAQ had grown in strength over 3@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: Wrang explained the 4@D wrong it seems, 4@D showed game forcing without short D|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: with spade support of course|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2@D Multi, showing a weak two in either of the majors (or perhaps some strong hand)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 1nt denies Major unless 4-3-3-3|pg||
nt|othered1: Nicely j udged lead|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: Nothing wrong with this slam|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: actually a good slam... need only to find @Hq|pg||
nt|joemanjo: xfer helped there, else spade lead wd immediately put trumps under pressure.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes for sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: Ok, some downgrading due to singleton J|pg||
nt|mmmakela: brb cig br|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2@D limits the hand further down?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: max 14-15 |pg||
nt|xenya: 10 tricks are available, yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's around 50%, not bad at all|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: maybe even better with the 9 card fit|pg||
nt|joemanjo: whew|pg||
nt|lestergold: Bowles is not finding the world's greatest leads at present|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ralfwil: now @d are 2-2, but if 3-1?|pg||
nt|varange: better slams are those that make :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: super fast play - claiming at the end|pg||
nt|joemanjo: I am sure that DBL was intended as competitive but was left in assuming penalty|pg||
nt|othered1: East's sound opening may cover west's quick trickless double.|pg||

nt|varange: <-- being facetious|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's 53%, singleton queen or 2-2, but ....|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: maybe north shd have started a cuebid with 3@S|pg||

nt|joemanjo: declarer well placed here|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphzpx: 4@H showed a good raise to 4@S|pg||
nt|kaapo: Perhaps West could bid a minor suit to suggest a maximum with hearts?|pg||
nt|kaapo: 8 teams remain in the top division so there's lot to play for even for Örebridgen. They're currently 6th, 4.5 VPs ahead of the 8th positioned team|pg||
nt|kaapo: You'll find running scores via http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.877|pg||
pc|dT|nt|suketbombi: lead is not bad here and subhash has 2 entries to short Trump the dummy  but can get 2 Hearts and @D if correctly played|pg||
pc|d3|nt|frankaus: lots of good slams fails - and some bad ones make - i for 1 bid far to many  slams|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|varange: how would one know when one bids too many slams?|pg||
nt|joemanjo: That lead is good. Now 10 wll be difficult.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the other room, West doubled 2@S and his poor partner is now in 2NT, mercifully undoubled|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: wow u have the %s at the tip of your fingers Roland|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: miskey - play out of turn - claiming at the end|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, I know when to bid my 12.89% slams|pg||
nt|suketbombi: he has not much options unless he thinks @HS are 4-4|pg||
nt|suketbombi: he has to try the @S finnesse first to know his target of @D tricks|pg||
nt|suketbombi: ?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|chick: no one did, this hand is a nightmare in any contract|pg||
nt|col3435: (and 5VPs ahead of 9th)|pg||
nt|lestergold: It was ugly but he is  justc about minimum for that bid to be permitted it doesn promise a goodm hand just a courtesy repsponse upwards with support for the unbid suits|pg||

nt|mmmakela: well clubs are 3-2 and the A right|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kaapo: I'm not very fond of West's 2@S but perhaps that was another small deception: he was trying to convince NS they should go to 4@H|pg||
nt|othered1: Probably depends on what north things their lead style would imply here.    To my eyes, 7 is an interesting card|pg||
nt|joemanjo: thgt spade wd come back|pg||
pc|d8|pg||

pc|d9|pc|d2|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kaapo: He could squeeze East if nothing else works (double dummy) :)|pg||

nt|mdgraham: bidding 4@H with the North hand looks a bit, er, well shall we say percentgae|pg||
nt|othered1: 3 @H rather|pg||
pc|h3|nt|chick: he is playing this perfectly, given the chance to make|pg||

nt|joemanjo: closed room result may be soon overtaken here. 4@s, 4@h, 1 club atleast.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kaapo: 1@C was strong. Interesting to see that West didn't have any fancy convention but simply bid his best suit|pg||
nt|suketbombi: hi all|pg||
pc|sA|nt|chick: the @C7 just became a big card|pg||
nt|kaapo: I don't really see much better here than to hope for @CA at East|pg||
nt|kaapo: Well, perhaps @CA7 douleton|pg||
nt|kaapo: In theory, NS have 5 tricks before declarer has 9, but in practice they can't cash them|pg||

mb|p|nt|kaapo: Would you overcall 3@C?|pg||
nt|kaapo: Apparently 2@C is showing the majors|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes|pg||
mb|3S|nt|chick: this one is nice 3N if they can bid it|pg||
nt|kaapo: Staffan does wisely and concentrates on the board actually being played. That's a good advice for any bridge player :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now tough for S|pg||
nt|frankaus: now the save|pg||
nt|kaapo: If NS are good guessers, they could make 4@S|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@s looks like a fair-chance contract but both A@D offside and 4-1 trump will doom it|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: dbl or 2@C graham ?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, either could be right. 2@C has the advantage of bidding the good suit... |pg||
nt|suketbombi: 12-15 no major or 4-3-3-3 if there is a major|pg||
nt|joemanjo: oh well |pg||

nt|arvid: I would|pg||
nt|kaapo: I guess I would too|pg||
nt|kaapo: Unapparently 4@C is asking to pick a major|pg||
nt|frankaus: pass  at 50s would be my action 2|pg||
nt|mmmakela: not the expected one|pg||
nt|kaapo: 10 down = 500|pg||
nt|frankaus: -10  = 500|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 4 H dbld cheaper|pg||
nt|frankaus: yes but hard to  be certain its not 800|pg||
nt|mmmakela: come on after 4 @C!|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, win @SA, then ruff a @H and eventually there is a squeeze against S|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 2 @C for me anyday|pg||
nt|suketbombi: a trf to @C if superaccepted even 4@S on a carefull handling will make|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: The web site (mostly in Swedish) is here somewhere: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.877|pg||
nt|kaapo: @S to queen, then run 7|pg||

nt|suketbombi: dont think kamal will move here|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: would you?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: after the pause is a club lead ethical?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: yes|pg||
nt|mcphee: lots down|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: no double no trouble :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: But just 50 each|pg||
nt|col3435: ok, I guess even on three rounds of diamonds declarer would probably go down there.|pg||
nt|joemanjo: Subash no doubt thought he always can put Satya back to @c|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 4 piki skurczybyki|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kaapo: 2@D was some kind of Multi: showing a weak two bid in either major (or possibly some strong hand)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: they will land in 2@h now instead of 2@s, if S had opened with 1@s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: South has all the important cards. @CQJ and @HKQ|pg||
nt|othered1: Is south thinking of doing something?  Did north's original pass show some values?|pg||
nt|joemanjo: time for red card|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: nie????|pg||
nt|vugraphj77: nie|pg||

nt|vugraphj77: wypuszczone 3 NT|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jkmjanusz: Po przepuszczeniu @H Damy Kasprzak zmieni³ wista na @S !!|pg||
nt|kaapo: Apparently 2@H was a simple reverse, a little light but with nice 3-card support for partner and great controls|pg||
nt|kaapo: Diamond split is very cruel, in case they end up at some number of dimonds|pg||
nt|kaapo: What is the 1NT range here, Staffan?|pg||
nt|frankaus: 2@H will make so no real harm|pg||
nt|varange: the one is as good as the other?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|chick: not necessarily a pause... remember the operator cannot enter bids until both people on one side of the screen have bid|pg||
nt|varange: friendly breaks either way|pg||
nt|yuval10: if he guess it that would be something :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but double shows the three-suiter and is possibly more flexible, and would therefore score 10/10 in a bidding competition|pg||
nt|mdgraham: board 5 - game missed at othert table as well|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 2nt knowing there is a minor fit|pg||
nt|suketbombi: y e-w play Demicoma 1nt denies 4 card major unless 4-3-3-3|pg||
nt|suketbombi: it is about a 50% game after pd gived you full 14|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|kaapo: 14-16?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: not sure, 14-16 or 15-17|pg||

nt|mmmakela: still wd EW|pg||
nt|varange: you'd open the south hand 1@s Frank?|pg||
nt|varange: or 1NT?|pg||
nt|frankaus: many here include 5M332 in their NT range - klinger has  a great influence here a he recomends it|pg||
nt|xenya: but this is very double dummy|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @C is only 5-card - d is best|pg||
nt|hawe45:  D|pg||
nt|othered1: "Knowing" may be a bit strong, if south could have 4=3=3=3 with 4-card major|pg||
nt|suketbombi: ok but they got 4 for there 200|pg||
nt|joemanjo: 9 IMPs gift to trailing team|pg||
pc|d2|nt|chick: that's one advantage of not bidding clubs, don't give away the bad distribution|pg||
nt|kaapo: Of course would be more cruel still, if South had them|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: they play lebensohl|pg||
nt|chick: if it promises clubs, that's ok with N|pg||
nt|mcphee: :)|pg||
nt|chick: but with a nice heart fit, it is trouble, double or not|pg||
pc|sT|nt|arvid: If east had the jack of diamonds 6@D would have been a very good slam|pg||
nt|kaapo: Wrang saw short clubs with partner and opts for the 4-3 @S game|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: We had a lost connection at the other table which means board  15 isnt scored properly. The result in the open room was 6@S made, which should give another 14imps for Team Zang|pg||
nt|chick: he must win the @SA, so can ruff two clubs with the small trumps|pg||
nt|mmmakela: making 13|pg||
nt|yuval10: either way EW can make 10 tricks in @h because of the 87 doubleton @d so -1 in 4@s isn't so bad|pg||
nt|joemanjo: yes, missed the qj of clubs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but with these suit discrepancies I would bid 2@C - always a good overcall of 1@D|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes that is rare N is known to take chances|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so then very nice auction|pg||
nt|frankaus: will be nervous about the @D situation|pg||
nt|varange: the 8@h is a big card|pg||
nt|joemanjo: lol|pg||
nt|hlortz: singleton @S lead will beat 4@H looks like|pg||
nt|lestergold: This can be beaten|pg||
nt|lestergold: it actually should be|pg||
nt|lestergold: a bit unlucky of course as its a very good contract|pg||
pc|s3|nt|varange: AQxxx isn't that flash anyway|pg||
nt|frankaus: yes  then i play garbage 2@C and puppet 3@C for all game going hands|pg||
nt|varange: ok|pg||
nt|varange: nice treatment|pg||
nt|col3435: can East just continue hearts here?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yes he can|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: well he has only 3 carder @S and a very weak 4 card @H suit|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: easy on a @D lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East will do very well to lead a spade here|pg||
nt|suketbombi: everyone is happy here|pg||
nt|hlortz: if n later leads Q@C and w ducks S will need to rise Ace to give the ruff.|pg||
nt|lestergold: good point|pg||
nt|hlortz: tho prehaps just clearing 3 rounds of trump will leave declarer a @D loser|pg||
nt|lestergold: but south should be able to count west's hand for a stiff club|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mmmakela: well S never thinks with his 10-12.....|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: there are no screens |pg||
nt|mmmakela: against 2-way club most treat it as supposing the weak variation and W didn't bid after 1 @C so has clubs now if thinking one could assume|pg||
nt|mmmakela: even that was meant priv sry|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but, on the bidding, he may well do so - no, he has gone passive|pg||

nt|kaapo: At least we have scores for 15 and 16 :)|pg||
nt|chick: looks like we have lost some scores from the movie, but I'll bet our superb operators will get that fixed when they have the time|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Staffan must insert results on 17 and 18 manually in MOVIE|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: already done roland, you must be faster than that :)|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: Speedy Gonzales|pg||
nt|mcphee: trick 2|pg||
nt|kaapo: More double fits|pg||
nt|kaapo: More interesting boards|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and then declarer is a tempo short.. he plays either of the pointed suits and defence can set up a second trick there|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South must have lost his way there|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes|pg||
nt|othered1: Texam Aces now need less than one imp/board to take the lead.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 4@S here even 3nt is fine|pg||
nt|othered1: actually need exactly 1 imp/bd|pg||
nt|joemanjo: brb, get some lunch|pg||
nt|suketbombi: satya cud have salvaged a pric by play @H and another @HK needs to be unblocked|pg||
nt|suketbombi: tric|pg||
nt|suketbombi: trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: good news for eggeres is that it would have helped|pg||
nt|lestergold: not helped|pg||
nt|lestergold: i meant|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|mmmakela: 7 dias dbld par here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: so -1 on previous bd|pg||
nt|joemanjo: 5IMPs per board is the asking rate|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mmmakela: N very close to 17+ here|pg||
nt|kaapo: Ever played Speedy Gonzales at some Swedish junior camp, Staffan?|pg||
nt|kaapo: Where will this end?|pg||
nt|joemanjo: I wonder where this will end. 3N or 5C? |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: multi 2@D|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 6@Hs on a @S guess played by Subhash if trumps 3-2 can try for @C Q 3 times before commiting to the @S guess not a bad slam|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kaapo: 3NT seems an interesting choice - I was thinking about 2NT or 4NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, they won't get any here I fancy - this looks the flattest 4@S imaginable |pg||
nt|suketbombi: ashok is likely to pass this|pg||
nt|suketbombi: satya has no where to go and subhash must be not unhappy|pg||
nt|hlortz: some sort of mexican 2@D? 18-19 balancec?|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: i thought Edwin's original bidding was a bit conservative on a 9 count with 3 kings|pg||
mb|2S|nt|chick: E was about to bid spades, so now will he try his diamonds, or will he hide in the bushes and ambush a spade contract?|pg||
nt|chick: 2N obviously for the minors, not what N wanted to hear|pg||
nt|chick: and S violates rule  1 of preempts .... don't bid again unless forced.   But with 6-6, I can see the temptation|pg||
nt|kaapo: In the end, PO went one down and lost 12 IMPs|pg||
nt|varange: and made 10 tricks|pg||
nt|kaapo: Opening 4@S looks right|pg||
nt|col3435: agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: 3NT perhaps|pg||
nt|mcphee: too hi in everything I thinnk:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: good thing about this hand is they are not going to get dbled in 3N|pg||
nt|col3435: quick 4@s here then|pg||
nt|varange: that 4NT+2 got them 11 imps; 7@d-1 at the other table|pg||
nt|joemanjo: East has an easy defense if he starts off with @h honour|pg||
nt|othered1: @C lead can hold 3N to 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: I have to leave you now, Graham|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Tx all and happy viewing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks Sunil|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Sveta Bodrenkova|pg||
nt|mdgraham: cheers Sunil|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello to all, hi Roland|pg||
mb|3H|nt|joemanjo: 2 down without breathing hard and more if declarer discards wrong.|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't like 1@D opening, but perhaps it's forced if you are not prepared to support  1@S response|pg||
nt|suketbombi: tuff options for N here 3nt works fine here but|pg||
nt|suketbombi: crucial bd can be 13 imps here or there|pg||
nt|suketbombi: pick a slam happy to be in 6@H|pg||
nt|joemanjo: a heavy balancing postiion 1N in the other room by East when 1@S was passed around|pg||
nt|joemanjo: That put paid to all game ambitions there|pg||
mb|p|nt|burypies: 1@s by³by w stylu Darlesu:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: zasuwaj¹ tak, ¿ebym nie nad¹¿y³...|pg||
nt|kaapo: I might open 4NT if that shows both minors too|pg||
nt|chick: 2@C probably a precision-like bid showing 5-6 clubs and a 4 card major|pg||
nt|varange: one of our specs is having confit du canard - hmmmm, yummy|pg||
nt|ralfwil: perhaps best lead. declarer has to do all the work himself|pg||
nt|varange: yep|pg||
nt|varange: nice and neutral|pg||
nt|mdgraham: You have to bid 3@H, really.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: Lebensohl is a very good gimmick that can be used in many various situations|pg||
nt|mmmakela: really like this?|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2 down on a @C ruff|pg||
nt|frankaus: 5@D X will be a poor compensation for NS|pg||
nt|col3435: ah, the danger of bidding grands|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yes, the players at the other table knew about the 6-2 in @d and bid 7. Bridge isnt fair... :)|pg||
nt|varange: dontcha hate it when underbids get the imps?|pg||
nt|hlortz: ah multi|pg||
nt|hlortz: nah..|pg||
nt|hlortz: ok 18-20 bal or 4by1|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: It's a nearly perfect fit NS, and neither one knows about the other's singleton|pg||
nt|varange: too true Staffan|pg||
nt|suketbombi: may get a @S lead and atrick wud be returned in @D|pg||
nt|lestergold: a perfectly normal contract but the 5/1 diamond break means declarer has to look for a ninth trick elsewhere|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mcphee: nice stab for n/s, just no tricks|pg||
nt|mcphee: maybe he can work some end play|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and how W has to attack trumps immediately|pg||
nt|suketbombi:  showed 4 Hearts and up to 10 hcp|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes the vital imp|pg||
nt|othered1: We're going through some relays and responses, it seems.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: there are various combitions available to Ashim this will take long for sure|pg||
nt|suketbombi: combinations |pg||
nt|suketbombi: @S underlead certain:0|pg||
nt|suketbombi: :)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: sumit will do it on this auction|pg||
nt|joemanjo: nice lead|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mmmakela: quite a bid in red with W hand|pg||
nt|suketbombi: start with @CK:)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: :(|pg||
nt|suketbombi: now satya on his own here|pg||
nt|suketbombi: will try for @C q three times and then close his eyes and Guess @ss|pg||
nt|suketbombi: if only Ashim had made that cold 4@S the match wud have been closer good lead satya will be welcomed by T|pg||
nt|suketbombi: @ST from Subhash|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vugraphzbf: i kart nie pokazuj¹, które zagrywaj¹, chyba siê obra¿ê :)|pg||
nt|varange: they're playing this in 1NT East at the other table and the 4@h was lead|pg||
nt|joemanjo: Satya had only 3 suits to lead from. Either @h or @c wd have given the tempo away.|pg||
pc|s3|pg||

nt|abunio: dawac po lapach!!!|pg||
pc|sK|nt|varange: led|pg||
nt|suketbombi: will que bid 4@D now|pg||
pc|s7|nt|chick: he may survive it|pg||
nt|chick: N needs to cash his @HA to avoid crashing it with one of S's honors|pg||
nt|chick: it looks like a good hand, but still have to trust partner|pg||
nt|arvid: good lead|pg||
nt|mcphee: should try @D|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N is hopeless of course|pg||
nt|suketbombi: oh ace asking:)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|chick: then switch to a spade and start tapping declarer|pg||
nt|arvid: now this will be 4 or 5 down|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: I´ve played several speedys and I am used to winning speedys :)|pg||
nt|hlortz: in @C presumably before defenders establish 5|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|yuval10: either 4 or 1 @s.... looks like P not an option|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  to keep the loss as minimal as possible|pg||
pc|s2|nt|varange: bye bye diamond loser|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm told: y, 1nt-8-13, 2H-4@H 8-10, 2nt no @S support|pg||
nt|suketbombi: next please|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 3 idiots led a @C there I guess and got caught in a @C @s sq to allow 7|pg||
nt|lestergold: elsewhere only really being lubs|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kaapo: I agree with you there, Markku|pg||
nt|chick: leb is a convention that no one should be without.  it seems a bit complex at first look, but it is extremely valuable|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzck: tricks missed claiming at the end|pg||
nt|lestergold: clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: unfortuantyely the defenders will get to 5 tricks first|pg||
nt|hlortz: y 2@H 2@C 1@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: eggsactly|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: declarer can't even do an avoidance play to get west on lea with no hearts left|pg||

nt|suketbombi: sorry this was too easy:)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kaapo: I thought you might be good at it ;)|pg||
nt|chick: needs to duck and hope for KQ10 in W|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes 4@C donno but looks like aces |pg||
nt|suketbombi: must be the only way to allow 7|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|nt|vugraphzcv: because east has SA as an entry anyway|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mmmakela: after S's 4 H N just can't dbl imho, must bid 5/6 H|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphzpx: last time Ida Grönkvist picked me out for a speedy knowing i was the fastest one around... and we sure won at 67% too :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: The idea in a Speedy Gonzales bridge competition is that there's only a ridiculously short time per board to play|pg||
nt|arvid: sorry only 3, but much more difficult for east-west if south is declarer|pg||
nt|suketbombi: will concede 2 tricks ina hurry to make 5|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h9|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mcphee: this lets them show where they live as defenders|pg||
nt|yuval10: needed to play @d for -1, it seem|pg||
nt|suketbombi: Babesh quick to encourage @Ss|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mmmakela: time to cash 3 dias|pg||
nt|suketbombi: will test @S once break you have 8 tricks in bag strip squeeze the @@@C bidder  but not here|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mmmakela: imo S shd have 4 spades here if not strong enough to bid forward after pds 2 @S|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|varange: it'll make on the throw-in|pg||
pc|dA|nt|xenya: N made a practical bid -- as many would i think|pg||
nt|suketbombi: tie here|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ralfwil: Couldn´t N see that he should be endplayed and won @d9 with @dA?|pg||
nt|kaapo: 5 IMPs for Skalman on board 17: 4@S without a double in the open|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 2 @Hs 2@DS and 2 @S to loose|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d8|pg||
nt|kaapo: Yes, was rather aggressive take out double|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|nt|suketbombi: so only 2 imps good rescue by satya 1@S dbl wud have been 500|pg||
nt|suketbombi: @HK and @D exit he is ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: miskeyed-claiming at the end|pg||
pc|c4|nt|chick: that's a very good clue, by the way.... when a defender cashes the trump A and then switches, it's often a singleton, so you can figure you have a bad split|pg||

nt|chick: I'll bet it means, the info is here :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: Sylvan keeps getting a lot of diamonds|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I would bid 6|pg||
nt|frankaus: Aces and singleton a re great combination|pg||
nt|varange: 4@sE in the OR|pg||
nt|varange: and another interesting layout ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: players taking a break|pg||
nt|suketbombi: could be that vital imp to texan aces here|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes 2 smokers there|pg||
nt|othered1: another easy game, likely making 4 since there's no clear reason to guess trumps correctly|pg||
nt|othered1: And no reason to overbid, unless somehow @D are thought to provide tricks|pg||
nt|suketbombi: auction will be 1@H- 2@H  and W will settle for 4|pg||
nt|suketbombi: even if E gets agressive with a Nt will get a 2@D response and will bid 3@H but sighn off after the que bid from W|pg||

nt|vugraphzck: resuming play|pg||
nt|suketbombi: no dhampur ahead |pg||
nt|vugraphzck: E thought the contract was 6 nt and claimed by error|pg||

nt|chick: maybe he's a girl's best friend :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1@D is about 11-16 with 4+@D and suggests an unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|mcphee: 19 @S nice card for S hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: shall i ask him cornelia? :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: Surprising no pre-empt from N|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so, @c and some strenght against @s and distribution |pg||
nt|suketbombi: the old trusted 3nt best here for N-S|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 6@D a great and a superior slam here|pg||
nt|lestergold: N/S could bud an optimistic 3N here 24 combined with 5 card  susts around and good intermediates|pg||
mb|4H|nt|chick: 3 good spades|pg||
nt|kaapo: East has an interesting opening bid choice|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes he decided to underbid this|pg||
mb|4S|nt|col3435: on bd6, if East continued hearts, declarer would probably play another club with West showing out. Then west would be marked with all the cards in spades and diamonds, and it seems ...|pg||
nt|col3435: declarer could throw him in|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North has plenty to raise to 2@S|pg||

nt|chick: asking partner to bid 3@C|pg||
nt|kaapo: Or perhaps a transfer to clubs|pg||
nt|mcphee: 10@S I mean|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  EW reached their limit, what about NS?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: Jm has not finished:(|pg||
nt|othered1: but west has done more and east has a maximum, so|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: would you show majs or treat S hand as 1-suiter|pg||
nt|xenya: strange pass by S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: You can understand why South bids 3@D, even though imho it is an overbid |pg||
nt|suketbombi: ashim will stick? any way 4nt makes too|pg||
nt|suketbombi: will attack with @Ds knowing Thak|pg||
nt|joemanjo: everyone had something to say so far|pg||
nt|lestergold: unfortunately 9 tricks shouldnt be available on reasonable defence|pg||
mb|p|nt|varange: can you explain Ralf?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, push-em-up|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ...onward and possibly upward.... |pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes K bendre is Kaustub Bendre and in Kibz bendre is his father|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: and direct 3 @C promising pos values|pg||
nt|chick: "transfer" implies that you have the suit.   in this case, it's more like a "relay" to clubs, with many possible hands|pg||
nt|kaapo: East had a very maximal hand and support for whatever suit West has and tries for game|pg||
nt|mmmakela: tries?|pg||
nt|kaapo: True, Cornelia, but many play real transfers in this position|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: East though seems unaware of that his partner has made a lebensohl bid |pg||
nt|kaapo: Your using keyboard input, Staffan?|pg||
nt|kaapo: *You're|pg||
nt|frankaus: nil vul is not so good to preempt|pg||
nt|kaapo: I didn't expect 2NT if EW play strong club, but I guess it's still an option|pg||
nt|mmmakela: grandmaproof 3 nt|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and West takes the bait|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  juicy 200?|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: S thinking hard|pg||
nt|suketbombi: in good time|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but seriously, East only bid 2@H |pg||
nt|suketbombi: safe to release ot this wud be 10 or even 1 tricks|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 11|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: N-E discussing|pg||

nt|burypies: w jakim kierunku zmierzaja?|pg||
nt|chick: majors|pg||
nt|kaapo: @S lead will bring the 8th trick|pg||
nt|kaapo: And if there are 8 there are 9, as the saying goes :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, it's teams, so not that important - as long as South is not tempted to bid 3@S|pg||
nt|joemanjo: Asihm's dbl with singlesuited hand in the first round put him in a spot later|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jkmjanusz: A ³adsna? Warto dzwoniæ?|pg||
nt|chick: in competitive bidding, I think need to give as many options to partner as you can|pg||
nt|kaapo: 800 may have been very expensive, because EW's 4@S didn't seem easy at all|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1@C strong - 1@D weak|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yes, but looking at the wrong hand as well... :)|pg||
nt|varange: says he, belatedly :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  S could expect partner with relatively long @c and @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: oh ok|pg||

nt|col3435: very much so :)|pg||
nt|col3435: nice though|pg||
nt|varange: yes|pg||
nt|xenya: double showed @Hs -- it would seem natural to bid your @S at that point|pg||
nt|othered1: Maybe the overcall will help west get trumps right|pg||
nt|othered1: for the requisite 1 imp per board|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|chick: ok, but that's not lebensohl (for the benefit of kibs)|pg||
nt|kaapo: Yes, good to make the distinction clear|pg||
nt|mmmakela: not true Kaapo, most play leb here|pg||
nt|mcphee: this game may go down|pg||
nt|kaapo: As you see, D and S are adjacent on the keyboard. Easy to make "typos" if using keyboard input when operating :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yeah, and all 13 cards are next to eachother so it´s easy to have a "clickos" for that :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: @C lead bad for the N hand|pg||
nt|kaapo: Well, you've been doing marvellously well :)|pg||
nt|varange: :) dang|pg||
nt|ralfwil: perhaps some kind of transfer|pg||
nt|varange: it seems that way|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: no alert on 1NT at least so I dont think they play it as transfer|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes and a singleton @D lead may confirm the trump position for OT|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mmmakela: N likes the lead but...|pg||
nt|col3435: good prediction - spade lead didn't look clear to me|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|chick: as long as EW cash their minor winners, this cannot make|pg||
nt|kaapo: Some might use Lebensohl here. If it's in use, then South's 3@D shows some values; he'd bid 2NT with a very weak hand|pg||
nt|varange: wow|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: east: spade lead is awkward for defence if west putsu p SJ =- declarer has 9 tricks then|pg||
nt|lestergold: well they have in the open auction started the same way but finished with south's 1N|pg||
nt|lestergold: here Howard felt he had enough for a try and that was always going to be accepted withSouth's good 9 count|pg||
nt|hlortz: n took a rosy view to raise, all his honors in his long suits looked bullish|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mmmakela: I hate playing in 4-2 when 6-1 was available(ok extreme case but 4-3 is probable)|pg||
nt|joemanjo: wow 6@c punt in the other room|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|lestergold: well club lead looks normal and beats this out of hand|pg||
pc|c4|nt|abunio: mama ladna, nie ma sprawy, tylko zajeta:)|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Mike Gold twierdzi, ¿e w Polsce dodaje sie 3BA do od¿ywek dzieciecych...|pg||
nt|kaapo: @DJ would suffer the same, too|pg||
pc|c7|nt|chick: often opponents will compete, taking partner off the hook|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so 1-suiter for me|pg||
nt|suketbombi: he is inducing Thak to cash his @H or underlead it:(|pg||
nt|suketbombi: @D can only be good for declerar here|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: dobra obrona, choæ chyba wynikaj¹ca z nieporozumienia licytacyjnego na NS|pg||
pc|c9|nt|chick: and even if 4-2, opps cannot double (else you run to hearts)|pg||
nt|varange: then the DBL must have some unknown meaning|pg||
nt|varange: how would S interpret the 3@d|pg||
nt|suketbombi: sure imp for texans|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|d2|nt|arvid: even if south is showing some values with 3@D I think his hand is too good|pg||
nt|col3435: yeah, and club is worse!|pg||
pc|d3|nt|chick: and to paraphrase your comment:   I hate playing in a 6-1 when 4-4 was available :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: any opinions from kibs? majors or 1-suiter?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  small club from table?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: oops what was that play of @Sa?|pg||
nt|lestergold: West correctly ducking to maintain communications|pg||
nt|lestergold: and declarer is left without any recourse for a ninth trick|pg||
nt|hlortz: needs the @D finesse even with @S coming in so he will probably try for 5 @D tricks 1st in which case no need teh @S finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: with west having all the entries he could have cleared clubs himself in case east only started with 2 - but declarer's 10 and Q suggest east has another one to play|pg||
nt|lestergold: West doesnt have the diamonds so the duck is surely correct and safest|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kaapo: Most do, but many don't :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 9 and next, cant take the spade hook|pg||
nt|varange: any spec who knows?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: :(|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|abunio: postanowili dac szanse kibicom na emocje do konca|pg||
nt|varange: theree's my answer|pg||
nt|suketbombi: he gets his 9th trick |pg||
pc|d5|nt|kaapo: @H10 isn't that great either|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kaapo: Nystöm could give a ruff but he would then lose his natural @C trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yeah, but that would force south to ruff a club |pg||
nt|kaapo: Seems to end +1 either way|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: true|pg||
nt|xenya: friendly lead -- 10 tricks are available now|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mmmakela: name 1 besides you|pg||
nt|kaapo: My partner, I hope ;)|pg||
nt|yuval10: @c lead actually the best....with @s return from S....|pg||
nt|lestergold: one hurdle passed giving a ray of hope|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|kaapo: And Garozzo, perhaps|pg||
pc|h3|nt|abunio: 36 boards, 3 segments, 12 boards each|pg||
nt|mmmakela: and more to the point I think S shd bid 3 H instead of 4 @S in this sequence to show his hand|pg||
nt|mcphee: nice D from west|pg||
nt|hlortz: playing on @S seems wrong but it will not matter|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|suketbombi: can make 4 now but he wont|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hlortz: i still say he should try @D 1st|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
mc|10|nt|ryskiel_: N chyba potraktowa³ 4 kier jako licytacje w kolor prxzeciwnika|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: czemu nie jest podliczone rozdanie 15? |pg||
nt|vugraphj77: juz|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: jak na 5 podliczonych rozd¹ñ wynik jest impodajny niezwykle|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: rednia pe³ne 11 imp na rozdanie|pg||
