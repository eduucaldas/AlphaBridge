nt|kareno: Yet another 3NT for n/s.  Unless they want to try 6@d depending on the losing club finesse against the queen.|pg||
nt|mrdct: if east gets into the action with @S, NS may play in 5@D which fails on the @C ruff|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct: although not clear-cut to lead the doubleton @C|pg||
nt|kareno: Hardly with KQJ of spades.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct: yes 3@H would be pass/correct|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|mrdct: i've had jenny thompson's exc excellent defence thee commended by both her current and former husbands who are in the audience|pg||

mb|2C|mb|3C|nt|mrdct: where can i get a t-shirt that says that?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|kareno: With that gaping hole in the club suit I would expect north to retreat to 4@c now.|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Hi|pg||
mb|5C|nt|mrdct: hi bill|pg||
nt|kareno: Bill :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: 5@Hx is only -300|pg||
nt|kareno: The east hand hasn't got much distribution and if west is 5/5 they could be overboard even lower than the five-level.|pg||
nt|mrdct: perhaps 500 on a trump lead|pg||
nt|mrdct: what is east thinking about here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphA2: lol no|pg||
nt|kareno: n/s need one of their patented stops on a dime here.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Stop on a 10 cent piece, please|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct: east gives this one a kiss|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bjacobs: Slam on a hook ... no big deal|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|s6|pg||
nt|kareno: Nasty to be doubled as well, however.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|s7|pc|sK|pg||
nt|mrdct: this auction has worked out well for EW, but i probably would've gone for a preempt with west's hand straight up|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, that diamond suit is hardly worth the mention.|pg||
nt|mrdct: EW play 3@H as intermediate - so 4@H was jenny thompson's only other option|pg||
nt|kareno: Not appealing either |pg||
mc|11|pg||

mb|3N!|nt|kareno: And cookies?  OOO|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|bjacobs: 3NT = 12-14 raise to 4@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Now if the defence goes passive ...|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kareno: But it is not easy.  Indeed, unless the defense messes it up, it's down one.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Then all the play will resolve around the diamond suit - trumps will be drawn, hearts cleared, and a club played|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hK|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bjacobs: E/W play two rounds of clubs, and then it gets interesting|pg||

nt|bjacobs: With the help of the hand record, of course|pg||
mb|1D|mb|d|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|mrdct: if they get to 5@D here, east can never get in to lead a @H through the K|pg||
nt|kareno: 5@d will fetch.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: 3@d weak?  That hand is something of a light limit raise IMO.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|nt|bjacobs: This is awkward for North ... too strong for 3@D preemptive, but what are the alternatives?|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sA|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|c5|pg||
nt|mrdct: let's see if di smart on the lookout for the beer card here|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|h2|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h3|pc|dQ|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|kareno: Jump raise is weak.  2NT is a limit raise with notrump potential and j/s to the other minor shows a limit raise based on distribution - no interest in notrump.|pg||
nt|kareno: I play it in my regular partnerships.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bjacobs: Seems impressive at first glance.  So 3@C on this hand?|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|pc|cT|nt|mrdct: and what's redouble?|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, showing a limit raise with distribution.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Redouble is redouble: 10+, etc|pg||
nt|kareno: Redouble is the usual.. no fit but values.|pg||
nt|mrdct: and what are the other jump shifts?|pg||
nt|kareno: Weak and natural.|pg||
nt|mrdct: new leader in a moment|pg||
nt|kareno: Or whatever you like in your partnership.. fit-showing, perhaps.|pg||
mc|11|pg||

mb|p|nt|bjacobs: And so little to show for them|pg||
nt|mrdct: looks like a nice part-score result for Creet in the closed room|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, that too.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: 1H - 1@S - 2@C - 2@H - 2@S ?|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|kareno: Or perhaps 1@h - 1@s - 2@s|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Good choice after the double, I suppose|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Maybe even without it|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: Or without a double.  Passed hand looking for clubs with spade fit already known?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The auction I suggested shows a good hand ... whether South's cards are good enough is a matter of judgment|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kareno: I meant opposite a passed hand, I would not be looking for clubs.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||

nt|bjacobs: a big prediction, young man|pg||

mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: I was about to observe that.  She has had a record number of HCP this set.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bjacobs: 11 points has been her minimum in 8 boards|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|bjacobs: If she could just swap some of those points for imps|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||

nt|mrdct: i'm told 3NT failed by 2 tricks in the other match|pg||
nt|kareno: Looks about right with clubs not breaking |pg||
nt|mrdct: we are showing one table from each of the two ladies semis at the moment|pg||

nt|mrdct: there is some system disclosre info at http://www.abf.com.au/events/playoffs/2007/OpenWom/systems.html|pg||
nt|mrdct: but it's fairly limited an on an exception basis|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm told that an opening 2NT shows a five-card major so this is how they would show an equivalent hand without one.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|mrdct: they play 2NT as a weak two-suiter without @C|pg||
nt|shevek: http://www.abf.com.au/events/playoffs/2007/OpenWom/Beale-Smart.pdf|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct: and the 2NT rebid here is indeed 21-22|pg||

nt|kareno: It's the 2NT response to 2@c that shows a five-card major.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mrdct: pin-pointing the 21 count here|pg||
