nt|jbgood: absolutely - but cards (clubs) not nicely dirsributed|pg||

nt|ralfwil: What about 1nt as first bid from S?|pg||

mb|1C|mb|1H|mb|d|nt|xenya: maybe 3@C didn't promise a strong hand in terms of points?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|2D|nt|hawe45:  But still it must promise a hand better than passing|pg||
nt|jbgood: dbl = 4+ spades|pg||
nt|xenya: take away an ace from N's hand -- wouldn't he bid 3@C?|pg||
mb|3H|mb|d|mb|3S|nt|jbgood: this N surely would, Vladimir:)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  With a 3-1 break in @C, game is makeable without that mentioned Ace|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbgood: the 3 @h bid may have announced the heart distribution - so S would have made 4 @h in comfort|pg||
mb|p|pc|sQ|pc|s3|nt|hawe45:  Not at all in comfort - must guess @D|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but still possibilities for S to misread the @c distribution and play E for Hx in @d in 4@h|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|pg||
nt|jbgood: not if he starts with the ace and another di - then he makes 4 if he guesses the hearts|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes Ralf - that would be logical having seen the @H-break|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Can one make 4 @H having then 4 loosers?|pg||

mc|12|nt|jbgood: agree with Flash and other kibs that 3@h instead of 2@d might have done the trick|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Hans! perhaps 1@d was a conventional opening|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Over 2 @C East should bid 4 @C - he has all, what West could ask for. 3 NT is not possible, then West had bid it over 1 @S|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi all.|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Jordan|pg||
nt|jcwla: Seems likely that 2@C forced 2@D, then showed invitational hand w/5 @H's by 2@H.  E could take different action over that.|pg||
nt|jbgood: they discuss the sequence - problem was that 2@c (game force) didnt promise 5 hearts... and they still wonder how they should have bid|pg||
