mb|3N|nt|poohbear: tuff from West's standpoint. South took away his 2NT ask :)|pg||

mb|4C|nt|Walddk2: EW have a 300 point save in 5@C, not a bargain|pg||
mb|4D|nt|sporteye: I think 4@D would be good here to help partner judge what to do over a likely 5@C bid|pg||
nt|petergill: Bergen raises are very popular downunder. That is not necessarily an endorsement of Bergen Raises|pg||

pc|hT|pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|Gerben42: the distribution and bad honors made West decide against 3@D|pg||
nt|poohbear: play to 3NT is interesting on a @s lead. If the defense plays 2 rounds of spades retaining an entry to the West hand . Declarer's best bet is playing a 3rd @s|pg||
nt|poohbear: even with a @h guess not clear declarer can handle it all|pg||
nt|jstokes: or some invitational sequence -- it was a weak NT|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|nt|jstokes: on the last hand, heart was led against 5@DX|pg||
nt|jstokes: in other room|pg||
pc|h6|nt|poohbear: he is off to a good start though|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|nt|poohbear: i think Declarer is getting tapped out now. Cant draw trumps and set up the red suits while West has the @h ace|pg||

pc|d4|pc|s3|nt|poohbear: failing to unblock the @s 9 might have been fatal|pg||
nt|marlowepi: was it right to lead a heart before that club?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|poohbear: West needs to pitch a @h here to keep his long @d trick or threaten a @h ruff. If declarer continues @h to the 9 I think East needs to duck it|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|poohbear: though its also OK to win the @h ace and play another @c allowing West to pitch his last @h|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c7|pc|h9|nt|Gerben42: quick 11 tricks|pg||
nt|poohbear: The defense is forced to cash @ss if they are 5-3 or else declarer can duck a @h to East|pg||
mc|11|nt|poohbear: and then declarer might have a Squeeze or a count on @cs in the end position|pg||
nt|poohbear: now declarer has a chance|pg||

mb|1S|nt|Gerben42: a nice picture of the Milne team: http://www.abf.com.au/events/not/2010/bulletins/11Sat23.pdf|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|an|!|nt|jstokes: surprised to see 1@C with 5-5 in the black suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: 3@H must be some bergenish raise|pg||
nt|marlowepi: used to be normal|pg||
mb|3C|an|!|nt|jstokes: yes, used to be....|pg||
mb|p|nt|chip: Reasonable to DBl as N. Note that if South's majors were reversed, 4H would be a good game.|pg||
mb|3D|an|!|nt|poohbear: @h lead beats this |pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: this keeps the defense in the game but I am not sure they find 7 tricks now|pg||
nt|nigel: Yep Andy is just an old fashioned guy|pg||
mb|3N|nt|chip: but may get them a bit high here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: 4@H no doubt a 2-way shot depending on who held what|pg||
nt|chip: Though looks like 4D can be made.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this does make for a tidy auction|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|5C|nt|avivs:  this might be too high|pg||
nt|nigel: Seems normmal 1@D was a transfer to hearts 1@s nat 2@d 4th suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: the @C return gave them the chance, now th @D loser is gone|pg||
nt|Gerben42: a passive @S would have been better|pg||
nt|marlowepi: makes sense|pg||
nt|marlowepi: unlikely to make|pg||
nt|nigel: pity about the bad spade break |pg||
nt|jstokes: well, 3-1 isn't all that bad ;)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: though ten of spades from dummy could lead to some interesting decisions|pg||
nt|nigel: However they are not in six yet|pg||
mb|6S|nt|jstokes: right; he knows they are missing a key card and the trump queen|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jstokes: so much for that|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel: He knows they are off the sopade queen and a key card oh well|pg||
nt|marlowepi: still belong there facing say:  AJxxx   x   xx   AKQxx|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|marlowepi: it is not 6S that is the dubious bid--once he bids 4N i agree wth 6S. but he could have gone slower to maybe find out how bullish a view was warranted|pg||
pc|dA|nt|nigel: Doubt it will be bid in the other room after say 1S - 4C, 4H- then 4S|pg||
nt|jstokes: yes, but south would cooperate fully after some sort of slam TRY with the hand you gave|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer cant afford to draw trumps till his @ss are established. This might boil down to guessing which major is 3-3|pg||
nt|nigel: Suppose it is hard to stay out of|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|marlowepi: my point is that the dubious call was 4N, not 6S|pg||
