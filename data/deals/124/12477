nt|gavin:  this is one of the greatest events in the world|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gavin:  they were on the same wavelength, 4NT pick a minor|pg||
pc|hK|nt|gavin:  East didnt want to commit to clubs or diamonds but rather offer his partner a choice|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h3|pc|h8|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|gavin:  wow|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|gavin:  that was sloppy, |pg||
nt|gavin:  browne played the 2 of hearts then the 3 of hearts|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|pc|cQ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|gavin:  to give up the contract by playing a spade is very weak|pg||
nt|gavin:  tired rather|pg||
nt|petergill: 4NT = let's get too high, I'm just a tenager, even if I'm heading towards the Grand Final of my country's National Open Teams for the first time|pg||
nt|gavin:  that person is tired at the end of the set|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|dT|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|c7|pc|d9|pg||

pc|s7|pc|s9|pc|cK|pc|h9|pg||
pc|d3|nt|petergill: NS play natural attitude|pg||
pc|hT|pc|c8|nt|vugrapha2: thanks guys, restart is at 230 |pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|cA|mc|11|nt|gavin:  ya so he discouraged then on the ace of hearts the 2nd card was suit preference ?|pg||
nt|gavin:  he could have played some card other than the 3 if he had the ace of spades|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes|pg||
nt|petergill: and his partner ignored him|pg||
nt|gavin:  payed the price|pg||
nt|gavin:  paid|pg||
nt|petergill: Bagchi played the previous set in a team of five with a different parner. I'ts quite hard when you switch from one partner to another to maintain concentration for a full 16 boards ...|pg||
nt|petergill: in a team of five|pg||
nt|gavin:  and this is a very long event and they had just had a number of bad boards leading up to that point|pg||
nt|gavin:  he played so fast it was not that he thought it through and made the wrong play|pg||
nt|gavin:  but thats when its most important to keep your focus|pg||
nt|petergill: Team Bilal have every chance in the next 32 boards that Bagchi, now that he has 48 boards in his regular partnership with Seamus, will regain composure for the next set. They need ...|pg||
nt|petergill: him to. |pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Thanks all for joining us the next set will start at 3pm |pg||

nt|petergill: The young team Milne is focussing very well indeed on the task|pg||
nt|petergill: Ages of Milne team members 17, 18, 22, 21, 23, 27 I think|pg||
