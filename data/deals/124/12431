nt|brolucius: Coyle and Simpson are listed at 12/1.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Three joing favourites, including the Hackett twins at 7/1.|pg||
nt|brolucius: ..joint...|pg||
nt|jwit: 4S likely spot for EW.  Might not be easy with distribution however.|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1H|mb|d|mb|p|nt|cicus: is this matchpoints?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|brolucius: West will bid spades now, but he has to judge how high.|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cicus: I expected 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: 2@s very careful..|pg||
pc|hK|nt|brolucius: Perhaps he should look for some spade bid between 4@S and 2@S.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|nt|jbgood: like 3 1/2?|pg||
nt|jwit: 2S should show a hand that would have jumped to 3S over 1S.  A little too good in my opinion, though 4S might be difficult with distribution|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|cicus: 2@S is usually treated as a weak rebid, just like raising 1@S to 2|pg||
pc|s6|nt|brolucius: That's not how it is normally played here.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If partner is short in hearts, you would like to bid more spades than 2. If he is not, conservatism is best at MP|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jwit: I disagree Gabor|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pg||
nt|cicus: I see Jon :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I also disagree|pg||
nt|brolucius: When you are weak, you can bid 1@S. You are not often forced to bid that with only three spades.|pg||
nt|cicus: I think it is a matter of agreement, I bid 1@S with 3 or a real junk|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|s4|nt|cicus: here waest is happy to have stayed so low|pg||
nt|brolucius: North must beware of an endplay. |pg||
nt|jwit: However, 4S is a reasonable contract on EW cards, and very difficult if not impossible to make with lie of diamond suit|pg||

pc|d8|pc|s9|pg||
nt|jbgood: Brinig even|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|c9|pg||
nt|brolucius: If declarer had exited with his heart, North would have to return a heart and could then be endplayed in clubs. But that was double-dummy, really.|pg||
mc|8|nt|Walddk2: At our other table, declarer went 2 down in 4@S|pg||
nt|jwit: That should be a very good result for EW, as most pairs will get too high|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Exactly|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Short breaks between rounds of 2 boards|pg||
nt|brolucius: The West hand was not so strong as it looked, perhaps. Even if partner was short in hearts, oposite his @HJ-x-x-x, he would need a bundle of trumps to ruff them all.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We will not shut down between rounds. Marta will insert new player names |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now Jon S, pls tell us about N-S|pg||

nt|Walddk2: He is also a fine bridge player|pg||
nt|jbgood: Martin A (S) is the former captain of the Norwegian Football team|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|d|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Now 3@D better than a third double.|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbgood: he just resigned from active play to concentrate on his coaching of VIF - a premier league team|pg||
nt|jbgood: Furunes is international for Norway (not in football:))|pg||
mb|p|pc|c7|nt|jbgood: Andresen won Life Master Pairs in San Diego with Tor Hellnes|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|jwit: This contract should fetch on time|pg||
nt|brolucius: East knew there was a fair chance that West was 4-5 in the red suits, but he did not want to bid 3@H in case this prompted West to bid again. |pg||
pc|sK|nt|brolucius: Anyway, West could be 3-3-5-2 with a high point-count.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|2D!|an|one major|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: 2@D often played as one or other major suit, single-suiter.|pg||
nt|cicus: now that's a bold reopening bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If you scroll down you can se all the results on a board as they come in|pg||
pc|s6|nt|brolucius: North bids 2@H, pass or correct. South's pass shows hearts.|pg||

pc|c3|pc|cT|pc|c4|pg||
nt|jbgood: which will be a good result|pg||
nt|jwit: Yes, EW can make 2S, and very well might have gotten there without a weak NT opener|pg||
pc|dT|nt|cicus: on a forcing game this might have gone down 2|pg||

mc|7|nt|Walddk2: End of round 2, short break|pg||
nt|brolucius: South was bold but lucky - a good combination.|pg||
nt|cicus: unimaginative defence|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.brenning.se/results/2010/london/tgrs1stauctionpairs/tgrsbridgeclub1stauctionpairs-session1.htm  will keep you updated constantly. Thanks to Tomas Brenning from Sweden|pg||
nt|jbgood: 3 @d was worth 49%|pg||
nt|brolucius: On which board?|pg||
nt|jwit: I would think this last board would be worth about 80% for NS|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 30 tables in play, so we must be prepared for pauses between rounds|pg||
nt|jbgood: I was thinking about   3 - but ... I was wrong|pg||
nt|brolucius: On BOard 3, 3@D for 110 was 23.8/58, 3@H for 140 was 39.4/58.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Andrew McIntosh - Nick Sandqvist have just been selected to play for the England Open team in Belgium this summer. European Teams Championships|pg||
nt|Walddk2: None of them English of course :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Tosh is from Scotland, Nick from Sweden|pg||
nt|brolucius: A selection that caused Roland to lose a big bet!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, Â£10|pg||
nt|brolucius: You had 1st. 2nd and reserve pair right, so your stake money shoudl have been returned. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, I had Crouch-Paterson instead of EW here|pg||
pg||

nt|jwit: If Dbl by North is penalty on this auction, I would certainly consider it, especially at matchpoints|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||
nt|brolucius: Brian Senior and his partner currently 1st. Nevena Senior and her partner 3rd.|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c8|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|d5|pc|d8|pg||
pc|c3|nt|cicus: NS seem to have 120 so X would not have been good enough if this goes down 1|pg||
pc|s3|pc|cT|pc|c7|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|pc|dT|pc|dA|pg||
nt|jwit: However, I think they could have beaten it 2|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jbgood: he is 2 sown now..|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.brenning.se/results/2010/london/tgrs1stauctionpairs/tgrsbridgeclub1stauctionpairs-session1.htm  for instant scoring|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|pc|h5|pc|h9|pg||
nt|brolucius: The more I look at the field, the more I realise what an exceptionally high quality it is. Big names everywhere.|pg||
pc|c9|pc|d9|nt|jwit: Yes, as I say if double is penalty by North, would have been the proper action, as North knows they have the majority of high card points and EW are on at best a seven card fit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I wish people in USA would watch this and see how Barometer scoring with instant scoring is no issue in Europe. It's just normal in most places|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Organizers in USA rather|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h7|pg||

mb|1N|an|12-14|mb|d|nt|jwit: If double for penalty, perhaps South should be obligated to reopen with shortness|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Tricky when you play the weak 1NT.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jwit: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: David Burn doing quite well in 9th place. No wonder since his user ID (dburn) is in spec :)   (just kidding specs, someone else on his account)|pg||
nt|brolucius: South can attempt the Bath Coup, ducking.|pg||
nt|jwit: This contract may be tough to beat|pg||
nt|cicus: then E may also duck a heart finesse|pg||
nt|cicus: personally I would have removed the X as east|pg||
nt|brolucius: If South ducks and West finds a diamond switch, a blockage will rescue declarer.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|cA|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h7|pc|hJ|pc|h5|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|s9|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|brolucius: East ducks @HK, hoping that declarer will repeat the defence and make only one heart trick. |pg||
nt|brolucius: repeat the finesse...|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
pc|c8|pc|s7|pc|d7|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h6|nt|cicus: this defence may make S wonder if @H finesse is in fact on|pg||
nt|brolucius: West is a big favourite to hold the @HK, so declarer will be reluctant to forego the finesse. |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|jbgood: now the double pays off|pg||
nt|brolucius: A diamond through will give the defence the maximum, saving West from a throw-in.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|dQ|pc|d8|pg||
pc|cT|pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c2|nt|brolucius: So, a strong defence from East, beginning with his smooth duck of the @HK.|pg||

nt|cicus: N took a position, could have been right|pg||
nt|jwit: lucky for declarer that diamond suit blocked or would have been worse|pg||
nt|cicus: when he didi not remove the X|pg||
nt|brolucius: If South could be surely 7 tricks without taking the heart finesse (I forget if this was so), he should not have taken it. That's because most pairs will play the strong 1NT and ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: will not end in 1NT doubled.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Player names with CAPITAL letters are not random. They denote seeded pairs (16 altogether)|pg||

nt|jbgood: the twins in the lead after 6 boards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That is some weak NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Much too good|pg||
nt|cicus: this one is too heavy|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: He will surely try some spectacular coup to impress me...|pg||

nt|jwit: Could easily miss a game though David, but not on this hand|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|jbgood: tu:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: When deciding whether to balance, you need to look carefully at whether the opponents are vulnerable as well as your own vulnerability. |pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|jwit: Perhaps West should have doubled 3H|pg||

nt|cicus: certainly|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And I think a heart lead stands out regardless|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|dA|pg||
nt|brolucius: East might have led a heart anyway. The @DJ may be partly a matchpoint choice, since the N/S bidding sounded strong. |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|brolucius: Both N and S were minimum for their chosen actions. |pg||

pc|c4|pc|d3|pc|c9|pc|cA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: At our other table the auction was the same and East led @H5|pg||
nt|jwit: I think I would have doubled 3H.  No other lead by partner seems good looking at that hand|pg||
nt|cicus: and the hand has a probably entry as well|pg||
nt|brolucius: East has a certain count on the North hand now.|pg||
nt|jbgood: for updated scores: http://www.brenning.se/results/2010/london/tgrs1stauctionpairs/tgrsbridgeclub1stauctionpairs-session1.htm|pg||
nt|brolucius: A heart switch does seem to be marked.|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d6|pc|s8|nt|brolucius: North has only two hearts, so East knows that West must hold two hearts higher than dummy's 9.|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|brolucius: After this weakening of his diamond holding, East has to be wary of a throw-in.|pg||
nt|brolucius: A low heart now will be risky, for example.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|nt|cicus: this is not good either, decl wins and returns|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jbgood: that was also risky|pg||
pc|s2|pg||

mc|10|nt|jwit: Didn't have to cash second diamond|pg||
nt|jbgood: strange|pg||
nt|brolucius: East could have exited with the @HQ instead of the @SQ.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT went down in our other room on the heart lead|pg||
nt|cicus: will be close to top for NS|pg||
nt|jwit: Indeed|pg||
nt|brolucius: At the moment +430 is a joint second top. Some pair made 450 in spades.|pg||
nt|jwit: No way!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 30 tables in play; we can only show 2 of them. Was impossible to find 30 operators in London|pg||
nt|brolucius: Thank goodness.|pg||
nt|jwit: 450 in spades must be one of the great results of alltime!|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@S also went three down elsewhere...|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps the defenders on the 450 table had a big bet on their opponents.|pg||
nt|jwit: lol|pg||
nt|cicus: I think NS can make 480 on careful defence,,,|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told: The lead in 4@S +1 was @S6|pg||
nt|jwit: Even on the worst defense imagineable, you would have to lose two trumps and a club|pg||

nt|Walddk2: http://www.brenning.se/results/2010/london/tgrs1stauctionpairs/tgrsbridgeclub1stauctionpairs-session1.htm|pg||
nt|jcwla: I would show values - I have a nice suit if need be so am not going to live in fear.|pg||
nt|jbgood: and a few demonstrtions of that so far this afternoon|pg||
nt|brolucius: Sally Brock and Robert Sheehan's 71.3% is some score in a field of this quality.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Still, plenty of boards to go. It is easier to do well in the first half than in the second half, as I have often proved.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Paul Hackett is West|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I have often proved that it is very easy to do well in neither half|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Seniors World Champion|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, but BBO commentators are not supposed to mention that sort of thing. BBO fondly imagine that we know what we're talking about.|pg||
nt|brolucius: "The way to avoid making idiotic remarks is to say nothing," I have been told. But I don't follow that advice.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: England were 'lucky losers' so to speak when they joined the Seniors Bowl in SÃ£o Paulo last autumn. The Netherlands did not send a team, so England replaced them  ... and won the ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: event!|pg||
nt|brolucius: As we were told before, the Eddis brothers are members of the Portland Club, where members are supposed to worship natural bidding. |pg||
nt|brolucius: The subscription is Â£100 higher if you wish to employ Stayman during the year.|pg||

nt|brolucius: Since this event is being held at TGR's, they may take advantage and surprise us with some new conventional method.|pg||
nt|brolucius: I watched Sam Stayman play once, at the Sunday Times Pairs in London. He had the look of a very wealthy man.|pg||

mb|3C|mb|4H|nt|Walddk2: Yes, I will be disappointed if they don't bid 7@H|pg||
nt|brolucius: The spade discard is useful and the one on the hearts is not, as Jon says.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East not bothering with 4@C|pg||
mb|5C|nt|jbgood: right denomination will pay off|pg||
mb|6H|nt|brolucius: I am told: a friend of mine once went to a stayman party in his manhattan home and gushed how beautiful a place it was then asked Sam if he owned the building and Stayman ADMITTED ...|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: THE WHOLE BLOCK!|pg||

pc|d2|pc|dA|mc|11|nt|jbgood: your betting object is 35th after 18 David, not to worry, there aree boards left:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Only one pair bid 6@H on Board 17, (where South had the wasted @DK-Q-J-10-x-x). One down when the trumps misbehaved.  It was a blanket of 450s.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last round of the first session coming up, so a few words of ''thank you's'' are in order|pg||
nt|Walddk2: First, many thanks to Marta Sikora, our brilliant operator at TGR's in London. Great job!|pg||
nt|jbgood: superb|pg||
nt|brolucius: Of course it was a joke, Jon, to say that I would bet on David Burn. He is the guy who has never agreed with a word of mine when co-commentating on BBO.  Usually he right, I dare ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: say, but it is not a very pleasant thing to do.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Brock-Sheehan just crept below 70%  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Also thanks to my excellent fellow commentators: Jon Sveindal, David Bird, Mike Graham, Jordan Chodorow, GÃ¡bor SzÃ¶ts and Jon Wittes|pg||
nt|brolucius: And to Roland, of course, for doing all the organisation.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Finally, our gratitude to TGR's Bridge Club for bringing this inaugural event to BBO. Marilyn Malinowska and David Burn have been instrumental in setting up a fine show|pg||
nt|jcwla: Thanks to all of the above and to all specs.|pg||
nt|jbgood: Tu for resting my soul, David, I was worried for you ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, an excellent event and they raised a splendid field for it.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: running scores at http://www.brenning.se/results/2010/london/tgrs1stauctionpairs/tgrsbridgeclub1stauctionpairs-session1.htm|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Play will resume in about 45 minutes with another session of 22 boards. Welcome back then. But still boards 21 and 22 to come|pg||
nt|brolucius: The Polish pair, Chmurski and Puczynski, (who were joint second favourites in the betting odds that I was sent) are doing well, in 3rd place.|pg||
