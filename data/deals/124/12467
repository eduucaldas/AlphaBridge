mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dT|nt|jbgood: First to BBO and Roland Wald, and Bergen Akademiske Bridgeklubb, for broadcasting this prestigious event. And the Tournament  Committee leader, David Ueland, and his two stalwart ...|pg||
nt|jbgood: helpers, Kåre Beyer Kristiansen and Oddmund Midtbø.|pg||
nt|xenya: a most natural but unlucky lead|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|xenya: likely to happen at almost all tables i think|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|jbgood:  And of course a big thank you to our eminent and flawless Operator, TorO Reistad, very well done!|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h9|pg||
nt|hantveit: can get 11 tricks now|pg||
nt|vugraphzbv: thx jon|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c6|nt|xenya:  well done|pg||
nt|jbgood: Also thank you fellow commentators (too many have been in to mention you all by name) for devoting your time and expertise. Well done tou you too! |pg||
nt|hantveit: now 10 is max if south use the ace and contine clubs|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, seems he played the @CK too early -- a @H finesse looks much better -- and it's quite safe|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|xenya: now he he's got another chance|pg||
nt|hantveit: lost chances for the brothers, it will probably end up with 11 now|pg||

nt|hantveit: sorry, father and son :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jbgood: .. and finally a big hand to our excellent audience, for your interesting inputs! |pg||
mc|10|nt|hantveit: strange to continue clubs after the break from south, east should know south has the ace|pg||
nt|xenya: seems declarer got a completely wrong picture  here -- well everybody's tired of course|pg||
