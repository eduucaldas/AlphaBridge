mb|4C|mb|4H|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|athene: nice sensible 2@C from south makes this easy|pg||

nt|roswolf: west is one of the world championship team and her partner is a solid performer in ebu competitions|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: Slightly delayed start as the ladies gathered, but we're on our way now.|pg||
nt|roswolf: do we know the systems|pg||
nt|viren169: Nice 7@S yesterday missed by most pairs|pg||
nt|eggy: Hello everyone and welcome back to the Young Chelsea Bridge Club in West London|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good afternoon all|pg||
nt|eggy: for the 3rd session of the Women's trials for the Home internationals|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: eankings are on the website|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: rankings|pg||
nt|eggy: http://www.ebu.co.uk/results/2010January-July/LadyMilneTrials/index.htm|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|vugraphzda: Afraid not|pg||
nt|viren169: off we go here|pg||
mb|2C|nt|garnetts: who ever dealt this was unkind |pg||
nt|viren169: Will West pull it?|pg||
nt|garnetts: really tough hand to start with |pg||
nt|viren169: pass... opps always lead a maj on this auction!|pg||
nt|garnetts: ironically a club lead beats 5@D but not 3NT|pg||
nt|viren169: 3N is cold...|pg||
nt|roswolf: The trials are to determine the England teams for the Lady Milne in Manchester in April. |pg||
nt|garnetts: Thats why it is tough if west pulls |pg||
nt|roswolf: England will have two teams in Manchester because they are hosting the event.   |pg||
nt|viren169: Would you pull?|pg||
nt|garnetts: My view she probably should as from her point of veiw a club lead looks obvious |pg||
nt|roswolf: Pairs finishing 1, 2 and 3 will be |pg||
nt|garnetts: also a @D slam may be cold with a stiff club opposite |pg||
nt|roswolf: selected for the England team, pairs from 4 onwards will be invited to play in the EBU team, which is self-funding.  |pg||
nt|viren169: My vote is pass... the opps have to find the right lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: agree with you there|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: Jajjer thinking long |pg||
nt|vugraphzda: Jagger|pg||
nt|roswolf: she is a very deliberate player especially on big boards|pg||
mb|2H|nt|daman: looks like 4@H for NS     E will need to lead a @C and then give partner a ruff to beat it|pg||
nt|roswolf: pessimist9ic view by south|pg||
nt|garnetts: I know it fails here but the pull is much better bridge|pg||
nt|viren169: ouch...|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@D asking for a singleton was perhaps better |pg||
nt|roswolf: The 20 pairs will play 6 board rounds against each other pair.  The scores will be cross-imped, with a maximum of +25 IMPs available to the winners and no limit on the minus score ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: for the losers.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: neat little slam for NS to start with |pg||
mb|3C|mb|3H|nt|mdgraham: bye all - off to Open|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Decalrer needs to guess well in clubs to make ten tricks|pg||
nt|viren169: Good dble...|pg||
nt|roswolf: unlucky board for the leaders|pg||
nt|garnetts: West has been very unlucky in my view |pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|roswolf: might be vindicated by the club ruff which is available|pg||
nt|daman: I would have bid game if only to test the waters|pg||
nt|daman: only if the led a @C|pg||
nt|cuttysark: North is generally quite an exciting bidder - South will have seen some of her more imaginative pre-empts before|pg||
nt|roswolf: game will be the popular choice i think|pg||
nt|eggy: NS are both European Champions and Heather Dhondy, of course is a reigning world champion|pg||
nt|roswolf: slam wont be missed now|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: The 20 pairs will 6 board rounds against each other pair.  The scores will be cross-imped, with a maximum of +25 IMPs available to the winners and no limit on the minus score for ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: the losers.|pg||
nt|eggy: Margeret James won the european under her former name of Margeret Courtney|pg||
pc|hA|nt|cuttysark: So obviously you would not play a club to the jack, then one to the king if you were declarer?|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h4|nt|viren169: bad luck...|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|eggy: Well bid I thhink, although, as often, the intervention helped a bit|pg||
mc|12|nt|rnmalik: Hello all. By and large the same sequence in both the rooms and the result|pg||
pg||
qx|o2|st||md|4SKT63HKT75DKJ7CK3,SQ8HQ843DAT9CJ964,SJ2HA62DQ8643CQ87,SA9754HJ9D52CAT52|sv|n|nt|mdgraham: You can envisage that being flat across the field, but somehow that never seems to happen |pg||
nt|jtr: I am really concerned about him|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|athene: 1nt should be easy enough for NS |pg||
mb|p!|mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: 1@C 2+ also makes diamonds a suit. Usually 5, but can be 4 with 4441 hands|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: support double?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks an easy 1N rebid for South |pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Well, one would normally pass to show the weak NT|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I am not a big fan of support doubles as it is, and I think they are even more useless after 1@D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you could, I suppose - but 1N shows what you have quite nicely|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mdgraham: a balanced hand with a decent spade stop|pg||
nt|dburn: question of whether 1NT is a maximum weak no trump with spade stops or whether it shows better than a strong no trump|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, maybe it is ok with a near maximum and 1.75 stops|pg||
nt|athene: some play 1nt as the support double, in fact|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, i saw that the other day and i like it|pg||
nt|dburn: sound even worse than support doubles|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pc|hA|pg||
nt|dburn: and nothing is worse than support doubles|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|jtr: At least it is a bid that need not have another meaning|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|nt|mdgraham: why has declarer knocked out the entry to her diamonds? |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: One could argue that 1NT should show 18-19 and that you pass with a weak NT|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|dburn: because they are trumps, perhaps|pg||
nt|jtr: Tend to double with 18/19 and bid 2NT with a good suit and 17+|pg||
nt|mdgraham: oh yes - well spotted|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|nt|mdgraham: all this talk about 1NT |pg||

pc|s5|pc|sT|nt|Walddk2: http://www.ebu.co.uk/results/2010January-July/LadyMilneTrials/index.htm  for standings after two sessions|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pairs finishing 1, 2 and 3 will be selected for the England team, pairs from 4 onwards will be invited to play in the EBU team|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|jtr: Before you arrived David, we were wondering if you could tell us anything about E/W|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|nt|Walddk2: and N-S for that matter|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dT|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, i knew a bit anout them|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East comes from Essex - not sure about West|pg||
nt|jtr: about|pg||
nt|dburn: both young players - one from Durham University and one from Cambridge, I believe|pg||

nt|roswolf: the score shown is only for interest|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: We're playing 4 6-board matches this evening but are presenting it as one long 24-board match. This means that we'll pause every 6 boards and change the names but the running score ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: will continue.|pg||
nt|viren169: not sure everyone will open 3N with East's hand.|pg||
nt|garnetts: since it is good bridge to pull maybe will happen elsewhere too|pg||
nt|viren169: ummmmmmmmm|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes indeed not too much wrong with 1@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|daman: that must be an intermediate 2@S opening|pg||
nt|roswolf: intermediate opening|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Tough for NS to reach 4@H now|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|garnetts: Have to say if you do not open 3NT with that--then you might as well use it for something else|pg||
nt|viren169: E/W will be trying to get something back in the next few boards|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|daman: EW would have bid 4@S over 4@H|pg||
nt|daman: insurance|pg||
nt|cuttysark: excellent result for EW - a 1@S openers might not achieve this|pg||
nt|daman: this is a bonus|pg||
nt|eggy: Presumably 2C is a limited 3 card raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: I didn't see an alert|pg||
nt|eggy: Just my intuition :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dT|nt|roswolf: I TRUST THIS IS FINIS|pg||
nt|viren169: Not everyone's opening on East's hand|pg||
nt|eggy: It doesn;t seem like a convention well suited to string NT, 4 card majors though|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: Margaret thought she was a passed hand .... Drury|pg||
nt|eggy: or at least not if you do it with this hand|pg||
pc|d3|nt|roswolf: e/w should play normal bridge they will be given presents by other pairs in this long event|pg||
nt|garnetts: sneaky lead |pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|eggy: Tough lead for West actually|pg||
pc|dK|nt|roswolf: 4th highest etc wasnt it|pg||
nt|garnetts: send one back and a low club will test west|pg||
nt|viren169: South will assume Pd has led from the K|pg||
nt|roswolf: as a genral point it is apparently correct that if you lead 4th highest of your longest and strongest suit you will defeat contracts of any tupe about 52% of the time which is why ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: i do so when i am in doubt about what to lead!!|pg||
nt|copeyj: Maybe not Gad, if she can see dummy|pg||
nt|copeyj: gm all btw :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|viren169: sorry K in dummy|pg||
nt|eggy: J9xx is not many peoples cup of tea vs NT, so a diamond is quite reasonable|pg||
pc|d4|nt|garnetts: a low heart has been suggested by Georgia Ray--and then a low club--that will test anyone|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|c4|nt|daman: we were right about the first board|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cT|nt|daman: NS lost 6|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|eggy: but hasn't worked out well at all, although on the hand I don;t think 8 tricks were going to prove too taxing|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|c8|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d9|pc|dQ|pc|s4|pg||
pc|d8|nt|cuttysark: Decalrer there ran @C9 on the first round of the suit. Intersting line|pg||
nt|daman: wow|pg||
nt|daman: would be sick losing to Q10 doubleton|pg||
nt|cuttysark: That uis decalrer at the other table that is being broadcast. There are lost of tables in play|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s3|nt|garnetts: Great lead--and for once got a reward--EW under a lot of pressure now|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|eggy: perhaps you may misguess spades though and lose 3C, 1D and 2 spades|pg||
mc|9|nt|daman: claim|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes 20 pairs playing|pg||
nt|eggy: still the case I suppose|pg||

mb|2C|mb|2S|nt|jtr: 5@c?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hard to keep South out of 5@c now|pg||
mb|5C|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: not sure about that double - may be to discourage East from bidding more spades, but...|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Was 1@h 4+cards?|pg||

nt|jtr: In which case i am less sure about the double|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|pc|h5|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|athene: cashing that spade looks like a bit of a panic|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one trick gone|pg||
mc|9|nt|dburn: indeed - not sure what the rush was to do that|pg||
nt|jtr: Or the @dA come to that|pg||

nt|daman: NS might try to slither into 3NT on this|pg||
nt|viren169: well defended by N/S|pg||
nt|garnetts: some good bridge played here first two hands |pg||
nt|vugraphzda: Misbid, not misinformation|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|garnetts: Not keen on this opening bid though|pg||
mb|2C|nt|viren169: Dbl or 3@D?|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|eggy: Yes - the "forgot I hadn't passed" worked well :)|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|garnetts: Don't necessarily want a spade lead and the stiff K might have been trash |pg||
nt|roswolf: remember the score you can see is only a very rough guide |pg||
nt|roswolf: The 20 pairs will play 6 board rounds against each other pair.  The scores will be cross-imped, with a maximum of +25 IMPs available to the winners and no limit on the minus score ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: for the losers.|pg||
nt|viren169: Singleton K not so good|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|roswolf: the last boardseems likely to be played in some number of spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: West will be checking the cards - how often do you hold @CAQ doubleton?|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: I suppose, for the sake of the BBO archives, we should say who is playing as this might be lost if we change the names later. For boards 1-6 we have Tracy Capal (North), Kath ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: Nelson (South), Susanna Gross (East) and Sally Brock (West).|pg||
nt|daman: 3NT now?|pg||
nt|roswolf: well she is nv and it is a biodders game nowadays|pg||
nt|roswolf: bidders|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: 2@S is presumably strong but not game-forcing by a passed hand. North is maximum, but will be wondering where the tricks might come from|pg||
nt|viren169: trump lead is good here|pg||
nt|viren169: or switch|pg||
nt|garnetts: This is a sound indication as to why 1@S was a poor opening --forced to rebid a queen high suit |pg||
nt|viren169: As someone said if u are dealt AK... you do not have to look for for any other lead|pg||
nt|viren169: North could have bid 3@S|pg||
nt|garnetts: Also I prefer 3@D to double|pg||
nt|viren169: It is a pushy 4@S|pg||
nt|viren169: 2@S didnt promise 6?!?!|pg||
nt|roswolf: doesnt seem to be enough tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: south's trump pips arent quite good enough|pg||
nt|garnetts: What else would you suggest over 2@S ---poor North can hardly imagine a 2@S rebid is on Q10xxx---likely to have seen a 2NT rebid with just five spades too |pg||
nt|viren169: 8 of @S would have been nice|pg||
nt|viren169: 3@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: well it is a filthy opening bid + north good reasonably expect more|pg||
nt|garnetts: Cut to the chase--if North thought south held hearts then would have expected 2NT not 2@S which in my view is a much better bid than 2@S |pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe a furth argument for passing initially|pg||
nt|garnetts: Better to pass than to be forced to rebid Q10xxx|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair comment|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rnmalik: playable contract|pg||
pc|c6|nt|eggy: looks like this shouldn't be a problem with spades providing an discard by behaving nicely|pg||

nt|eggy: discards I should say|pg||

nt|roswolf: the losers.|pg||
nt|daman: -17   according to the score|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@H for NS but difficult to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: another potential freak hand|pg||
nt|viren169: 1-2-3@S?|pg||
nt|eggy: Margeret may opt to open 1nt|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: That is with one table, where NS are doing everything right. There are 10 tables in play|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but the score is only a very rough guide - 10 tables in plat|pg||
nt|eggy: I'm pretty sure the weak no trumpers will|pg||
mb|1N|nt|viren169: 2 sounds about right|pg||
nt|garnetts: South is more trusting then me |pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: I might have mentioned an 8 card suit |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: it seems to me that the 3 contracts played here will be below par across the field|pg||
pc|c5|nt|daman: for NS|pg||
nt|eggy: The likely most common outcome ..|pg||
nt|eggy: although "semi" forcing no trumpers may get a bit entangled|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and with QJ@H it makes|pg||
pc|c2|nt|roswolf: not my idea of a vul overcall|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 2@D is unlucky - shortage of aces and 3 trump losers. Ohmwell|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|viren169: 3@C looks ok for the lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: dont understand south;s silence|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|garnetts: I cannot undertsand how anyone who has paid an entry fee could pass throughout with the South hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: suit blocked|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|pc|c3|nt|roswolf: well i think 2@D is silly in ythe pass out seat at this form of scoring|pg||
nt|daman: one of the aces is in trumps    she might have a chance to make this|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|c9|nt|cuttysark: Partner is marked with values when opponents stop low, and may make a catastrophic lead against 1NT|pg||
nt|daman: will need a miracle endplay|pg||
nt|roswolf: well with spade ruffs rhis could be horrible|pg||
nt|viren169: probably would have kept E/W out of the making 3N|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c6|nt|rnmalik: but then S will not have an entry to cash the @H|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|eggy: Despite the lucky heart position, S will have to duck the 2nd round of course|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hJ|nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|eggy: so -2 looks normal, whereas you shoulkd be able to make 2H|pg||
pc|h7|nt|cuttysark: I think I would have tried to sneak a diamond - get rid of the club on a spade|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|pc|hT|mc|6|nt|garnetts: 4@C might even make too --needs accurate defence|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|jtr: I see the point of 1@h but you might not have a rebid|pg||
nt|dburn: well, they can get them into the auction now...|pg||
nt|dburn: ...but maybe West's double would have had more to do with the lead than with a save|pg||
nt|athene: double of 4@C might have been for a spade lead or something|pg||
mb|4D|nt|dburn: meanwhile, North has a pretty good hand facing a real splinter and not the joke splinter that South actually has|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I think double should indicate a save at these colours|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mdgraham: you feel that West might have doubled 4@C, but maybe that's looking at the East hand as well |pg||
nt|athene: yes, optimal agreement might be to have x of splinter save-suggesting only at favourable, else lead for one of the other suits, but that's quite a lot to discuss|pg||
nt|jtr: Considering 4NT now maybe|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Apparently, Fawcett's splinter is not limited since Moore bid 4@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: No 1@s overcall and she has xxx@h|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: funny, this - if North had opened 1@S South could have bid 4@C as well|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|dburn: mind you, the @s8 lead would in practice beat four, but is not very likely to be found|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not without looking at the hand records |pg||
nt|jtr: If East cn find the @s8 lead then North can find the 9 from dummy|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||

pc|hA|pc|c8|nt|Walddk2: As West could have done here too, admittedly|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|pg||

nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: they were winners so natural to chuck them instead of losers!|pg||
nt|eggy: A better hand for the weak NT opener then - Roland will not be impressed :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|roswolf: e/w need to be disciplined here|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|roswolf: another roland type slam on here|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: I play was fast, I wasn't watching the discards which were irrelevant anyway|pg||
nt|viren169: probably stop in 3N|pg||
nt|eggy: Another awkward opeing bid hand|pg||
mb|d|nt|daman: would we all have bid 2@C on this auction?|pg||
nt|roswolf: of course only roland and i would bid such slams!|pg||
nt|viren169: and make them!|pg||
mb|4S|nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|viren169: 6@C is much better than 6@d|pg||
nt|garnetts: Funny my ex-partner Bob Rowlands was exactly the same--only good slam was one that makes |pg||
nt|viren169: nothing wrong with that!|pg||
nt|roswolf: great philosophy|pg||
nt|viren169: And a fine judgement he has too!|pg||
nt|garnetts: Maybe 2@C is asking for five card majors --and then explore |pg||
nt|viren169: What is East thinking about?|pg||
mb|5C|mb|d|nt|cuttysark: No - for me 2@C here shows the majors|pg||
nt|roswolf: some pairs over a 1nt overcall play a 2 suiter gadget|pg||
nt|cuttysark: cards lying well - EW have missed game|pg||
nt|eggy: This will be very cheap if they double it ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: indeed but the field wont be in it|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed very cheap|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: I play it shows both majors|pg||
nt|cuttysark: In the 5-card major style you probably canot afford to bid 2@C natural - but when clubs mean clubs...|pg||
nt|roswolf: i play as heats and anor|pg||
mb|p|pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|viren169: I fear they will find their 5-3 fit ahead of 4-4  fit|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: East wasn't thinking about 2@S I didn't see bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes they will need divine inspiration|pg||
nt|viren169: David, Pay attention!|pg||
nt|garnetts: depends upon whether 3@C showed both minors |pg||
nt|viren169: 6@c is not a walk in the park|pg||
pc|hT|nt|garnetts: 3@D might have been a relay |pg||
nt|roswolf: a few molehills to enconter|pg||
nt|roswolf: encounter|pg||
nt|garnetts: I have to say ---being rather lazy --after 2@S I would have made the game try of 3NT |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|viren169: I suspect West will pass or correct to 5@D with poor clubs|pg||
nt|viren169: we'd have nothing to talk about then!|pg||
nt|eggy: That was a good decision I think, although it will go down 2|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|nt|roswolf: the hand is perfect layout for game|pg||
pc|sK|nt|viren169: let's see how West tackles this for 11/12 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: 3@C Baron I think|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|daman: 2@D X  -1      cost only 2 IMPs|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|pc|sT|pc|h9|pg||
nt|roswolf: well that will help|pg||
nt|rnmalik: but vul against non vul-bit costly|pg||
pc|cA|nt|viren169: East even|pg||
nt|eggy: but, assuming that S started with SK, there would be a case for a successful diamond view I think|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: If you can play a diamond the the 8 spot, I can lead a diamond and give a ruff later|pg||

nt|mdgraham: odd, that - surely @S2 was encouraging |pg||
nt|Walddk2: should have been smaller|pg||
nt|dburn: but that @s2 was supposed to be encouraging, so this defence looks a bit odd, as well as more than a bit unsuccessful|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe it was count on the King?|pg||
nt|jtr: In which case the A would have been better|pg||
mc|11|nt|dburn: maybe it was, true|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Whatever you play, you should never stop playing bridge|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The king must surely be from AK|pg||
nt|athene: in the other room it was similiar|pg||
nt|athene: except NS actually cashed three spades|pg||
nt|athene: and *then* north went back to a heart|pg||
nt|jtr: 3 only?|pg||
nt|athene: @SK collected the @S6 from south|pg||
nt|athene: then @SQ, @SA, heart|pg||
nt|jtr: What is all this K playing?|pg||
nt|athene: my guess is, in the other room, north thought that @S6 was just to encourage, from @SQ62|pg||
nt|jtr: Then play the 9 back after the Q|pg||
nt|athene: have firm agreements about when your card is count and when it's attitude, is my recommendation|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Easy, play count at the 5 and 6-level, rest attitude|pg||
nt|athene: people who say "we tell partner what we think he wants to know" just give games away every five minutes through these misunderstandings - you need explicit agreements about what ...|pg||
nt|athene: information you are giving|pg||
nt|athene: the point is, even if you work out what information partner does need to know, partner then needs to work out what you worked out he wants to know|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Or lead second through declarer, then all is clear|pg||
nt|athene: as a spec points out, in the other room south might cash the @HA before returning the third spade, if he held it, in some situations|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then you know K is from AK and A from no K|pg||
nt|jtr: I never know what my partner wants to know anyway|pg||
nt|jtr: usually it is where his glasses are and there is no signal for that|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Scores before this match are available on http://www.ebu.co.uk/results/2010January-July/LadyMilneTrials/index.htm|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Two new pairs coming to our table shortly|pg||
nt|athene: if you look at e.g. meckstroth-rodwell's card, it's really specific - things like "if we are defending notrumps and third hand can't beat dummy's queen or lower, he does this..."|pg||
nt|mdgraham: partner often wants to know when you are going to go to the bar  |pg||
nt|athene: rather than just "we give attitude or count or suit-preference depending how we feel at the time"|pg||

mb|p|nt|cuttysark: This will not go well, but no double, no trouble|pg||

nt|viren169: looks like some form of bergen here|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Agreed, but it has kept EW out of trouble|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|viren169: and 3@H as return GT|pg||
nt|viren169: not a great fan of bergen I take it David?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|garnetts: Clearly West has good cause to re-evaluate this garbage 10 count with the $@S bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: doomed contract|pg||

pc|h3|nt|garnetts: 4@S i mean |pg||

nt|vugraphzda: I've got a mobile phone too. And I'm a man. I'm breaking all the rules.|pg||
nt|daman: the score indicates  NS were shut out   at least at this table|pg||

mb|p|nt|daman: o|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think double. you can control most auctions, and if opps outbid you in spades double does a better job of protecting spade queen|pg||

nt|viren169: boooooooooooooooooo|pg||
nt|marlowepi: greedy? is this matchpoints?|pg||
nt|viren169: or even 6@C|pg||
nt|garnetts: totally agree Marshall |pg||
nt|roswolf: no cross-imps|pg||
nt|viren169: no... |pg||
nt|roswolf: The 20 pairs will play 6 board rounds against each other pair.  The scores will be cross-imped, with a maximum of +25 IMPs available to the winners and no limit on the minus score ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: for the losers.|pg||

nt|marlowepi: not that she rates to of course|pg||
nt|viren169: unlikely|pg||
nt|garnetts: But the point is well made --ducking doesn't look wrong unless he is trying to sneak a nineth trick|pg||

mb|3N|an| |nt|sybarra: why 2 @D?|pg||
nt|sybarra: pard announced majors|pg||
nt|sybarra: at least let me tell her my preference|pg||
nt|cuttysark: For me that says I have a load of diamonds and no majors|pg||
nt|eggy: presumably that is a 3NT raise without a stop|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: well i have the suit and dont have 4 of a major but should have tolerance for one of them|pg||
nt|cuttysark: think North might have tried to reach 3NT - could bid 3@H to see if partner could help out in spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: I expect 2@c shows 5-5, so I think you're allowed to support with 3 cards.|pg||

nt|roswolf: and i like indicating a good lead for pard|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Which is no good here since you would never pass 2@H|pg||
nt|sybarra: well if pard bid it with 5/4   I really still want to play it in my 4/3  given that hand|pg||

nt|cuttysark: If Michelle took this line I believe it is the best one single dummy. Unlucky|pg||

nt|cuttysark: After the 3@H overcall unlikely that West has Kxxx in clubs|pg||

pc|c7|nt|roswolf: but also likely trups 3-1 or worse|pg||

nt|henryb:  no play|pg||
mb|3H|nt|viren169: me neither...|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: I think I would too - partner might have a more suitable hand. The 2NT response at the other table gave North room for 3@C|pg||

mb|p|nt|po-s: no waay to enter hand except with club ruffs|pg||

nt|jcwla: I have no idea what boards Rounds 12 and 13 correspond to, but hi all.|pg||
nt|henryb:  I have a set of old Contract Bridge Journals, and they looked with approval on bidding like this|pg||

nt|ady: trump lead best|pg||
nt|lestergold: Of course she can stand 5C if partner doesnt like spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Eggers!!|pg||
mb|5C|nt|lestergold: 5H wouild normally be on on the N/S cards but with this break it cant make|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|eggy: That's a pretty tigerish double though i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: this could well make ....and very pushy X |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well west decides to go for glory|pg||
nt|cuttysark: A vulnerable game|pg||
nt|cuttysark: She has 3 trump, a high card and a ruffing value - could be worse|pg||
nt|roswolf: her boldness may well pay off|pg||
nt|pelu: when decl try the @D-ruff S will take @H10 - then a @s-discard - but now decl has to play 2x@H before the @S-ruff (enter on @CK)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: This may have needed a spade lead|pg||
pc|dK|nt|eggy: But beating 5C may prove tricky|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: I very much doubt it will make|pg||
nt|eggy: as West knows the club position I think|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sybarra: a lot to do ...on both side|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|eggy: Looks like the breaks mean that, although the top losers are low, the winners are a bit on the short side as well|pg||
pc|c3|nt|pelu: correct Liz - a @S-lead would defeat|pg||
nt|roswolf: not obvious i think|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|roswolf: although it is 4th highest!:)|pg||
nt|ady: cant see more than 9 tricks   3 hearts 2 spades 3 diamonds and 1 club|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d4|pc|c6|pc|d3|pg||
nt|lestergold: Well holding up the ace of spades for three rounds may prove awkward|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|nt|eggy: as David has now explained in detail :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: now shortened her own trumps  probably not best|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|jcwla: This was not the winner.|pg||
nt|eggy: playing spades I think, would have worked better|pg||
pc|dA|nt|eggy: That's was a wise decision, East will end up with a spade loser for -1|pg||
nt|lestergold: I expected here to play on spades|pg||
nt|eggy: I think she is a trick short now|pg||
nt|lestergold: I do not thinkl she can now enjoy more than one spade and three club tricks now that is onmly ten tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think she played this tricky hand rather too quickly|pg||
nt|eggy: well to be fair, if the spades were wrong, she might have gone for more off on that line I suppose|pg||
nt|lestergold: well do you play to m,ake at the risk of going more off or do you play to scramble tricks|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|roswolf: double wierd|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|cuttysark: East convinvced that the heart finesse was not working|pg||

pc|hJ|pg||

nt|cuttysark: She had seen 9 points, but it was likely that South had @HK to make up the numbers|pg||
nt|eggy: Both Of NS have been bringing on their game by strides in recent years playing in professional partnerships ... |pg||
nt|eggy: It will be interesting to see how they perform in this event I think|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes indeed|pg||
nt|jcwla: But aren't the "A" and "B" scores carryover from several other matches with other teams?|pg||
nt|eggy: For those unaware - the BBO score is only an indication|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh well I am not sure of the implications then for E/W as a pair a small setback clearly|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: J & S had dropped to 5th place after a poor last match|pg||

nt|eggy: scores are on http://www.ebu.co.uk/results/2010January-July/LadyMilneTrials/index.htm|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Where is Roland to discuss the meritrs of this slam?|pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting 4 @S potential here|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S for n/s|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|roswolf: well within his odds and mine too!|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: North led @HA in the other room - I now I would get hearts wrong|pg||
nt|roswolf: well a gadget has struck|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Know, even|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Trans fer break to a source of tricks, or perhaps a general break - seems normal|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think it would be normal to get them wrong|pg||
nt|cuttysark: East is not about to get excited anyway|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 nt not all bad either  from N |pg||
nt|sybarra: skip that,  dont think she can handle it |pg||
nt|jcwla: 2@H or 2NT poss'l here|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6C on for N/S a little better scoring than 3D in the open room|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: maybe 1nt by north|pg||
mb|2N|nt|lestergold: You would expect at least a game to be bid on these values 3N cant be touched|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|roswolf: well you never know -east is very imaginative|pg||
nt|roswolf: but not today|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: pretty good from either side I suppose, perhaps harder for EW to avoid a heart blockage if by N though, as you say|pg||
mb|3D|nt|lestergold: I cannot comprehend why Brock in the open passed this out in 3D it ws a very pessimistic view|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: now 10 or 12 tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: oh well!|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jcwla: If 3@C is fragmenting out, should cause reconsideration of 3NT.  Seemed instead to be Leb-ish.|pg||
nt|lestergold: what do I know!|pg||
nt|eggy: Still I don't think you can make 6C on a diamond lead, and it's pretty poor on any lead of course|pg||
nt|lestergold: After reverse I think Brunner has made two very weak bids and has failoed to do justice to her hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: yeh but 5c or 3N is reasonable eggers|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: I will pass on your views to Michelle, Mike  :-)|pg||

nt|lestergold: 7 points with 5 card suit whether norths 3c was fourth suit or shape describing either way surely 3N isthe money bet|pg||

nt|ady: part score hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: The 20 pairs will play 6 board rounds against each other pair.  The scores will be cross-imped, with a maximum of +25 IMPs available to the winners and no limit on the minus score ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: for the losers.|pg||
nt|jcwla: I would sooner bid 5@C than 3NT if 3@C shows this.|pg||
nt|lestergold: ok Jordan but not 'sign off' in 3D|pg||
nt|eggy: I'm not sure that 3D is "sign off", just descriptive|pg||
nt|jcwla: It was a deep position - could have been right on some hands perhaps -- to me depends on meaning of 3@C.|pg||
nt|lestergold: Good point Jordan|pg||
nt|eggy: The problem from Michelle's perspective I think was, either there was no source of tricks or..|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1N|nt|eggy: N held a singleton spade|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: strange that W in OR only bid 5@C - why not a cuebid in 4@s?|pg||
nt|roswolf: THE OPEN ROOM SEQUENCE LOOKS ODD|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 4@C would normally be a solid suit. |pg||
nt|eggy: Standings at start of play today are on http://www.ebu.co.uk/results/2010January-July/LadyMilneTrials/index.htm|pg||
nt|ady: eithert 2 spades for e/w   or maybe a diamond contract for n/s|pg||

pc|d9|nt|sybarra: my last hand all ,  thx and great fun!|pg||
pc|d4|nt|roswolf: a reverse 2@S perhaps|pg||
nt|roswolf: would be better|pg||

nt|eggy: Looks like it showed a strong NT type though|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes normal treatment|pg||
nt|eggy: not that Nevena is interested|pg||
