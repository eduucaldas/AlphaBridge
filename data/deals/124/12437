nt|vugraph814: You think right Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Systems please?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|hawe45:  We might start with 3 NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Hi, everybody!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  hi|pg||
nt|vugraph814: EW 5card M, 15-17|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  What is Pass over 1 @S?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Walddk2: What is East's second pass all about?|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: I don't like East's 2nd round pass there|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|othered1: Maybe they play it forcing?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now he is trying to catch up|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I think, that East didÂ´nt want to bid 2 @D - but why not 2 @C?|pg||
nt|vugraph814: Gad tends to fly by the seat of his pants a lot|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraph814: Oh dear|pg||
nt|patricck: Not flying this time.......   more like crash and burn|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Might make...|pg||
nt|vugraph814: I suppose there is some logic in this being natural if East weren't a passed hand|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, with all the cards well placed for EW, NS might have trouble making 6 tricks|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|d3|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|nt|Walddk2: I think it should be natural by an unpassed hand|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c9|pg||
pc|hA|nt|patricck: a trump lead was crucial for the defence|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h4|nt|othered1: I can't come up with a reason to take 2@S as natural, unless north is a psycher.  East's passed hand status eliminates many possibilities|pg||

nt|tejjyid: that's a flaw in my theory then - although I feel the greater flaw is their method.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 22-24 first in this room followed by comparisons from the closed room when we roll over to board 13|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|patricck: 5@D would have made as well.....  but just as difficult to bid|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|othered1: your call  on south's hand?|pg||

nt|vugraph814: I prefer 2D|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@D also a good bid (from a passed hand)|pg||
nt|patricck: don't like all those queens, particularly Q@C, so will bid 1@S and then take any invitation partner made|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: would depend on style to me,  If north is likely to double on 3=5=1=4 or the like, cue-bid might feel better by this passed hand.  If north wouldovercall, then 2@S|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|chick: a weak 2@D is pretty useless as a preempt, there are a lot of 2@D conventions that are better|pg||
