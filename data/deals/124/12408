nt|vugraphzby: hi all|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hei Ralf kos å se deg:)|pg||
nt|stc: hi again, 27 is an important lead, Contact will probably take some risks|pg||
mb|1D!|an|11-16 0+!D|mb|2S|nt|ady: limit of 3@S   for e/w     may wellbe overboard|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and Hi to you Craig|pg||
mb|2N|nt|Walddk7: Welcome back everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|col3435: hi all|pg||
nt|petepunt: Good morning all|pg||
nt|col3435: the flattest of boards to start with|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Hello David and Craig|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Tack!|pg||
nt|rodal f: Re hiCedric and specs:)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello Cedric|pg||
nt|rodal f: Re hi Cederic and specs:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzby: Hi again|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|ady: difficult for Silverstone to stop their|pg||
nt|rodal f: Re hi Cederic and specs:)|pg||
nt|stc: the cards lie good for NS, 3Nt is easy, even on a @d lead|pg||
nt|cedricgva: rehi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzby: hi all agin|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: rehi everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: welcome all to the 3rd stanza|pg||
nt|athene: hi welcome back everyone|pg||
nt|col3435: hi everyone|pg||
nt|chthonic: Hello, Roland and David|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: Robson has judged well to defend|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: only 1 overboard, not a bad crossing|pg||
nt|ady: looks like a push|pg||
nt|chthonic: Yes.  hard to judge accurately|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi specs|pg||
nt|rodal f: Same to Constantin:)|pg||
nt|cedricgva: an easy 3NT to start with|pg||
pc|s8|nt|chthonic: Well, defense still has to perform|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vugraphzbe: sorry, different distribution|pg||
nt|athene: @CJ lead could be ducked by declarer|pg||
nt|rodal f: EW lost there best spot|pg||
pc|d8|nt|april7: could it be a misunderstandingß|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hello again|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: Welcome back to Stanza 5 of the Gold Cup Semi Final  Christine|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|petepunt: nice relaxing 1st board|pg||
nt|cedricgva: ok|pg||
nt|cedricgva: he sould have bid "STOP 2h"|pg||
nt|rodal f: If that was at the 2/1:)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rodal f: Thoose screens make it problematic theese days. Before they putted the STOP at the table before bidding 2@H:)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s2|nt|Walddk7: Morning David, Peter and Mike|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|chthonic: good signaling by defense here -- I assume both have suit preferenced for hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: Welcome Back|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: Final Stanza and only 12 imps between the teams|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Good evening to Mike Gold|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphzaf: Welcome back to the 2nd stanza with your operators Christine and Stuart|pg||
nt|mdgraham: difficult to judge what the South hand is worth facing a 2NT opener|pg||
nt|athene: this would have decent chances on a minor-suit lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: AKx of hearts would be better, with the @CQ instead. @HQ is rather wasted  |pg||
nt|april7: unfortunately 1 down, no parkingplace for the @S or @D loser|pg||
nt|athene: as it is, he might duck a spade and hope for (very unlikely) minor-suit squeeze|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: S asking if 4th lead, E says no as he has doubled, therefore presuming its a 3rd or 5th card lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: we could speculate about this for some time, methinks|pg||
nt|athene: ducking a spade rectifies the count but also gives up on the @SJ being some sort of menace|pg||
nt|athene: he will be thinking about complicated three-suit squeezes without the count|pg||
nt|athene: we may be here for some time...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as one does...|pg||
nt|april7: whats the difference whether its 4th or 3d/5th lead|pg||
nt|athene: i think north should bid 3@C over 2@S here|pg||
nt|chthonic: Not sure about covering that card.  Was ten tricks, now nine|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Roland and all All distinguished players here|pg||
nt|stc: for the declarer not so easy, some communication problems, some choice to make-|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: if he isn't going to open 3@C|pg||
nt|cedricgva: indeed|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mdgraham: Good morning all|pg||
nt|athene: there might be some ending where you really need to know the distribution|pg||
nt|lestergold: Forrester a legend playing with well known Peter Crouch|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w xenior world champions|pg||
nt|lestergold: well east is strictly speaking not west|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Walddk7: and good morning to Jeffrey Allerton|pg||
nt|jallerton: Hello everybody|pg||
nt|ralfwil: why @cK?|pg||
nt|rodal f: And why not @DQ|pg||
nt|rodal f: :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think declarer should have won with @dQ and finess @c|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|petepunt: hi jeff|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: Welcome back|pg||
nt|chthonic: With the club lead, five will roll smoothly|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h7|pg||
nt|lestergold: but west is his more regular partner and has many successes to his name|pg||
pc|s6|nt|wilkinsona: yep, Chris seemed to suspect some underhand lead from south|pg||
nt|chthonic: surely a diamond now|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ralfwil: and he did!|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rodal f: Going for 5 tricksit seems|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|cedricgva: in dummy for the last time|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|nt|stc: a@s and @c to the J, but this is double dummy|pg||
pc|cA|nt|petepunt: looks like he wil play for a @D @C sqz that doesnt work|pg||
nt|athene: even if you got to a successful throw-in ending (e.g. @SKQ, @CQ with east) he could just exit with the @CQ to block the suit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if West throws a club now, he likely has five, with four on the table|pg||
nt|chthonic: absolutely|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|april7: back again and good afternoon|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes good defence|pg||
nt|chthonic: well defended|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|dA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|petepunt: needs KQD and 5@C with either opp|pg||
pc|hT|pc|c7|nt|ralfwil: ??? What happened?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rodal f: Sr 6:)|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|dK|mc|5|nt|athene: the trumps lie well for the double finesse, but entries to dummy are just a bit short :)|pg||
pg||

nt|vugraphzcz: little slow table to start but the smokers are at this table|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|an|6-10 w 6+M or 21-22 Bal|nt|wiki: hello again - 8 more boards|pg||
nt|k ylinen: pas,kun on 11ap ja tasainen|pg||
nt|rodal f: A realy good quality at that @S for the bid:))))|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|kaapo2:  NS play Blue Club|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: not splinter|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|hawe45:  Easy play here - all suitys behave|pg||
nt|hedyg: check for 4 @ss|pg||
nt|wiki: 5 @S optimum as EW can make 5 1C or @D|pg||
nt|wiki: @C|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: hand when you know pd has @s:s but u wanna play in @h :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzcz: 2 aces and the correct singelton, so missed a slam on this one|pg||
mb|3H|nt|kaapo2:  Holding a 4-card major, North usually would open with the major|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y. But 3@H at least is on|pg||
nt|k ylinen: N passed with 11 hcp and balanced as system requires so|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo2:  That's why South gets to bypass her 4-card @H suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  For what reason 1 @D from North - and not 1 C???|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@c-3@H-3NT= not intterested in @Hs looking for @ss|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Hello|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Kaapo|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo2:  Good evening Raija :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last time it went 1@S  4@H  declarer was in a 0-0 fit. Sadly, it wasn't on vugraph|pg||
nt|wiki: bur probably 3 pass here|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hedyg: because with 4 4 they open 1@D|pg||
nt|hedyg: it is systemic|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I see - but why?|pg||
nt|wiki: but - sorry about my fingers :(|pg||
nt|wiki: hello again and welcome|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: you could bid 4@c asking pd to trf to his suit, then pass the 4@h response|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rodal f: Test the @C for the hook and 3-3. If not 3-3 u need to hit the @D, but here the @C works|pg||
pc|s4|nt|hedyg: because when the bidding goes 1@d-1@s-X he can bid 2@c without 4@hs and no @s stopper|pg||
nt|doctorone: Frankly, I would just have bid 3N as S. See where we are now. But as it is our day, we will survive in 4@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: but 3NT shows 4@ss to me|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I do hope, that the survival will be in 4 NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: i would bid 3@s without them and 3NT with them|pg||
nt|doctorone: I meant over 2NT, bidding 3NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: why give up on finding a 4 4 @s fit?|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  This is a sequence it's good to have an agreement on so that you don't get to play in a 1-0 fit|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|peachy: this should make max 7 tricks if lucky|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Ah, Roland has 0-0|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi specs and vug operator:)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|hawe45:  But hard to find the killing @d-lead against 4 NT...|pg||
nt|hedyg: pd will NEVER bid over 3NT ....:(|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h6|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Good by to a plus-score|pg||
nt|doctorone: I don't want to open a debate... I know how many positions about this issue exist, but I don't like bidding 2N with 4@s... So my problem is solved. I know, they are drawbacks of ...|pg||
nt|doctorone: course|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In fact, 4 @H can NEVER mak - if not South plays @H to the 10, he is short of entries|pg||
nt|peachy: prob six|pg||
nt|oliverc: .|pg||
nt|wiki: both pairs playing  strong club|pg||
pc|hK|nt|oliverc: Well that sequence owed more to Culbertson than anything CC Wei might have|pg||
nt|oliverc: come up with :)|pg||
nt|wiki: now 420|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s6|nt|doctorone: good lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: coded 9s?|pg||
nt|doctorone: seems so, or just a falsecard, in front of N's opening?|pg||
nt|vugraphzbx: stephan thinks|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|rodal f: Re hi:)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|oliverc: but who are we to argue with success?|pg||
nt|muppe: +1 now it seems. Defence would have done its best with trump lead or switch at trick 2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Kursat Ozsahin|pg||
nt|vbman: hi all|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|nt|hawe45:  Tha was killing (the) defence|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  I think EW play strong club with 5-card majors and 14-16 1NT|pg||
pc|s7|pc|h4|pc|s5|pc|s8|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||

nt|doctorone: he will make and win an impor two :) Thats the bridge story |pg||
nt|hedyg: they have split some pairs...Latinovs regular pd is Tom Fenwick who is at home coughing. mishaps are bound to happen|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|d5|pc|d4|pc|d8|pg||

nt|Walddk7: 13 tricks??|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: Welcome to the Gold cup Semifinal Christine Walker operating|pg||
nt|mdgraham: (on a 2-1 trump split)|pg||
nt|april7: duülication of values|pg||
nt|xenya: EW were a bit lucky on that one|pg||
nt|col3435: yes not much going on in that board|pg||
nt|vugraphzby: I don't know my computer got stuck|pg||
nt|cedricgva: Slam in @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: doubt N will raise 1N here|pg||
nt|stc: 13 tricks wih 25 HP, let's see|pg||
mb|2H!|an|5!H 4+minor|nt|lestergold: u would normally want to be in 4S on the e/w cards|pg||
nt|cedricgva: No Josephine problem here|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes, surprising decision from west to pass 3nt with four spades and a small doubleton|pg||
nt|col3435: 14-16 NT, I believe?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nice fit in NS cards|pg||
nt|rodal f: Was something here 2|pg||
nt|stc: this is the type of hand needed by the trailing team|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|april7: here we have an easy 4@S contract|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not a superb exampple of a 2@C overcall|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 3N seems to work here ith 5 clubs off|pg||
nt|chthonic: It has been suggested that a club at trick two would have made the defense harder.  True, but declarer must also guess clubs.  I am told that was done at other table but clubs not ...|pg||
nt|chthonic: guessed|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Tony Wilkinson|pg||
nt|lestergold: and they are|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Hi everyone, close match|pg||
nt|lestergold: Waterlow will not expect 5 spades on his left on the bidding|pg||
nt|rodal f: So two then Cedric|pg||
nt|cedricgva: Hi.... Bonjour tout le monde|pg||
nt|cedricgva: difficult to stop before a game|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can be some problems for EW now. Hard to stop|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|jallerton: 1@d = "Stayman"|pg||
nt|mdgraham: In the other s/f Matheson - Sime bid 1N-3N. @HK lead|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1NT =17-19|pg||
nt|athene: north way too good for 3@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzby: Salut Cédric|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello Cedric2!|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Cedric number 2:) And welcome|pg||
nt|cedricgva: probable 3NT down 2|pg||
nt|cedricgva: 4 @H is better|pg||
nt|stc: the @c intervention helps|pg||
nt|stc: 7@c(-1400) is worth 2 IMP|pg||
nt|stc: exclusion BW ?|pg||
nt|stc: many pairs play here 5@c as exclusion BW|pg||
nt|vugraphzby: why not symply controls?|pg||
nt|stc: because you also need the Q@h for the grand |pg||
nt|vugraphzby: then josephine|pg||
nt|stc: Note that NS open VERY light ....|pg||
nt|cedricgva: it is not a good grand... 6@H is enough|pg||
mb|3H|nt|athene: but no convenient cue-bid; it's possible to use 2NT in that position as the good raise|pg||
nt|april7: it wil be a 4@H contract for EW|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: hard to see how many spades there are for NS|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear Crouch to the 'rescue'|pg||
mb|3S|nt|rodal f: Magnusson. From Sweden or Icland?|pg||
nt|cedricgva: Cabaj - Varenne is knon to bid and play very slowly|pg||
nt|vugraphzby: I am not absolutely sure, but I think norway|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzby: He is number 1 actually!|pg||
mb|p|nt|chthonic: What was 2H?  |pg||
nt|col3435: well it looks like this sequence shows an invite with 4 spades|pg||
nt|rodal f: SO SORRY FOR MY FOULT:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: finding the usual Jxx in dummy |pg||
nt|petepunt: 1@C two + ?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ady: chance for Robson    has to sniff club position|pg||
nt|chthonic: This will be difficult enough at the five level...|pg||
nt|chthonic: He cannot really bid six |pg||
nt|chthonic: with those spades and no spade cue bid.|pg||
nt|lestergold: hard to blame crouch he knows pard has length in spades but expects his vlaues to be elsewhere!|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 4Sx in the other room|pg||
nt|lestergold: big swing to Waterlow in the wings then|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Tony|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Hi again Mike ..I have been re-rostered|pg||
nt|lestergold: in time to see Forrester roasted here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Paul leads his partners suit|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: my partners stopped leading my suits a while back|pg||
nt|lestergold: Im not convinced of the soundness o Crouch's actions here with an aceless 6 count and a poor heart suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: at end of day Crouch should realise that his club values are not working too well in offence|pg||
pc|hA|nt|petepunt: X of 2@S would be negative and show similar ahand for N|pg||
nt|athene: four top losers, and nowhere to put them even if the defence don't cash them right off|pg||
nt|athene: @H1097 lead more likely than @HK onside; maybe you rise ace here|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: 17-19 3Hts|pg||
nt|rodal f: Need to be careful with the @S if he want to set up the @H Then 10|pg||
nt|rodal f: brb|pg||
nt|cedricgva: magnuson is swiss but 50% Sweeden 50% Danish|pg||
nt|rodal f: The family name belong to Swenden and Icland. In Norway we wright it Magnusen|pg||
nt|vugraphzby: ok, meaculpa|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: perhaps he just decided that with everyone bidding, Robson had to have a light 2@C overcall, so 3@C wasn't going to hurt|pg||
nt|april7: after ace of@D E has a choice ow plays and might guess wrong, so E must help and lead @C after K of @H|pg||
nt|athene: a trump lead is possible, with declarer known to have three|pg||
nt|athene: trying just to stop a ruff in the closed hand|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|stc: the grand is as good as the chance to find K@d on side, not bad after the overcall|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: but that sort of "trusting opponents" strategy can allow opps to talk you out of things|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: dare I say I'm not convinced by the soundness of norths double|pg||
nt|cedricgva: 3 Diamonds will maka as well, maybe loosing one imp|pg||
pc|s3|nt|cedricgva: good lead !K|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jallerton: yes, any 11-13/17-19 bal or natural|pg||
nt|athene: of course it might find partner's @HQ :)|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|mdgraham: better to trust your partner|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|april7: good duck by N|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rodal f: I belive in ure predict now Cederic1:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzby: D|pg||
pc|h9|nt|chthonic: Well on the way to nine tricks with straightforward play|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: may be able to get a count now|pg||
nt|ady: can make now without club finesse|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|xenya: 1@D showed @Hs, 2@HS was 4 hearts and minimum -- well, S decided it was worth bidding 4|pg||
nt|lestergold: im getting questionjs from specs is Crouch the footballer -answer er .... no.... another do we agree with forrester's double?|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|jallerton: The @d play for 3 tricks anyway, so the lead did not give away the contract|pg||
nt|chthonic: but needed to play diamonds|pg||
nt|col3435: lack of entries to dummy gives you something to worry about|pg||
nt|stc: et voila :)|pg||
nt|stc: EW should claim(concede)|pg||
nt|stc: still not easy for dec !! 7 would be easier because no choice !!|pg||
nt|rodal f: They do this only for u Constantin. Want to stress u up:)|pg||
nt|cedricgva: zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz|pg||
nt|vugraphzby: ...zzzzzzzzz|pg||
nt|vugraphzby: I promess, everybody is still alive|pg||
nt|stc: I see Frenando's problems, what if W has THREE @hs?|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|april7: E guessed wron but still down because 9 and 10 of @D dont drop|pg||
nt|rodal f: The web page: http://www.swiss-bridge.ch/|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rodal f: I was wrong. Hard to findany working line|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Welcome to Yasser Rahim|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Yasser:) Welcome|pg||
nt|yr: hi Frank & all|pg||
nt|cedricgva: en effet|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rodal f: Stolen trick:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzby: one more and he's oem|pg||
nt|vugraphzby: home|pg||
nt|rodal f: Belive so now. A endplay in @S or @H to come|pg||
pc|s8|nt|rodal f: Aureka:)|pg||
nt|stc: i expect the Q@d|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|athene: if declarer had the @D10, it would be necessary for west to play a club now|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: so well done|pg||
nt|ady: now set up long diamond|pg||
nt|lestergold: it was dangerous but passing is also dangerous|pg||
pc|s6|nt|petepunt: playing 1n as 17-19 means you can bid over 1@C on very min values safely|pg||

nt|chthonic: eight. then|pg||

nt|rodal f: Any 1@D for major?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|hawe45:  How can E/W get a trick against a @H-slam?|pg||
nt|oliverc: I'd certainly open the East hand. Precision tends to lose the Diamond suit a bit,|pg||

mb|p|nt|peachy: I suppose Makela doubted whther 4H makes because he only bid 3S|pg||

nt|rodal f: Coffe time again:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: 3@h would be -1 if u find the @c ruff|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hedyg: i really prefer 3@c over 2@c|pg||

nt|cedricgva: NS will play 2@H|pg||
mb|4S|nt|april7: e won't give up|pg||
nt|athene: some might bid only 3@S with south over the double, but you don't really know what to do when they then bid 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: so you might as well take the "4@S over 4@H" push right away|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: best lead for the defence here|pg||
nt|rodal f: Here it will fail, but turn EWs hands and 10 is on|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: now double from east|pg||
nt|xenya: 1@S = 1NT|pg||
nt|april7: N will afterwards consider 5@S|pg||
nt|chthonic: yes, indeed.  Spades beginning with the jack is most effective for declarer.|pg||
nt|yr: S shwoing extra caution in passing,  but even 3@h needs some luck|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: strangely may be correct to have ducked the J|pg||
nt|chthonic: interesting point.|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|chthonic: JD in other room?  Seems same line would have brought in contract.  Robson's play was very nice -- not tested to find club queen as he would have been if two spades were cashed|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: how on earth did 5@H make in the other room? :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: I remmeber sparring with Watermow 40 years ago at the Harrow Bridge Club when i was a real beginner as opposed to merely an old begiiner|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mdgraham: in order to take the spade finesse, perhaps....|pg||

nt|april7: and will|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: the take out double not found in OR|pg||
nt|lestergold: not mch to be done cant even make 2N|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: seems so|pg||
nt|lestergold: but i think a push is quite likely|pg||
nt|yr: NS can make all 13 tricks here with the help of a @c finnese|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: hi all|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ralfwil: How many of you agree with P from S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: sure is with these tens|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 5@C certainly wouldn't be everyone's choice, with three first-round controls|pg||
nt|athene: will declarer play on clubs or diamonds?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hard to tell from W hand what the NT range is:)|pg||
nt|chthonic: Spade and a heart shift will set this, of course|pg||
nt|marlowepi: could be anything from 11-14 to 15-17|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H   nip & tuck|pg||
nt|rodal f: @H workes two but K732 can be dangerous|pg||
mb|p|nt|col3435: 14-16 I think (for both pairs)|pg||
nt|chthonic: And that seems likely|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 4Hx nipper and tucker|pg||
nt|ady: yes you could say north's take-out double a little thin|pg||
nt|yr: but reaching 6 should be good enough|pg||
nt|cedricgva: One spade was not forcing on a passed hang... they don't play drudy ?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jallerton: Do you agree with North's t/o double?|pg||
nt|cedricgva: drury|pg||
nt|vugraphzby: who plays buffalo?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Vul pass from me. Non vul OK|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: but he was a bit unlucky his partner had such a great heart suit|pg||
nt|athene: and nothing at all wasted in spades|pg||
nt|petepunt: trying to cut out @S suit with his opening , i suspect|pg||
nt|athene: double is game-try (3@S would be merely competing)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: this time cards lying badly for declarer it seems|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can become a gain for a bigger lead. Passive bidding seen from my eyes|pg||
pc|c5|nt|petepunt: non vul yes, but vul|pg||
nt|april7: the only way toplay 7@H is the ruffing finesse in @C and fortunate @H are 2-2. Hand much to strong for a 5@C opening.imo|pg||
nt|athene: north, unsurprisingly, doesn't accept the try|pg||
nt|chthonic: Or not|pg||
nt|ady: club now sets it for sure|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: it seems the bad club break beats thi...|pg||
nt|ady: sorry   Dixon not on lead|pg||
nt|jzinsli: an easy ride|pg||
nt|rodal f: Multi 2@D|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|col3435: it wouldn't have occurred to me, though that doesn't mean it's bad|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I have been asked why Crouch is playing here and not playing football :)|pg||
nt|athene: 3@S = "whatever you want, partner, i haven't got it"|pg||
nt|yr: S maybe tempted for 7 here|pg||
nt|yr: he shd ask kings if he is|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ady: club lead sets it for sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: tens not a lot of use against 4 top spades and two bullets|pg||
pc|s2|nt|april7: 4@S again,S has not muck confidence in N's overcall|pg||
nt|yr: but with north showing just 1 king,,,6 wud be sensible|pg||
nt|rodal f: Grand is flat here by no hook needed, but also that is on|pg||
nt|rodal f: Set up @S for 3@Cs to pitch|pg||
nt|yr: yes|pg||
nt|cedricgva: yes 650|pg||
pc|sT|nt|jallerton: Some case for an opening trump lead|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Right, and Liverpool needs him badly|pg||
nt|petepunt: thats his taller brother|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: taller than Robson, in fact|pg||
nt|yr: this is the advantage of playing specific kings,,,, had south known N had the @s king he can try 7 with sum realistic hope|pg||
nt|yr: with only "one" king. dont think 7 is a good bet|pg||
nt|vugraphzby: Actally Peeters partner is sick and Nikolenkov's partner's plan could'n land in geneva, so both pairs never played together!:)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: i'm told the other room is playing 6@H|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ah, yes...|pg||
pc|h2|nt|petepunt: after a 1@C opening|pg||
nt|xenya: just a matter of overtricks here|pg||
nt|athene: the diamonds will keep|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: is this correct?|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|lestergold: operator surely inpuit derror|pg||
nt|lestergold: forrester not going to bed with setting trick|pg||
nt|rodal f: It's a hard life Cedric:)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|wilkinsona: is that right folks?|pg||
nt|vugraphzby: asking how they lead the guy answered top of sequence|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: ok, all easy now|pg||
nt|cedricgva: how not to loose any heart trick|pg||
pc|c2|nt|chthonic: yes, not a happy ending for NS|pg||
nt|rodal f: Next:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzby: no SF|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|petepunt: plus score good for e/w as@H break badly for them|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|athene: on board 19 it went 1nt p p to forrester and of course he bid|pg||
nt|athene: now NS are in 3@C, which isn't much fun|pg||
nt|col3435: interesting|pg||
nt|chthonic: Yes, all crucial cards are wrong -- but there seems little play, so not much chance for a swing, either|pg||
pc|d9|nt|stc: 11|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|h3|nt|cedricgva: without the buffalo|pg||
nt|ralfwil: The Rabbits double finess....|pg||
pc|h8|nt|rodal f: And get 1 trick in @D in return|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mdgraham: good for the defence if East dumps @DK under the ace|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|petepunt: 2 off|pg||
pc|h5|nt|col3435: any suggestions as to what south was playing for?|pg||
nt|ady: can set up low club for down 1|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|ady: some useful imps for waterlow|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so only 4 imps...|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mdgraham: which he might well do, as West has shown minimal values so far|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk4: We are in Helsinki, the capital of Finland, for the Finnish Seniors Qualifications (European Championships in Belgium in June)|pg||

nt|oliverc: SaTu team|pg||

nt|k ylinen: and later to world championships in USA!|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: pretty good hand for 14-16 opening|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|garnetts: I was wondering what East would bid--too  good for a 14-16 1NT |pg||
nt|garnetts: I don't like because of both the shape and hard values |pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: she could have opened 1@c (16+) but chose against it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Showing the majors vulnerable with 4-4 is not my cup of tea|pg||
mb|2S|nt|doctorone: Oh my !|pg||
nt|doctorone: How easy for W is it to bid?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ThatÂ´s a joke - show us, what West really vbid...|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo2:  It's been colder than in recent years yes. Between -20 and -30 celcius on many days here in JyvÃ¤skylÃ¤ middle-Finland|pg||
nt|garnetts: I agree with that too Roland|pg||
nt|wiki: most players do not like to open weak  with 4-6 majors and I do not like it here as @Hs are bad|pg||
mb|2N|nt|doctorone: no, no... Hans. This is true|pg||
nt|k ylinen: yes we have exceptionally lots of snow even in Helsinki|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  And close to -20 and lots of snow even in the South|pg||
nt|peachy: optimum reached at the table|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@D asking for the longer majors. Ha!|pg||
mb|p|nt|muppe: 5 imps to SaTu in first brd, other room played 1NT+1|pg||
nt|vbman: maybe its timefor a convention|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So you bid hearts with equal length|pg||
nt|wiki: funny that you over ruff when you have 5 @C in hand - but those things happen:)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|k ylinen: tough competition|pg||
nt|diaoff: Yes, good pressure by NS|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But unusual that West bid again. For all he knows, partner might want to defend|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vbman: he lead beats it how many?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vbman: 1nt l mean?|pg||
nt|garnetts: I can see the east hand is awkward for 1@C strong  --what about 1@D and you are a point too good?  |pg||
nt|wiki: @C lead helps  but is normal|pg||
pc|c3|nt|muppe: And in the 2nd board Cassine takes 3 imps back. Other room found 5@cx -2|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: always play the @h6 at first opportunity|pg||
nt|oliverc: That's no doubt one of the reasons East chose the opening|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Well, I need to be going soon. Have fun here!|pg||
nt|oliverc: I'd be happy enough to open 1@D and reverse into the Hearts given the chance|pg||

pc|d4|pc|h2|nt|rodal f: Are u using cellular Wiki?:)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kaapo2:  He sees hearts are bad for NS so 4@H might not make|pg||

nt|vbman: a slip|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|h3|nt|vugraphzcz: and a make|pg||

nt|oliverc: has|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vbman: and a make|pg||
nt|garnetts: I wasn't actually--but I regard gadgets over 1NT as a method of balancing rather than trying to find a game so I think I would pass as North|pg||

pc|s7|pc|h4|pc|c9|pg||

nt|vugraphzby: EO play some specialities|pg||
mb|p|nt|col3435: I was a bit surprised West passed it - wouldn't you be worried about never having shown three hearts?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: swing of 6 imps on earlies board though when a strong loogin 2 heart bid from Allfrey stole it|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jallerton: take-out double by Dixon|pg||
nt|ady: ok   ses close|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: thanks Stuart|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: i think waterlow had a double here with west|pg||
mb|3N|nt|petepunt: no, 2@Cx making is no disaster|pg||
nt|lestergold: pass very conservative|pg||
nt|lestergold: he has 17 and 4 of the other major|pg||
nt|yr: that kind of intervention at these coulors can nly do you harm,,,but it goes unpunished often enough |pg||
nt|rodal f: Why not a 2@D? 3+ and force but S gave a damn|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: another good board for leading your own suit, NOT partner's|pg||
nt|jzinsli: there are existing players that bid 2 diamonds with East hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: True, David, but North's double told him hearts were not breaking|pg||
nt|cedricgva: easy as well|pg||
nt|rodal f: 9 or10 in NT all up to if declerer endplay W |pg||
nt|cedricgva: No swing Bergues keep their lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|yr: for its advocates to continue |pg||
pc|cT|nt|rodal f: W will be squized in the hard colors it seems|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: 15 hcp  n/s   playing in 1NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: undoubled|pg||
nt|yr: this is a misunderstanding i think,,,,W meant to play 3@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzby: yes|pg||
nt|yr: but E had other ideas|pg||
nt|jzinsli: coffee time|pg||
pc|c2|nt|wilkinsona: yas, and a swing still needed|pg||
nt|rodal f: I don't like the 3NT bid if 2NT is lebensol. And it seems to be|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|athene: interesting sequence here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: this appears to be on the trump hook, and after that diamond lead from ace must be odds on|pg||
nt|chthonic: easy to see from our vantage point that ace of clubs, ruff, AK of trumps and a diamond works.  But what else?    Except the heart finesse|pg||
pc|d3|nt|wilkinsona: diamond J for -4|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|nt|mdgraham: possible 5@C sacrifice EW, but you don't have to sacrifice if the opps don't bid game|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and anyway not obvious how EW get in the bidding|pg||
nt|petepunt: its a perfect fit n/s |pg||
nt|jallerton: Do you want to play this hand in game? I suppose it's virtually cold if @s are 2-2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: three minor losers, and the hearts can be played either way |pg||
nt|petepunt: need to guess 1major suit right |pg||
nt|athene: 3@C was clearly intended as pre-emptive|pg||
nt|lestergold: givi8ng opps easy ride in 2 of a minor is nor normally recommended bridge altho here cards not lying too well for e/w so their 'pushing' power is limited|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not now. Missed the ice in the stomac|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|athene: west can put two spades through but it doesn't quite give east three trump tricks|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: will silverstone hook the @S9 for the overtrick? :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jallerton: why do you have to guess @h?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: trouble is 3N may de on EW|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mdgraham: no, the third heart goes on a diamond |pg||
nt|athene: but i am not sure you can play that without a lot of artificial kit, because you need some way to make a real (invitational) 3@C bid|pg||
nt|col3435: South doesn't have much for his 4@d here|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|yr: with the @s entry in dummy, it can be made though\|pg||
nt|rodal f: At board 3 the OR are in 4@H where NS here had a nice play for 10|pg||
nt|rodal f: brb|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: Silverstone could have taken action    asfar as Dixon was concerned Silverstone might have a bust|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep 11 tricks now on, testing spades lead required to hold to 10 maybe|pg||
nt|cedricgva: 12 tricks, promenade|pg||
pc|s5|nt|chthonic: this will be bloody |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3NT EW certainly has chances on a heart lead from South|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and was in fact made in OR|pg||
nt|yr: i think they will go down:)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|petepunt: y|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still early :)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|chthonic: different order, same idea|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: he might not have to, of course; robson might not want to pitch a heart|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|wilkinsona: so this is damage limitation|pg||

nt|ralfwil: ending with a show up squeeze...|pg||

pc|d2|pc|h8|nt|april7: 2@C pass would have been enough, what was the 3@C bid for?|pg||

mb|p|nt|vbman: but passing is  a hard way to earn a living in bride|pg||

pc|s6|nt|wiki: not easy to bid|pg||

pc|s3|pg||
nt|wiki: cannot imagine why|pg||
pc|h5|nt|wiki: Richie did not wanr to comment in finnish so I had to come here|pg||

nt|vbman: more to cassini|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hawe45:  Right you are|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2 times @H and @C|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|d9|pc|d5|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sT|nt|wiki: we have  3o+ hcp - it is better to tell the suits as they are, byt maybe system is 2@D|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d8|pc|s8|pg||
nt|rodal f: A normal play. We see all the cards|pg||

nt|chthonic: Ouch|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: North not happy!!!|pg||
nt|davidstern: 4@S for EW looks the go here|pg||
nt|lestergold: Waterlow is the anchor player of this partnershuip probably under 'instructions' from hackett to play his steady game andleave the fireworks to partner|pg||
nt|stc: Note that 4@h are also making|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: chance missed for EW there - the little red card stayed in the box|pg||
nt|davidstern: Obviously no diamond lead in the OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 1@S opener or 2NT?|pg||
nt|athene: double is a possible alternative for south|pg||
nt|athene: but he prefers to get the good suit in|pg||
nt|april7: 5@C or 3NT for the lucky position of the @D suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: No -4 agreed|pg||
mb|1H|an|4+!H|nt|yr: yes, if W plays the @c 9 instead of following low\|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nice cards in E but not much help to get from W|pg||
nt|yr: he was probably awake to do that or,,,,he wasnt even tested|pg||
nt|rodal f: Top spot is 3@S and a good sac at 4@D-1|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: 1@S forcing, no major (X would be hearts; 1@H would be spades)|pg||
nt|davidstern: Even so how do you make six|pg||
nt|davidstern: On a heart lead would you really finesse?|pg||
nt|jzinsli: wau pass at thrid position :(|pg||
nt|cedricgva: jolie séquence|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: Ah win heart and four rounds of clubs pitching heart and three diamonds |pg||
nt|davidstern: South ruffs with natural trump trick|pg||
mb|1S|nt|col3435: there goes the lead, then|pg||
nt|chthonic: Rather a disastrous set|pg||
nt|col3435: that's a big advantage disappear in 5 boards|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not the normal end at last board|pg||
nt|stc: NS may try 3NT here, could be beaten but not easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: isnt 1n 17-19 ?|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@d = no 5-card major, 1NT =17-19|pg||
nt|athene: many would overcall 2@D with north|pg||
nt|april7: EW has a partscore in @S and NS might try a @C partscore|pg||
nt|rodal f: For -1 at 4@D E need to play @CK early enough if not there is 10. A @C pitch at @H|pg||
nt|yr: the grand not attempted in the other room so 13 more to bergues|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|athene: but robson is there for him!|pg||
nt|stc: as I said, already 9 tricks .)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|yr: E gives up too easily here,,,, i wud try 3@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: W will X and E will bid 2@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: Waterlow had a very distinguished career in industry whereas Hackett 's profession has been bridge for many decades|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mdgraham: no fears about re-opening|pg||
nt|athene: i'm not a big fan of 1NT, with only one spade stop|pg||
nt|athene: silverstone just needs to know if his partner has a singleton diamond|pg||
nt|athene: if he has, 6@C must be good|pg||
mb|p|nt|col3435: so what does N have avaiable here? Is this showing short @c?|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: 3@S - singleton club 3 suit hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can't beat 3NT. @D get blocked or give NS 2 tricks. Rest is easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzaf: In principle 44 Majors  but TF judged his hand|pg||
nt|petepunt: will worry @D may be 4-1|pg||
nt|jallerton: Declarer may try to lead a @s hoping 2nd hand has the ace, planning to switch to @d|pg||
nt|jallerton: though contuining @s OK if with @s 3-3 or guesses @h|pg||
nt|jallerton: Declarer does not know that @c are 4-4|pg||
nt|petepunt: looks like 7 tricks tho.|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes you might bid 1nt to show values, but here, partner is never moving over it anyway, so you aren't getting to game|pg||
nt|april7: If N finds Q of @C, 7 tricks, if not....|pg||
nt|athene: so why not just bid 2@D?|pg||
nt|april7: should E have a singleton @D then 6 @C to be made|pg||
nt|athene: i'm not sure he has  achieved much by taking this very scenic route to 3nt|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep, thats what happened OR|pg||
nt|cedricgva: and now Spade for the 10|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: inersting tx|pg||
nt|athene: i don't have the NS system details; i assume north just asked for 5- and 4-card majors|pg||
nt|davidstern: And same going to happen here for flat board|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: he might duck this|pg||
nt|april7: down again on @S lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 6@C only beaten on a diamond lead... |pg||
pc|hA|nt|petepunt: or @Sare 4-2|pg||
nt|rodal f: Belive the X showed 4@Hs but W didn't want to bid. E have done his work|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h6|pg||
nt|athene: @SK is one hurdle cleared, but no luck in either red suit|pg||
nt|april7: unfortunately @D dont break|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: little red card out of the box this time|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|s8|pg||
nt|stc: right, 3NT cold|pg||
pc|sK|nt|petepunt: spec thinks dec may be sqz;d out of 7th |pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|nt|athene: hoping his partner has an entry (major-suit ace or even @CQxx if declarer misguessed)|pg||
nt|lestergold: just the one to be made providing ofm course e/w cash out|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 9 tricks and next board|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|april7: S will try @D and then doublefinesse in @H|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|athene: at BAM i think he takes the @DAK and gives up; there's too much danger of conceding 12 tricks otherwise|pg||
nt|stc: at least a lost oprtunity for contact|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|athene: now he needs three heart tricks |pg||
nt|athene: do you start with the @HJ or a small one? the @HJ looks very silly if west has a singleton @HK|pg||
nt|athene: but gains against singleton @H10 offside or west not covering|pg||
nt|april7: I think J is best|pg||
nt|april7: i OR 2 down, should be only 1 down here|pg||
nt|april7: no sorry J of @D maeks another trick|pg||
nt|rodal f: So a new possible gain for Bergues|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|athene: small diamond from west now|pg||
nt|petepunt: Wests failure to open 15-17 1N may help here|pg||
nt|athene: or maybe he will play a club, playing his partner for the @CK?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|petepunt: a@D first would have avoided this guess ?|pg||
nt|jallerton: Knew ducking a @d to East was safe as East could not be cashing two clubs (West known to have the jack)|pg||
nt|jallerton: not the @h finesse option|pg||
nt|petepunt: hence q@C known to be with Waterlow|pg||
pc|hK|nt|petepunt: but 10@H keeps options open now|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h7|pg||
nt|april7: W might try asmall @D now, before releaising the ace|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c2|pc|h8|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|athene: that was always the problem - east ends up throwing his clubs, so declarer is very unlikely to go wrong in the suit|pg||
pc|h5|nt|april7: S might be squeezed if S had JQ of @S|pg||
pc|h4|pc|sT|pc|c3|pg||
nt|athene: Hackett is doing his best to look like a man with the @CQ, though|pg||
nt|athene: sorry dummy had the @CQ :)|pg||
nt|stc: complicated play, just @h at trick 2 was enough for 9 tricks|pg||
nt|rodal f: And they realy need it so a bad pass from Caponi in my eyes|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|c9|pc|s4|pg||
nt|petepunt: Will notice Waterlows 14HCP shown and Hackets pass over 1@S is the key|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|nt|athene: and @CJxxx with north wouldn't be any good as declarer would be picking that up|pg||

nt|vbman: yes true|pg||
nt|rodal f: b|pg||

nt|Walddk4: A laydown slam now|pg||
nt|oliverc: @H game here for NS|pg||
nt|garnetts: The auction in the OR on the lsat hand was not well judged by West--total phantom save |pg||
nt|oliverc: EW will be disappointed if they compete too much here|pg||
nt|vbman: 4sp save here?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Many 4-1 in colors now|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|an|12-16, 4+!h|nt|hawe45:  Too strong for 1 NT|pg||

nt|kaapo2:  Ok, so West can say that "I was certain you couldn't remember it so I bid it as natural" :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: EW likely to outbid them in spades |pg||
nt|oliverc: 4@SX-2 too expensive|pg||
nt|vbman: ah yes |pg||
nt|vbman: colours|pg||
nt|oliverc: yup|pg||
nt|wiki: but it is a good 6 @H|pg||
mb|d|nt|hedyg: surely not too strong|pg||
mb|p|nt|doctorone: It wouldnt cross my mind to take any actioon as N facing 15-17, NV.... But, when it is your day, it is your day|pg||
nt|diaoff: Yes, 6@D is best but @H and NT will also make|pg||
nt|garnetts: I am alone in not liking weak two bids on flat hands in first two seats |pg||

nt|wiki: 1 @S and 2 @S by N|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1@S and what will N bid by his 20HP|pg||
mb|1S|nt|hawe45:  This hand is worth 1 @C - 1 ? - 3 @C|pg||
nt|hedyg: so?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  3 x 10 + a 6-card.suit|pg||
mb|d|nt|oliverc: Hate them|pg||
nt|wiki: @H10(11) lead makes it happy|pg||
nt|rodal f: :) Y|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: is 3@s enough for N?|pg||

nt|k ylinen: rdbl?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|wiki: ok - now RD|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo2:  Other table already reached 6@H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In the context of 12-16 2+ diamonds I don't think 2@D is enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: this hand has Kx Kx and wants to rightside NT, i agree|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Now the test for East - not @D Queen|pg||
mb|p|nt|diaoff: Agree|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's worth 3@D imo|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Looks like just making|pg||
nt|vbman: more to cassini|pg||
nt|sybarra: well they landed |pg||
nt|wiki: @D lead makes it almost fool proof|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rodal f: My bid would have been 2@H force for one round|pg||
nt|rodal f: RD are OK to. |pg||
nt|wiki: without D I thin 2 @S is almost enough in white but 2 @H is best for me(without D)|pg||
nt|rodal f: But RD can be taken for SOS|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hawe45:  But the suit (@D)= is frozen anywhere|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  And since they started with boards 7-8, they've played 2 boards faster|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d2|pg||
nt|oliverc: no, to SaTu|pg||
nt|garnetts: This was meant to be 5@H and a minor --and look at how defensive the hand is |pg||
pc|sA|nt|rodal f: And here we go|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|s8|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 6@D is a good choice in case partner has xxx in hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Qxx   xxx    in the majors and 6@H would fail whereas 6@D makes|pg||
nt|peachy: nice bidding|pg||
nt|diaoff: Exactly, but for me 6@D would have been a grand slam invitation in this auction|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Yes, good to be able to bid 6@D as a suggestion to play. I might have a fear that it's interpreted as a try for grand|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d8|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|wiki: But with that balanced hand I think that also after D by W  2 @H is best bid|pg||

nt|wiki: S playing - @H lead |pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I am up for the adventure in 3 nt |pg||

nt|rodal f: And a @H lead for IMPs to NS who need some|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: i put the explanation to 2N o what 2N is|pg||
pc|h2|nt|diaoff: On a @H lead, declarer must be a bit careful on this one|pg||

nt|vbman: 17 vs 23|pg||

nt|mdgraham: this will be competitive - NS to reach at least 5@D? |pg||
nt|athene: the opening lead away from a king gave him a tempo|pg||
nt|april7: and the contract|pg||
nt|athene: he might have made the game anyway, though, of course|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: sure|pg||
nt|davidstern: So it seems|pg||
nt|davidstern: Put me down as an opener and I AM conservative|pg||
nt|chthonic: Gee|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: last board then, so thanks to everyone|pg||
nt|stc: easy slam (for GIB)|pg||
nt|cedricgva: Having problems Cedric ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Sr for the time it took. Needed to clean a bit:(|pg||
nt|rodal f: But Re hi all:)|pg||
mb|1N!|an|15-18|nt|petepunt: last board ?|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D will get them started|pg||
nt|lestergold: well it looks like slam time|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: nice south hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: 5@D will be found now maybe |pg||
nt|april7: 4@H is maximum, so 5 @D a very good save and might push EW to 5 level|pg||
nt|athene: south might bid clubs now, for the lead|pg||
nt|athene: oh, sorry, of course he couldn't|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6C excellent altho in fact nothing wrong with 6N|pg||
nt|rodal f: I will look a bit in OR for the slam|pg||
nt|ralfwil: first slam|pg||
nt|cedricgva: only try to avoid playing 7|pg||
nt|rodal f: While uwatch the slam here:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzby: playing KK it should be OK|pg||
mb|2C|nt|wilkinsona: I would open, but maybe there are system points we don't know|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: appeal pending in China v. Ch. Taipei match|pg||
nt|rodal f: A Roland hand:) What's that?|pg||
nt|rodal f: EW20HP and NS20HP|pg||
nt|jzinsli: a little shy at east|pg||
nt|rodal f: Full pressfor the juice?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|col3435: yes score up after every 8 boads|pg||
nt|athene: he needed two diamond tricks :)|pg||
nt|col3435: I'd bid 1@h with the North hand, I think double is unusual these days|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S  or 3NT for e/w |pg||
nt|lestergold: now surely Crouch will make some kind fo ffort with his monster|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: surprise south had to double|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6H of course also rolls in|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: avid 6 diamonds tho'|pg||
nt|lestergold: problem is south could only presumabl;y show his massive two suityer on the first ound with a bid like 4S which may have got them too high on another day|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: he doesn't know that EW aren't going to end up in spades|pg||
nt|april7: without a @C lead, perhaps Q of @H lead|pg||
nt|davidstern: A failing 4@H seems possible here. |pg||
nt|vugraphzby: np:) welcome back|pg||
nt|jzinsli: it's the style of the two guys :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Was nice bidding from Cabaj|pg||
nt|jzinsli: yes indeed|pg||
mb|4H|nt|petepunt: 5@C sugested as more informative by S first time|pg||
nt|athene: west perhaps thought that dummy was likely to have a trick source in clubs, in which case an aggressive lead was necessary|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: due to the 6card suit W might raies to 3|pg||
nt|lestergold: they ahve avoided 6D but sadly all the other cold slams|pg||
nt|rodal f: Score for EW seems to be wrong now. Was ca. 120|pg||
nt|vugraphzby: awful!! Bergue has a good team but a bad connexion|pg||
nt|cedricgva: lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|chthonic: I agree.  South showed some restraint -- a good thing|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT   by Silverstone not so good on J@C lead|pg||
nt|davidstern: East will certainly bid game|pg||
nt|rodal f: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: Yes, this is the last board of the set.  Thanks to our operator, Christine Walker.|pg||
nt|col3435: they're short sets by vugraph standards|pg||
nt|petepunt: a bit of explaining needed to robson :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: funny how we tend to play sets of eight when most others seem to play sets of 16|pg||
nt|jallerton: A bit of waiting for Robson to finish too!|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: Thanks ably assisted by Stuart Bradnam|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might consider holding up the @CK and finessing diamonds into north - that would be right if north had the @HA |pg||
nt|athene: but when people respond 2@C to 1major, it's very often just a balanced hand|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well this could still be a deciding board|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not the best lead I've seen|pg||
nt|rodal f: A slamtry|pg||
nt|vugraphzby: but fernando has only one pleasing card|pg||
nt|vugraphzby: Q of @S|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c7|nt|chthonic: I pass many hands my partners think I should open, but 13 HCP, 2 1/2 quick tricks and two four card majors is a lot|pg||
pc|cK|nt|davidstern: 3NT had some chances as they avoided the spade lead on the bidding|pg||
nt|ralfwil: On a board like this I dont like asking for aces|pg||
nt|rodal f: Better to use exlution blackwood after 4@D|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|april7: E might duck @C and try to finesse @D the right way|pg||
nt|athene: but you look very silly if you lose to @DQx and south has the @HA as entry|pg||
nt|athene: anyway, the @DQ appears so all is well|pg||
nt|davidstern: That isnt the best lead for the defence|pg||
nt|davidstern: 10 tricks now 1-5-1-3|pg||
nt|davidstern: Unless declarer gets confused by the lead|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ady: as it happens clubs are blocked  and Robson has not entry    so 3NT will make even on wrong spade guess|pg||
nt|lestergold: Crouch was chicken in my view and i do not see why 3n promised vaslues and upper limit can be quite seriously strong|pg||
nt|lestergold: over 3N he cn afford to bid the 4S he did not want to risk on the first round|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so quickly to the other room thanks all|pg||
nt|lestergold: if forrester jumped to 6D then Crouch could try 6H or 6N|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dK|nt|davidstern: Which he hasn't|pg||
nt|jzinsli: and not a technical lead also|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can make now, but not by a small @H lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: Well stoped. Will not find single @HK I belive|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|april7: thats true, but if its successful, then?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 12 tricks now|pg||
nt|stc: note that the score shown now is wrong, the real score is 125-79|pg||
nt|vugraphzby: what do you see|pg||
nt|vugraphzby: ?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Thx Constantin:)|pg||
nt|cedricgva: we lost here all the history...|pg||
nt|cedricgva: all we knoe is Contact need a miracle on the remaining boards|pg||
pc|d8|nt|jzinsli: no king twice :(|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d2|nt|petepunt: restart at 11:10, time penalties apply ?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well judged by EW - 5@H is down one|pg||
nt|athene: i might have been a little bit worried with east - you do have a very pure hand|pg||
nt|petepunt: N/S likely to take out insurance in 6@D if Hackets bids one more .|pg||
nt|april7: is 1NT by E forcing, in what system?|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: 17-19|pg||
nt|april7: tu|pg||
nt|athene: i am not a huge fan of 1nt - the sixth heart is too important to bury|pg||
nt|athene: but anyway, they have wandered into game :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well the pass cost as 4 hearts made OR|pg||
nt|chthonic: Twelve IMPs away on the passed out hand|pg||
nt|jzinsli: exactly|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|athene: i assume 2@C was two-way checkback (forces 2@D, then 2@S is invitational)|pg||
nt|vugraphzby: oops, 1down good bridge|pg||
nt|rodal f: S went in with 3@D where u asked Ralf. The slam|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can a new breake because of the connection help them Cederic2?:)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|cedricgva: undisciplinned... but we can understand south|pg||
nt|vugraphzby: north shouldn't BWD|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|mdgraham: NS never bid at the other table|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: exactly as explained|pg||
nt|davidstern: Mind you he had to play it well to make. I wouldn't like to have to go back to my team mates and explain why I didnt open|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: it might be more of a double fit - give west the @SK instead of the @DA, for example|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree with you Joerg|pg||
nt|ralfwil: -1 and next!|pg||
nt|jzinsli: they enjoy to play, give them some time :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ady: 11 tricks for 1 imp to waterlow|pg||

nt|muppe: Ty all|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Restart after a short break|pg||
nt|oliverc: Difficult to criticise EW, though. It's more likely that NS (with 23) will get too high|pg||
nt|oliverc: than that EW (with 17) will willingly bid anywhere near to game at unfavourable|pg||
nt|oliverc: vulnerability|pg||
nt|oliverc: 4@S NS here|pg||
nt|wiki: we are in Finland now, so it is nothing :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: but fair for public view @H|pg||

nt|rodal f: Could be Markku. Nice to see u and welcome:)|pg||
nt|k ylinen: 40 imps differense now|pg||

mb|1N|nt|rodal f: The last board for this segment. When will the next start?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: any rabbi could make a slam here|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@H or 4@H is a good shot to keep the spades out of it --since partner has passed |pg||
nt|oliverc: 4@H?|pg||
nt|oliverc: (by North)|pg||
mb|2C!|an|stayman|mb|p|nt|hedyg: sorry about the mistake in the title folks, this is the last segment|pg||
nt|santyclz: Do you have to be a rabbi to play @ds?|pg||

mb|2H|nt|hedyg: why not bid 4@d here?|pg||

mb|3S!|mb|p|nt|santyclz: No xx to show a void?|pg||

nt|rodal f: Are we over for match point?:)))))|pg||
mb|4D|nt|hedyg: who should XX? where? what?|pg||
