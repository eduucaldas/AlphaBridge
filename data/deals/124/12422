mb|3N|nt|yo_yo: gosh what is this system?|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: So the event's off to a rip-roaring start with three 2@S contracts ...|pg||
nt|yo_yo: tell us their system please steve|pg||
nt|bridge_one: probably mine :) me too open 1@d with 5@S and 1@C with 5@h when i play with a my crazy friend|pg||
mb|p|nt|qwikjanz: as reflected in the scoer line|pg||

nt|qwikjanz: But auction I think limited South to 4@H so W had count|pg||
