pc|hJ|nt|dougdscsu: 4@s can also make with careful play|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
pc|h2|nt|varange: and a consummate professional, as they all are|pg||
pc|h5|nt|poohbear: I think the boys are trying to be too delicate here|pg||
nt|wesleyc: If 1C could be any balanced hand maybe Adam was worried about clubs for 3NT|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Winners of this match join Nabil Edgtton - Paul Gosney and Michael Whibley - Justin Howard on the Australian U26 team that will play in the Junior PABF tournamnet in Hamilton, NZ, ...|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: as well as the World Juniors in the USA later in the year|pg||
nt|poohbear: Andy could have given his partner a second chance to bid 3NT by bidding 3S|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: Edgtton would do well to offer 4@s here..|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|bucheister: Hi, well I'm back for the final set; if I stay awake|pg||
pc|s3|nt|poohbear: Adam was worried that with his extras they might have slam since North is unlimited and I presume showed 4-5 in the blacks |pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|varange: I don't know the others much I'm afraid, other than from playing|pg||
nt|bucheister: I think this will make except for a diamond lead|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|poohbear: but the king of @h rates to be worthless so the prudent bid might have been 3NT |pg||
nt|poohbear: Partner can still bid again|pg||
nt|poohbear: 5@d isnt a bad spot|pg||
pc|sK|nt|poohbear: But thats a good lead|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|pg||

nt|poohbear: can still make this since 3 @s cash and West doesnt have another trump to lead|pg||

mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|poohbear: thats quite a strong bid by Schultz|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Schulz|pg||
nt|poohbear: sorry|pg||
nt|poohbear: Dbl by North typically shows about 18+ and 3 spades|pg||
nt|poohbear: second dbl|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: It might work out well as 4@h is on for N/S|pg||
nt|poohbear: once Hung Dbled they were always reaching 4@h|pg||
pc|c8|nt|bucheister: very conservative by W; partner opened the bidding and he has an A and a K; he might double|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|nt|sybarra2: back to a new match at the moment|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|poohbear: Edgtton has an easy raise|pg||
nt|poohbear: in fact he might even have a Q bid|pg||
nt|poohbear: He has shown nothing but has quite a reasonable hand|pg||
pc|s6|nt|cuttysark: Slightly surprised North did not get involved here|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sK|nt|dougdscsu: 4@h is plenty IMO|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Does 1N show spades?|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|h7|nt|varange: yes|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|poohbear: well when I could have zero and 9 max and I have an ace and J9x of trump and a useful dbltn I kinda like my hand|pg||
nt|varange: but opps definitely have shapely hands (from the bidding), and aces can disappear in a hurry|pg||
nt|varange: 3NT is on, NS?|pg||
nt|bucheister: I think only 8 tricks|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|poohbear: Declarer needs to be slightly careful. needs to take a dbl hook in @s and take a @c ruff before his entries run out|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|poohbear: Defense cant force the long trumps|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|varange: a spec just pointed out that north's cuebid was rather aggressive, with an unsupported QJ and a K@D that rates to be toast|pg||
pc|s2|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|bucheister: 2NT by N might be a better description of his hand|pg||

nt|sybarra2: or a 5 with a minor  |pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: np Pascale :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: George Bilski - is a bridge pro with an insurance background - he has been aussie rep ans aussie captain many times|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: Since Hung has a weak hand he opts to show his @s and ignore @ds|pg||
nt|varange: Ian tells me they  play the multi as 3-10HCP|pg||
mb|p|nt|bucheister: they like this vulnerability|pg||
nt|varange: as one does|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|nt|dougdscsu: 4@s is on..but will they bid it?|pg||
nt|frankaus: NS play a modified wercsion of Polish Club|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|poohbear: I agree since the auction gets awkward when you respond 1D playing Walsh style|pg||
nt|poohbear: Hung knows that partner has 4 trumps so he gambles|pg||
nt|varange: they may well be playing these Balanced Weak Twos through the multi, and "normal" Weak Twos' as-is|pg||
pc|c3|nt|poohbear: Partner would rdbl with 3 card support for @s|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: He caught a great dummy :)|pg||

pc|cT|nt|cuttysark: Woujd have been more Polish with a 'z' or two|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|poohbear: yes he did|pg||
nt|poohbear: he has to be careful again. He needs to draw trumps before playing @ds to avoid an uppercut|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|nt|cuttysark: Minors lying well here - should make 10 tricks|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|varange: it's generally played the other way around though|pg||
pc|dA|pg||

nt|poohbear: Hard to place declarer with 6 @ds|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: @d jack will seal the deal I'm afraid|pg||
nt|poohbear: might see a @h shift here|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|c6|pc|h2|pc|c5|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d6|nt|bucheister: I think that E has to bid something; 2nt or 3C|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk4: Operator, the tables are not linked. Please shut down and reconnect to the open room|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|wesleyc: 2c seems a slightly odd lead on the west hand|pg||
pc|d9|nt|frankaus: that say u only need to get the first and last letters correct - but i have trouble with even that|pg||
pc|d7|nt|poohbear: Declarer banked on deception in order to avoid losing control if @s 3-1|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|varange: the spade bid would be the same as with a normal multi - showing game interest in hearts (if that is partner's suit) and tolerance for spades|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|nt|bucheister: that was highway robbery at its best|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|an| |mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|wesleyc: Hung/Edgtton ahead by 7.7 with 3 to play|pg||
nt|bucheister: the only weakness of the 1C is these 16 pt hands when you allow them in your auction|pg||
mb|3D|nt|varange: nice|pg||
nt|bucheister: OK that would be fun thanks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=3-way  a) 15-17 BAL  b) any 17-20  c) 11-16 with 2nd suit only if 5@C|pg||

nt|cuttysark: And East has a little to spare|pg||

nt|ahollan1: it took all day to escape from my family|pg||

pc|h3|nt|varange: Pascale, are Paul L and Robert K watching this?|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: they aren't in the room watching but maybe watching on vugraph outside|pg||
nt|varange: ok :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: they are not loggeg in to bbo  under thier usual call names|pg||
nt|sybarra2: or maybe from pc in room |pg||
nt|bucheister: Indy beats Baltimore 20-7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks like bilski's plan was to treat this as 15-17 bal|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bucheister: I notice that they passed 2nt in the open room; probably very good judgement over 2nt|pg||
nt|sybarra2: hi frank :)|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|varange: that 3D set the cat among the pigeons|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think that's what DBL said -- 3@S would probably show the 17-20 hand|pg||
pc|s8|nt|varange: I doubt that Terry is the happiest person at the table right now|pg||

pc|dT|pc|d6|pg||
nt|poohbear: and makes the @d shift|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is Bilski's Modified Polish Club -- biggest change is 1N opener is weak which is most common meaning of true Polish 1@C|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kiwibridge: Roman say 100 honours and never bid suit is a crime|pg||
pc|s5|nt|cuttysark: 800 looks a good borad for the Poles!|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i'm told Bilski is not the author of the system -- that person's name seems to be lost to the ages :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|poohbear: Declarer would have to block @ss and hung would get a second chance|pg||
nt|frankaus: cant se any real pickups coming for neill  so looks like they need to chase a lot of imps from here  still 50+ to go|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and just takes a low  @D  lead to beat this a lot |pg||

nt|cuttysark: Prospects of a few part score swings that will make the match closer|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: possible 6 here plus the 7 carryover|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Like this one, where they appear to have got too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|varange: south has no diamond stoppers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no surprise [to me] that preemption over 1@D causes problems in constructive bidding|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|dT|pc|dQ|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Brown's 3@S with double stopper in @D does seem to endplay Bilski|pg||
nt|bucheister: does this have any chance?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the good news - when East shows out on 1st @C -- 3N isn't making either|pg||
nt|bucheister: The bars closed 10 minutes ago in Detroit|pg||
pc|c4|nt|poohbear: this is a very uncomfortable spot but with 3-3 @ss and both minors behaving declarer will make this with normal play|pg||
nt|bucheister: oops|pg||

nt|wesleyc: would hate to run into a 1444|pg||
pc|sT|nt|poohbear: I dont like it. On those rare occasions that partner has a singleton its really bad . partner is a favorite to only have a dbltn since some hands with 3 he would have raised ...|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|bucheister: With only the 8; I believe that low is best|pg||

pc|d2|nt|dougdscsu: wd|pg||

nt|bucheister: good point|pg||
pc|d7|pc|c7|pg||

nt|poohbear: its only our best gues|pg||
