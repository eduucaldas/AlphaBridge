nt|vugraphzcz: little slow table to start but the smokers are at this table|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|an|11-16, 5+!S|nt|wiki: hello again - 8 more boards|pg||
nt|k ylinen: pas,kun on 11ap ja tasainen|pg||
nt|rodal f: A realy good quality at that @S for the bid:))))|pg||
nt|mmmakela: hi Juho, Markku, Roland, kibs!|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Welcome back! Hi Markku P, Kalle and Juho|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  And good morning to Markku M MÃ¤kelÃ¤|pg||
nt|runnerup: hi all|pg||
nt|k ylinen: hi|pg||
nt|mmmakela: NS play modified Blue Club w 4c majs and canapes|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|kaapo2:  NS play Blue Club|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: not splinter|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 1-suiter|pg||
nt|mmmakela: no|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: suction|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: i believe|pg||
nt|mmmakela: after 64 boards lots of imps have been scored|pg||
nt|runnerup: lucky slam to start|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|hawe45:  Easy play here - all suitys behave|pg||
nt|hedyg: check for 4 @ss|pg||
nt|wiki: 5 @S optimum as EW can make 5 1C or @D|pg||
nt|wiki: @C|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: hand when you know pd has @s:s but u wanna play in @h :)|pg||
nt|runnerup: now we see -now we didnt -i think south must transfer to clubs|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 3 clubs now?|pg||
nt|runnerup: ew makes 2 clubs ns 2 diamonds |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzcz: 2 aces and the correct singelton, so missed a slam on this one|pg||
mb|4S|nt|kaapo2:  Holding a 4-card major, North usually would open with the major|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y. But 3@H at least is on|pg||
nt|k ylinen: N passed with 11 hcp and balanced as system requires so|pg||
nt|runnerup: now sure|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Team SaTu was up by 50 IMPs after yesterday - but the lead was cut down to 17 IMPs during the first 8 board segment today|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: i thought E would have bid 2@s|pg||
nt|mmmakela: N took a risk, S might not have dias suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: i suppose S may correct to 2N since N showed max|pg||
nt|runnerup: six any from west is ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: 6@d about finding @dQ (or 6@s by W)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: why didn't E bid 3 dias?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo2:  That's why South gets to bypass her 4-card @H suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  For what reason 1 @D from North - and not 1 C???|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@c-3@H-3NT= not intterested in @Hs looking for @ss|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Hello|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Kaapo|pg||
nt|k ylinen: tough bidding|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Still 24 boards to play|pg||
nt|mmmakela: normally N has 5 dias for this bid|pg||
nt|mmmakela: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo2:  Good evening Raija :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last time it went 1@S  4@H  declarer was in a 0-0 fit. Sadly, it wasn't on vugraph|pg||
nt|wiki: bur probably 3 pass here|pg||
nt|miniemin: East-West "Ranna Ruutu"  system from Estonia|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|hedyg: because with 4 4 they open 1@D|pg||
nt|hedyg: it is systemic|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I see - but why?|pg||
nt|wiki: but - sorry about my fingers :(|pg||
nt|wiki: hello again and welcome|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: you could bid 4@c asking pd to trf to his suit, then pass the 4@h response|pg||
nt|mmmakela: didn't know promised max|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rodal f: Test the @C for the hook and 3-3. If not 3-3 u need to hit the @D, but here the @C works|pg||
nt|mmmakela: hi Mikko!|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hedyg: because when the bidding goes 1@d-1@s-X he can bid 2@c without 4@hs and no @s stopper|pg||
nt|doctorone: Frankly, I would just have bid 3N as S. See where we are now. But as it is our day, we will survive in 4@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: but 3NT shows 4@ss to me|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I do hope, that the survival will be in 4 NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: i would bid 3@s without them and 3NT with them|pg||
nt|doctorone: I meant over 2NT, bidding 3NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: why give up on finding a 4 4 @s fit?|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  This is a sequence it's good to have an agreement on so that you don't get to play in a 1-0 fit|pg||
nt|runnerup: changes for +1|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|peachy: this should make max 7 tricks if lucky|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Ah, Roland has 0-0|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi specs and vug operator:)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|runnerup: yes south had dimonds but very weak opening otherwise-perhaps lucky + score anyhow|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hawe45:  But hard to find the killing @d-lead against 4 NT...|pg||
nt|hedyg: pd will NEVER bid over 3NT ....:(|pg||
nt|miniemin: Hi Markku|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Good by to a plus-score|pg||
nt|doctorone: I don't want to open a debate... I know how many positions about this issue exist, but I don't like bidding 2N with 4@s... So my problem is solved. I know, they are drawbacks of ...|pg||
nt|doctorone: course|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In fact, 4 @H can NEVER mak - if not South plays @H to the 10, he is short of entries|pg||
nt|peachy: prob six|pg||
nt|oliverc: .|pg||
nt|wiki: both pairs playing  strong club|pg||
pc|s7|nt|oliverc: Well that sequence owed more to Culbertson than anything CC Wei might have|pg||
nt|oliverc: come up with :)|pg||
nt|wiki: now 420|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now 9 is good|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|nt|doctorone: good lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: coded 9s?|pg||
nt|doctorone: seems so, or just a falsecard, in front of N's opening?|pg||
nt|vugraphzbx: stephan thinks|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: only with @s lead this is 9 tricks|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|rodal f: Re hi:)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|oliverc: but who are we to argue with success?|pg||
nt|muppe: +1 now it seems. Defence would have done its best with trump lead or switch at trick 2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Kursat Ozsahin|pg||
nt|vbman: hi all|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h2|nt|hawe45:  Tha was killing (the) defence|pg||
nt|runnerup: with 9 diamonds 6 can be found if east supports i think|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  I think EW play strong club with 5-card majors and 14-16 1NT|pg||

nt|doctorone: he will make and win an impor two :) Thats the bridge story |pg||
nt|hedyg: they have split some pairs...Latinovs regular pd is Tom Fenwick who is at home coughing. mishaps are bound to happen|pg||

nt|vbman: think it is going to get exiciting|pg||
nt|rodal f: If any like to use BBO-TV: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: W:s comment was that he didn't like the chances of making that contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: but considering the situation of the match, he felt he had to bid it|pg||
nt|runnerup: 6nt is the other possibility because it can be plaised to west|pg||
nt|mmmakela: "nice" fit EW here|pg||
mb|2C!|an|5+4+ majors, 6-10|nt|peachy: game both sides here|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: good max E has here|pg||
nt|vbman: some might open with e|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  In the open room, they weren't sure if 4@H was a splinter or not, resulting in playing in 4@S|pg||
nt|rodal f: Any 1@D for major?|pg||
nt|runnerup: normal loking 4 hearts|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Strong club all around in this match. NS hear play a Precision-style system with 14-16 NT, and EW strong club with control responses, and 4-card majors|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  *here|pg||
nt|runnerup: a borderline game 3nt or better 5 diamonds -difficult both|pg||
nt|runnerup: some chance to over bid|pg||
nt|runnerup: now ossi can pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|miniemin: 2@C = 6-10 hcp , majors at least 5-4 or 4-5|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 2 positive things, dias hook working and spades 3-3|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  How can E/W get a trick against a @H-slam?|pg||
nt|oliverc: I'd certainly open the East hand. Precision tends to lose the Diamond suit a bit,|pg||
nt|oliverc: since the 1@D Opening is more of a catch-all and in classic precision can easily|pg||
nt|oliverc: have as few as 2 Diamonds|pg||
nt|wiki: shorter than in Ostende :)|pg||
nt|runnerup: canape opening in use|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  7 @C looks like only 1100|pg||
nt|mmmakela: and clubs 33|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kaapo2:  Yes, could be a swing board|pg||
nt|muppe: 4@h will probably make, will they bid it?|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  4@C should do it|pg||
nt|vbman: i dont think its gf |pg||
nt|vbman: ah there|pg||
nt|vbman: 4 card support makes s hand a giant|pg||
nt|wiki: maybe not in red|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not u W. Was thinking abough S:)|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Well judged|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: i don't like that bid with only 3 card support|pg||
nt|k ylinen: limit Stenberg|pg||
nt|runnerup: this makes so good start for satu |pg||
pc|c3|nt|mmmakela: huge triumph for satu to play in 2 @C making|pg||
pc|cK|nt|doctorone: would you support @cs as E?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Or may-be 1400 because of the bad trump-split|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d looks like a waste of time|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I would pass - or bid 5 @C|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Unless EW think otherwise|pg||
nt|oliverc: Yes, the overcall will make it easier for NS to get to this slam|pg||
nt|k ylinen: I do|pg||
nt|k ylinen: 5-4 and not minimum|pg||
nt|runnerup: Väiski seems to bid that support instead of 1 spades |pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: can u play 4@s still if opener shows suit there?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: yes 1 @S response stands out|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|peachy: I suppose Makela doubted whther 4H makes because he only bid 3S|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  1@D could be short if 11-13 balanced, so EW don't really know about the huge double fit|pg||
nt|rodal f: Coffe time again:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: 3@h would be -1 if u find the @c ruff|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  This is the last 8-board segment of this 80-board qualification match. The winners get the right to play for Finnish seniors in the 2010 Europeans in Ostend, Belgium|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hedyg: i really prefer 3@c over 2@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: i'd like to bid 1@s instead of 2 with the S hand|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Looking at EW's cards, 5@C looks to have just 3 losers|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: 5@c could be -2 but on a @h lead it would make|pg||
nt|muppe: Easy 10 tricks it seems|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Welcome to Markku Pekkinen|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 5 dias here better than 3 nt|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c7|nt|hedyg: now 5@c|pg||
nt|wiki: pass was ok now when 3 NT is not quite makeable|pg||
nt|runnerup: hi all|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|mmmakela: well heart lead and right guess...|pg||
nt|runnerup: they really liked to take away trumps from dummy|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kaapo2:  Of course @D ruff takes it 2 down|pg||
nt|vbman: close your eyes and bid the slam:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: south is gonna bid it after the 2NT call|pg||
nt|rodal f: I wonder if S would have leaded @HA in 5@C. Take a look and see what would have happend if not|pg||
nt|rodal f: As 3@S is on two|pg||
nt|k ylinen: he could, because system requires 5 cards to 1S bid|pg||
nt|runnerup: perhaps south is weak for her 3 diamond can they stop|pg||
nt|runnerup: now hearts lets this home but can n lead something else |pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzcz: now an overtrick|pg||
pc|h8|nt|hawe45:  Friendly match - E/W passing...|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|muppe: Yes, but hard to bid it looking at W´s cards|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. 2@S|pg||
nt|mmmakela: what is the best line in 4 hearts?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kaapo2:  5@C that is|pg||
nt|oliverc: wd|pg||
nt|vbman: cool|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|nt|mmmakela: still wondering how could anyone open E hand w 7-4 showing majors, I'd treat it as spades only|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|peachy: i liked 2S better, no defense except potential slow club|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|kaapo2:  This is the third segment of 8 boards out of 10. After this segment, there will be a late lunch and the restart is then at 15:30 local time (14:30 CET)|pg||

pc|c6|pc|h2|nt|hedyg: now he can pull trumps and ruff out J@d if only W does not have 3 @hs|pg||

nt|peachy: i think so too|pg||
nt|k ylinen: any one for 5% by S?|pg||
nt|k ylinen: 5D|pg||
nt|wiki: we always say it is only 1 IMP but when it happens often enough....|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit hard but often OK. |pg||
nt|wiki: depends on feelings -  sitting here I do not know|pg||
nt|wiki: but ok for me|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: conservative here|pg||
nt|runnerup: Cassini seems to start strongly -to get back imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: yes, my mind was in wrong contract|pg||
nt|mmmakela: leading @S J wasn't "impossible" in this sequence (or small spade)|pg||
nt|runnerup: 4 h ew|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Yes, opening 1@S or perhaps 4@S looks more sensible on the East  cards on the previous board|pg||
nt|mmmakela: no |pg||
nt|mmmakela: sry priv|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  At least one of the kibitzers was a little confused, so I'll clarify: all of these players are from Finland, but EW use an Estonian bidding system, Ranna ruutu, or Beach Diamond|pg||
mb|2D!|an|weak two in M or 21-22 Bal|mb|2H|nt|hawe45:  You can make 5 @C by finessing the @H 8!|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Quite nice a hand at West|pg||
nt|muppe: indeed|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Does Juho know any Rabbis?|pg||
nt|oliverc: exactly, so maybe 5@C a more helpful cue-bid than 4@S|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Did Timo not bid 3@S already?|pg||
nt|wiki:  4 @S here but  only DD|pg||
nt|runnerup: seems 4h+1 or +2 -if you guess all but a lot can happen here|pg||
nt|runnerup: but then you down get lucky + score --very lucky board for brothers|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|peachy: is NS also playing some strong club variant?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will they be taken? Only a partscore for EW|pg||
nt|runnerup: a diamond ruff set 6 and this opening will make difficulties|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: would anyone bid on with N:s hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: opponent most often have both major fits|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I would |pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|wiki: maybe entry problem even dd|pg||
nt|rodal f: By DD y Wiki. Would u be there? |pg||
nt|rodal f: But I belive they will end there. Vul for EW|pg||
nt|wiki: unfortunately  - but 1 or 2 down|pg||
nt|wiki: but 3 NT has its chances as always|pg||
nt|runnerup: seems difficult to bid to best contract -2 hearts ,but now possible|pg||
nt|k ylinen: 5 imps to Cassini in first played deal|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3 lubs best but also spades makes |pg||
mb|p|nt|vbman: lebensohl apply here?|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Or was he too strong for it :)|pg||
nt|vbman: no doubletons for 3 sp|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: you mean the obvious 8@H finesse?|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Could be. They haven't played together very regularly but usually play strong club in most of their partnerships|pg||
nt|peachy: kib confirmed Einari-risti|pg||
nt|k ylinen: tough bidding again|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Sry 4 @C...|pg||
nt|doctorone: but wait.... Dont you loose 1@d and 2@hs ?|pg||
nt|rodal f: And the conceratisme pays?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 3 H huge underbid imo|pg||
nt|runnerup: wd and nothing to play ==|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugraphzcz: @d ruff beats 6|pg||
nt|runnerup: n thinging to 1nt or 2 d|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: blocked the 2@c bid from E|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hawe45:  Yes - T removed to 4 @C|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Both pairs here use strong club|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  NS play Einari club, a common system in Finland, especially in the Turku area. It has 4-card majors and control-showing responses to strong club|pg||
nt|mmmakela: good for NS|pg||
pc|s3|nt|peachy: Einari club, close relative of Blue Club|pg||
nt|muppe: Slam makes only IF declarer drops @dK|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: why do you ask?|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  EW use Blue Club, an old Italian system with canape style and also control responses to 1@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: does a safe line of play exist here?|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Has North not paid his entry fee - PASS...|pg||
nt|santyclz: Tough to beat 2@d though.|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Joe :)|pg||
nt|runnerup: perhaps east was worried cause he only had 2 hearts|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphzcz: but can't be bid missing 2 aces|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  No Rabbis around, so slam is destined to go down|pg||
nt|runnerup: but this is 1 down so 2 ims or so possible|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rodal f: Conservatisme|pg||
nt|k ylinen: according to their system Eeva should have opened 4 and a half D*s|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: kinda difficult to do that|pg||
nt|runnerup: control problems how to make this so that you dont loose clubs|pg||
nt|mmmakela: no safe line|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kaapo2:  So the 1@S opening is often just 4 cards|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  I thinks Timo is quite aggressive in bidding to the 3-level. Of course 2@S looks just fine for me|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mmmakela: winning 1/2|pg||

nt|kaapo2:  Wow|pg||

nt|muppe: 6@d?|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: Timo is again hoping for @cQ/@hQ or @sK onside|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kaapo2:  Timo thinks he's good at guessing trump kings I suppose|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  SaTu stands for Salo-Turku, two cities in South-West Finland. "Satu" is also a Finnish word, meaning a fairy tale|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kaapo2:  And to Kalle Ylinen, who will give some comments on the system played by EW|pg||
nt|k ylinen: yes u r right|pg||

pc|h3|nt|diaoff: Morning Roland, hi all|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Kalle|pg||
nt|rodal f: A friendly but understandable lead from N|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|garnetts: I was wondering what East would bid--too  good for a 14-16 1NT |pg||
nt|garnetts: I don't like because of both the shape and hard values |pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: she could have opened 1@c (16+) but chose against it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Showing the majors vulnerable with 4-4 is not my cup of tea|pg||

mb|p|nt|doctorone: Oh my !|pg||
nt|doctorone: How easy for W is it to bid?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ThatÂ´s a joke - show us, what West really vbid...|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  The other team is named after the space craft Cassini. That's because one of their players, VÃ¤inÃ¶ KelhÃ¤ playing in the open room, had a part in designing some scientific equimpent for Cassini|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: 4@h is makeable here|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kaapo2:  It's been colder than in recent years yes. Between -20 and -30 celcius on many days here in JyvÃ¤skylÃ¤ middle-Finland|pg||
nt|garnetts: I agree with that too Roland|pg||
nt|wiki: most players do not like to open weak  with 4-6 majors and I do not like it here as @Hs are bad|pg||

nt|k ylinen: now pass?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now miracle pass needed|pg||

pc|d5|nt|doctorone: no, no... Hans. This is true|pg||
nt|k ylinen: yes we have exceptionally lots of snow even in Helsinki|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  And close to -20 and lots of snow even in the South|pg||
nt|peachy: optimum reached at the table|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@D asking for the longer majors. Ha!|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Should Kanerva bid 4? Seems a bit hard with the wasted @DQ but he does have a singleton and a good side suit|pg||
nt|runnerup: sorry easnt prepared to that diclare play|pg||
pc|dA|nt|muppe: 5 imps to SaTu in first brd, other room played 1NT+1|pg||

pc|d7|pg||
nt|k ylinen: tough competition|pg||

nt|runnerup: yes how to show you have 5-5 ..|pg||
pc|dT|nt|vbman: 1nt l mean?|pg||
nt|garnetts: I can see the east hand is awkward for 1@C strong  --what about 1@D and you are a point too good?  |pg||
nt|wiki: @C lead helps  but is normal|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|muppe: And in the 2nd board Cassine takes 3 imps back. Other room found 5@cx -2|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: always play the @h6 at first opportunity|pg||
nt|oliverc: That's no doubt one of the reasons East chose the opening|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Well, I need to be going soon. Have fun here!|pg||
nt|oliverc: I'd be happy enough to open 1@D and reverse into the Hearts given the chance|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not only do we not like the 2@C bid but I suspect we hate the 3@H bid too|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  And partner often cannot raise when 4 is on|pg||

pc|h9|pg||
nt|vbman: and a make|pg||

mb|3S|mb|d|nt|kaapo2:  Against Blue Clubbers, anything is possible ;)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: and against seniors even more is?|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  I believe they still resond with controls|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Even after the 3@C call|pg||
nt|muppe: really?|pg||
nt|vbman: weak 2 dia avail?|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: no|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not me --as I play a weak 2@D but if I didn't I have no objection to 3@D |pg||
nt|vbman: then no|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will be hard for EW to stop under slam now|pg||
nt|k ylinen: Mäkelä really isn't a chicken!|pg||

nt|kaapo2:  No alert, so perhaps I was wrong|pg||

nt|vugraphzcz: finally got a verbal explanation|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now they will reach it|pg||
nt|runnerup: this is 500 if passed and defended well|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo2:  Transfers still aren't standard in Finland|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In the end Parviainen is happy to defend I suppose, but I would have bid with his cards over 1NT|pg||
pc|d8|nt|diaoff: Guess that E is happy not to have entered this bidding, yes|pg||
nt|garnetts: and I admit I would aslo have bid 3@D over 2@S |pg||
nt|sybarra: I have difficulty with canape (except those served with cocktails) any way |pg||
nt|rodal f: And only 10 tricks by normal play|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vbman: but passing is  a hard way to earn a living in bride|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kaapo2:  I suppose NS play 2-way Stayman, and 2@H and 2@S are weak, natural|pg||
nt|k ylinen: yes I hate to say that lots of pairs are still using two-way Stayman|pg||
pc|d9|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Might take 10 tricks here|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  And in fact the bidding looks very sensible to me|pg||
nt|wiki: rest of the day W is ashamed with his @D - maybe could not bid 2 @C - do not know their system |pg||
nt|wiki: ok - he made it quickly|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: i think he tried to mislead opponents|pg||

pc|h4|nt|doctorone: Though it may, Hedy, I see no reason to bid anything other than 3N again :)|pg||

nt|mmmakela: wd|pg||
pc|h5|nt|wiki: not easy to bid|pg||
nt|runnerup: not a good contract but van be made|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphzcz: i was informed that EW agreed yesterday that 3@c here shows 5+@h5+@c|pg||

pc|h6|nt|wiki: Richie did not wanr to comment in finnish so I had to come here|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: i would've opened 1@d even with canape system|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: i don't think N knows what E has|pg||
pc|h8|nt|runnerup: entry problems so she must play heart rigth or..|pg||

nt|kaapo2:  They play 80 boards during the weekend|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Divided into 10 segments of 8 boards|pg||

nt|vbman: yes true|pg||
nt|rodal f: b|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: Norths claim wasn't as accurate as it could have been|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: he said that he loses 2@d tricks if either defender has 5 of them|pg||
nt|wiki: of course it is ddown with @D lead as @HQ takes uppercut|pg||
nt|rodal f: A coffe board. Or a unluckey 6@S?|pg||
nt|wiki: no the worst comment from W: you had only 11 !!|pg||
nt|wiki: now|pg||
nt|k ylinen: 31 imps differense|pg||
nt|mmmakela: wonder why N kept the @S J.....|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes 500 in partscore board so good for satu this time|pg||
mb|p|nt|k ylinen: we see the differense of teams in deal 5. Sa(lo)Tu(rku) are much more aggressive|pg||
nt|Walddk4: A laydown slam now|pg||
nt|oliverc: @H game here for NS|pg||
nt|garnetts: The auction in the OR on the lsat hand was not well judged by West--total phantom save |pg||
nt|oliverc: EW will be disappointed if they compete too much here|pg||
nt|vbman: 4sp save here?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Many 4-1 in colors now|pg||
nt|runnerup: seems that we have about even situation to start next section |pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: 5@d had chances if W doesn't play @s:s early enough and declarer finesses @d:s|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3nt can be beating but not so clear to do so|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: he said he thought N promised an @s honour with the X|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 4 spades here|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3nt/ 4s |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Too strong for 1 NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: fine for me|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Should not be too difficult to reach|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Ok, so West can say that "I was certain you couldn't remember it so I bid it as natural" :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: EW likely to outbid them in spades |pg||
nt|oliverc: 4@SX-2 too expensive|pg||
nt|vbman: ah yes |pg||
nt|vbman: colours|pg||
nt|oliverc: yup|pg||
nt|wiki: but it is a good 6 @H|pg||
mb|1S!|an|12-16, 4+!s, can be canape or 44 majors|nt|hedyg: surely not too strong|pg||
mb|p|nt|doctorone: It wouldnt cross my mind to take any actioon as N facing 15-17, NV.... But, when it is your day, it is your day|pg||
nt|diaoff: Yes, 6@D is best but @H and NT will also make|pg||
nt|garnetts: I am alone in not liking weak two bids on flat hands in first two seats |pg||
nt|wiki: my kind of 3 NT|pg||
nt|wiki: 1 @S and 2 @S by N|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1@S and what will N bid by his 20HP|pg||
nt|runnerup: looks 4 hearts this time|pg||
nt|k ylinen: was there wrong information given?|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|hawe45:  This hand is worth 1 @C - 1 ? - 3 @C|pg||
nt|hedyg: so?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  3 x 10 + a 6-card.suit|pg||
nt|runnerup: partscore battle 2pades win perhaps |pg||
mb|2H|nt|oliverc: Hate them|pg||
nt|wiki: @H10(11) lead makes it happy|pg||
nt|rodal f: :) Y|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: is 3@s enough for N?|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2@S is to weak for his hand. Telling (15)16-18|pg||
nt|k ylinen: rdbl?|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok this even makes|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3nt seems 97% but 4 spades needs something -about 85%|pg||
mb|3S|nt|wiki: ok - now RD|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo2:  Other table already reached 6@H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In the context of 12-16 2+ diamonds I don't think 2@D is enough|pg||
mb|4S|nt|hedyg: this hand has Kx Kx and wants to rightside NT, i agree|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Now the test for East - not @D Queen|pg||
nt|mmmakela: because strong club W will settle in 4 hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|diaoff: Agree|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's worth 3@D imo|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Looks like just making|pg||
nt|vbman: more to cassini|pg||
nt|sybarra: well they landed |pg||
nt|wiki: @D lead makes it almost fool proof|pg||
nt|mmmakela: yes but hard to reach 3 nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: My bid would have been 2@H force for one round|pg||
nt|rodal f: RD are OK to. |pg||
nt|wiki: without D I thin 2 @S is almost enough in white but 2 @H is best for me(without D)|pg||
nt|rodal f: But RD can be taken for SOS|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so 5 from top for defence.......|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  But the suit (@D)= is frozen anywhere|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  And since they started with boards 7-8, they've played 2 boards faster|pg||
pc|h8|nt|runnerup: yes but north has double stopper in hearts in this secuence|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Canape style 1@S. She could have any longer suit and just 4@S, or some balanced hands|pg||
pc|h9|nt|oliverc: no, to SaTu|pg||
nt|garnetts: This was meant to be 5@H and a minor --and look at how defensive the hand is |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rodal f: And here we go|pg||
nt|runnerup: not so easy to take them anyhow|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|mmmakela: very hard to beat this|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  I think 3@S here only guarantees 5 cards, but Erkki doesn't really have other choice than to raise|pg||
nt|mmmakela:   25 a push|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|nt|Walddk4: 6@D is a good choice in case partner has xxx in hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Qxx   xxx    in the majors and 6@H would fail whereas 6@D makes|pg||
nt|peachy: nice bidding|pg||
nt|diaoff: Exactly, but for me 6@D would have been a grand slam invitation in this auction|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Yes, good to be able to bid 6@D as a suggestion to play. I might have a fear that it's interpreted as a try for grand|pg||
nt|k ylinen: Väiski teki hyvän tarjouksen 4S, muttei se riittänyt Eevan slammihalujen torjumiseen|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: he is trying to create swings|pg||
nt|doctorone: That, I understand :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|oliverc: Well Leb would apply over 2@S by South|pg||
nt|rodal f: Neigher can NS make 3@D so the border passed for bought|pg||
nt|wiki: actually I think that S has more 1 @S opening that multi|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: did he miscount or downgrade|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Pirjo alerts a natural call?|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Perhaps it's so standar to use this as a pre-emtpive raise that she thinks it better to alert :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: maybe i saw wrong, they do not use the alert card|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|nt|k ylinen: with only 11 hcp and alanced hand W would have to pas, so now 12...13 p|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  600 is a strange result in this board but that was recorded in the open room|pg||
nt|vbman: 3sp better|pg||
nt|oliverc: 3@S by South now|pg||
nt|garnetts: Asking for the teach them a sharp lesson with 4@S |pg||
nt|garnetts: That will terrify East |pg||
nt|oliverc: :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: until it drifts off|pg||
nt|vbman: will loose the 1st 4 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: there is a chance of accident, since if E was strong she would have acted over 2@h, so why play 2N as Leb and not 2-suiter|pg||
nt|wiki: S playing - @H lead |pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I am up for the adventure in 3 nt |pg||
nt|reisig: opening 1@h w 9xxx ..just goes against my grain|pg||
nt|Walddk5: It's against my religion|pg||
nt|wiki: that must ne 1 @S even in USA|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c5|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Are 5 spades and an ace enough to pass the double?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|k ylinen: balanced even|pg||
nt|reisig: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: my pard always leads the k of H!'s |pg||
nt|wiki: no - it overbidding and probably 2 down :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: *@Hs|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: they open a major almost always when they have one|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: and 1M responses to 1@d show 5+|pg||
nt|wiki: 3 @D is ok but E  could not pass - wonder why not|pg||
nt|rodal f: And a @H lead for IMPs to NS who need some|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: i put the explanation to 2N o what 2N is|pg||
nt|runnerup: can east pass?-no she did not|pg||
nt|runnerup: seems to make = here|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: though he should open 1@h if he downgraded, hmmm...|pg||
pc|s2|nt|diaoff: On a @H lead, declarer must be a bit careful on this one|pg||
nt|peachy: Wouldthat be true if he held xx diamonds?|pg||
nt|k ylinen: 2NT promised stoppers in both Majors|pg||
nt|k ylinen: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: she had only 2 tricks|pg||
nt|runnerup: Eki has to guess well or play well to make this|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: though if defence starts with 4 rounds of @d, E pitching 2@h:s|pg||
pc|c4|nt|oliverc: so a push after all that|pg||
nt|garnetts: Odd game isn't it--4@H laydown and the opps play a partscore  |pg||
nt|wiki: thanks Richie  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: i have no idea|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: at least the 1@d opening had a different meaning there|pg||
nt|runnerup: a lot of opening hands were pass seems best -like here -but old school says -double means =opening hand |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kaapo2:  Next set is scheduled to start in ten minutes, so we're just about on time|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's natural to knock out @CA first and there goes the entry to the long hearts|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Ah right, 400|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: slam is makeable|pg||
nt|reisig: That suit ...looks like 3 cards|pg||
nt|rodal f: If u use the 15 rule as many good players do u count ure HP+@Ss Does it make 15 u have a opening hand as S have here.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|wiki: with only 6 loosers it is a good opening for me|pg||
nt|mmmakela: was still overjoyed from 3 nt last deal I suppose|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|wiki: NS gets 3-4 imps |pg||
nt|runnerup: 1100 and a partscore so now Cassini is beaten|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kaapo2:  6@C?|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: 6@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: finesse @HJ and squeeze|pg||
nt|sybarra: S is same pard I have   (believes me) |pg||
pc|s5|nt|mmmakela: daring west might balance with 2 spades here|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|pg||
pc|d7|nt|k ylinen: here we see again the differense between teams. passed out with Cassini palers and 3NT by SaTu|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|runnerup: can be down even here|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kaapo2:  Ah sure, you juniors are much sportier than me ;)|pg||
nt|k ylinen: players|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: horrible things are about to happen|pg||
nt|runnerup: now beaten|pg||
pc|s6|nt|garnetts: If East had bid 3@H over this then West is likely to bid 4@H obver 3@S ---so Lehbensol is daft in this position I agree|pg||
nt|vbman: 17 vs 23|pg||
nt|Walddk5: A system that dictates me to open 1@H is /&%!!" , and a system that prevents me from entering the auction with South's cards is =æ% ?¤¤!|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|d3|nt|wiki: funny that both rooms opened it as weak and got lucky |pg||
nt|reisig: The defense rests :)|pg||

nt|muppe: Ty all|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Restart after a short break|pg||
nt|oliverc: Difficult to criticise EW, though. It's more likely that NS (with 23) will get too high|pg||
nt|oliverc: than that EW (with 17) will willingly bid anywhere near to game at unfavourable|pg||
nt|oliverc: vulnerability|pg||
nt|oliverc: 4@S NS here|pg||
nt|wiki: we are in Finland now, so it is nothing :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: but fair for public view @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: 3@d didn't say anything about strength|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: opener could have full 16 count|pg||
nt|rodal f: Could be Markku. Nice to see u and welcome:)|pg||
nt|k ylinen: 40 imps differense now|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: since 2N was interested in only partscore or about slam|pg||
nt|wiki: maybe opener bid 3 NT with max ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: but our E forgot system|pg||
nt|wiki: ok|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  This match consists of 80 boards divided into 10 segments of 8 boards|pg||
nt|mmmakela: think Kanerva loses nothing returning a dia against any distribution|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes was endplayed but played it down |pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: What's that I hear from the green room?|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  They'll compare scores, have a cig break, and then get back to action|pg||
mb|1H!|an|12-16, 4+!h, can be canape|nt|vbman: l think its better 3sp 1st round|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 5 bds left|pg||
nt|wiki: the most natural reason|pg||
nt|wiki: to go wrong|pg||
nt|runnerup: here 2 spades makes|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I would treat S hand as 1-suiter|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes even Timo had a change to switch to his sing d -and then it is down allways|pg||
nt|mmmakela: good pass by Kelhä in OR|pg||
nt|mmmakela: erkki played for a practically no-chance when ruffed the club rerurn|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  This is our last board. Great thanks to our marvellous operators Juho GranstrÃ¶m here and Pauli Nieminen in the open room|pg||
mb|2D!|an|Kx, Qxx or nat, inv+|nt|rodal f: The last board for this segment. When will the next start?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: any rabbi could make a slam here|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@H or 4@H is a good shot to keep the spades out of it --since partner has passed |pg||
nt|oliverc: 4@H?|pg||
nt|oliverc: (by North)|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Segment 8 is scheduled to start 11:10 local time (10:10 CET)|pg||
mb|2S!|an|5+!s, 15-16|mb|p|nt|hedyg: sorry about the mistake in the title folks, this is the last segment|pg||
nt|santyclz: Do you have to be a rabbi to play @ds?|pg||
nt|hedyg: no but to catch the K@H|pg||
nt|garnetts: I mean as an overcall of 1@D |pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: after cig break, i think|pg||
nt|runnerup: looks 3nt ofcause can overbid 15+15 so|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes no chance better that some lucky change -hmm..strange|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  And thanks to two Markkus, Markku M MÃ¤kelÃ¤ and Markku Pekkinen, for comments|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|hedyg: why not bid 4@d here?|pg||
nt|doctorone: I would elect 4N !|pg||
nt|hedyg: pd is strong and short in @c, surely he is interested|pg||
mb|p|nt|k ylinen: 11 tricks in H here|pg||
nt|rodal f: A coffe board wich NS don't need|pg||
nt|wiki: 3 NT by S best|pg||
nt|mmmakela: here easier|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: but N can thank E for that|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Thanks also to the Bridge League of Finland for organising, and to Bridge Base Online for letting us show this exciting match|pg||
nt|runnerup: here is a slam but not good contract|pg||
mb|3N|nt|k ylinen: what was dbl?|pg||
mb|p|nt|wiki: not sure what 3 NT is, but looks like East should look for the minor|pg||
nt|runnerup: ofcause they can overbid-18+13 |pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: S doesn't believe in slam w his 4333|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes seems that Eeva also-2 diamonds is onesuiter in heartrs or spades|pg||
nt|mmmakela: in OR seems they didn't|pg||
nt|runnerup: 6 clubs best |pg||
nt|kaapo2:  And of course thanks to all our kibitzers!|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: @c and @d 33 or oen of them with the other 24 and @h finesse?|pg||
mb|4N|nt|Walddk4: 4333 and 15 would make me choose 3NT over Stayman|pg||
nt|mmmakela: absolutely|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: No xx to show a void?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@d for me shows @d stopper and 2nd rd @c control|pg||
nt|doctorone: Surely the right thing to do, Joe|pg||
nt|garnetts: K@C looks like a switch too|pg||
nt|rodal f: Are we over for match point?:)))))|pg||
nt|mmmakela: K and dias|pg||
nt|runnerup: 5 spades can be only 1 down -best defence sets it -2|pg||
nt|mmmakela: surely accepts|pg||
mb|5H|nt|hedyg: who should XX? where? what?|pg||
nt|garnetts: likley to get the spades right too I think |pg||
mb|p|nt|doctorone: N|pg||
nt|hedyg: true, yes|pg||
nt|doctorone: over 4@c X P P|pg||
nt|reisig: dbl = I want to lose 800+|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: reisig is right|pg||
nt|k ylinen: yess|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: but the explanation at table was either @c:s or take-out of @c:s|pg||
nt|wiki: against me they always bid 6 NT and both finesses work|pg||
nt|wiki: just change the hands EW|pg||
nt|rodal f: Thats standard bridge Wiki:)|pg||
nt|k ylinen: wiki u r the lucky one|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|hedyg: sry getting tired here too|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Often used for the 2 lowest colors, but most use it for majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|wiki: RKCB obviously is 2 from 5 without @HQ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 30-32 between you, never mind Stayman|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Agree Roland. 1NT-3NT would look just about right|pg||
pc|c2|nt|reisig: 3N was a minor preempt ...I thk|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cT|nt|runnerup: heart finess always and 4-2 can be handled in some cases makes it |pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|wiki: red  makes it difficult of course|pg||
nt|runnerup: 5 still makes from south -but they bid 6|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: ok, this is doomed|pg||
nt|rodal f: Forget my coffe boards|pg||
nt|wiki: so 11 more to SaTu|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  NS use canape even in responses|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  So I suppose South has now shown better clubs than diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: here south could have 2-6 minors|pg||
pc|cK|nt|k ylinen: this is here again bad tactics, they are -40 Imp down, but ...|pg||
pc|c4|nt|reisig: to me ...3N is 99% forcing|pg||
nt|k ylinen: now home|pg||
pc|c8|nt|wiki: yes it looks like it|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 8 more to go ,SaloTurku close to victory|pg||
nt|mmmakela: must choose the right maj finesse|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|hedyg: whats the hurry with @hs?|pg||
nt|miniemin: no|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|nt|vugraphzcz: both defenders trying to get ruffs|pg||
pc|s2|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|oliverc: Good set for SaTu|pg||
nt|runnerup: still 3 loosers|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|pc|hJ|nt|wiki: so this a good Roland slam(Ihad to say this) about 17 %|pg||
nt|runnerup: 2 loosers|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|sA|nt|runnerup: yes this session 18-18|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vugraphzcz: neither is giving them|pg||
nt|muppe: but neither will get|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kaapo2:  They'll compare and have a very short break and then change seats after this board|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hedyg: come on play the @d!|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: now can go wrong|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c5|pc|s6|pg||
pc|h6|nt|reisig: Went down in 5@h??|pg||
nt|wiki: much needed 11 for cassini|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  So we'll be back at 10 past the hour|pg||
nt|mmmakela: bad play but still makes|pg||
pc|h7|nt|oliverc: thanks everyone. bye for now|pg||
nt|vbman: bye|pg||
nt|garnetts: It looks odd not to finesse the club but if he crosses to dummy and finesses and it loses a @D back spoils the entries |pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: we'll resume in 55min|pg||
nt|garnetts: bye for now|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kaapo2:  Thanks, see you soon|pg||
nt|rodal f: EW had one board earlier where NS got of the hook. Been kindly that way|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: overtrick, i think|pg||
nt|runnerup: cards sits well enough so even Eeva is worried this makes|pg||
nt|runnerup: was not the best way to play but makes -should have ruffed d to table|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: trying for 13, not happening|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sJ|pc|c6|pc|sT|pg||
nt|wiki: so we are in half way to Ostende SaTu still going strong|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|nt|vugraphzcz: i mean 2|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: we continuue after comparison and cig break|pg||
pc|d6|pc|hK|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|nt|k ylinen: sry|pg||
nt|rodal f: Better then 17%. I'd say 45%. @C covered 50% by a @D hook and a bit more of by 3-2@H|pg||
nt|k ylinen: now 50 imp diif|pg||
nt|k ylinen: differense|pg||
nt|wiki: hearts 3-2 and the needs 2 finesses ??But in Norway it is different:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: this was the last segment of the day|pg||
nt|runnerup: about 34 % little less|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Thanks Markku and Juho + Roland|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes both had minimum for slam chanced to be on but if opener has max offcause 1-3 nt can be a bit asked by team members -why you missed that|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: if opener has 5card suit, then slam possible|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|nt|po-s: not so easy for West to duck the spade|pg||
nt|po-s: but two heart ruffs will leave North with club losers|pg||
