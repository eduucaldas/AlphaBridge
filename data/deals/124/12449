nt|tejjyid: (2nd biggest nugget of gold found on the Australian goldfields)|pg||
nt|jstokes: in the other room, a 2@S opening by north apparently showed the minors, and South picked clubs -- West doubled and East  passed|pg||

pc|sA|pc|sJ|pc|s6|pc|s4|pg||
pc|h6|nt|marlowepi: one of the latter is that when you have this gizmo in your toybox you want to use it whenever possible so you brandish it when 65 in the minors and run substantial risk of playing ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in the wrong suit, sometimes doubled. the lower of the two suits should be at least as long as the higher suit|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h4|pc|h9|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that is, when you are 65 instead of 56|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but even beyond that, a weak 2S is a much commoner hand type and a more effective preempt. you can combine this here toy with multi of course, but then you have to batch in all ...|pg||
