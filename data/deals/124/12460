nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|jbgood: hi from Bergen|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Hi -interesting start-board - 5 @S D is the spot|pg||
nt|roswolf: this does lookk fairly straightforward @H v @S -i think the @H will play the contract but at what level!?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Probably @S will not even be bid|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Those who play strong club as N/S might invite opponents to finde the @S-fit|pg||
nt|roswolf: well west may have the chance to come in with a double if n/s show a 2 suited fit|pg||
nt|vugraphzbv: off we go|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|andersk: Hi all|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Next board|pg||
pc|h3|nt|roswolf: west had an opportunity assuming south had made a weak raise -you must get in the auction at mps and the vul was quite conducive|pg||

nt|roswolf: another flattish board|pg||

mb|p|mb|5H|nt|roswolf: south will be the victim|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|nt|hawe45:  South must fin the way to NO @H-looser|pg||
nt|andersk: Now Kvangraven has to find the right way to pay the @H to make|pg||
nt|jbgood: laughter at the table as dummy's spades come down|pg||
nt|roswolf: very poor discipline by south - he must trust pard|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|dT|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Nice lead|pg||

nt|roswolf: play of the 8 is not trivial|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|roswolf: well done|pg||
mc|11|nt|roswolf: that should be a good score|pg||
nt|jbgood: yes - W will more often than not play low on the queen, unless of course he has K10|pg||
nt|vugraphzbv: that's it 2boards/round, 6mins left of the round|pg||
nt|jbgood: Kvangraven was happy to make the contract, but as he pointed out, quite a few may lead spades... |pg||
nt|jbgood: he was not that unhappy about not passing 4 spades - prd may NOT have that good trumps..|pg||
nt|roswolf: ues jon but a lot of pairs will play in clubs i think + slam will be bid by some|pg||
nt|hawe45:  We forgot to comment on Wests 1 @S-bid!!!|pg||
nt|vugraphzbv: still waiting for EW, they're playing the previous round|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think passing the double of 4@S is mandatory - pard must have very good trumps to suggest a penalty - he knowws at the vul that he needs to get them -4|pg||
nt|vugraphzbv: theyre arriving now|pg||

mb|2H|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbgood: 1 heart normally shows 3 hearts, the ordinary 4 card support hand would usually bid a direct 2@h|pg||
mb|p|pc|c9|nt|andersk: this might give NS the magic +200|pg||
nt|roswolf: typical mp situation pass/double or bid 1 more|pg||

nt|Walddk2: If partner is short in spades, it seems right, because he did not act over 1@S, but Berset guessed wrong|pg||
nt|jbgood: if you use 14-17 in balancing seat, which quite a few do, I dont think it is easy to bid on S's hand|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|pc|h2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|jbgood: 14-17 NT that is|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  140 is by  good defence the max here|pg||
nt|mcphee: lot of argument for 1@C opening|pg||
nt|jbgood: not easy to find that defense|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Open 1 @C - and jump in @C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|mcphee: the downside in 1@C is it becomes easy to get an overcall in|pg||

mc|10|nt|hawe45:  East shal not overtake to play a @S, West can do that himself.|pg||
nt|mcphee: E might have attempted to try for a @D ruff|pg||
nt|jbgood: all hands played simultaneously all over the field - that is why we can have results after each round:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: last round before lunch coming up now..|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ain't it board 30 as last before lunch Jon?|pg||
nt|jbgood: 52 pairs in the Champion heat - 68 pairs in the A-heat|pg||
nt|rodal f: And restart at 15.45CET|pg||
nt|mcphee: i think to try for @D ruff is more reasonable defence here|pg||
nt|mcphee: although its not so clear cut|pg||

nt|mcphee: these are hands that are fun I see|pg||
mb|1D|nt|rodal f: Not using the @HA ther could have been wrong by E if one trick was needed for 9. So Haldor did right|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|jbgood: First thanks go to BBO and Roland Wald, and Bergen Akademiske Bridgeklubb, for broadcasting this prestigious event. And the Tournament  Committee leader, David Ueland, and his two ...|pg||

nt|rodal f: A spec sugested 2@S from S after 1@S from E, but he cant. It tells @H and @C by a good hand from S|pg||
