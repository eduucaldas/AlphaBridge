mb|p|nt|rodal f: Y|pg||
nt|gavin:  my feelings change strongly if edgtton was vulnerable.  The problem with opening 4 card majors when you are vul in 3rd chair is often you end up playing a 4-3 fit in 2, or even 3 when the opponents overcall and your partner  has a limit raise|pg||
mb|p|pc|d2|nt|gavin:  and you can go 2 down vul, sometimes doubled when the suit breaks badly|pg||
