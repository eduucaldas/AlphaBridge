mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: you think Bilski-Noble system generates a lot of alerts -- someday scope out Michael Ware when he's playing CRUNCH|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: who do we blame for not finding the @H fit??|pg||
pc|d4|nt|granguru: E of course|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure how EW play a passed hand 4th suit bid of 2@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so maybe Khan is supposed to bid 3@H on the way to 3N|pg||
mc|9|nt|ahollan1: OR reverse into 2@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW in the other room play Polish Club, so West was able to show he had good hand early|pg||
nt|granguru: if E bids 1@S and then 2@H he has shown 9 cards at least. when he bids 1@S -2@S he shows only 6 and much more side suit alternatives|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: the players have left the table for a short break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks James|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not necessarily since we don't know what Bilal passed hand responses of 2@D/@H/@S would be|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: 3 players have returned to the table, just waiting on Bilal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and -- if Khan has shown 9+ minors, why introduce weak 4 card @H when expecting at best 7 card fit|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: wow|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2S showed both majors or both minors. there are some advantages to such bids but several downsides too|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
pc|cT|nt|marlowepi: one of the latter is that when you have this gizmo in your toybox you want to use it whenever possible so you brandish it when 65 in the minors and run substantial risk of playing ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in the wrong suit, sometimes doubled. the lower of the two suits should be at least as long as the higher suit|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that is, when you are 65 instead of 56|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but even beyond that, a weak 2S is a much commoner hand type and a more effective preempt. you can combine this here toy with multi of course, but then you have to batch in all ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: strengths of weak 2s, so the partner of the multi bidder has to guess a lot|pg||

mb|2S|mb|d|an|!|nt|ahollan1: i bet Bilal is nowhere near too strong for 2@D|pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: how many partnerships know if 3@D is forcing or not?|pg||

mb|1D|an|!|mb|p|mb|2S|an|!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D the only positive bid [6+]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is interesting   2@S=17-20, 6+@S and 4+minor|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|4N|an|!|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 4N RKC, 5@D=1 key card    please don't ask about 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: talk about drawing the perfecta -- both black Queens|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: no pressure now -- but i wonder what best line for 12 is after @HJ lead and 2nd @H|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: Three|pg||
nt|cindy:  hoo nose|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: ok i asked because only one comparison appears on "Movie"\|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: Only played 1 of the same boards|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: ok thx|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: strong club, 1D is transfer?|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|jcwla: Yet another missed game after a 1NT opening.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: spec says 1D = any 6+ HCP|pg||
mb|4S|nt|kiwibridge: 2@S seems a strange response ro @C and another|pg||
nt|cindy:  whats 1N   a grabit ?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hJ|pc|h2|nt|marlowepi: probably like a forcing NT. has the advantage of going slow & letting pd rebid naturally at 2 level. 2H might bix N and the suit is not that good anyway|pg||
nt|cindy:  im told 1N is supposed to be 9+ game force|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h8|pg||
pc|hT|nt|marlowepi: more curious is the 2N bid, but N cannot force to game (3D presumably) and 2D might not be forcing|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|nt|marlowepi: Ok i was wrong. |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dont expect it to happen again:)|pg||
nt|cindy:  not until groundhog day|pg||
