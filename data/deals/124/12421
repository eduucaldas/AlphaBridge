mb|p|nt|varange: and a consummate professional, as they all are|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: I think the boys are trying to be too delicate here|pg||
nt|wesleyc: If 1C could be any balanced hand maybe Adam was worried about clubs for 3NT|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Winners of this match join Nabil Edgtton - Paul Gosney and Michael Whibley - Justin Howard on the Australian U26 team that will play in the Junior PABF tournamnet in Hamilton, NZ, ...|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: as well as the World Juniors in the USA later in the year|pg||

mb|d|nt|dougdscsu: Edgtton would do well to offer 4@s here..|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|poohbear: Adam was worried that with his extras they might have slam since North is unlimited and I presume showed 4-5 in the blacks |pg||

nt|bucheister: I think this will make except for a diamond lead|pg||
pc|s4|nt|poohbear: but the king of @h rates to be worthless so the prudent bid might have been 3NT |pg||

pc|s7|nt|poohbear: But thats a good lead|pg||

pc|sA|nt|poohbear: Declarer might have to take a fast @c finesse to make this|pg||

nt|poohbear: second dbl|pg||

nt|sybarra2: or a 5 with a minor  |pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: np Pascale :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: George Bilski - is a bridge pro with an insurance background - he has been aussie rep ans aussie captain many times|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: Since Hung has a weak hand he opts to show his @s and ignore @ds|pg||
mb|p|pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|dougdscsu: 4@s is on..but will they bid it?|pg||
nt|frankaus: NS play a modified wercsion of Polish Club|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cT|pg||
nt|poohbear: I agree since the auction gets awkward when you respond 1D playing Walsh style|pg||
nt|poohbear: Hung knows that partner has 4 trumps so he gambles|pg||
nt|varange: they may well be playing these Balanced Weak Twos through the multi, and "normal" Weak Twos' as-is|pg||
pc|c3|nt|poohbear: Partner would rdbl with 3 card support for @s|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: He caught a great dummy :)|pg||

pc|s3|pg||
nt|poohbear: yes he did|pg||
nt|poohbear: he has to be careful again. He needs to draw trumps before playing @ds to avoid an uppercut|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|nt|cuttysark: Minors lying well here - should make 10 tricks|pg||
pc|h5|nt|varange: it's generally played the other way around though|pg||
pc|h4|pg||

nt|dougdscsu: @d jack will seal the deal I'm afraid|pg||
nt|poohbear: might see a @h shift here|pg||

pc|s2|pc|d2|pc|sT|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|nt|bucheister: I think that E has to bid something; 2nt or 3C|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk4: Operator, the tables are not linked. Please shut down and reconnect to the open room|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|wesleyc: 2c seems a slightly odd lead on the west hand|pg||
pc|d6|nt|frankaus: that say u only need to get the first and last letters correct - but i have trouble with even that|pg||
pc|d5|nt|poohbear: Declarer banked on deception in order to avoid losing control if @s 3-1|pg||
pc|dK|nt|varange: the spade bid would be the same as with a normal multi - showing game interest in hearts (if that is partner's suit) and tolerance for spades|pg||
