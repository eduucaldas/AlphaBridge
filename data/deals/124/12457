nt|tejjyid: He gave up a few years ago, I recall|pg||
nt|janm: Is 3 out of 4 (or 4 out of 4) smokers high for Australia, as it would be for the US?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: yes, even for bridge players this is a pretty high number|pg||
nt|janm: That's good - smoking isn't good for ones health and we need bridge players to stay alive since we don't seem to be doing a good job of recruiting new, younger ones :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: sadly, tis ex-snoker isalso an ex-player|pg||
nt|janm: I notice that Markey's 1NT was 10-14; isn't it awkward to have quite so wide a range?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: yes - in fact we have already seen one 9 HCP NT aswell|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it is something of a calling card for them|pg||
nt|janm: It seems to me they'd have a difficult time sorting out what they have with that wide a range, even if they didn't shade it at all|pg||
nt|janm: Although the CR EW seem to have gotten even higher|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|Gerben42: 1@H is more than 0-6 (thats forcing pass)|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|poohbear: Prob looking at 3NT here. Defense has to win the first @c in the south hand to preserve North's entry to the @s suit|pg||
mb|2S|nt|avivs:  they didn't hear of negative doubles?|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2@h was alerted. Possible that they play some kind of transfer system making 2@h a Q bid. But Im just guessing|pg||
nt|poohbear: as if he Q bid 2@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|poohbear: 2@s goes for 500 on a @d lead or switch|pg||
mb|3C|nt|Gerben42: tough auction for EW, may reach 4@S now|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: but these days very few partnerships can dbl the opps in a partial with balanced hands|pg||
nt|poohbear: most everyone plays Takeout dbls of low level contracts|pg||
nt|poohbear: so the other hand needs a stack to sit|pg||
nt|poohbear: not sure whats happening here but I suspect 3C is forcing|pg||
nt|avivs:  if 2@h was indeed a qbid than i think X should be penalty oriented|pg||

nt|avivs:  other table played in 2NT by West -1|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|poohbear: Declarer in 3 NT needs to win the second @s and cross to a @h to lead a @c making it as difficult as possible for South to hop|pg||
pc|s7|nt|poohbear: defense can counter by shifting to @ds and setting up 1@s 2@c and 2@ds|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Gerben42: well done getting somewhere sensible|pg||
nt|avivs:  defense might survive that if declarer missgues the diamonds|pg||
pc|sT|nt|peachy: not a bad contract |pg||

mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|janm: But I think that you're more likely to be dealt 10 than 12, so wouldn't the 10 or 11s come up more often than the better hands?|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|nt|janm: Yes, both of them need the spade finesse, and 3NT also needs hearts not 5-2, but doesn't 4@s need spades 3-3?|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|an|forced|nt|janm: In 3NT, if the spades don't break you can take the club finesse for the 9th trick? |pg||
nt|janm: Of course that needs diamonds to come in, but spades needs that too - no, the club finesse might be good enough in spades if diamonds don't come in. Too complicated for me :)|pg||

mc|6|nt|janm: How do you think N or S are supposed to get into this auction after the 2@s opening, which was, as you commented about EW, super-aggressive|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Thanks all - we will be back in about half an hour for the next half of this match |pg||
nt|tejjyid: could overcall with 15-17 NT as South|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: The room will stay open until we have confirmed scored |pg||
nt|vugrapha1: scores*|pg||
nt|janm: It seems a little pushy, but I guess you're right. Or North could risk DBL or 3@h|pg||
nt|tejjyid: not completely clear though, with the soft stopper; I alwasy used to pass these hands, but I'm pretty conservative over weak openings|pg||
nt|janm: He did overcall 1NT on a pretty bad 15 earlier, but 2NT? Still, I'd hate to get stolen from like this :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: sometimes you lose, but you pick up lots of 5 imp "down in both room" swings|pg||
nt|tejjyid: It's not empirical, but my feeling isyou want QT as the minimum stopper with minimum values |pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|an|alert|mb|p|nt|chip: and in fact EW are doing quite well, killing their opponents.|pg||
nt|avivs:  in that case than South should have done somthing|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chip: That is, Ew in the other room (why their team is ahead by 34 despite some poor play by NS here)|pg||

nt|Gerben42: the distribution and bad honors made West decide against 3@D|pg||
nt|poohbear: play to 3NT is interesting on a @s lead. If the defense plays 2 rounds of spades retaining an entry to the West hand . Declarer's best bet is playing a 3rd @s|pg||
