nt|woozle: 3NT is a possible contract also, but that can be beaten if the opponents get around to diamonds early|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|Walddk2: No reason to reach game-level with those values|pg||
nt|woozle: Apparently the other room failed in 4H, so an opportunity for EW if they can make a game, or indeed any contract at all|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3H|nt|woozle: Is 2H some kind of spade raise?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bgn: presumably 2@H a raise, allowing E to bid a strongish 3@H. Would East have jumped to 4@H if N just bid 2@S?|pg||
mb|p|pc|sA|nt|woozle: Robinson/Delivera miss their club fit (and the game bonus that comes with it) but they'll earn 5-6 imps if they can bring home 3H|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s9|pc|s7|pg||
nt|bgn: simple line is just to cash the @HA-K and then run clubs, refusing to ruff the @SK. But then NS can counter if N pitches one @S before ruffing the 4th @C|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d3|pc|s6|pc|sT|pg||
nt|bgn: that gives N the chance to ruff a 3rd spade if declarer doesnt ruff the  @S K|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|h7|pc|s3|pg||
nt|bgn: but the players don't agree with that idea at all :)|pg||

nt|petergill: Welcome back|pg||
nt|petergill: the hands are from the previous 16 boards|pg||
nt|sporteye: Hi Peter, Hi Henry|pg||
nt|petergill: so the table will have to be shut down and re-started, I guess|pg||
nt|petergill: This hand was in the first 16 boards|pg||
nt|petergill: West played in 1NT on a spade lead about 2 hours ago|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Ed, welcome everyone to a set of Crunch|pg||
nt|itinerant: McManus-Ware are playing a system named CRUNCH|pg||
nt|itinerant: Hi Gary|pg||
mb|p|an|0-6 or 15-20|nt|kiwibridge: now unless the CR overtakes us again we should have comparisons|pg||

nt|henryb:  like a bad penny I too show up again.Hi Peter|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: hi Shirley|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=9-18 HCP, 4+@S, unbal, maybe longer @C/@D, maybe 4@H|pg||
nt|itinerant: 1S in third seat = 9-18pts, 4+ spades|pg||

nt|pamela: hi Gary |pg||
nt|itinerant: ah, has everyone got that?|pg||
nt|pamela: and SHirley|pg||
mb|2H|an|3-6pts, 3+ spades|nt|jcwla: The pace in the CR is glacial.  They are now starting 18.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: describe the other holdings on the next round:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Pamela welcome|pg||
nt|pamela: are we in for a bumpy ride  :-) |pg||
nt|itinerant: 2H = 3-6pts, 3+ spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: do you adjust in canape to play penalty X's?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hold on should be fun, great youth players vs experienced pros|pg||
mb|d|nt|pamela: when did Michael Ware move to Aussie|pg||
mb|2S|nt|peachy: hi tez, his specs|pg||
nt|peachy: hi*|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello Raija and Tez|pg||

nt|pamela: oh lol ok|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|itinerant: he's still living in NZ|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|kiwibridge: fingers crossed J|pg||
nt|tez: dbl shows 3 card @h|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: wow|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2S showed both majors or both minors. there are some advantages to such bids but several downsides too|pg||
nt|itinerant: hard to control the trump situation in this contract|pg||
nt|itinerant: it would seem the defence needs to attack diamonds sooner rather than later|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: he lived in Hong Kong for a few years, his wife Mary-Ellen qualified to play for HK ladies|pg||
nt|sybarra: the taps in the @D may kill this (if they can find it fast enough)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|peachy: I am not sure what sys EW have, yesterday I thought it was Polish club, anyone?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|peachy: this should make in comfort|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they moved back to NZ where he resumed his status as our leading player|pg||
pc|s9|nt|vugrapha2: sorry aout that, had to leave the table momentarily|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|pamela: matt will play 9 S |pg||
pc|d2|nt|marlowepi: one of the latter is that when you have this gizmo in your toybox you want to use it whenever possible so you brandish it when 65 in the minors and run substantial risk of playing ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in the wrong suit, sometimes doubled. the lower of the two suits should be at least as long as the higher suit|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h3|pc|d7|pc|d6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that is, when you are 65 instead of 56|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but even beyond that, a weak 2S is a much commoner hand type and a more effective preempt. you can combine this here toy with multi of course, but then you have to batch in all ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: strengths of weak 2s, so the partner of the multi bidder has to guess a lot|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: everyone is just taking a 5 min break|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|h7|pc|s3|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: excellent pin|pg||
nt|sybarra: been suggested this can make with  7trumps 2@C +1@S|pg||
nt|mwigor: hi all|pg||

pc|s8|pc|s4|pc|dJ|pc|c7|pg||
nt|itinerant: The Milne team has an average age of 21yrs, and that includes alex Smirnov who is 27!|pg||
nt|poohbear: If he had tried drawing trumps He would succeed if @ds were blocked or trumps 3-3. Might have been a better line|pg||

nt|woozle: East's 2C is (shock) natural, and appears to show roughly the same hand type as a 2C response by an unpassed hand|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: NOT is short for National Open Teams. We are in Canberra, Australia|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk2: 10:33 am Monday local time|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|woozle: A spectator has suggested that a spade safety play may be in order...it's a good thought, but if Milne's heart six lead is a true card, the safety play isn't necessary since ...|pg||
nt|woozle: there's no five card heart suit out|pg||

nt|bgn: Also I've checked dates and am keen on Butler in Hobart if you're still interested!  Only risk is if we make NSW ANC team. |pg||

nt|Walddk4: We don't think your name is Laura|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Pls edit your profile|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|marlowepi: one wonders how many results of that sort -- 500 away against no game, not a rare outcome -- it takes to quell the players' ardor for those methods|pg||
nt|marlowepi: to be fair, they can bring in the odd bushel too|pg||
nt|itinerant: apparently Meckwell vow to open all balanced 11 counts - Nabil is keen too|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Ah, James, welcome|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Good evening to Thomas Gotard|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he must make up for his much older partner who must be slowing down now that he's all of 27|pg||
nt|pamela: yes  seen better 11's |pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy:  looks like strong to me too|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2S was presumably NF but E has a good hand|pg||

nt|itinerant: not sure that it shows 11pts though|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: hi all from happy Dortmund!|pg||

mb|3N|nt|vugrapha2: west is asking for an explanation of the auction so far|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy:  very good|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|poohbear: problem with this method is that you cant stop in 2@s anymore|pg||
nt|sybarra: pleasant that spades are 3/3 |pg||
nt|poohbear: when you bid 2nt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some use 2@D/2N to say  not 4 other major, not 3 your major, min vs max|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jcwla: Good contract.|pg||
nt|poohbear: would be a better method if 2@c was GF|pg||
nt|itinerant: Mercifully for their methods, Alex had no plans to stop at the 2-level this time|pg||
nt|poohbear: though I dont know , Maybe it is|pg||
pc|h8|nt|tez: now in deep trouble..has to figure out his pds shape..|pg||

nt|tez: not enuf jt9|pg||
nt|peachy: got|pg||
nt|pamela: they arrived in same spot regardless who opened - nice lead |pg||
nt|ahollan1: right  2@D as min fits in with Barry's opportunity to stop in 2@S|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|hQ|nt|poohbear: We will see if declarer ducks and takes a safety play in @s by playing Q and low to the 9 to cater to 5-1 spades|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|2D|mb|d|nt|woozle: Robinson opens 1H...EW are, of course, weak notrumpers, so 1NT wasn't a consideration|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good hand for a non-forcing 2@S|pg||
nt|woozle: Delivera evidently can't bid any number of spades without misstating his values, so he starts with an ugly negative double|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, I am not a fan of negative free bids, but this hand qualifies I must confess|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|nt|woozle: Some partnerships could bid 3S instead|pg||

mb|p|an|0-6 or 15-20|mb|1H|nt|cindy:  yeh|pg||
mb|2D|an| |nt|itinerant: Kiwis might be having a tough time choosing their favourite today. Mike Ware, on the Delivera team, and both Liam Milne and Michael Whibley on the Milne team are kiwis|pg||
nt|sybarra: E likely to bid a large bunch of spades|pg||
nt|poohbear: Yea but Whibley has defected|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: but Whibbers is officially an Aussie now :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: although Whibley is now an adopted Australian|pg||
mb|2S|nt|tez: with open hands 7@d ok|pg||
mb|3D|nt|pamela: do not recognize that name are they young players |pg||
mb|4S|nt|tez: 6@d is good game|pg||
mb|5D|nt|jcwla: Aggressive double here.|pg||
nt|itinerant: Ah, and richard brightling, for delivera is a defected KIWI also!|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: We are taking over :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Whibley play in the NZ Bermuda Bowl Team, now in the Australian Youth|pg||
nt|pamela: most of the gooduns in Aus are from NZ ( ducking for cover as I say it)|pg||
nt|poohbear: Edgtton should pass here and respect partner's decision|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Smirnov remains a German though, right?|pg||
nt|mwigor: whats pass for matt and mike ed?|pg||
nt|itinerant: first seat pass 0-6 or 15-20|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: pass is 0-6 or 15-20|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1st/2nd seat  PASS = 0-6 OR 15-20 Balanced OR 15-20 Unbalanced no 4 card Major|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 15-20 unbal WITH 4+ major starts with 1@C[@H] or 1@D[@S]|pg||
mb|p|an| |nt|jcwla: Min opener, flat shape.  The lead is perfect.|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|cindy:  why does N have to bid 1N here ?|pg||
nt|tomi2: dot like 2@S here, but for others its normal|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy:  cant he bid what he has ?|pg||
nt|tez: i dont agree with 2@s..my choise is 2@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: same here,|pg||
nt|tomi2: would be even worst if soub might be balanced, say 3244 distr. then N does not know about fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: 5@c 5nt 7@d:)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|poohbear: I wonder how they deal with that wide a range? Is the system on all the time?|pg||
nt|poohbear: or just NV|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all vul -- just changes if 1st/2nd vs 3rd/4th|pg||
nt|poohbear: seems to me if they are vul I would trap pass every now and then|pg||

nt|poohbear: especially with shortness so I can get back in with a TO dbl|pg||
nt|itinerant: but gains 1 heart trick!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: McManus 2@D is decent suit/hand  ---  if weak 1-suiter would bid Comic [aka Gardener] NT over 1@H|pg||
nt|itinerant: if the defence holds up in clubs correctly, declarer will lose 2 heart tricks|pg||

nt|tomi2: strange double by smirnov|pg||
pc|d5|nt|peachy: eased N's probable worries about clubs|pg||
pc|d8|nt|tomi2: wants to remind himself to lead a club ;). question is if the opps can use the extra bidding room or get confused because they dont have enough agreements|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Hi Kieran|pg||

nt|bgn: This looks to be a trick short after declarer ducks 2 @S tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|woozle: Milne appears to have started with a cue raise...and his hand is quite nice for clubs, but it's a little deficient in values for 3NT|pg||
nt|bgn: ditto 4@C if they run|pg||
nt|bgn: I'd feel better about North's aggressive raise if one of his @D honours was in @C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: 3NT can be two down if West switches to a heart after two spades|pg||

pc|s3|nt|jcwla: Cue up Boy George...I know all there is to know about the crying game...|pg||
pc|s5|nt|marlowepi: against high suit contracts, usually better to lead from short strength than longer weakness|pg||
pc|sT|nt|janm: Whether P is forcing depends on their agreements - I think it's very hard not to bid 5@h if P isn't forcing, and not sure whether N would work out to DBL if S made a forcing pass|pg||

nt|woozle: 1NT|pg||
nt|woozle: Milne has a lovely sound overcall in clubs, and Whibley should have no trouble moving toward 3NT|pg||
mb|1D|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Nice auction|pg||
nt|woozle: Robinson should start with a top heart...with no points opposite, his best chance to shoot this is to find partner with five small hearts|pg||

nt|woozle: Whibley needs to pick clubs for the contract, but they're as friendly as can be...he'll make his eleven top tricks|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: Three|pg||
nt|cindy:  hoo nose|pg||
nt|bucheister: It's the old bid one more at IMPs; probably a better problem at MPs|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: restart at 5:15|pg||
nt|poohbear: bidding one more cost 11 imps|pg||
mb|1D|nt|marlowepi: ok i asked because only one comparison appears on "Movie"\|pg||
nt|itinerant: tight 3NT here|pg||
mb|2C|nt|tomi2: last board in this segment, 3 more segments of 16 boards to come|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: Only played 1 of the same boards|pg||
nt|tomi2: E has some nice fit for partner :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4 imp difference with only 49 comparisons remaining|pg||
nt|itinerant: lol|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: ok thx|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kiwibridge: last board this set, practically a tied match, great vugraph from Pascale, great comments all|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: strong club, 1D is transfer?|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: not a good risk reward|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Yet another missed game after a 1NT opening.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: again -- 2@C has substance because Comic 1N available for bad 1-suiter|pg||
nt|itinerant: same 11 tricks here as teh other room, one would suspect|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty Gary...great fun, when do we restart     very exciting |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thx spec great feedback, we are due to resume in about 40 minutes|pg||
pc|d5|nt|marlowepi: spec says 1D = any 6+ HCP|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kiwibridge: 2@S seems a strange response ro @C and another|pg||
nt|cindy:  whats 1N   a grabit ?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c6|nt|bucheister: what does the panel think about the 2H rebid by W?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|poohbear: it might be the only situation where I rebid 2S with 6-4|pg||
nt|bucheister: this auction should show a very good 6-4?|pg||
nt|poohbear: then over 2NT i can rebid 3H and partner knows I got this|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|marlowepi: probably like a forcing NT. has the advantage of going slow & letting pd rebid naturally at 2 level. 2H might bix N and the suit is not that good anyway|pg||
nt|cindy:  im told 1N is supposed to be 9+ game force|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bucheister: well said|pg||
nt|poohbear: not in a 2/1 auction|pg||
nt|janm: The 2@h rebid convinced East to play 3NT - 4@s is a better contract, I think|pg||
nt|poohbear: Agree Jan|pg||
nt|poohbear: if He bids 2S then 3H he gets to 4@s|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c3|nt|marlowepi: more curious is the 2N bid, but N cannot force to game (3D presumably) and 2D might not be forcing|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty   see you then :)|pg||
nt|itinerant: see you all in 40 mins!|pg||
mc|10|nt|marlowepi: Ok i was wrong. |pg||
nt|sybarra: Kids should be happy |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 5 imps the lead, better than nothing :)|pg||
