nt|bjacobs: yes, good idea|pg||
nt|bjacobs: We'll imagine that Lilley is 11 imps in the lead, and Noble needs 14 imps to qualify|pg||

nt|bjacobs: This is the last board.  Many thanks to our enthusiastic and informative operator, Traian Chira|pg||
nt|po-s: agree fully - 2H should show an opening hand unsuitable for double, better than this one|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: OK we are up to date with the scores|pg||
nt|bjacobs: His account is "vugraph3" -  I believe he's in line for a promotion to "vugraph2"|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|bjacobs: And many thanks also to PO Sundelin, Tim Bourke and Roland Wald for keeping us informed|pg||

nt|bjacobs: This is the last segment of the day, but BBO will be back tomorrow I think with the Seniors and Women's finals|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|po-s: Is there a chance for those three imps that Bill thinks are needed?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well!  The big 12 imps came in on the board we missed|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: wow the last board match|pg||
nt|Walddk3: and good luck next week in the Open Teams! I suppose you and Ben Thompson will be taking part|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Thanks Roland|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Double might be the 2 imps involved|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: wow|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s3|nt|bjacobs: For example, if at the other table, E/W double 5@C, then they pick up their 2 imps|pg||

nt|vugrapha3: closed is in 4s e|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, plenty of play in 4@S - a diamond lead will beat it 2 tricks|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: w sorry|pg||
mc|10|nt|po-s: lead?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But on a club lead, it romps home|pg||

nt|vugrapha3: lets wait for the result in the closed|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: thanks Roland and BBO|pg||
nt|po-s: we only need the lead please|pg||
nt|Walddk3: I bet a diamond|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It does seem a likely lead|pg||
nt|po-s: may depend on the bidding|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: wait... they finished ... i will have the score in one sec|pg||
nt|Walddk3: wow|pg||
