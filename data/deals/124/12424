nt|vugraphzcz: little slow table to start but the smokers are at this table|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|wiki: hello again - 8 more boards|pg||
nt|k ylinen: pas,kun on 11ap ja tasainen|pg||
nt|rodal f: A realy good quality at that @S for the bid:))))|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|an|17+|nt|kaapo2:  NS play Blue Club|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: not splinter|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N!|an|8+, 4 controls|nt|hawe45:  Easy play here - all suitys behave|pg||
nt|hedyg: check for 4 @ss|pg||
nt|wiki: 5 @S optimum as EW can make 5 1C or @D|pg||
nt|wiki: @C|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: hand when you know pd has @s:s but u wanna play in @h :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzcz: 2 aces and the correct singelton, so missed a slam on this one|pg||
mb|2D|nt|kaapo2:  Holding a 4-card major, North usually would open with the major|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y. But 3@H at least is on|pg||
nt|k ylinen: N passed with 11 hcp and balanced as system requires so|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo2:  That's why South gets to bypass her 4-card @H suit|pg||
mb|3D|nt|hawe45:  For what reason 1 @D from North - and not 1 C???|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@c-3@H-3NT= not intterested in @Hs looking for @ss|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Hello|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Kaapo|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo2:  Good evening Raija :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last time it went 1@S  4@H  declarer was in a 0-0 fit. Sadly, it wasn't on vugraph|pg||
nt|wiki: bur probably 3 pass here|pg||
mb|6D|nt|hedyg: because with 4 4 they open 1@D|pg||
nt|hedyg: it is systemic|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I see - but why?|pg||
nt|wiki: but - sorry about my fingers :(|pg||
nt|wiki: hello again and welcome|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: you could bid 4@c asking pd to trf to his suit, then pass the 4@h response|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Test the @C for the hook and 3-3. If not 3-3 u need to hit the @D, but here the @C works|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: because when the bidding goes 1@d-1@s-X he can bid 2@c without 4@hs and no @s stopper|pg||
nt|doctorone: Frankly, I would just have bid 3N as S. See where we are now. But as it is our day, we will survive in 4@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: but 3NT shows 4@ss to me|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I do hope, that the survival will be in 4 NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: i would bid 3@s without them and 3NT with them|pg||
nt|doctorone: I meant over 2NT, bidding 3NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: why give up on finding a 4 4 @s fit?|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  This is a sequence it's good to have an agreement on so that you don't get to play in a 1-0 fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: this should make max 7 tricks if lucky|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Ah, Roland has 0-0|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi specs and vug operator:)|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|nt|hawe45:  But hard to find the killing @d-lead against 4 NT...|pg||
nt|hedyg: pd will NEVER bid over 3NT ....:(|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Good by to a plus-score|pg||
nt|doctorone: I don't want to open a debate... I know how many positions about this issue exist, but I don't like bidding 2N with 4@s... So my problem is solved. I know, they are drawbacks of ...|pg||
nt|doctorone: course|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In fact, 4 @H can NEVER mak - if not South plays @H to the 10, he is short of entries|pg||
nt|peachy: prob six|pg||
nt|oliverc: .|pg||
nt|wiki: both pairs playing  strong club|pg||

pc|d9|pc|d8|nt|doctorone: good lead|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
nt|rodal f: Re hi:)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|oliverc: but who are we to argue with success?|pg||
nt|muppe: +1 now it seems. Defence would have done its best with trump lead or switch at trick 2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Kursat Ozsahin|pg||
nt|vbman: hi all|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|hawe45:  Tha was killing (the) defence|pg||

nt|hedyg: they have split some pairs...Latinovs regular pd is Tom Fenwick who is at home coughing. mishaps are bound to happen|pg||

nt|vbman: think it is going to get exiciting|pg||
nt|rodal f: If any like to use BBO-TV: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: W:s comment was that he didn't like the chances of making that contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: but considering the situation of the match, he felt he had to bid it|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: game both sides here|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: good max E has here|pg||
nt|vbman: some might open with e|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  In the open room, they weren't sure if 4@H was a splinter or not, resulting in playing in 4@S|pg||
nt|rodal f: Any 1@D for major?|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  How can E/W get a trick against a @H-slam?|pg||
nt|oliverc: I'd certainly open the East hand. Precision tends to lose the Diamond suit a bit,|pg||
nt|oliverc: since the 1@D Opening is more of a catch-all and in classic precision can easily|pg||
nt|oliverc: have as few as 2 Diamonds|pg||
nt|wiki: shorter than in Ostende :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|hawe45:  7 @C looks like only 1100|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo2:  Yes, could be a swing board|pg||
nt|muppe: 4@h will probably make, will they bid it?|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  4@C should do it|pg||
nt|vbman: i dont think its gf |pg||
nt|vbman: ah there|pg||
nt|vbman: 4 card support makes s hand a giant|pg||
nt|wiki: maybe not in red|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not u W. Was thinking abough S:)|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Well judged|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|doctorone: would you support @cs as E?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Or may-be 1400 because of the bad trump-split|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d looks like a waste of time|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I would pass - or bid 5 @C|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Unless EW think otherwise|pg||
nt|oliverc: Yes, the overcall will make it easier for NS to get to this slam|pg||
mb|2C!|an|Crowhurst says CC|nt|peachy: I suppose Makela doubted whther 4H makes because he only bid 3S|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  1@D could be short if 11-13 balanced, so EW don't really know about the huge double fit|pg||
nt|rodal f: Coffe time again:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: 3@h would be -1 if u find the @c ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: i really prefer 3@c over 2@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: i'd like to bid 1@s instead of 2 with the S hand|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Looking at EW's cards, 5@C looks to have just 3 losers|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: 5@c could be -2 but on a @h lead it would make|pg||
nt|muppe: Easy 10 tricks it seems|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Welcome to Markku Pekkinen|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|hedyg: now 5@c|pg||
nt|wiki: pass was ok now when 3 NT is not quite makeable|pg||
nt|runnerup: hi all|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|kaapo2:  Of course @D ruff takes it 2 down|pg||
nt|vbman: close your eyes and bid the slam:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: south is gonna bid it after the 2NT call|pg||
nt|rodal f: I wonder if S would have leaded @HA in 5@C. Take a look and see what would have happend if not|pg||
nt|rodal f: As 3@S is on two|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Friendly match - E/W passing...|pg||
pc|d6|nt|muppe: Yes, but hard to bid it looking at W´s cards|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. 2@S|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kaapo2:  5@C that is|pg||
nt|oliverc: wd|pg||
nt|vbman: cool|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|d2|nt|peachy: i liked 2S better, no defense except potential slow club|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kaapo2:  This is the third segment of 8 boards out of 10. After this segment, there will be a late lunch and the restart is then at 15:30 local time (14:30 CET)|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|nt|rodal f: Sr. Forgot the @S was 5-2|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||
nt|hedyg: now he can pull trumps and ruff out J@d if only W does not have 3 @hs|pg||
nt|runnerup: north hoped this to be forcing but -partner passed-dissopointing--4 spades on but lucky|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|sK|nt|wiki: Keep you high cards says N|pg||

pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|s6|pc|sA|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dQ|pc|d9|pc|d8|pg||
nt|doctorone: that explains why they scored a trick there... Declarer guarding against 3@h with W allowed a @d ruff|pg||
nt|hedyg: ofcourse|pg||
nt|rodal f: Only an exsta IMP:))|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rodal f: Non for play @H NS?|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|hedyg: he cannot just play top cards and then find @hs 3-1 , K@D in E and Q@s in W|pg||
nt|doctorone: lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: so a chance for cassini to gain some imps|pg||
pc|h5|nt|oliverc: Kibber rightly points out that 4@S here was a little pointless, (since the only control|pg||
nt|oliverc: that North is likely to have is in Spades so North unlikely to respond with anything|pg||
pc|hK|nt|oliverc: other than 5@H)|pg||
nt|wiki: it is seldom right that both play the same suit |pg||

nt|muppe: indeed|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Does Juho know any Rabbis?|pg||

nt|kaapo2:  Did Timo not bid 3@S already?|pg||
nt|wiki:  4 @S here but  only DD|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|peachy: is NS also playing some strong club variant?|pg||

nt|kaapo2:  Or was he too strong for it :)|pg||
nt|vbman: no doubletons for 3 sp|pg||
mb|2H|nt|hedyg: you mean the obvious 8@H finesse?|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Could be. They haven't played together very regularly but usually play strong club in most of their partnerships|pg||
nt|peachy: kib confirmed Einari-risti|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Sry 4 @C...|pg||
nt|doctorone: but wait.... Dont you loose 1@d and 2@hs ?|pg||
nt|rodal f: And the conceratisme pays?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Yes - T removed to 4 @C|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Both pairs here use strong club|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  NS play Einari club, a common system in Finland, especially in the Turku area. It has 4-card majors and control-showing responses to strong club|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|peachy: Einari club, close relative of Blue Club|pg||
nt|muppe: Slam makes only IF declarer drops @dK|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: why do you ask?|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  EW use Blue Club, an old Italian system with canape style and also control responses to 1@C|pg||
pc|d5|nt|hawe45:  Has North not paid his entry fee - PASS...|pg||
nt|santyclz: Tough to beat 2@d though.|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Joe :)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|vugraphzcz: but can't be bid missing 2 aces|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  No Rabbis around, so slam is destined to go down|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|rodal f: Conservatisme|pg||
nt|k ylinen: according to their system Eeva should have opened 4 and a half D*s|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: kinda difficult to do that|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kaapo2:  So the 1@S opening is often just 4 cards|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kaapo2:  I thinks Timo is quite aggressive in bidding to the 3-level. Of course 2@S looks just fine for me|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|peachy: I've heard its been cold winter there, still cold and snow?|pg||
nt|k ylinen: and later to world championships in USA!|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: pretty good hand for 14-16 opening|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|garnetts: I was wondering what East would bid--too  good for a 14-16 1NT |pg||
nt|garnetts: I don't like because of both the shape and hard values |pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: she could have opened 1@c (16+) but chose against it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Showing the majors vulnerable with 4-4 is not my cup of tea|pg||
mb|p|nt|doctorone: Oh my !|pg||
nt|doctorone: How easy for W is it to bid?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ThatÂ´s a joke - show us, what West really vbid...|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo2:  It's been colder than in recent years yes. Between -20 and -30 celcius on many days here in JyvÃ¤skylÃ¤ middle-Finland|pg||
nt|garnetts: I agree with that too Roland|pg||
nt|wiki: most players do not like to open weak  with 4-6 majors and I do not like it here as @Hs are bad|pg||
pc|c4|nt|doctorone: no, no... Hans. This is true|pg||
nt|k ylinen: yes we have exceptionally lots of snow even in Helsinki|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  And close to -20 and lots of snow even in the South|pg||
nt|peachy: optimum reached at the table|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@D asking for the longer majors. Ha!|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Should Kanerva bid 4? Seems a bit hard with the wasted @DQ but he does have a singleton and a good side suit|pg||
pc|c2|nt|muppe: 5 imps to SaTu in first brd, other room played 1NT+1|pg||
nt|vbman: maybe its timefor a convention|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So you bid hearts with equal length|pg||
nt|wiki: funny that you over ruff when you have 5 @C in hand - but those things happen:)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|k ylinen: tough competition|pg||
nt|diaoff: Yes, good pressure by NS|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But unusual that West bid again. For all he knows, partner might want to defend|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vbman: he lead beats it how many?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vbman: 1nt l mean?|pg||
nt|garnetts: I can see the east hand is awkward for 1@C strong  --what about 1@D and you are a point too good?  |pg||
nt|wiki: @C lead helps  but is normal|pg||
pc|sA|nt|muppe: And in the 2nd board Cassine takes 3 imps back. Other room found 5@cx -2|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: always play the @h6 at first opportunity|pg||
nt|oliverc: That's no doubt one of the reasons East chose the opening|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Well, I need to be going soon. Have fun here!|pg||
nt|oliverc: I'd be happy enough to open 1@D and reverse into the Hearts given the chance|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not only do we not like the 2@C bid but I suspect we hate the 3@H bid too|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  And partner often cannot raise when 4 is on|pg||

pc|s7|pc|h8|nt|doctorone: That maybe th board of the match for Bergues.... E's opening (2@d) in the other room was a semi F with  18-20... That allowed finding the game|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|muppe: This 4@s should have been doubled|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|d3|nt|kaapo2:  Wonder if Timo bid this to make or as a sac|pg||

pc|c8|nt|vbman: a slip|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes very difficult for North to raise -but now partner had suitable cards  and no wasted in Hearts|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|d4|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|vugraphzcz: and a make|pg||

nt|oliverc: has|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vbman: and a make|pg||
nt|garnetts: I wasn't actually--but I regard gadgets over 1NT as a method of balancing rather than trying to find a game so I think I would pass as North|pg||

nt|diaoff: Yes, 6@D is best but @H and NT will also make|pg||
nt|garnetts: I am alone in not liking weak two bids on flat hands in first two seats |pg||
nt|wiki: my kind of 3 NT|pg||
nt|wiki: 1 @S and 2 @S by N|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1@S and what will N bid by his 20HP|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  This hand is worth 1 @C - 1 ? - 3 @C|pg||
nt|hedyg: so?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  3 x 10 + a 6-card.suit|pg||
nt|runnerup: partscore battle 2pades win perhaps |pg||
pc|cA|nt|oliverc: Hate them|pg||
nt|wiki: @H10(11) lead makes it happy|pg||
nt|rodal f: :) Y|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: is 3@s enough for N?|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2@S is to weak for his hand. Telling (15)16-18|pg||
nt|k ylinen: rdbl?|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok this even makes|pg||
pc|c5|nt|wiki: ok - now RD|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kaapo2:  Other table already reached 6@H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In the context of 12-16 2+ diamonds I don't think 2@D is enough|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|hedyg: this hand has Kx Kx and wants to rightside NT, i agree|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Now the test for East - not @D Queen|pg||
pc|sT|nt|diaoff: Agree|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's worth 3@D imo|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Looks like just making|pg||
nt|vbman: more to cassini|pg||
nt|sybarra: well they landed |pg||
nt|wiki: @D lead makes it almost fool proof|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rodal f: My bid would have been 2@H force for one round|pg||
nt|rodal f: RD are OK to. |pg||
nt|wiki: without D I thin 2 @S is almost enough in white but 2 @H is best for me(without D)|pg||
nt|rodal f: But RD can be taken for SOS|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|hawe45:  But the suit (@D)= is frozen anywhere|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  And since they started with boards 7-8, they've played 2 boards faster|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|dA|nt|oliverc: no, to SaTu|pg||
nt|garnetts: This was meant to be 5@H and a minor --and look at how defensive the hand is |pg||
pc|d2|nt|rodal f: And here we go|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Walddk4: 6@D is a good choice in case partner has xxx in hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Qxx   xxx    in the majors and 6@H would fail whereas 6@D makes|pg||
nt|peachy: nice bidding|pg||
nt|diaoff: Exactly, but for me 6@D would have been a grand slam invitation in this auction|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Yes, good to be able to bid 6@D as a suggestion to play. I might have a fear that it's interpreted as a try for grand|pg||
nt|k ylinen: Väiski teki hyvän tarjouksen 4S, muttei se riittänyt Eevan slammihalujen torjumiseen|pg||
pc|d7|nt|wiki: not sure, but I think that W bids are natural and so W thinks that she has a better hand|pg||

nt|rodal f: Didn't get ure lead Wiki. So -1. Next|pg||
nt|wiki: Hardly as D always promises at least 3 @S or then stron minorhand|pg||
nt|rodal f: And after the pressed 2@S from S it's easyer for N to pass at level2|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s8|pg||
pc|c6|nt|wiki: But with that balanced hand I think that also after D by W  2 @H is best bid|pg||
nt|wiki: so we can rest in 2 @S|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: i would rather use the 2@h for some strong hands then for those with fit, 2/3/4@s would seem enough bids when u have @s:s|pg||

nt|Walddk4: 2 IMPs you are happy to concede in a long match. 6@D was clearly superior|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and next time it may earn you a huge swing|pg||
nt|vbman: 4h|pg||
nt|oliverc: 4@S a good save here, though|pg||

nt|kaapo2:  Now, how does Blue Club open this West hand? I suppose with 1@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|an|12-16, 5+!c|nt|oliverc: East unlikely to look further than a p/s, though, and won't compete to the 4-lvel|pg||
nt|garnetts: Will east bid if North tries 2@S |pg||
nt|garnetts: Might if he plays a gadget |pg||
nt|oliverc: East knows they're out-gunned|pg||
nt|vbman: tx and a bypass|pg||
nt|wiki: good cards but funny that you cannot make even 3 @S|pg||
nt|k ylinen: I would listen more|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will EW gain some IMPs here? Belive now if E don't go bananas|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes ew bidding can make difference to open room |pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Other table also played 3@S on  4 so one missed chance for Cassini (they still one an overtrick IMP though)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|doctorone: I dont understand opening 1@c here as Fernando does... Sorry :)|pg||

nt|oliverc: :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: until it drifts off|pg||
nt|vbman: will loose the 1st 4 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: there is a chance of accident, since if E was strong she would have acted over 2@h, so why play 2N as Leb and not 2-suiter|pg||
nt|wiki: S playing - @H lead |pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I am up for the adventure in 3 nt |pg||
nt|reisig: opening 1@h w 9xxx ..just goes against my grain|pg||
nt|Walddk5: It's against my religion|pg||

nt|vbman: bye|pg||
nt|garnetts: It looks odd not to finesse the club but if he crosses to dummy and finesses and it loses a @D back spoils the entries |pg||

nt|vugraphzcz: if opener has 5card suit, then slam possible|pg||
