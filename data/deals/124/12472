mb|3C|nt|avivs:  they didn't hear of negative doubles?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: but Patrick got there 1st|pg||
mb|p|pc|d4|nt|mrdct: the likelihood of the 2-2 break decreases with the 2NT overcall|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just confirmed other match IS playing same boards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  8 where McManus made a takeout DBL of Griffiths' 3@D   Smirnov did not open west hand|pg||

mb|1C|nt|Gerben42: a nice picture of the Milne team: http://www.abf.com.au/events/not/2010/bulletins/11Sat23.pdf|pg||
nt|Gerben42: if 1@C shows @H, then @D shows @S|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|an|H|nt|jstokes: surprised to see 1@C with 5-5 in the black suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: 3@H must be some bergenish raise|pg||
nt|marlowepi: used to be normal|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jstokes: yes, used to be....|pg||
mb|p|nt|chip: Reasonable to DBl as N. Note that if South's majors were reversed, 4H would be a good game.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|poohbear: @h lead beats this |pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: this keeps the defense in the game but I am not sure they find 7 tricks now|pg||
nt|nigel: Yep Andy is just an old fashioned guy|pg||
mb|2S|nt|chip: but may get them a bit high here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: 4@H no doubt a 2-way shot depending on who held what|pg||
nt|chip: Though looks like 4D can be made.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this does make for a tidy auction|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5H|nt|avivs:  this might be too high|pg||
nt|nigel: Seems normmal 1@D was a transfer to hearts 1@s nat 2@d 4th suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: the @C return gave them the chance, now th @D loser is gone|pg||
nt|Gerben42: a passive @S would have been better|pg||
nt|marlowepi: makes sense|pg||
nt|marlowepi: unlikely to make|pg||
nt|nigel: pity about the bad spade break |pg||
nt|jstokes: well, 3-1 isn't all that bad ;)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: though ten of spades from dummy could lead to some interesting decisions|pg||
nt|nigel: However they are not in six yet|pg||
mb|6S|nt|jstokes: right; he knows they are missing a key card and the trump queen|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jstokes: so much for that|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel: He knows they are off the sopade queen and a key card oh well|pg||
nt|marlowepi: still belong there facing say:  AJxxx   x   xx   AKQxx|pg||
pc|cA|nt|marlowepi: it is not 6S that is the dubious bid--once he bids 4N i agree wth 6S. but he could have gone slower to maybe find out how bullish a view was warranted|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|nigel: Doubt it will be bid in the other room after say 1S - 4C, 4H- then 4S|pg||
nt|jstokes: yes, but south would cooperate fully after some sort of slam TRY with the hand you gave|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer cant afford to draw trumps till his @ss are established. This might boil down to guessing which major is 3-3|pg||
nt|nigel: Suppose it is hard to stay out of|pg||
pc|c5|nt|marlowepi: my point is that the dubious call was 4N, not 6S|pg||
nt|jstokes: agree with that|pg||

nt|mrdct: a 6-4 bid more hand for north|pg||
mb|2S|an|wkish with a good suit|mb|3S!|nt|ahollan1: that's Weak???|pg||
nt|patricck: Nice of the organisers to give Michael some good cards....  it is so unusual for him to actually have his bids :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@S is a great save vs 4@H|pg||
nt|itinerant: it's "weak" but they have a comic notrump available to show a poorer hand (usually a poorer suit)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C!|nt|ahollan1: even so -- looks like a 1@S bid to me -- those @C aren't chopped liver |pg||
nt|mrdct: if north doubles 4@C south may come to life|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: sidebar -- why is that phrase used?  i always liked chopped liver     but i digress|pg||
nt|patricck: Then East will know it is a double fit and should take the push to 5@H|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: but this way no push :(|pg||
nt|mrdct: still - i'd rather be defending 5@H than 4@H in the long run|pg||

mb|4H|nt|marlowepi: too much of it redundant, better to have streamlined trumps and more values outside|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: the 3rd @D bid might show @D :)|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dK|nt|chip: This is a good example of why it is best to play that over 2C, 2H shows 4 and denies 3S. Then N could would have an obvious 3S bid over 3C to show honor doubleton.|pg||

pc|d2|nt|poohbear: interesting play to 6@s on a @d lead. South should win and cash the @d . Cross to the Q of @c and pitch a @h away . Then he should duck a @c entirely in case they are 5-1 . |pg||
