mb|p|nt|dougdscsu: 3nt should not be a problem|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|sT|nt|kiwibridge: greetings Liz and all|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: 4@s can also make with careful play|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|nt|poohbear: I think the boys are trying to be too delicate here|pg||
nt|wesleyc: If 1C could be any balanced hand maybe Adam was worried about clubs for 3NT|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Winners of this match join Nabil Edgtton - Paul Gosney and Michael Whibley - Justin Howard on the Australian U26 team that will play in the Junior PABF tournamnet in Hamilton, NZ, ...|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: as well as the World Juniors in the USA later in the year|pg||
nt|poohbear: Andy could have given his partner a second chance to bid 3NT by bidding 3S|pg||
pc|s9|nt|dougdscsu: Edgtton would do well to offer 4@s here..|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|nt|poohbear: Adam was worried that with his extras they might have slam since North is unlimited and I presume showed 4-5 in the blacks |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|pg||
nt|poohbear: but the king of @h rates to be worthless so the prudent bid might have been 3NT |pg||
nt|poohbear: Partner can still bid again|pg||
nt|poohbear: 5@d isnt a bad spot|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|poohbear: But thats a good lead|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s3|nt|poohbear: Declarer might have to take a fast @c finesse to make this|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|poohbear: notice the @d spots . That 5 is big|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c7|pc|c3|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|nt|poohbear: opting to play for the @h ace onside|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: Needed to take the @c finesse to make|pg||
nt|poohbear: can still make this since 3 @s cash and West doesnt have another trump to lead|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: If Harrison - Schulz fail to qualify for the U26 team, they will qualify to play the same events on Australia's U21 team (in the U21 division)|pg||

nt|poohbear: Dbl by North typically shows about 18+ and 3 spades|pg||
nt|poohbear: second dbl|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: It might work out well as 4@h is on for N/S|pg||
nt|poohbear: once Hung Dbled they were always reaching 4@h|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d6|pc|dQ|pc|d5|pg||
nt|poohbear: Edgtton has an easy raise|pg||

pc|dK|nt|cuttysark: Slightly surprised North did not get involved here|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|nt|dougdscsu: 4@h is plenty IMO|pg||

nt|frankaus: George Bilski - is a bridge pro with an insurance background - he has been aussie rep ans aussie captain many times|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: Since Hung has a weak hand he opts to show his @s and ignore @ds|pg||
mb|p|pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|dougdscsu: 4@s is on..but will they bid it?|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
