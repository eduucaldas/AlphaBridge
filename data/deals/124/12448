nt|athene: declarer knows that north opened on a 4-card heart suit, which immediately gives her a strong notrump or 4441|pg||

pc|hK|pc|hJ|pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|nt|Walddk2: Yes, because you can't rebid 2NT over 2@C/D because that would show a strong notrump|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: i would expect most people to open that 1nt if they are playing 12-14|pg||
pc|h8|pg||

pc|sA|pc|d7|pc|h4|pc|sK|pg||

mb|d|nt|athene: you can double with that if partner doesn't leave it in without some values|pg||

mb|p|nt|sheila a: The case for doubling on a wider range of hands is that you don't get bounced out the auction|pg||

nt|vugraphzdb: West checking that 1NT is still12-14 vul.  It is.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|nt|athene: against a weak notrump you really have to double on a very wide range of hands just so you don't get talked out of a lot of games (and even partscores)|pg||

mc|9|nt|Walddk2: 'cap' is taken from cricket I suspect, where a debutant gets a cap before his first match for England. Is that so, David?|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Just an excuse, I knew it was possible to undo :)|pg||
nt|dburn: well, 4@h is a decent enough spot for EW, though it has some handling charges|pg||
nt|sheila a: Easy to be wise from here, but I think N might have opened 1@c|pg||
nt|athene: EW might get to 4@H here - west can look fondly on her singleton and invoke Drury or something|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And they may get the helpful lead of @SQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A normal lead |pg||
nt|dburn: in first or second position you might open those North cards, but in third or fourth you probably should not|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Walddk2: Did East really pass?|pg||
nt|dburn: and East probably did not pass this out in fourth chair|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s7|pc|sA|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|sT|pc|s2|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|dburn: because although this spade lead has blown a trick, it has at least enabled the defenders to knock out the late entry to the diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: now there's a ruffing finesse in clubs|pg||
nt|athene: north should probably duck that|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: Always difficult when you have the ace and dummy a singleton|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe, but with @dAK as potential winners in her hand, it was harder than usual to duck the club|pg||
nt|athene: it does go to show the advantage, wherever possible, of leading suits towards the closed hand |pg||

nt|Walddk2: for the losers|pg||
nt|athene: i guess that method of scoring is so that one huge disaster doesn't "gift" your opponents unduly?|pg||

nt|dburn: South has to make a "takeout double" with 0 points and short clubs|pg||
nt|bigtrain: south's X cannot be takeout...  it is at least cards and might even be strictly penalty at partnership discretion|pg||

nt|othered1: agree and don't think it's close|pg||

mb|p|mb|3H!|nt|dburn: not silly to bid Blackwood and 7@s|pg||
nt|othered1: NOrth has quite a bit to show after starting with a generic forcing raise|pg||
nt|dburn: if partner has three low diamonds, partner has three low diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: yes,  no way south can show everything she has|pg||
nt|dburn: still, if you could find out that partner had one diamond, that would be good|pg||
nt|athene: so she has to take control, i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: although on hands like this, the ideal diamond length for partner is two, not one|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|othered1: do we know what 3@H implied?|pg||
nt|sheila a: over 5@h S could bid 6@d, asking for 3rd round control?|pg||
mb|6D|nt|Walddk2: Sensible if that is what it is|pg||
nt|othered1: looking for 3rd round controls at 6-level isn't a new idea, just not one that has been widely adopted.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: 3@H was self-alerted but not explained|pg||
nt|athene: north might be worried that south is leaving room for her to bid 6@H on @HQ |pg||
nt|athene: assuming 5NT would be asking for specific kings, north at least knows that her partner is not interested in finding any specific king :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but it's always very, very hard when it's not clear if a bid is asking or showing|pg||
nt|dburn: just as well - would be very unhappy as North not to have been able to show a potentially vital source of tricks in clubs|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: after all, whatever this auction means, South would have no clue whatsoever about North's shape|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: 3@H shows 5-5|pg||
nt|dburn: in what?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: in @s and @d|pg||
nt|dburn: that's all right then|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: so Susan has written|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In that case 6@D surely asks for help in that suit|pg||
nt|othered1: stiff @D, a suit that might develop easily, and decent trumps would influence me to go.  But I'd just be guessing at til|pg||
pc|s5|nt|othered1: at it|pg||
nt|dburn: no idea|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@h = 15+ any 5 card suit (3@S can ask)|pg||
nt|athene: i think this sort of sad ending to the auction is why the recommended "crude" blackwood and 7@S is a very good idea for south|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so she did not show diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: correction: @s and another 5-5|pg||
nt|athene: ok, *if* you have it set in stone that 6@D asks partner to bid 7@S unless she has @Dxxx, then ok, you follow this route|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|s7|pg||
nt|dburn: some do play that Blackwood and then a new suit at the six level asks for third-round control|pg||

nt|othered1: of course when they play the blue card after your lead directing double, it turns out not to be free|pg||
