mb|p|mb|3S!|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Nigel -- is this event played with screens?|pg||
nt|nigel: These complex systems are great but tough on the memory in long tournaments and can affect ones card play and defence. Natural methods would get to 4@s in no time|pg||

mc|9|nt|marlowepi: that is, when you are 65 instead of 56|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but even beyond that, a weak 2S is a much commoner hand type and a more effective preempt. you can combine this here toy with multi of course, but then you have to batch in all ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: strengths of weak 2s, so the partner of the multi bidder has to guess a lot|pg||
