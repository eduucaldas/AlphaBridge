nt|vugraphzcz: little slow table to start but the smokers are at this table|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|wiki: hello again - 8 more boards|pg||
nt|k ylinen: pas,kun on 11ap ja tasainen|pg||
nt|rodal f: A realy good quality at that @S for the bid:))))|pg||
nt|mmmakela: hi Juho, Markku, Roland, kibs!|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Welcome back! Hi Markku P, Kalle and Juho|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  And good morning to Markku M MÃ¤kelÃ¤|pg||
nt|runnerup: hi all|pg||
nt|k ylinen: hi|pg||
mb|1D!|an|12-16, 2+!d|mb|2C|nt|kaapo2:  NS play Blue Club|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: not splinter|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 1-suiter|pg||
nt|mmmakela: no|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: suction|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: i believe|pg||
nt|mmmakela: after 64 boards lots of imps have been scored|pg||
mb|2D|an|4+!d, max|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Easy play here - all suitys behave|pg||
nt|hedyg: check for 4 @ss|pg||
nt|wiki: 5 @S optimum as EW can make 5 1C or @D|pg||
nt|wiki: @C|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: hand when you know pd has @s:s but u wanna play in @h :)|pg||
nt|runnerup: now we see -now we didnt -i think south must transfer to clubs|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 3 clubs now?|pg||
nt|runnerup: ew makes 2 clubs ns 2 diamonds |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzcz: 2 aces and the correct singelton, so missed a slam on this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo2:  Holding a 4-card major, North usually would open with the major|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y. But 3@H at least is on|pg||
nt|k ylinen: N passed with 11 hcp and balanced as system requires so|pg||
nt|runnerup: now sure|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Team SaTu was up by 50 IMPs after yesterday - but the lead was cut down to 17 IMPs during the first 8 board segment today|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: i thought E would have bid 2@s|pg||
nt|mmmakela: N took a risk, S might not have dias suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: i suppose S may correct to 2N since N showed max|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kaapo2:  That's why South gets to bypass her 4-card @H suit|pg||
pc|cT|nt|hawe45:  For what reason 1 @D from North - and not 1 C???|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@c-3@H-3NT= not intterested in @Hs looking for @ss|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Hello|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Kaapo|pg||
nt|k ylinen: tough bidding|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Still 24 boards to play|pg||
nt|mmmakela: normally N has 5 dias for this bid|pg||
nt|mmmakela: yes|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kaapo2:  Good evening Raija :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last time it went 1@S  4@H  declarer was in a 0-0 fit. Sadly, it wasn't on vugraph|pg||
nt|wiki: bur probably 3 pass here|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|hedyg: because with 4 4 they open 1@D|pg||
nt|hedyg: it is systemic|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I see - but why?|pg||
nt|wiki: but - sorry about my fingers :(|pg||
nt|wiki: hello again and welcome|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: you could bid 4@c asking pd to trf to his suit, then pass the 4@h response|pg||
nt|mmmakela: didn't know promised max|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rodal f: Test the @C for the hook and 3-3. If not 3-3 u need to hit the @D, but here the @C works|pg||
pc|h6|nt|hedyg: because when the bidding goes 1@d-1@s-X he can bid 2@c without 4@hs and no @s stopper|pg||
nt|doctorone: Frankly, I would just have bid 3N as S. See where we are now. But as it is our day, we will survive in 4@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: but 3NT shows 4@ss to me|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I do hope, that the survival will be in 4 NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: i would bid 3@s without them and 3NT with them|pg||
nt|doctorone: I meant over 2NT, bidding 3NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: why give up on finding a 4 4 @s fit?|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  This is a sequence it's good to have an agreement on so that you don't get to play in a 1-0 fit|pg||
nt|runnerup: changes for +1|pg||
pc|h3|nt|peachy: this should make max 7 tricks if lucky|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Ah, Roland has 0-0|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi specs and vug operator:)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes south had dimonds but very weak opening otherwise-perhaps lucky + score anyhow|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|hawe45:  But hard to find the killing @d-lead against 4 NT...|pg||
nt|hedyg: pd will NEVER bid over 3NT ....:(|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|nt|hawe45:  Good by to a plus-score|pg||
nt|doctorone: I don't want to open a debate... I know how many positions about this issue exist, but I don't like bidding 2N with 4@s... So my problem is solved. I know, they are drawbacks of ...|pg||
nt|doctorone: course|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In fact, 4 @H can NEVER mak - if not South plays @H to the 10, he is short of entries|pg||
nt|peachy: prob six|pg||
nt|oliverc: .|pg||
nt|wiki: both pairs playing  strong club|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|oliverc: Well that sequence owed more to Culbertson than anything CC Wei might have|pg||
nt|oliverc: come up with :)|pg||
nt|wiki: now 420|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now 9 is good|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|nt|doctorone: good lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: coded 9s?|pg||
nt|doctorone: seems so, or just a falsecard, in front of N's opening?|pg||
nt|vugraphzbx: stephan thinks|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: only with @s lead this is 9 tricks|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rodal f: Re hi:)|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|oliverc: but who are we to argue with success?|pg||
nt|muppe: +1 now it seems. Defence would have done its best with trump lead or switch at trick 2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Kursat Ozsahin|pg||
nt|vbman: hi all|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c2|nt|hawe45:  Tha was killing (the) defence|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kaapo2:  I think EW play strong club with 5-card majors and 14-16 1NT|pg||
pc|s2|pg||

pc|d9|nt|rodal f: Y. W gave S a chance|pg||
nt|wiki: now N must play @C|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Good morning. This is the Finnish senior qualification to Europeans|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|hT|nt|runnerup: not the best line|pg||

nt|doctorone: he will make and win an impor two :) Thats the bridge story |pg||
nt|hedyg: they have split some pairs...Latinovs regular pd is Tom Fenwick who is at home coughing. mishaps are bound to happen|pg||
pc|sT|nt|peachy: nice of W to save outcard for E|pg||

nt|kaapo2:  Hi Vesa, good to have you here .)|pg||
nt|muppe: Hi Kari|pg||
nt|vbman: think it is going to get exiciting|pg||
nt|rodal f: If any like to use BBO-TV: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: W:s comment was that he didn't like the chances of making that contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: but considering the situation of the match, he felt he had to bid it|pg||
mb|1S!|an|12-16, 4+!s, can be canape or 44 majors|nt|peachy: game both sides here|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: good max E has here|pg||
nt|vbman: some might open with e|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  In the open room, they weren't sure if 4@H was a splinter or not, resulting in playing in 4@S|pg||
nt|rodal f: Any 1@D for major?|pg||
nt|runnerup: normal loking 4 hearts|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Strong club all around in this match. NS hear play a Precision-style system with 14-16 NT, and EW strong club with control responses, and 4-card majors|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  *here|pg||
nt|runnerup: a borderline game 3nt or better 5 diamonds -difficult both|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|an|Kx, Qxx or nat, inv+|nt|hawe45:  How can E/W get a trick against a @H-slam?|pg||
nt|oliverc: I'd certainly open the East hand. Precision tends to lose the Diamond suit a bit,|pg||
nt|oliverc: since the 1@D Opening is more of a catch-all and in classic precision can easily|pg||
nt|oliverc: have as few as 2 Diamonds|pg||
nt|wiki: shorter than in Ostende :)|pg||
nt|runnerup: canape opening in use|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  7 @C looks like only 1100|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|kaapo2:  Yes, could be a swing board|pg||
nt|muppe: 4@h will probably make, will they bid it?|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  4@C should do it|pg||
nt|vbman: i dont think its gf |pg||
nt|vbman: ah there|pg||
nt|vbman: 4 card support makes s hand a giant|pg||
nt|wiki: maybe not in red|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not u W. Was thinking abough S:)|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Well judged|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: i don't like that bid with only 3 card support|pg||
nt|k ylinen: limit Stenberg|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|doctorone: would you support @cs as E?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Or may-be 1400 because of the bad trump-split|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d looks like a waste of time|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I would pass - or bid 5 @C|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Unless EW think otherwise|pg||
nt|oliverc: Yes, the overcall will make it easier for NS to get to this slam|pg||
nt|k ylinen: I do|pg||
nt|k ylinen: 5-4 and not minimum|pg||
nt|runnerup: Väiski seems to bid that support instead of 1 spades |pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: can u play 4@s still if opener shows suit there?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: yes 1 @S response stands out|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: I suppose Makela doubted whther 4H makes because he only bid 3S|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  1@D could be short if 11-13 balanced, so EW don't really know about the huge double fit|pg||
nt|rodal f: Coffe time again:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: 3@h would be -1 if u find the @c ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: i really prefer 3@c over 2@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: i'd like to bid 1@s instead of 2 with the S hand|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Looking at EW's cards, 5@C looks to have just 3 losers|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: 5@c could be -2 but on a @h lead it would make|pg||
nt|muppe: Easy 10 tricks it seems|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Welcome to Markku Pekkinen|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 5 dias here better than 3 nt|pg||
mb|p|pc|h5|nt|hedyg: now 5@c|pg||
nt|wiki: pass was ok now when 3 NT is not quite makeable|pg||
nt|runnerup: hi all|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mmmakela: well heart lead and right guess...|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kaapo2:  Of course @D ruff takes it 2 down|pg||
nt|vbman: close your eyes and bid the slam:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: south is gonna bid it after the 2NT call|pg||
nt|rodal f: I wonder if S would have leaded @HA in 5@C. Take a look and see what would have happend if not|pg||
nt|rodal f: As 3@S is on two|pg||
nt|k ylinen: he could, because system requires 5 cards to 1S bid|pg||
nt|runnerup: perhaps south is weak for her 3 diamond can they stop|pg||
nt|runnerup: now hearts lets this home but can n lead something else |pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: now an overtrick|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hawe45:  Friendly match - E/W passing...|pg||
pc|d5|nt|muppe: Yes, but hard to bid it looking at W´s cards|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. 2@S|pg||
nt|mmmakela: what is the best line in 4 hearts?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kaapo2:  5@C that is|pg||
nt|oliverc: wd|pg||
nt|vbman: cool|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dT|nt|peachy: i liked 2S better, no defense except potential slow club|pg||
pc|d8|nt|kaapo2:  This is the third segment of 8 boards out of 10. After this segment, there will be a late lunch and the restart is then at 15:30 local time (14:30 CET)|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|d3|nt|runnerup: yes they can so -different chances but all makes i think|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphzcz: i like this line|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rodal f: Sr. Forgot the @S was 5-2|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|hedyg: now he can pull trumps and ruff out J@d if only W does not have 3 @hs|pg||
nt|runnerup: north hoped this to be forcing but -partner passed-dissopointing--4 spades on but lucky|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: ups|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d4|pc|c7|pg||
nt|wiki: Keep you high cards says N|pg||

pc|c3|pc|s9|pc|c9|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|pc|c4|nt|runnerup: yes not so clear how to play this|pg||
nt|mmmakela: shd've played Q|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h8|nt|doctorone: that explains why they scored a trick there... Declarer guarding against 3@h with W allowed a @d ruff|pg||
nt|hedyg: ofcourse|pg||
nt|rodal f: Only an exsta IMP:))|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rodal f: Non for play @H NS?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hedyg: he cannot just play top cards and then find @hs 3-1 , K@D in E and Q@s in W|pg||
nt|doctorone: lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: so a chance for cassini to gain some imps|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|oliverc: Kibber rightly points out that 4@S here was a little pointless, (since the only control|pg||
nt|oliverc: that North is likely to have is in Spades so North unlikely to respond with anything|pg||
pc|h9|nt|oliverc: other than 5@H)|pg||
nt|wiki: it is seldom right that both play the same suit |pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|hedyg: he is playing 6@Hs not 7|pg||

nt|kaapo2:  Does Juho know any Rabbis?|pg||

nt|runnerup: seems difficult to bid to best contract -2 hearts ,but now possible|pg||
nt|k ylinen: 5 imps to Cassini in first played deal|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3 lubs best but also spades makes |pg||
mb|2D|nt|vbman: lebensohl apply here?|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Or was he too strong for it :)|pg||
nt|vbman: no doubletons for 3 sp|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: you mean the obvious 8@H finesse?|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Could be. They haven't played together very regularly but usually play strong club in most of their partnerships|pg||
nt|peachy: kib confirmed Einari-risti|pg||
nt|k ylinen: tough bidding again|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Sry 4 @C...|pg||
nt|doctorone: but wait.... Dont you loose 1@d and 2@hs ?|pg||
nt|rodal f: And the conceratisme pays?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzcz: @d ruff beats 6|pg||
nt|runnerup: n thinging to 1nt or 2 d|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: blocked the 2@c bid from E|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hawe45:  Yes - T removed to 4 @C|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Both pairs here use strong club|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  NS play Einari club, a common system in Finland, especially in the Turku area. It has 4-card majors and control-showing responses to strong club|pg||
nt|mmmakela: good for NS|pg||
pc|c6|nt|peachy: Einari club, close relative of Blue Club|pg||
nt|muppe: Slam makes only IF declarer drops @dK|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: why do you ask?|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  EW use Blue Club, an old Italian system with canape style and also control responses to 1@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: does a safe line of play exist here?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hawe45:  Has North not paid his entry fee - PASS...|pg||

nt|hedyg: hi Joe :)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: but can't be bid missing 2 aces|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  No Rabbis around, so slam is destined to go down|pg||
nt|runnerup: but this is 1 down so 2 ims or so possible|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rodal f: Conservatisme|pg||
nt|k ylinen: according to their system Eeva should have opened 4 and a half D*s|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: kinda difficult to do that|pg||
nt|runnerup: control problems how to make this so that you dont loose clubs|pg||
nt|mmmakela: no safe line|pg||
pc|c7|nt|kaapo2:  So the 1@S opening is often just 4 cards|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kaapo2:  I thinks Timo is quite aggressive in bidding to the 3-level. Of course 2@S looks just fine for me|pg||
pc|c4|pg||

nt|runnerup: ns can make 4 spades ,but a pre-emp will come|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  They started with 7-8 in order to get the comparisons before the board is played|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|an|12-16, 4+!s|nt|peachy: I've heard its been cold winter there, still cold and snow?|pg||
nt|k ylinen: and later to world championships in USA!|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: pretty good hand for 14-16 opening|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes very hard in teams at least|pg||
nt|k ylinen: D now|pg||
nt|runnerup: 4 in a major ,but south can bid minors so a battle and card dont lie too well|pg||
mb|2N|an|5+!d5+!c|mb|d|nt|garnetts: I was wondering what East would bid--too  good for a 14-16 1NT |pg||
nt|garnetts: I don't like because of both the shape and hard values |pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: she could have opened 1@c (16+) but chose against it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Showing the majors vulnerable with 4-4 is not my cup of tea|pg||
nt|mmmakela: facing passed partner 2 NT seems best|pg||
mb|3D|nt|doctorone: Oh my !|pg||
nt|doctorone: How easy for W is it to bid?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ThatÂ´s a joke - show us, what West really vbid...|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|kaapo2:  It's been colder than in recent years yes. Between -20 and -30 celcius on many days here in JyvÃ¤skylÃ¤ middle-Finland|pg||
nt|garnetts: I agree with that too Roland|pg||
nt|wiki: most players do not like to open weak  with 4-6 majors and I do not like it here as @Hs are bad|pg||
nt|runnerup: east is not a chicken -he bid a lot|pg||
nt|runnerup: can south pass|pg||
nt|k ylinen: now pass?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now miracle pass needed|pg||
nt|k ylinen: I think so|pg||
nt|mmmakela: and duly bid|pg||
nt|runnerup: perhaps east should jump to 4 h|pg||
mb|p|nt|doctorone: no, no... Hans. This is true|pg||
nt|k ylinen: yes we have exceptionally lots of snow even in Helsinki|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  And close to -20 and lots of snow even in the South|pg||
nt|peachy: optimum reached at the table|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@D asking for the longer majors. Ha!|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Should Kanerva bid 4? Seems a bit hard with the wasted @DQ but he does have a singleton and a good side suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|muppe: 5 imps to SaTu in first brd, other room played 1NT+1|pg||
nt|vbman: maybe its timefor a convention|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So you bid hearts with equal length|pg||
nt|wiki: funny that you over ruff when you have 5 @C in hand - but those things happen:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|k ylinen: tough competition|pg||
nt|diaoff: Yes, good pressure by NS|pg||

nt|runnerup: yes how to show you have 5-5 ..|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vbman: 1nt l mean?|pg||
nt|garnetts: I can see the east hand is awkward for 1@C strong  --what about 1@D and you are a point too good?  |pg||
nt|wiki: @C lead helps  but is normal|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|muppe: And in the 2nd board Cassine takes 3 imps back. Other room found 5@cx -2|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: always play the @h6 at first opportunity|pg||
nt|oliverc: That's no doubt one of the reasons East chose the opening|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Well, I need to be going soon. Have fun here!|pg||
nt|oliverc: I'd be happy enough to open 1@D and reverse into the Hearts given the chance|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not only do we not like the 2@C bid but I suspect we hate the 3@H bid too|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  And partner often cannot raise when 4 is on|pg||

pc|hA|nt|muppe: This 4@s should have been doubled|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|kaapo2:  He sees hearts are bad for NS so 4@H might not make|pg||

pc|d5|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mmmakela: 3 @C was 100 % forcing  in my book and 3 @S was automatic so S must find the pass|pg||

pc|s4|pg||
nt|vbman: and a make|pg||
nt|garnetts: I wasn't actually--but I regard gadgets over 1NT as a method of balancing rather than trying to find a game so I think I would pass as North|pg||

pc|sT|pc|s5|pc|sQ|nt|hedyg: he will lose 2 more tricks|pg||

nt|kaapo2:  Ok, so West can say that "I was certain you couldn't remember it so I bid it as natural" :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: EW likely to outbid them in spades |pg||
nt|oliverc: 4@SX-2 too expensive|pg||

mb|p|nt|wiki: ok - now RD|pg||

nt|Walddk4: In the context of 12-16 2+ diamonds I don't think 2@D is enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: this hand has Kx Kx and wants to rightside NT, i agree|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Now the test for East - not @D Queen|pg||
nt|mmmakela: because strong club W will settle in 4 hearts|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: My bid would have been 2@H force for one round|pg||
nt|rodal f: RD are OK to. |pg||
nt|wiki: without D I thin 2 @S is almost enough in white but 2 @H is best for me(without D)|pg||
nt|rodal f: But RD can be taken for SOS|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so 5 from top for defence.......|pg||
pc|c6|nt|hawe45:  But the suit (@D)= is frozen anywhere|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  And since they started with boards 7-8, they've played 2 boards faster|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|nt|oliverc: no, to SaTu|pg||

nt|peachy: nice bidding|pg||
nt|diaoff: Exactly, but for me 6@D would have been a grand slam invitation in this auction|pg||

nt|kaapo2:  Moving on to the last board of the set, thanks Juho and Vesa|pg||
nt|muppe: Ty all|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Restart after a short break|pg||
nt|oliverc: Difficult to criticise EW, though. It's more likely that NS (with 23) will get too high|pg||
nt|oliverc: than that EW (with 17) will willingly bid anywhere near to game at unfavourable|pg||
nt|oliverc: vulnerability|pg||
nt|oliverc: 4@S NS here|pg||
nt|wiki: we are in Finland now, so it is nothing :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: but fair for public view @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: 3@d didn't say anything about strength|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: opener could have full 16 count|pg||
nt|rodal f: Could be Markku. Nice to see u and welcome:)|pg||
nt|k ylinen: 40 imps differense now|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: since 2N was interested in only partscore or about slam|pg||
nt|wiki: maybe opener bid 3 NT with max ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: but our E forgot system|pg||
nt|wiki: ok|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  This match consists of 80 boards divided into 10 segments of 8 boards|pg||
nt|mmmakela: think Kanerva loses nothing returning a dia against any distribution|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: What's that I hear from the green room?|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  They'll compare scores, have a cig break, and then get back to action|pg||
mb|1N|an|15-17|nt|vbman: l think its better 3sp 1st round|pg||
mb|2H!|an|!s:s|nt|hedyg: 5 bds left|pg||
nt|wiki: the most natural reason|pg||
nt|wiki: to go wrong|pg||
nt|runnerup: here 2 spades makes|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I would treat S hand as 1-suiter|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes even Timo had a change to switch to his sing d -and then it is down allways|pg||
nt|mmmakela: good pass by Kelhä in OR|pg||
mb|4H|nt|rodal f: The last board for this segment. When will the next start?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: any rabbi could make a slam here|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@H or 4@H is a good shot to keep the spades out of it --since partner has passed |pg||
nt|oliverc: 4@H?|pg||
nt|oliverc: (by North)|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Segment 8 is scheduled to start 11:10 local time (10:10 CET)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|hedyg: sorry about the mistake in the title folks, this is the last segment|pg||
nt|santyclz: Do you have to be a rabbi to play @ds?|pg||
nt|hedyg: no but to catch the K@H|pg||
nt|garnetts: I mean as an overcall of 1@D |pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: after cig break, i think|pg||
nt|runnerup: looks 3nt ofcause can overbid 15+15 so|pg||
mb|5H|nt|hedyg: why not bid 4@d here?|pg||
nt|doctorone: I would elect 4N !|pg||
nt|hedyg: pd is strong and short in @c, surely he is interested|pg||
mb|p|nt|k ylinen: 11 tricks in H here|pg||
nt|rodal f: A coffe board wich NS don't need|pg||
nt|wiki: 3 NT by S best|pg||
nt|mmmakela: here easier|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: but N can thank E for that|pg||
mb|p|nt|k ylinen: what was dbl?|pg||
mb|p|nt|wiki: not sure what 3 NT is, but looks like East should look for the minor|pg||
nt|runnerup: ofcause they can overbid-18+13 |pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: S doesn't believe in slam w his 4333|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes seems that Eeva also-2 diamonds is onesuiter in heartrs or spades|pg||
nt|mmmakela: in OR seems they didn't|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk4: 4333 and 15 would make me choose 3NT over Stayman|pg||
nt|mmmakela: absolutely|pg||
pc|s9|nt|santyclz: No xx to show a void?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@d for me shows @d stopper and 2nd rd @c control|pg||
nt|doctorone: Surely the right thing to do, Joe|pg||
nt|garnetts: K@C looks like a switch too|pg||
nt|rodal f: Are we over for match point?:)))))|pg||
nt|mmmakela: K and dias|pg||
nt|runnerup: 5 spades can be only 1 down -best defence sets it -2|pg||
pc|sK|nt|hedyg: who should XX? where? what?|pg||
nt|garnetts: likley to get the spades right too I think |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|doctorone: N|pg||
nt|hedyg: true, yes|pg||
nt|doctorone: over 4@c X P P|pg||
nt|reisig: dbl = I want to lose 800+|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: reisig is right|pg||
nt|k ylinen: yess|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: but the explanation at table was either @c:s or take-out of @c:s|pg||
nt|wiki: against me they always bid 6 NT and both finesses work|pg||
nt|wiki: just change the hands EW|pg||
nt|rodal f: Thats standard bridge Wiki:)|pg||
nt|k ylinen: wiki u r the lucky one|pg||
pc|sA|pc|h2|nt|hedyg: sry getting tired here too|pg||
pc|s7|nt|rodal f: Often used for the 2 lowest colors, but most use it for majors|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|wiki: RKCB obviously is 2 from 5 without @HQ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 30-32 between you, never mind Stayman|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Agree Roland. 1NT-3NT would look just about right|pg||
pc|hA|nt|reisig: 3N was a minor preempt ...I thk|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h7|pc|s6|pg||
nt|wiki: red  makes it difficult of course|pg||
nt|runnerup: 5 still makes from south -but they bid 6|pg||
nt|vugraphzcz: ok, this is doomed|pg||
nt|rodal f: Forget my coffe boards|pg||
nt|wiki: so 11 more to SaTu|pg||
pc|h3|nt|k ylinen: this is here again bad tactics, they are -40 Imp down, but ...|pg||
pc|hT|nt|reisig: to me ...3N is 99% forcing|pg||
nt|k ylinen: now home|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|wiki: yes it looks like it|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 8 more to go ,SaloTurku close to victory|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|hedyg: whats the hurry with @hs?|pg||
nt|miniemin: no|pg||
pc|hK|pc|s2|nt|vugraphzcz: both defenders trying to get ruffs|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|oliverc: Good set for SaTu|pg||
nt|runnerup: still 3 loosers|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|cJ|nt|wiki: so this a good Roland slam(Ihad to say this) about 17 %|pg||
nt|runnerup: 2 loosers|pg||
