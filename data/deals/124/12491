nt|Walddk2: (Nicola Smith is the one missing). Reserve pair Catherine Jagger and Sarah Teshome are also playing, but not together|pg||
nt|daman: slam time for EW|pg||
nt|mdgraham: surprising to see Goldenfield/Brunner languishing in 14th place|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|daman: should be routine |pg||
mb|2D|an|GF|nt|Walddk2: A strong jump shift would be useful here|pg||
nt|garnetts: 6@D is better than 6@H--but might be hard to bid--need to diagnose two running suits |pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|daman: Blackwood now  solves a lot of problems|pg||
nt|daman: 2 + Q|pg||
nt|dburn: perhaps, but if those two were @hA, @cA and @hQ, slam would be only a little better than a finesse|pg||
nt|garnetts: it does but 6@D is a whole lot better --|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Could be  KQxxx  and @CA    then 6@D is better if East has a side king|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think east should bid 3@D and not 2@H if they are playing five card majors |pg||
nt|daman: I suppose we could find exceptions to just about anything    my galss is always half full|pg||
nt|daman: glass*|pg||
nt|dburn: unclear - may have wanted to stress the hearts, and not silly to do that|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If 2@D is game-forcing, what is the problem with 3@D now?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nothing|pg||
nt|garnetts: None and irt obvious in my view|pg||
nt|daman: clearly it isn't obvious to Jagger|pg||
nt|mdgraham: AKQ to eight is worth bidding a few times |pg||
nt|garnetts: irt is not a typo but a Norse expression for Roland's benefit--don't know what it means though|pg||
nt|dburn: not completely obvious - she may want to use Blackwood for hearts, and 3@d would involve her in being able to use it only for diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I have never seen it|pg||
mb|4N|an| |nt|daman: tah dah|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's not in Chambers|pg||
nt|garnetts: Blackwood is fine as long as 6@D after 5@S is not a grand slam try |pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|an| |mb|p|mb|6D|nt|Walddk2: I can see 6@H also makes, but it's clearly inferior opposite   Kxxx  KQxxx  J10x  A    a hand East could have had|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think on reflection after 2@H that 4@D is better --solid suit etc|pg||
nt|dburn: irt is not in the OED either, but there is a river by that name in Cumbria|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|garnetts: Must be a Norse word then |pg||

nt|jtr: I am really concerned about him|pg||
nt|viren169: good hand now|pg||
nt|rnmalik: what a board:)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lestergold: would be more interesting if colours were reversed|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 1nt should be easy enough for NS |pg||
mb|2D|nt|lestergold: then n/s would have viable club save against the 6D slam|pg||
nt|viren169: yes... N/S are likely to be a bit shy at this vul|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: 1@C 2+ also makes diamonds a suit. Usually 5, but can be 4 with 4441 hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: support double?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks an easy 1N rebid for South |pg||
mb|3H|nt|jtr: Well, one would normally pass to show the weak NT|pg||
nt|viren169: not sure about the 2@S bis|pg||
nt|viren169: ...bid...|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6H on 3/2 break but 6D much superior except at mps|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|viren169: looks like they have decided on hearts as trumps...|pg||
nt|ady: should play 6@D|pg||
nt|rnmalik: why not 4@D instaed of 4@H|pg||
nt|viren169: RKC and 6@D as an alternative place to play|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: no mention of 2D as GF that i heard which would make 2S more sensible|pg||
nt|lestergold: now if west tries 6D it may be misinterpreted as some sort of grand slam try|pg||
nt|ady: I think 3@H was a good choice to get a suit agreed if playing rkc  then eventually play in diamonds|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but when is east gonna believe that West has 8 to the tops now!|pg||
nt|ady: could always use 6@C as a grand slam try|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but east has to know what west is doing at this level|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@H-ok, but 4@D by E that would be choice of contract and resultantly 6@D|pg||
nt|viren169: setting hearts is good to find about the Q of @H before bidding 6/7 diamonds depending on no. of keycards|pg||
mb|4N|nt|Walddk2: I am not a big fan of support doubles as it is, and I think they are even more useless after 1@D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you could, I suppose - but 1N shows what you have quite nicely|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: a balanced hand with a decent spade stop|pg||
nt|dburn: question of whether 1NT is a maximum weak no trump with spade stops or whether it shows better than a strong no trump|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, maybe it is ok with a near maximum and 1.75 stops|pg||
nt|athene: some play 1nt as the support double, in fact|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, i saw that the other day and i like it|pg||
nt|dburn: sound even worse than support doubles|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 6@D or @H makes very friendly @H distribution|pg||
nt|viren169: are they playing 2/1?|pg||
mb|6H|nt|dburn: and nothing is worse than support doubles|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: second best spot as i gfeared|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jtr: At least it is a bid that need not have another meaning|pg||
nt|rnmalik: +1|pg||
nt|viren169: 2nd best spot gets you +1 or +2 imps!|pg||
nt|lestergold: unbelievable lead|pg||
nt|viren169: strange lead|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|mdgraham: why has declarer knocked out the entry to her diamonds? |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: One could argue that 1NT should show 18-19 and that you pass with a weak NT|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|pc|hT|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|dburn: because they are trumps, perhaps|pg||
nt|jtr: Tend to double with 18/19 and bid 2NT with a good suit and 17+|pg||
nt|mdgraham: oh yes - well spotted|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|nt|lestergold: why not try a diamond at leat|pg||
mc|13|nt|viren169: would have tried a @D myself|pg||

nt|dburn: could be right just to open 4@h, to shut out spades, but could also work badly|pg||

mb|p|nt|jtr: Was 1@h 4+cards?|pg||

nt|viren169: this theme has occured several times over the past couple of days and much discussion|pg||
nt|ady: 3@D  must be some agreement for clubs|pg||

nt|Walddk2: There is nothing wrong with the contract, something slightly wrong with the breaks rather|pg||

nt|daman: over a weak NT|pg||
pc|dA|nt|garnetts: was wondering how EW could get into the action 5@d HAS PLAY |pg||
pc|d6|pc|dT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: play is about to slow down rapidly |pg||
nt|daman: oxymoron|pg||
pc|hA|pc|s8|pc|h6|pc|h5|pg||
nt|dburn: probably best to run @cJ after this, but far from obvious to do so|pg||
nt|garnetts: Agree with that--vacant spaces comes into play--not the one beteween the ears |pg||
nt|daman: the missed @H game on 3 cost NS 6 IMPs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, North just upped and bid 4@H on her own|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|nt|dburn: well, this even is cross-IMPed over the ten tables in play - game may not be bid at all of them|pg||
pc|c9|nt|daman: my Mom would have done the same thing|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This was a good move by Cook|pg||
nt|garnetts: it was --she must have been listening --but the Jack was better as she could then lead a spade!  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: However, she is now in the wrong hand to lead a spade up, so running the jack would have been better as David said. She was going to finesse anyway as we saw|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: Cook tried play from the wrong hand three tricks in a row ... much merriment|pg||
pc|cK|nt|dburn: true, but the defenders could then take two spades and two club ruffs - nothing works on this lie of cards|pg||
nt|dburn: and this (perfectly reasonable) line is likely to result in down two rather than down one|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c7|pc|c2|pg||
nt|garnetts: all true--good save against 5@D then|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk2: Time to ruff in|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Declarer would not have played like that if she had @SA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So ditching another spade is wrong|pg||
nt|garnetts: hmmmmmm--should have worked that out earlier |pg||
nt|dburn: declarer would not have bid like that either if she had @sA - then, she would have forced to game|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|garnetts: it is--maybe with the shape etc might have passed and bid later --too strong for 2@H in my view|pg||

nt|mdgraham: North's hearts are solid, though - it just takes a while to get to the point where there are solid |pg||
pc|h4|nt|daman: game was made on a @S lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: may have got a singleton club lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: a low @D would have scuppered this I think |pg||

nt|ady: better for west to ruff 2nd club and swsitch to a diamond|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: i thought ruffing clubs while they were blocked then D switch might be harder?|pg||
nt|lestergold: very favourable layout here for E/W|pg||
mb|2H|an|weak 2|nt|lestergold: 3N therefore on if they bid it|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|viren169: best for West to bid 2N|pg||
mb|2N|nt|jtr: I see the point of 1@h but you might not have a rebid|pg||
nt|dburn: well, they can get them into the auction now...|pg||
nt|dburn: ...but maybe West's double would have had more to do with the lead than with a save|pg||
nt|athene: double of 4@C might have been for a spade lead or something|pg||
nt|viren169: and raise by East to 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: meanwhile, North has a pretty good hand facing a real splinter and not the joke splinter that South actually has|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: I think double should indicate a save at these colours|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: you feel that West might have doubled 4@C, but maybe that's looking at the East hand as well |pg||
nt|athene: yes, optimal agreement might be to have x of splinter save-suggesting only at favourable, else lead for one of the other suits, but that's quite a lot to discuss|pg||
nt|jtr: Considering 4NT now maybe|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Apparently, Fawcett's splinter is not limited since Moore bid 4@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: No 1@s overcall and she has xxx@h|pg||
nt|lestergold: will now|pg||
nt|rnmalik: heard you:)|pg||
mb|p|pc|d6|nt|mdgraham: funny, this - if North had opened 1@S South could have bid 4@C as well|pg||
nt|viren169: good lead!|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: nice surprise attack|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3 @d and @h to lose|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|nt|dburn: mind you, the @s8 lead would in practice beat four, but is not very likely to be found|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|viren169: but it wont help...|pg||
nt|ady: may play south to have 3 diamonds to the ace|pg||
nt|viren169: @C return is probably best...|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mdgraham: not without looking at the hand records |pg||
nt|jtr: If East cn find the @s8 lead then North can find the 9 from dummy|pg||
nt|viren169: or the J of diamonds?|pg||
nt|lestergold: the diamond concedes the contract leave declarer to own devices may go off|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
pc|c5|nt|dburn: or the two, of course|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||

pc|s2|nt|lestergold: spade first |pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|pg||
nt|lestergold: also serves a sa discovery play|pg||
nt|lestergold: because if KS with south ace dimsm morem likely to be with North who opened weak 2 vul|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: but if defenders continued diamonds youd need s finesse anyway|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but declarer has a losing option in diamonds |pg||
nt|lestergold: so needs to know where spade is|pg||
nt|viren169: Declarer still looking for the 9th trick|pg||
nt|ady: needs to play diamond now|pg||
nt|lestergold: obviously on dim return that becomes irrelevant and spade finesse simply needed|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: agreed, though at this stage with d9 winning first trick declarer's best chance of a d trick is k onside.  could north duck sk?!|pg||

pc|s8|pc|s9|pc|sQ|pc|d3|pg||
mc|10|nt|Walddk2: End of round 14, shortish break|pg||
nt|dburn: perhaps South should have bid, after all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hm- maybe that's why you should overcall as South|pg||
nt|garnetts: I have to say that a passive lead on the auction is not usually indicated |pg||
nt|garnetts: to me a heart lead looked normal|pg||
nt|dburn: well, when you have A98x in dummy's first suit, it's not clear that you need to attack at trick one|pg||
nt|garnetts: also non space consuming overcalls must surely show better than a flat nine count and a QJ high suit |pg||
nt|dburn: still, a trump from 10x can work badly in a number of ways also|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a perfectly normal overcall in 2010|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Some require less, the Italians for instance, and they are quite good|pg||
nt|garnetts: When I lead a trump from that i always pick up Qxx |pg||
nt|daman: a small break now?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|dburn: if South had overcalled, East would probably have become declarer after a double by West, and the defence would then have been routine|pg||
nt|garnetts: Roland it might be normal --but it doesn't mean it is right or good bridge |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes it does|pg||
nt|dburn: so that set of boards will probably enable the Catherines to take one of the top three places|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What Lauria, Versace, Bocchi and others do is good enough for me|pg||
nt|garnetts: Really so South is certain a heart lead is best for the defence |pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, one hand doesn't prove anything, but certainly the modern style is to overcall if you have the slightest excuse|pg||
nt|dburn: it might be a good idea in some circumstances for North-South not to be the defence, but they can't arrange that if they sit there and pass all day|pg||
nt|garnetts: Frankly I think there are plenty of reasons not to make fatuous overcalls like 1@H |pg||
nt|garnetts: Just been told 1@H is a no brainer--I imagine they meant that described the person who bids it |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Stockdale had the nerve to overcall 1@H next door, and 4@S is going off. Naughty girl she is|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The trials are to determine the England teams for the Lady Milne in Manchester in April|pg||
nt|Walddk2: England will have two teams in Manchester because they are hosting the event. Pairs finishing 1, 2 and 3 will be selected for the England team, pairs from 4 onwards will be invited ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: to play in the EBU team|pg||
nt|garnetts: When you have a style of overcalling you also need to develope leading strategies in combination with that |pg||
nt|garnetts: I assume that if you adopt that style that partner is at greater liberty not to lead your suit --and that passive leads become more likely |pg||

pc|h2|pc|hJ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: odd, that - surely @S2 was encouraging |pg||
nt|Walddk2: should have been smaller|pg||
nt|dburn: but that @s2 was supposed to be encouraging, so this defence looks a bit odd, as well as more than a bit unsuccessful|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe it was count on the King?|pg||
nt|jtr: In which case the A would have been better|pg||
nt|viren169: more difficult without the heart bid|pg||
pc|cA|nt|dburn: maybe it was, true|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Whatever you play, you should never stop playing bridge|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The king must surely be from AK|pg||
nt|athene: in the other room it was similiar|pg||
nt|athene: except NS actually cashed three spades|pg||
nt|athene: and *then* north went back to a heart|pg||
nt|jtr: 3 only?|pg||
nt|athene: @SK collected the @S6 from south|pg||
nt|athene: then @SQ, @SA, heart|pg||
nt|jtr: What is all this K playing?|pg||
nt|athene: my guess is, in the other room, north thought that @S6 was just to encourage, from @SQ62|pg||
nt|jtr: Then play the 9 back after the Q|pg||
nt|athene: have firm agreements about when your card is count and when it's attitude, is my recommendation|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Easy, play count at the 5 and 6-level, rest attitude|pg||
nt|athene: people who say "we tell partner what we think he wants to know" just give games away every five minutes through these misunderstandings - you need explicit agreements about what ...|pg||
nt|athene: information you are giving|pg||
nt|athene: the point is, even if you work out what information partner does need to know, partner then needs to work out what you worked out he wants to know|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Or lead second through declarer, then all is clear|pg||
nt|athene: as a spec points out, in the other room south might cash the @HA before returning the third spade, if he held it, in some situations|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then you know K is from AK and A from no K|pg||
nt|jtr: I never know what my partner wants to know anyway|pg||
nt|jtr: usually it is where his glasses are and there is no signal for that|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Scores before this match are available on http://www.ebu.co.uk/results/2010January-July/LadyMilneTrials/index.htm|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Two new pairs coming to our table shortly|pg||
nt|athene: if you look at e.g. meckstroth-rodwell's card, it's really specific - things like "if we are defending notrumps and third hand can't beat dummy's queen or lower, he does this..."|pg||
nt|mdgraham: partner often wants to know when you are going to go to the bar  |pg||
nt|athene: rather than just "we give attitude or count or suit-preference depending how we feel at the time"|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pc|c9|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes overbid by east in that room but of course with no heart bid got a lucky lead|pg||

nt|viren169: This should be an interesting round... both experienced pairs |pg||
mb|1H|nt|lestergold: 4H making on successful club guess|pg||

nt|lestergold: not really light by today's standards|pg||
nt|viren169: or push E/W to a making 4@S|pg||

mb|2H|an|H+D|mb|3D|an|good raise of H|mb|4S|nt|jtr: Good 4@s|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: as cards lie may even make|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: may make with overtrick even|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: probably will as contract has bene right sided - south cant put partner on lead for d ruffs and clubs through|pg||
nt|viren169: Back to the AK leads!|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: this one pretty clear!|pg||
nt|viren169: A or K?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5H on double dummy so interesting hand|pg||
nt|viren169: or a small heart!|pg||
nt|viren169: or the 9 of hearts!|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzdb: we were all wrong!|pg||
nt|viren169: but not the 2 of @S|pg||
nt|lestergold: double heart finess club guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: sorry my alert of 2H is obviously S+D not H+D!|pg||
nt|ady: this should roll home with an overtrick|pg||
nt|viren169: I have been told the 2@S is a girlie lead by ____|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: trump leads show doubt don't they? :-)|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry 5H cant bemae double dummy because of shortage of entries for taking all the necessary finesses|pg||
nt|lestergold: however 5H a good save|pg||
nt|lestergold: spades played by west also cant make 11 ricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: could be a variety  of results thereore on this hand|pg||

nt|ady: even then might recover by playing a heart|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: no reason to do that surely?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well with 4 hearts and stiff spade, Brock cannot have been too optimisdtic about beating the spade contract|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h4|pc|s8|nt|athene: ah, not with that break in hearts :)|pg||

pc|s6|pg||
pc|d9|nt|viren169: Not sure I would open 1@H here...|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course neither side knows about the double fit which usually creates high level contracts for both sidesw|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|c2|pg||

nt|vugraphzdb: the double fits can be guessed by the high bidding - EW know they have a double fitso the others must do too|pg||
nt|viren169: both N/S thought they had good useful values to break 4@S... and hence no 5@H|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||

nt|athene: just looking at the spades and diamonds in isolation, though, you would normally prefer @SA, spade forcing an entry for the diamond finesse, because the chances of @SK singleton ...|pg||

nt|brolucius: Spades and diamonds are well held, but clubs might have been a weak link.|pg||

pc|c3|nt|jwit: Hmm|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, that's a good point. When partner might pass 1NT on a balanced 15 or 16, you could miss game with such a response.|pg||

nt|dagold: sure Jon. May would just offering alternative view for the general public...|pg||
mc|7|nt|brolucius: Entry fee was £60 a head, so you cannot afford to pass all the time. 1@H looks OK. |pg||
nt|jwit: In fact, looking at my good hand, 1C all pass is a likely scenario whenever North has extras for the opening bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: See you all in about 10 minutes|pg||
nt|dagold: Sarah Dunn has overcalled 1nt in the other room. That is not so bad...|pg||
nt|jwit: I would opt for 1H, but upgrading to 1NT not unreasonable with good texture of hand|pg||
nt|jwit: 1NT should work well if partner decides to Stayman.  Should fail if partner passes, but still better than defending 1C|pg||
nt|dagold: Better than bidding 1@h certainly|pg||
nt|brolucius: David, I have a question for you about signalling. When West leads against NT from A-K-J-x, how is the signalling meant to go when dummy has x-x-x, partner has 10-x-x-x and ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: declarer has a droppable queen?|pg||
nt|dagold: I have a solution to this|pg||
nt|dagold: A high card says play from the top please|pg||
nt|dagold: low says switch or underlead|pg||
nt|dagold: so Length plays high to encourage|pg||
nt|dagold: Qxx plays low|pg||
nt|brolucius: So, he has to guess when East has Q-x-x?|pg||
nt|dagold: not really|pg||
nt|dagold: if partner plays low and you have nothing else to play you continue low|pg||
nt|dagold: Akxxx or Akxx|pg||
nt|dagold: will do that since it sets the suit up anyway when partner doesn't have the queen|pg||
nt|brolucius: I looked at your convention card (with Townsend) the other day. Don't remember seeing it there.|pg||
nt|dagold: solves the problem of dropping declarer's short queen|pg||
nt|dagold: we have that agreement|pg||
nt|dagold: in our system file anyway|pg||
nt|dagold: we came up with it together|pg||
nt|brolucius: When lead is from A-K-J-x, you might have done better to switch. But I agree that your method looks good and you are going to have to concede ground somewhere anyhow. Thanks! |pg||
nt|dagold: well akjx is a special case|pg||
nt|dagold: if partner plays low you might switch since you cannot have 5 tricks in the suit and need a trick from elsewhere|pg||
nt|dagold: assuming the contract to be 3nt|pg||
nt|pitiful:  plauing a slow high card from 10xxx works as well|pg||
nt|brolucius: I see.|pg||
nt|pitiful:  playing|pg||
nt|dagold: I played with Bhakshi in the premiere league and he took on my agreement|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, I noted 'slow high' on Peter's convention card.|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: NS playing 5 card majors and a 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|dagold: I lead the A from AKxxx next hand|pg||
nt|dagold: dummy had Jx and he encouraged|pg||
nt|dagold: I was pleassed not to have to guess whether he had Qxx|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: EW playing 15-17, 5 card majors, 2/1 nearly GF|pg||

nt|jwit: Another dull hand in 4H|pg||
nt|dagold: ugly auction in the other room|pg||
nt|dagold: west's hand was opened 2nt|pg||
nt|dagold: ugh|pg||
nt|jwit: Hard to get to the slam|pg||
nt|pitiful:  words fail me opening 2N with unbalanced hands|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|jwit: I don't feel that strongly about it with a stiff ace|pg||
nt|brolucius: It seems that this West is also treating it as balanced.|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p!|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|brolucius: Pass alerted because it usually show a few values. You would double on a worthless hand.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|dagold: But 5 good hearts and a suit hand you really think 2nt is acceptable Jon?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now the diamond overcall may help them to reach 6@H. They will know that little is wasted in the diamond suit.,|pg||
mb|3S|nt|jwit: I really don't mind it David.  Often times if you try to show an unbalanced hand, partner will have a tough time envisioning your stiff to be an ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  a good rule which is often not observed is do not open 2N with a singleton|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|pitiful:  if you have to at least make it the King|pg||
nt|brolucius: Ace-and-king cue-bidding (an excellent method).|pg||
nt|jwit: Should get there now.|pg||
mb|4N|nt|brolucius: East's 4@S denies the ace of clubs and king of diamonds.|pg||
nt|dagold: I think opening 2nt is ridiculous. There I said it!|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Well bid!|pg||
nt|jwit: On this hand, it certainly was right not to open 2NT, but I feel there are a lot of hands where it is right|pg||
nt|dagold: it is fairly random that it makes to be fair. Would east bid differently with say 4423 or does west know the @c ten is so vital?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  yes when you have a balanced hand|pg||
nt|jwit: Anyway, this pair did very well to get to the good slam|pg||
pc|dK|nt|pitiful:  anybody surprised south did not raise @d's|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer will throw two spades from dummy on her good clubs and then ruff a spade in dummy for the 12th trick.|pg||
nt|dagold: Yes I would raise @d good point David|pg||
nt|brolucius: East-West made good use of the space that would have been denied them after a raise to 3@D. |pg||
nt|dagold: I have been opening 2@c agressively for the last few years and have seen it work very well|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||
nt|dagold: Opening these big hands at the one-level often makes it hard for partner to visualise such strength even when you try to show it later|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i like opening 2â£ with a 5+ Major but tend to open 1 of a minor with a long minor suit|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
mc|12|nt|dagold: Yes. Also the major hands are when you play in 1@h/1@s with a game on more often...|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, declarer was able to claim, once both defenders followed to the first round of trumps.|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: Early claim once the @h come in|pg||
nt|pitiful:  auctions that start 2@c followed by 3m rebid tend to be very ugly|pg||
nt|dagold: Anyway well done to EW|pg||
pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: 6H cold|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good fit, not easy to bid|pg||
nt|eggy: Near as damn it anyway|pg||
nt|lestergold: i agree but if they get there|pg||
nt|lestergold: its frigidaire|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ewj: well..|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: The boards are x imped so it will depend on how many games are bid and made of course|pg||
nt|eggy: unless hearts are 4-0 anyway|pg||
nt|lestergold: well much too good and offshape for 2N|pg||
mb|3C|nt|eggy: and how many 800s :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|eggy: or "I can't think what else to bid"?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdb: s says not quite :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ewj: Lol, what's wrong with opening 1@H|pg||
nt|ewj: You aren't balanced|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT is often a slam-killing opening|pg||
nt|lestergold: not too many points but the qwuality and shape of the hand is very powerful|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mdgraham: and this isn't a 2N opener, at all, at all|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mdgraham: not that getting there after 1@H would be easy|pg||
pc|d8|nt|eggy: Still it's worked out OK in practice|pg||
nt|eggy: Strange I agree, when you have a good hand, why open the least flexible bid unless you have too|pg||
nt|lestergold: I prefer to open 1H and take my chances and make slam tries of every kind even after a 2H raise|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|lestergold: so partner gets the message|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h9|pc|c2|pc|h5|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: maybe openiong 2C too much of a stretch|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h8|pc|h7|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|eggy: Ducking the 1st diamond would have been better as it was unlikely that N had the right holding to overtake and play a club|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|pg||
mc|12|nt|lestergold: these hands of course fall between stools and are very difficult to bid in standard methods|pg||
nt|mdgraham: don't thiink many will bid slam - likely flat|pg||
pg||
qx|o28|st||md|2SAJHAK97532D2CAJ6,S865HTDAQT754C874,S74HQJ4DJ6CKQT532,SKQT932H86DK983C9|sv|n|nt|pitiful:  yes, good decision by west|pg||
nt|pitiful:  to open 2@c|pg||
nt|dagold: tricky slam here|pg||
mb|2D|nt|brolucius: Another bidding test, where Brown and Stockdale will be in control of their own destiny. |pg||
nt|jwit: I'm not a big proponent on opening 2C on two suiters, especially with more distribution.  Auction is likely to get out of control before you've begun to describe your hand.  Could ...|pg||
nt|jwit: go something like 2C 2S P 4S back to you and you haven't shown either of your suits yet|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i like 3@d at these colours|pg||
nt|dagold: me too Peter|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: we seem to agree alot|pg||
mb|5D|nt|brolucius: Yes, 3@D. Excellent! Even if you play weak 2@D.|pg||
nt|dagold: who should be more worried?|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|pitiful:  well I opened 3@h in camrose recently on 6-4 hand to my cost|pg||
nt|brolucius: A big gamble for North to raise.|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Goodness me. Well done!|pg||
nt|dagold: North knows she has good cards. Can't bid 6 though imo|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  went for 300 against nothing|pg||
nt|jwit: Wow!  Very impressive|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: She has found South's minors the right way round.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|pitiful:  i believe in not punishing partner, I am often extreme in that view and would never consider raising|pg||
nt|dagold: she did well but in reality I think you have to give partner some leeway|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d9|pc|d2|pg||
nt|jwit: If you think about it, partner bid vulnerable at the 5 level missing the QJ of trumps, and has at most a singleton diamond.|pg||
nt|dburn: I think East might have bid 6@s, though - that would not be too expensive|pg||
nt|pitiful:  very well done by north|pg||
nt|dagold: Partner doesn't have to have 3+ Aces though and opps can have only 9 diamonds at these colours|pg||
nt|dburn: and East can be fairly sure that the opponents will have a lot of tricks in hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|jwit: So pretty good likelyhood partner has AK A A|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well, it was great to find the raise at the table - particularly after the disappointment of the previous board.|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i would bid 5@h with a lot worse hands than south|pg||
nt|pitiful:  swap Ace for small @s |pg||
pc|s8|nt|jwit: I think opponents are much more likely to have 10 or 11 diamonds even at these colors, after all, they can't have very many high cards|pg||
mc|12|nt|dagold: Depends if your partner always bids with contract in their hand or sometimes hopes you have something (I am from the latter camp)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Sometimes very risky gambles pay off in a big way. (Such as when my wife agreed to marry me 35 years ago...)|pg||
nt|pitiful:  would you pass 5@d jon with my example hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: E wondering if 4@d might have been better and not pushed them to slam|pg||
pg||
qx|c28|st||md|2SAJHAK97532D2CAJ6,S865HTDAQT754C874,S74HQJ4DJ6CKQT532,SKQT932H86DK983C9|sv|n|nt|eggy: But unless S held KQ tight, I'm not sure how that line could be right|pg||
nt|lestergold: i agree Mike very hard|pg||
nt|eggy: a few more may on this hand thoug|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well slam should be bid here|pg||
nt|lestergold: but e/w have great save |pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: Although a diamond pre-empt may not give NS enough room|pg||
mb|2S|nt|eggy: or a spade one?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well we have the kind of deal weve been waiting for|pg||
mb|4H|mb|4S|nt|lestergold: now...North must of course bid 5H|pg||
nt|lestergold: partner has bid 4H on her own at uinfave|pg||
nt|eggy: I expect that Sally would have passed 4H, but now she will definitely bid|pg||
mb|5H|nt|eggy: I can't say that I like the 2@H bid a bit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|eggy: Sorry Catherine|pg||
nt|lestergold: the question then is will Seale give herself 6now |pg||
nt|lestergold: she will think no spade losers|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lestergold: which is true in a way|pg||
nt|eggy: She might have if Jagger had bid 5C though|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@h doesn't look right - too strong - but it is facing a passed hand|pg||
mc|13|nt|eggy: This looks a bit out of control|pg||
nt|lestergold: Jagger should certain ly bid 5C if they have a good understanding that this is heart support with clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: which ity should be actually|pg||
pg||
qx|o29|st||md|3SQ8753H865D2CT952,S92H73DAT743C8764,SKJTHAQJ9DQ86CAJ3,SA64HKT42DKJ95CKQ|sv|b|nt|brolucius: Many thanks to Guy for that tit-bit from the tableside. An interesting observation from East.|pg||
nt|jwit: I think I would probably pass 5H with your example hand Peter, though certainly couldn't fault 5H a lot.|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|brolucius: South would bid 4@H over 4@D and North would be nowhere near a raise of that.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|dburn: well, if partner has a small spade instead of the ace you may go down in five, so you might as well bid six and hope partner can ruff the diamond lead|pg||
mb|2N!|an|18/19 balanced|mb|p|nt|dagold: That is a very good point|pg||
mb|3H!|an|transfer|mb|p|nt|pitiful:  so are you a raiser to 6 david (burn)|pg||
nt|brolucius: I don't like bidding so high on a moderate 18-point hand.|pg||
mb|3S!|mb|p|nt|jwit: I agree with that David|pg||
nt|dburn: I would not raise you to six, Peter, but anyone else...|pg||
nt|dagold: This is an italian idea, 2@d 18-19 balanced|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: In fact I don't really like it on 19 points, which is easily handled after a one-opening in a suit.|pg||
nt|dagold: works well for the rest of the system taking that awkward hand out of the other opening bids|pg||
nt|dagold: I have always thought it would fit well into acol so that there is no longer a wide range 15-19 when you are balanced|pg||
nt|brolucius: How much does a 2NT jump rebid show in that case? I suppose it must be conventional.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|dagold: Apparantly the idea comes from Mexico not italt|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - quite a useful way to play, but it does mean that you occasionally get too high with 18 or so facing nothing|pg||
nt|dagold: my appologies Hombres|pg||
pc|c2|nt|dburn: was part of Romex originally|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s4|nt|jwit: Interesting hand here.  Declarer must win the club and play a diamond to sever the defensive communication.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|pitiful:  i am not a fan of 2@d on 18-19 balanced but using 2N to raise partner's 1 level major suit response works well|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|pitiful:  i thought 2@d was 20-22 in Romex|pg||

nt|lestergold: a better action misse a chance|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1N|nt|gambit: S is strong enough to start with double, tough for N to move |pg||

pc|sA|pc|sT|pc|d5|mc|12|nt|brolucius: Obvious if you could make a cue-bid below 2@S. A cue-bid to show a sound raise to 3@S (on only three trumps) seems too much to me. Partner has only bid 1@S NV.|pg||

nt|brolucius: Still, the singleton heart and the good clubs... yes, I suppose it is pretty good.|pg||
nt|dagold: anyway East needed half of that hand to make 4@s so should have moved|pg||
mb|1H|nt|brolucius: True. An instructive deal.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jwit: Surely if 3S is too high, the opponents are making at least 3H, unless partner has a ton of heart wasteage, which doesn't seem likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: yes|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|jwit: West didn't really open 1H on this one?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|pitiful:  1@h is not my cup of tea, 4 card Majors on weak hands (below strong NT) has a lot of merit but then unlike Roland I am not an Acol fan|pg||
nt|dagold: 5@c decent on the bidding|pg||
nt|dagold: I despise acol |pg||
nt|brolucius: It seems you have not been reading Sandra Landy's Acol column in English bridge, Peter.|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: http://www.ebu.co.uk/results/2010January-July/LadyMilneTrials/index.htm    current position|pg||
nt|dagold: don't mind 12-14 notrump but don't like it with 4cM|pg||
mb|p|nt|jwit: If you open 1H on that hand, I must agree with your estimation of ACOL|pg||
nt|dagold: was an acceptably terrible system 50 years ago when noone else could bid|pg||
nt|dagold: but things have changed|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jwit: Well done for NS|pg||
nt|pitiful:  south showed good appreciation of her hand|pg||
nt|brolucius: Opening 1@S is just as bad, on A-J-x-x, because partner is more likely to assume that you have five spades. Better to open 1@C on such hands.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|dagold: Good judgement by Gillian, diamond shortage with partner is likely (no @h raise)|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: Dummy: "Is that enough?"|pg||
nt|jwit: Over a strong NT by West, would have been extremely difficult to get to 5C|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||
nt|dagold: and the contract would ironically be even better!|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|nt|pitiful:  well 2@s showing @s and minor might give you an outside chance|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||
nt|dagold: Brock and Gross got close after 2@s over 1nt showing @s plus minor|pg||
nt|dagold: but stopped in 4@c after looking for game|pg||
nt|pitiful:  if you play asptro or such then you have my sympathy|pg||
nt|brolucius: I think they did well to reach 5@C after a 1@H opening!|pg||
nt|jwit: Yes, spades and a minor would get you close, but south would have to blast.  North would not accept any invitations with only four clubs|pg||

pc|dK|pc|dQ|pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||

mc|11|nt|pitiful:  you could sort of imagine south bidding 2N over 2@s as strong relay, then if north shows minimum south can invite and maybe...|pg||
nt|brolucius: An excellent board for the leaders.|pg||

mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|eggy: about as similar as a razor's width then|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|pitiful:  3@d by north?|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@D about right on the North cards.|pg||

mb|3D|mb|3H|nt|brolucius: Pointless to show the hearts because you will be outbid.|pg||
nt|pitiful:  well done|pg||
nt|dagold: South could bid 5@d here|pg||
nt|dagold: advance save and take some space|pg||
nt|dagold: could bid 3@s but it is optmistic to think it might be your hand...|pg||
nt|brolucius: South cannot believe spade shortage opposite, on this bidding.|pg||
mb|4D|mb|5C|nt|pitiful:  5@c was a big bid|pg||
nt|dagold: 5@d is so much better than 4@d|pg||
nt|jwit: It was indeed!|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: removing many many more options from west|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dagold: like 4@h/@s/5@c|pg||
mb|6D|nt|dburn: may have to believe spade shortage opposite now, though|pg||
nt|jwit: South will have to find the ace of spades to defeat this contract|pg||
nt|dagold: And she perhaps should. East likely void diamond|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: West visibly shocked by seeing 6@C come under the screen|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|pitiful:  i am not a fan of 6@d|pg||
nt|jwit: East will pass, and West has an easy double|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|dagold: 6@d does seem a bit presumtious|pg||
nt|dagold: very hard area of bidding though|pg||
pc|h2|nt|dagold: when to save or not in situations like this|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|brolucius: An area where result merchants flourish.|pg||
nt|jwit: AK of clubs and another heart will defeat it 3|pg||
nt|dagold: West, much happier defending 6@d x I think|pg||
nt|pitiful:  some people like negative slam doubles|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i am not a fan|pg||
nt|dburn: question of whether the defence can get everything, including West's @d10|pg||
nt|dagold: So here South passes to show one trick?|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|cT|pc|c2|pg||
nt|jwit: defeat it 4 I mean|pg||
nt|dagold: and north can hope it is the spade Ace?|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|pc|c7|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|brolucius: King asked for (reverse-) count signal.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jwit: Well done|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|brolucius: West's second card should be some sort of suit preference signal. Seemingly reverse, once again.|pg||

nt|eggy: Not such a wonderful slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: slams can be bid made or defeated accordingly|pg||
nt|lestergold: certainly not good ones eggers|pg||
nt|lestergold: but with massive two suiter as east and west showing up with good spade suit anything possible|pg||
mb|2D|an| |nt|mdgraham: scores updated - gap between 6th and 7th is 30 imps|pg||

nt|lestergold: i dont like it in front of pard at equal vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: but its forced east to start bidding her cards at a high level|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: 2d = very weak major|pg||

mb|d|nt|lestergold: where will this mad hatters auction end up folks?|pg||
nt|eggy: The dreaded leaping Michaels of course which got a mass of stick from commentators in the European in Malmo about 8 years ago|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|eggy: What most annoyed them was that it almost never got a bad result|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: well 5D doubled is a massive save here for n/s|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: not so much against games but against possible slams making|pg||
pc|c3|nt|eggy: and a remarkable auction to bid it too|pg||

nt|eggy: Suzanna must have "iinferred" that N held Spades|pg||

mb|2D|nt|jwit: That is one ugly 2D bid, but at least the vulnerability is right|pg||
nt|brolucius: N/S were in the lead, remember, so they probably cannot afford another awful one like that. They had 26 IMPs to play with, but the 4th-ranked pair may be collecting IMPs at their ...|pg||

nt|dagold: I am sick though|pg||
nt|jwit: You should be lol|pg||
nt|dburn: well, they have a couple of good results also - match probably about level now|pg||
nt|brolucius: Surely no-one would think of passing?|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|pitiful:  first at green encourages you to be sick...|pg||
nt|jwit: I would pass.  I would be more likely to try 2D without 4 hearts.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|dburn: in fact, compared with the one other table we can see, the match is exactly level|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dagold: I don't like 3@h. Not on strength, because it may lose @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: I would double|pg||
pc|dT|nt|jwit: I like double|pg||
nt|dburn: still, this is a game with good chances, while 4@h would probably have gone down|pg||
nt|dagold: double-3@c-3@h-3nt|pg||
nt|dagold: seems fine|pg||
nt|jwit: Yes, double is likely to get you to 3NT as well|pg||
nt|dburn: not so clear - North did quite well to bid 3NT with that rather thin diamond stop, as opposed to 4@h|pg||
nt|dagold: all other vuls are disiplined|pg||
nt|dburn: luckily, partner came through with plenty of help in diamonds|pg||
nt|jwit: Yes, 4H is certainly a possible bid for North|pg||
nt|jwit: Although that hand looks a lot better with a diamond lead coming up to it as opposed to through it|pg||

pc|d3|nt|lestergold: might be hard to prvent declarer scrambling 6 tricks here|pg||
nt|eggy: and here, probably the same on a tight defence|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|2D|mb|3D!|nt|jwit: Good save for NS here, though they might be a little gun shy after their previous 6D fiasco|pg||
mb|4D|nt|dagold: Might splinter with the east hand|pg||
nt|brolucius: North might have bid 3@D instead of 2@D.|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: Let partner know about the diamond shortage|pg||
nt|dagold: would be slightly worried about the side suits but the void @d rather than singleton makes up for it|pg||
mb|5D|mb|5H|nt|jwit: yes, I like 4D better than 3d|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: 5@h is a pretty big bid, but it will work out well|pg||
nt|brolucius: No way North should bid again, after setting them a problem.|pg||
mb|6D|mb|d|mb|p|nt|pitiful:  i would have bid 5@d as south|pg||
mb|p|nt|jwit: That's a very surprising bid, but it was right as 5H makes, and 6D is down 3|pg||
nt|dburn: better stay off @cQ lead now|pg||
mb|p|pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|dburn: well done|pg||

nt|lestergold: not that it should be bid of course but its been known|pg||
nt|eggy: NS have saved in 6Dx which looks like absolute par|pg||
mb|1H|mb|3D|mb|4D|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|lestergold: well diamond save seems pretty marked|pg||
nt|mdgraham: east likely to bid 5@h with the @D void|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: allowing this at five level will be expensive for e/w|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: Not now though|pg||
nt|lestergold: and she has of course not allowed it|pg||
nt|lestergold: hard to reach par tho at imps on this kind iof hand- you may be beating 5 you may push them into 6 making so its a dangerous game|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 6@Dx should be 500|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: and 6h MAKES ON DIM LEAD AS I SAID EARLIER|pg||
nt|eggy: In the Open, North made a simple overcall and then kept saving|pg||
nt|lestergold: sory caps lock by error|pg||
nt|lestergold: not intended|pg||
nt|eggy: and goes down 2 on a club|pg||
nt|lestergold: but u have to find lead|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||

mb|p|nt|brolucius: The scores are cross-IMPed over all the tables and then averaged.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|jwit: Should be a tame 4H|pg||

nt|brolucius: A bit of a tame ending, as Jon said. But the boards have been entertaining (apart from that awful first set).|pg||
nt|jwit: Although both make game, 4H far superior to 4S.  Overtrick in jeopardy in 4S with three rounds of clubs on the go|pg||
