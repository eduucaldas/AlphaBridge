nt|mrdct: my son and I had an interesting "5-level belongs to the opponents" auction a couple of months ago when he felt compeled to bid 6H rather than 5H because I'd told him to avoid ...|pg||
nt|mrdct: competing to 5 - it duly made on a misdefence|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|itinerant: lol|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4 or 6, 5 or 7   those are fun hands|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: 5 or 6 is totally new concept :)|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: anybody for 2@S rebid instead of 2@H??   [other than ME]|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Milne has picked up 3 1's and a 7 to lead by 74 now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes Al agree 2@S|pg||
nt|mrdct: it is a nice looking suit|pg||
nt|itinerant: the average age of the milne team is around 20yrs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or at least 3@S instead of 3@D?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|itinerant: 21, i'm informed|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Whibley must be the "old Man" then :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|itinerant: alex smirnov, the german international is 27, dragging the average up somewhat|pg||
nt|bigtrain: maybe|pg||

nt|mrdct: ware isn't going to be able to get a ruff here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does anyone know if 2@D was Game Force or did we have to wait for 3@C?|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: i dont think 2@D was a GF in their system i think they are just playing Standard but not sure...|pg||
pc|dT|nt|itinerant: on a club lead to the QKA, declarer must play to keep north off lead lest he shoot the @c9 through. on the heart lead, he can play for overs|pg||
