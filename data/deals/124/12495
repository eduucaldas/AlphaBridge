nt|petergill: doubles. Hence the auction|pg||
nt|sybarra: still not disaster   |pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 2@C Game force|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: @S hook for the contract|pg||
pc|h8|nt|henryb:  true, but surely when partner raises and the opponents are probably in a 4-3 you should lead your suit|pg||
nt|petergill: I guess so|pg||
nt|henryb:  you know it is a 4-3 because East would have bid 2@s the first time with 4|pg||
nt|henryb:  and West would have bid 1@s with 5|pg||

nt|petergill: today.|pg||
nt|henryb:  so if East has a doubleton heart and three spades, what is his minor suit shape that he did not bid 3@c or 3@d|pg||
nt|henryb:  over the second double?|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s5|pc|sT|nt|petergill: West was known to have 4 spades and less than 4 @D's, East known to have 3 @S's and 4 or 5 @D's, hence East with longer non-@H holdings more likely to have shorter hearts - perhaps ...|pg||
nt|petergill: that was South's logic? |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|itinerant: 4C from north or a simple 4S?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: tempting to bid 3NT witht eh South cards - when does A pre-empt ever look like AKQ these days?|pg||
nt|itinerant: and if you're opps are playing the Gambling 3NT, the odds are even better|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: do you think we could get votes for balancing 3N?|pg||

nt|itinerant: So, the club lead will be ruffed and 2 clubs later in the hand for west, but that's it for the defence|pg||

mb|2D|an|relay|nt|itinerant: the double just moves them all "down" a bit|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|an|heart shortage|mb|p|mb|2S|an| |nt|itinerant: yup, more space|pg||
nt|tejjyid: sometimes with less experienced pairs they can miscount with all the extra room, but not here |pg||

nt|woozle: You would want some kind of agreement that this double won't be made with extreme shortness|pg||

nt|woozle: Hung might be happy to double 1S for penalty - partner is still there if he's very short - but passing 1SX when partner has 0-1 is very final|pg||
nt|tejjyid: eg. 1st X is balanced values|pg||

nt|gavin:  my feelings change strongly if edgtton was vulnerable.  The problem with opening 4 card majors when you are vul in 3rd chair is often you end up playing a 4-3 fit in 2, or even 3 when the opponents overcall and your partner  has a limit raise|pg||

mb|4N|nt|ahollan1: non-serious looks right to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: it is sort of like a transfer -- if we go down it is YOUR fault, not mine|pg||

nt|jcwla: Last one - thanks to Roland, Nick, Raija, our operator, all specs.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the colours seema deterrent but that is superficial -- the risk of passing is that opps could blast you out of a making vul game. would you rather initiate an inquiry at the one ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: level, or at the 5 level when both opps have bid and pd has been quiet?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a very welcome 11 to the youth|pg||

mb|d|nt|peachy: Good job by our operator <clap> >clap>|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Milne's lead could escalate in the next 5 minutes, with the 4@S about to be bid at the other table I expect|pg||
nt|petergill: on Bd 29|pg||
nt|petergill: Same bidding as other table so far|pg||
nt|gavin:  i think id just bid 3@H with norths hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|gavin:  they were on the same wavelength, 4NT pick a minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin:  East didnt want to commit to clubs or diamonds but rather offer his partner a choice|pg||
nt|peachy: a hard one Roland!|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kiwibridge: set to resume in 30, the OR will have to speed up|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2S seems a lot to bid at unfavourable with 11 losers (10 adjusted)|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Nothing|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|gavin:  to give up the contract by playing a spade is very weak|pg||
nt|gavin:  tired rather|pg||
nt|petergill: 4NT = let's get too high, I'm just a tenager, even if I'm heading towards the Grand Final of my country's National Open Teams for the first time|pg||
nt|gavin:  that person is tired at the end of the set|pg||

mc|9|nt|gavin:  ya so he discouraged then on the ace of hearts the 2nd card was suit preference ?|pg||
nt|gavin:  he could have played some card other than the 3 if he had the ace of spades|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes|pg||
nt|petergill: and his partner ignored him|pg||
nt|gavin:  payed the price|pg||
nt|gavin:  paid|pg||
nt|petergill: Bagchi played the previous set in a team of five with a different parner. I'ts quite hard when you switch from one partner to another to maintain concentration for a full 16 boards ...|pg||
nt|petergill: in a team of five|pg||
nt|gavin:  and this is a very long event and they had just had a number of bad boards leading up to that point|pg||
nt|gavin:  he played so fast it was not that he thought it through and made the wrong play|pg||
nt|gavin:  but thats when its most important to keep your focus|pg||
nt|petergill: Team Bilal have every chance in the next 32 boards that Bagchi, now that he has 48 boards in his regular partnership with Seamus, will regain composure for the next set. They need ...|pg||
nt|petergill: him to. |pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Thanks all for joining us the next set will start at 3pm |pg||
