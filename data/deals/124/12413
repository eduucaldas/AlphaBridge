nt|frankaus: George Bilski - is a bridge pro with an insurance background - he has been aussie rep ans aussie captain many times|pg||

nt|frankaus: NS play a modified wercsion of Polish Club|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|poohbear: I agree since the auction gets awkward when you respond 1D playing Walsh style|pg||
nt|poohbear: Hung knows that partner has 4 trumps so he gambles|pg||

nt|frankaus: S!K up may have prevented the @C swich|pg||
pc|d4|mc|9|nt|poohbear: and from K10xx  he would never play the 10 |pg||
