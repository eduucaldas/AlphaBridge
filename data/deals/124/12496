mb|1D|mb|p|nt|janm: We should now have comparisons from the other room, unless this table plays faster than expected|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|janm: N had to decide between raising spades on 9xx or rebidding 1NT with a suit-y hand - opted for describing his hand with 1NT|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|poohbear: Dbl by East in the other room at this stage is highly aggressive|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|janm: The DBL of 1NT certainly was aggressive, but down 30 the Milne team probably want to create a little action without being silly|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: West tried bidding 2@H just now :)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|poohbear: I dont blame him!|pg||
nt|janm: And I'm not sure I wouldn't have preferred to DBL 1NT than 2@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|poohbear: I agree with that Jan|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: Edgtton should spec a dbl here|pg||
pc|dK|nt|poohbear: lost opportunity|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
nt|poohbear: with best defense 3@hs goes for 800 down 4|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|poohbear: in this case only down 3 now|pg||
nt|janm: You're right, that would have been a good decision by Edgtton - pretty unlikely that 3@h would make, although the actual -4 is surprising - cards very well-placed for NS|pg||
pc|s4|pg||

nt|petergill: Welcome back|pg||
nt|petergill: the hands are from the previous 16 boards|pg||
nt|sporteye: Hi Peter, Hi Henry|pg||
nt|petergill: so the table will have to be shut down and re-started, I guess|pg||
nt|petergill: This hand was in the first 16 boards|pg||
nt|petergill: West played in 1NT on a spade lead about 2 hours ago|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Ed, welcome everyone to a set of Crunch|pg||
nt|itinerant: McManus-Ware are playing a system named CRUNCH|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@S=9-18 HCP, 4+@S, unbal, maybe longer @C/@D, maybe 4@H|pg||
nt|itinerant: 1S in third seat = 9-18pts, 4+ spades|pg||

nt|pamela: hi Gary |pg||
nt|itinerant: ah, has everyone got that?|pg||
nt|pamela: and SHirley|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jcwla: The pace in the CR is glacial.  They are now starting 18.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: describe the other holdings on the next round:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Pamela welcome|pg||
nt|pamela: are we in for a bumpy ride  :-) |pg||
nt|itinerant: 2H = 3-6pts, 3+ spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: do you adjust in canape to play penalty X's?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hold on should be fun, great youth players vs experienced pros|pg||
mb|d|nt|pamela: when did Michael Ware move to Aussie|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: welcome Ed and Al hoping for big things from EW this set|pg||

nt|itinerant: 3 kiwis by birth at this table|pg||
nt|itinerant: Brightling has been in Oz an awfully long time|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: probably before EW born :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: howdy all|pg||
mb|p|nt|itinerant: Hard to find a club lead from west against a spade contract|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|itinerant: he's still living in NZ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe not, need to attack|pg||
nt|itinerant: If declarer can see through the backs of the cards, he can make 10 tricks|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: pard has bid them|pg||
nt|marlowepi: red suits too slow|pg||
nt|itinerant: Hi Marshall|pg||
pc|cK|nt|marlowepi: plus you would have to guess which red suit to lead|pg||

pc|c9|nt|itinerant: well, hello @cK|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kiwibridge: wow|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2S showed both majors or both minors. there are some advantages to such bids but several downsides too|pg||
nt|itinerant: hard to control the trump situation in this contract|pg||
nt|itinerant: it would seem the defence needs to attack diamonds sooner rather than later|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: he lived in Hong Kong for a few years, his wife Mary-Ellen qualified to play for HK ladies|pg||
nt|sybarra: the taps in the @D may kill this (if they can find it fast enough)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|peachy: I am not sure what sys EW have, yesterday I thought it was Polish club, anyone?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|peachy: this should make in comfort|pg||

pc|c5|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: sorry aout that, had to leave the table momentarily|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i have WBF Convention Cards for both pairs -- NS from 2009 Bermuda Bowl, EW from 2009 U26 PABF|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|pamela: matt will play 9 S |pg||
pc|cT|nt|marlowepi: one of the latter is that when you have this gizmo in your toybox you want to use it whenever possible so you brandish it when 65 in the minors and run substantial risk of playing ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in the wrong suit, sometimes doubled. the lower of the two suits should be at least as long as the higher suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even without the double it would (or should) be a strong candidate for opening lead|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c7|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we have a 31 deficit with 32 to play|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: "we"?   both teams have current or expat Kiwis|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|d7|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we the viewers|pg||
pc|h4|nt|marlowepi: that is, when you are 65 instead of 56|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but even beyond that, a weak 2S is a much commoner hand type and a more effective preempt. you can combine this here toy with multi of course, but then you have to batch in all ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: strengths of weak 2s, so the partner of the multi bidder has to guess a lot|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: everyone is just taking a 5 min break|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: poor you what do you do between sessions Al :)|pg||
nt|itinerant: though we feel your pain, al, we respectfully note that these are 1st world concerns :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hunger should be the world's first concern|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it is for me|pg||
nt|itinerant: not sure that the UN should do a drop at al's place though|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i just realized -- last set was blurry not because of fatigue -- wearing wrong glasses|pg||
nt|marlowepi: somebody bid to game quick or specs will throw tomatoes at us|pg||
nt|itinerant: He's definitely suffering malnutrition and decaffeination... 911|pg||

pc|s3|nt|janm: bids that you can not open a perfectly good one because it has flaws - here he kept his partner from bidding too many clubs and will pick up some IMPs|pg||

mb|1N|nt|kiwibridge: and usually by youth|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at these colors anyway|pg||
mb|5C|nt|marlowepi: one wonders how many results of that sort -- 500 away against no game, not a rare outcome -- it takes to quell the players' ardor for those methods|pg||
nt|marlowepi: to be fair, they can bring in the odd bushel too|pg||
nt|itinerant: apparently Meckwell vow to open all balanced 11 counts - Nabil is keen too|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you're having trouble counting Milne @C length --- try  counting the other suits, then subtract from 13|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Good evening to Thomas Gotard|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he must make up for his much older partner who must be slowing down now that he's all of 27|pg||
nt|pamela: yes  seen better 11's |pg||
nt|marlowepi: LTC is right, versatile in playability, you can open a suit you want led, some preemptive value, some defence....what is not to like?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|cindy:  looks like strong to me too|pg||

pc|hT|nt|poohbear: problem with this method is that you cant stop in 2@s anymore|pg||
nt|sybarra: pleasant that spades are 3/3 |pg||
nt|poohbear: when you bid 2nt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some use 2@D/2N to say  not 4 other major, not 3 your major, min vs max|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|jcwla: Good contract.|pg||
nt|poohbear: would be a better method if 2@c was GF|pg||

nt|ahollan1: right  2@D as min fits in with Barry's opportunity to stop in 2@S|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS  4th best leads, reverse count & attitude, odd/even 1st discard|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there is a good case for bidding only 4C. partner will usually save at these colors when it is right to do so, and can let them play 4M when that is right (if they bid it)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is true that he wont know you have the ace of clubs, but you rate to statistiucally and anyway he would not necessarily be counting on that card defensively even if he did know ...|pg||

mb|2D|nt|itinerant: Kiwis might be having a tough time choosing their favourite today. Mike Ware, on the Delivera team, and both Liam Milne and Michael Whibley on the Milne team are kiwis|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: 13 ugly imps to De Livera on 2 not the start the youth wanted :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: many would disapprove of 2N, preferring 2-suited overcalls to be very strong or else weakish with a high Offense to defense ratio. but 2N protects the spade queen if you defend|pg||
mb|d|nt|marlowepi: 2D multi, 2N forcing|pg||
nt|tomi2: i wonder if they have special agreements on their methods to find major fits. in 6@D at least they avoided spades, so they knew about their spades quality and that its only 3 in S. ...|pg||
nt|tomi2:  this looks strange then, s squeezed himself with 1@H|pg||
nt|tez: basics are crutial|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|tejjyid: more technical issues?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think it was one of Reese's least favorite conventions -- unless used by his opponents|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: gt but Neill unable to convert|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N works OK here, but 4H could easily be the better spot. N does not have to come up with 55% of his stuff in the black suits|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in this case though, the 1@H opener has absolutely placed @DA in North|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: another that won't take long|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: and then pass 1nt. you are sure to have an 8 card fit and are 5-5|pg||
nt|tez: but to late now..hard to find 5/3 fit|pg||
nt|tomi2: e-w are no regular partnership. they might have some problems in signaling|pg||

nt|janm: give W an extra trick in one of the black suits. But once the diamond has been cashed, W has to abandon one of his potential black suit winners|pg||

nt|janm: E doesn't have any idea that his partner has 5 spades of course, so it may look to him as if a second spade is safe and there isn't a big rush|pg||
nt|poohbear: either take a first round @c finesse against the J or drop the Ax of clubs after the first @c play|pg||
nt|janm: What can he do if they shift to a @d? He can knock out the club A, cash the AK of hearts and pitch one diamond as W ruffs, but that still leaves him with a diamond loser, doesn't ...|pg||

nt|ahollan1: will MW mix it up with 3@C?|pg||

mb|4S|nt|kiwibridge: weak stayman followed by 2@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5 card support but look at the rest of Milne's drek -- and worst distribution|pg||
nt|marlowepi: spades are likely to block and if they do you dont have to guess where club ace is|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy:  big surprise|pg||
nt|bucheister: I believe that both pairs are playing pretty much standard 2/1|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: If 3@Hs at N a pass to serve for a possible X? Or?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: the auction is correct|pg||

nt|janm: direct 2NT over 2@d would have been 25+|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H was Kokish Relay, either big bal or long hearts. 2@S was Relay and 2NT big bal. |pg||

mc|11|nt|janm: Amazing - I thought 15 & 16 had very little room for action!|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|nt|petergill: another chance to narrow the margin|pg||
mb|3S|nt|poohbear: I like 3@s by south. Makes bids by West have a much wider range|pg||
nt|janm: Keep EW out of game?|pg||
nt|poohbear: or get too high|pg||
nt|janm: True, 5@c exactly is a narrow target|pg||
mb|d|nt|petergill: Trying to reach 3NT, and planning to convert 4@H to 5@C, hoping partner passes that|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: 5@h jump?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|poohbear: no|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|poohbear: not quite good enuff|pg||
nt|janm: I agree that 3@s was a sensible bid, and I think that S in the CR might have bid 3@h over the multi 2@d bid, which would have had much the same effect|pg||
nt|petergill: Will East pass 5@C?|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Dangerous|pg||
nt|poohbear: not at all clear. This auction shows a huge hand|pg||
nt|petergill: Arjuna De Livera will probably give this quite a lot of thought|pg||
nt|poohbear: Have to ask why West chose this route as opposed to a direct 5@c|pg||
nt|janm: Usually when you bid this way you either have some flexibility or extra values |pg||
nt|petergill: Arjuna was the dominant player in Australia in 2009, winning the most masterpoints, making the national open team, winning many nationals. |pg||
nt|poohbear: Personally I think 4@c is enuff on this hand|pg||
nt|poohbear: Asking partner to bid 3NT over a TO dbl when you have a singleton @H is a stretch|pg||
nt|petergill: Arjuna might reason that with a singleton or void club, Ian Robinson might bid clubs directly over 3@S, but with a doubleton club he might use this auction to search for 3NT|pg||
nt|janm: Presumably both W's were hoping to get to 3NT, and trusted  that their partners would pass 5@c if they bid it over 4@h - easier after the DBL of 2 than 3 though|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|davidstern: Oops|pg||
nt|petergill: Adam Edgtton's bold 3@S bid was perfectly timed, removing the space and creating the problem|pg||
nt|janm: Yes, that's true here - in the other room, West knew that S had more hearts than spades, so partner wasn't certain to have long hearts|pg||
nt|petergill: I meant doubleton spade, not club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @Sx  @HQx    and slam is cold. Could Robinson not have that hand on the auction? That's De Livera's problem and he guessed wrong|pg||

nt|petergill: wondered what the game he tried was, so they learnt by playing online on BBO's ancestor. |pg||
nt|poohbear: 6 trumps and AK A |pg||
nt|janm: I agree - lead a trump, continue trump when he wins the club.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|pc|sA|pg||
pc|hA|nt|poohbear: Question is can you set up @hs after a trump lead|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|s8|pc|h5|pg||

nt|petergill: Ishmael Del'monte says that bare queen is one of the good trump holdings to lead from|pg||
nt|poohbear: I agree|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|janm: Why is that, Peter, because it's going to show up anyway?|pg||
nt|poohbear: of course I ALWAYS lead trumps given any reason|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|cK|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|d5|pg||
nt|petergill: Because declarer might place you with QJ or QJx and mispick later|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|d4|pc|c5|pg||
nt|janm: A trump now isn't quite enough - declarer will have 7 trump tricks and AK, A. Now he has 8 trump tricks and AK, A|pg||

pc|c6|pc|d7|pc|dJ|pc|c8|pg||
nt|poohbear: prob should have ruffed the @s first|pg||
nt|petergill: Because you rarely drop a trick  by leading bare trump queen, but bare trump jack and king are far more likely to cost a trick |pg||
pc|sT|pc|s7|pc|d9|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|c7|nt|petergill: Ruff with D10?|pg||

pc|h9|pc|s9|pc|dK|pc|hJ|pg||

mb|p|nt|jcwla: The extent of the fit not pinpointed here.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: :) reciprocated Jordan ty @H|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kiwibridge: nicely cut Matt out of the auction|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am suprised that N is not in this bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure i understand 1@C=2+ but natural responses rather than transfers|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: how lucky for N that S does not have a normal hand for the 4H bid|pg||
nt|cindy:  now 5C looks like a @h sl;am try|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not if you have agreed that it isnt|pg||
mb|3C|nt|cindy:  of course no idea their agreements|pg||
nt|bucheister: the one level opening followed by 1NT kept them low|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: hang on Shirl -- i'm getting my thesaurus   "surprised" doesn't quite cover it|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: natural was best on this layout, made it hard for Matt to hop in, but surprised he didn't|pg||
nt|sybarra: it may not |pg||
pc|s2|nt|kiwibridge: and soon they will face the question: do we come out guns blazing 50 behind, or do we just concede|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|s6|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bucheister: E will keep searching for W opening bid; for not|pg||
nt|marlowepi: club length with spade length means down i think|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jcwla: Lots of "I'll choose the weakish noise this time and accept any tries" in this segment -- followed by no try -- followed by +200 etc|pg||
nt|itinerant: one disadvantage of using transfer responses to 1C is the extra space it gives your opponents. On this hand, for example, a 1H transfer by Alex would have allowed Matt to X showing ...|pg||
nt|itinerant: hearts, if that was their method|pg||
nt|sybarra: no clue what else to say |pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hK|nt|marlowepi: the 4H bid was curious|pg||
pc|h7|nt|cindy:  not as curious as dbl|pg||
pc|s8|pc|h5|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: 2@H showing @H works here too|pg||
nt|itinerant: yup, indeed|pg||
nt|sybarra: slightly more "normal" auction in the other room |pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: False claim is why it went down|pg||
nt|cindy:  hmm   thats ugly|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Directors ruling|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bucheister: that 6 is growing up|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kiwibridge: "senior" moments in other words :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: i'm told 1@C=2 ONLY IF  4=4=3=2, so not all balanced hands|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|nt|kiwibridge: will it be 3 or 6 imps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: do we get to vote?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: can Matt still have Q@S for his pass?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he can't have what he's already shown, so who knows|pg||
pc|sT|nt|tejjyid: nicely done by West|pg||
nt|itinerant: Can only think that he must have spade length to pass twice - once over 1S and again over 2S|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h2|pc|sQ|nt|jcwla: Thanks again to all.  For now, from Los Angeles, so long.|pg||

nt|marlowepi: concede??? NO RETREAT, NO SURRENDER|pg||
nt|ahollan1: was problem here:  a) Milne DBL  b) Whibley 3@C [rather than 2N] or c) all of the above|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d3|pc|d6|nt|marlowepi: dont care for 2N with 2-card disparity|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|an| |mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|an| |nt|janm: Hi all, nice to be here|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: NS are playing 2/1|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: EW are playing Acol i believe |pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|janm: A lot of players use 2@d in this auction as a multi-way bid, almost always including a good doubleton spade and often with 5 or 6 hearts - I don't know what the possibilities were ...|pg||
nt|janm: for this pair, perhaps a 2NT rebid with spade support was one of them|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think they are playing gazzilli|pg||
nt|janm: An aggressive game to start the segment - |pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|s9|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|poohbear: I would have liked to see a 3@d bid by South to complete the pattern and allow partner to make an intelligient decision|pg||
nt|janm: Presumably E didn't want to give anything up in a side suit, so led dummy's suit, and he's right that he hasn't given anything away|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sT|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|poohbear: 26 point 3NT with a 5 card suit is aggressive Jan>?|pg||
pc|sK|pc|h6|nt|janm: But he did give N the time to set up a 4th spade before the defensive diamonds were set up, although with the entryless West, setting up diamonds wouldn't have helped|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h3|pc|d7|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|janm: It looks as if this will end up making 4, and you're right, the other room will probably bid it also, so should be a flat board. We won't see the other table's results on this and ...|pg||
nt|janm: the next board until the end of the segment.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|janm: Not sure what West's heart spots said to his partner, since I don't know the EW signals, but 6 then 3 looks as if it probably wasn't clear, and of course it's not clear what he ...|pg||
nt|janm: wanted to signal either|pg||
nt|poohbear: Delivera very unlikely to have QJ of @ds based on the @s lead|pg||
nt|poohbear: so declarer prob wishing he had pitched a @h not a @d|pg||
pc|dK|nt|janm: De Livera seems to have taken the heart spots as discouraging in hearts and decided diamonds were a more attractive suit than clubs.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h5|pc|dT|pc|h4|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|pc|c8|pc|c2|pg||

nt|janm: tricks - is this one of those holdings where it's right to play the 9 from J9xx?|pg||
nt|janm: So N makes an overtrick|pg||
pc|d6|pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||

nt|jcwla: Well, it doesn't get any closer than this.|pg||
nt|cindy:  ewwww|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you would end up in 4-3 Ds instead of 62 clubs on a lot of hands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so maybe "d"  unlucky|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: 1N=11-14|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: for the oficial scores at the end of the match look on the abf website|pg||
nt|bucheister: Two more boards this set; thanks to our viewgrapher for a great job|pg||
nt|marlowepi: (e) lack of methods|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C forcing to 2N or 3@C|pg||
mb|3H|nt|bucheister: 3D is probably a limit raise or better in Hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: immediate 2N over the double = both minors, equal length or one more club|pg||
nt|marlowepi: delayed 2N = this hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H splinter forces to game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at least i'm going to guess they can't stop in 4@C|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|tomi2: 11 imps for NS on that hand with 11 red cards, other table drowe to slam. here now a playable slam but you will most often fail on trump break.  there were now several possible ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: slams on finesses or good breaks of suits, this causes lots of imps, most of them are (un)lucky and not just because of your better play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not really an issue with North's holding|pg||
nt|marlowepi: diamond queen is best shot double dummy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not unreasonable either|pg||
mb|4C|nt|marlowepi: easy queen of clubs lead:)|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: yes|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thx Max so 0-0 with 16 to go :)|pg||
nt|cindy:  this is good|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 2@S is the right bid by East here|pg||
nt|tejjyid: that's good bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: didn't 3@H show entire hand?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: american star Jack Oest says "even thinking over 3N was an overbid"|pg||
mb|6C|nt|marlowepi: excellent lead, and not because of result|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: McManus did NOT have a mechanism to show weak hand with both minors|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: wow and it goes further|pg||
nt|marlowepi: did S give this one enough gas, would we say?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: guessing S thinks it is his side that is stuck 55|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bucheister: what does the panel think about souths immediate 5H bid; is pass forcing?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: trying to make final set more interesting?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugrapha2: yep|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jcwla: Cue up Boy George...I know all there is to know about the crying game...|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|marlowepi: against high suit contracts, usually better to lead from short strength than longer weakness|pg||
pc|d3|nt|janm: Whether P is forcing depends on their agreements - I think it's very hard not to bid 5@h if P isn't forcing, and not sure whether N would work out to DBL if S made a forcing pass|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: does he need to play @H now -- or can he pull one more trump?|pg||
nt|sybarra: perhaps @H,   leading up to K ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure Al what is best|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's what i thought instinctively -- but i never trust my instinct|pg||
nt|sybarra: if it wins,  @D  back to ace,  ht again?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|vugrapha2: and thats the 6th flat board this segment|pg||
nt|bucheister: I agree totally; a human being bids 5H|pg||
nt|poohbear: Dbl is clearcut with the North hand. An ace and only 3 trumps|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: assumin this is down may need a final set|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i agree S should pass 3N, but we can surely see hy he liked his hand so much, and he undoubtedly felt there was safety above 3N. to me the even more surprising call is 6C, because ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S can SEE that the 4S call was not a high-card control|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if N was bothering to show Qx of spades, it is very likely because he has only 4 clubs and would be willing to play in 4S|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|pc|c3|pc|c6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no way to make now, except for false claim of course:)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|cindy:  lol|pg||

pc|hT|nt|marlowepi: some specs are suggesting that 4C was KC and 4S just a reply. maybe, but it makes no sense for S to splinter and then when N makes the most discouraging reply follow up with KC. |pg||

pc|hA|pg||
nt|poohbear: it might be the only situation where I rebid 2S with 6-4|pg||
nt|bucheister: this auction should show a very good 6-4?|pg||
nt|poohbear: then over 2NT i can rebid 3H and partner knows I got this|pg||
pc|s2|nt|marlowepi: probably like a forcing NT. has the advantage of going slow & letting pd rebid naturally at 2 level. 2H might bix N and the suit is not that good anyway|pg||
nt|cindy:  im told 1N is supposed to be 9+ game force|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bucheister: well said|pg||
nt|poohbear: not in a 2/1 auction|pg||
nt|janm: The 2@h rebid convinced East to play 3NT - 4@s is a better contract, I think|pg||
nt|poohbear: Agree Jan|pg||
nt|poohbear: if He bids 2S then 3H he gets to 4@s|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pg||
nt|marlowepi: more curious is the 2N bid, but N cannot force to game (3D presumably) and 2D might not be forcing|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|h7|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|nt|bucheister: E might play 3NT even if W rebids 2S but it does bring 4S into play; lots of A's in E|pg||
nt|poohbear: The other thing. If he rebids 2S he doesnt have to bid 3@h he can bid 3@d over 2NT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 6|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: must be prepared to play 3@D or @H|pg||
pc|sT|pc|dA|nt|poohbear: I think thats a better way to go|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|c4|nt|bucheister: hadn't thought of that but a very good point|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 36 is still feasible|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: very, plus they have a biut of momentum|pg||
pc|cA|nt|poohbear: now partner can evaluate @ds for NT|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|pc|d8|pg||
nt|janm: I'm not convinced that East would have a different picture of the hand if West bid 2@s and then 3@h, but I agree that if he just forgot about the hearts, E would probably play ...|pg||
nt|janm: spades|pg||
nt|poohbear: in Game Forcing Auctions its all about suit Quality|pg||
nt|bucheister: I am John Buchheister  and we are done for now; thanks to everyone all those that joined in at the end; good night all |pg||
