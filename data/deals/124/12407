nt|othered1: Hi, Tez!|pg||
nt|tez: i think they play semi forcing nt..5/12|pg||
nt|sybarra: an individual...wonder if they have "rules" as to what they play|pg||
nt|othered1: Individual events, which aren't very common, especially in USA, do give you a chance so see how players manage unfamiliar partnership, usually with simplified methods.|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is an individual tourney, at  the Bridge Club of Rio de Janeiro |pg||
nt|sybarra: I will say, I do not envy the operator for an indivdual tourney   |pg||
nt|sybarra: I am sure these folks know each other well....and can deal with "systems" |pg||
nt|tez: he should play @C|pg||
nt|tez: i thk:)|pg||
nt|tez: if he keep playing @C it will be annoying for defence|pg||
