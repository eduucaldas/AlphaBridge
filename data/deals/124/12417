nt|cuttysark: Prospects of a few part score swings that will make the match closer|pg||

nt|dougdscsu: It's such a crappy suit with no shortness...|pg||
nt|wesleyc: would hate to run into a 1444|pg||
pc|c9|nt|poohbear: I dont like it. On those rare occasions that partner has a singleton its really bad . partner is a favorite to only have a dbltn since some hands with 3 he would have raised ...|pg||
nt|poohbear: already|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bucheister: With only the 8; I believe that low is best|pg||
