nt|bucheister: E might play 3NT even if W rebids 2S but it does bring 4S into play; lots of A's in E|pg||
nt|poohbear: The other thing. If he rebids 2S he doesnt have to bid 3@h he can bid 3@d over 2NT|pg||
pc|hK|pc|c5|nt|kiwibridge: must be prepared to play 3@D or @H|pg||

pc|s4|mc|10|nt|janm: I'm not convinced that East would have a different picture of the hand if West bid 2@s and then 3@h, but I agree that if he just forgot about the hearts, E would probably play ...|pg||
nt|janm: spades|pg||
nt|poohbear: in Game Forcing Auctions its all about suit Quality|pg||
