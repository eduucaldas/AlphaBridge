nt|vugrapha3: he's thinking about it...|pg||
nt|avivs:  they both know the distribution i think|pg||

nt|itinerant: so, east can open 2C game force and the opponent's are cold for slam!|pg||
mb|p|nt|itinerant: not a common occurrance|pg||
nt|avivs:  well... it's a "psych" of sorts|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: haha, thomson describes 2C by punching the air at his screenmate... like a "cooommee on"|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|itinerant: a 2NT rebid by East would be a splendid psyche!|pg||
nt|avivs:  I assume X showed clubs|pg||

mb|2H!|nt|itinerant: i'd love to know what 2H showed|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: it wasn't alerted|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S!|nt|bgn: making me feel even older still :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|2N!|nt|itinerant: wow!|pg||
nt|avivs:  the 2@c opening took away the force|pg||
nt|itinerant: no need to psych a 2NT bid if you've already psyched a game-force!|pg||
mb|p|nt|avivs:  and South comletly ignored North strong bidding|pg||

nt|avivs:  it had to be clubs|pg||
nt|itinerant: if all it showed was some clubs, I'm not sure than north could have done any more!|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|avivs:  I said South should have bid more|pg||
nt|itinerant: indeed|pg||
nt|bgn: As a rule, length and strength in the other major (here, east's @HQ1083) is a sign not to preempt too high|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|avivs:  North already bid twice vul when he wasn't forced to|pg||
mb|p|nt|avivs:  and south had a first round control of all suits! (ok ok only second round in diamonds)|pg||
mb|p|nt|itinerant: the open room NS (delivera) have arrived in 3NT doubled on board 17|pg||
mb|p|pc|s8|pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sT|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: 1 IMP to Lilley , not the board they needed at this stage of the game ...|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|c3|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|h9|pc|h5|pg||

pc|s2|nt|avivs:  not the best lead for the defense|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|itinerant: in this position, many pairs play the 2S bid as showing only 4 spades. the idea being that, with 5, you would have overcalled in the first placce|pg||

nt|poohbear: I would bid 2@ds  with East.  ( assuming partner wont pass ) 3NT usually indicates a 7 card suit with cards outside and a likly singleton in responder's suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: now heading to 6@C|pg||
nt|poohbear: now they are off to slam on a finesse|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|d|nt|poohbear: In fact East shouldnt cooperate. Partner is thinking he has a singleton @s and he has 2 . Also he has only 6 @cs when he should have 7|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|poohbear: and in fact it is East who is driving to slam and mkaing a GS try in the process|pg||
mb|6C|nt|kiwibridge: yes indeed|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|poohbear: Williams has a decent hand but he has to be aware that there wont be an entry to the @s suit|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kiwibridge: good lead Thomson|pg||
nt|poohbear: on another lead declarer could draw trumps and duck a @s. Now that option isnt there|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|pc|hA|pg||
nt|poohbear: declarer played low from dummy?|pg||
nt|poohbear: Seems like he shoulda guessed one way :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: Part of the problem of bidding 3NT with the East hand   is that there are many strains that the hand can play in|pg||
nt|poohbear: I didnt see the dbl of 5@hs  that makes the play form dummy reasonable|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer only has 10 top tricks so he needs to get a Diamond ruff in dummy. I think he plays for the finesse|pg||
nt|poohbear: thats 50%  another option is to hope you can set up a @h trick and a squeeze comes in|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer can force a @h trick. But the problem is that he gets a @d return and has to guess right then|pg||
nt|poohbear: and there are communication problems with the @d finesse line|pg||
nt|poohbear: uppercuts|pg||
nt|allysophia: more importantly, there is a K@d problem with the finesse line|pg||
nt|poohbear: cant get back to draw trumps|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s9|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||

pc|sA|nt|petergill: The idea behoind the switch is that if partner has AQxx and declarer xxx, declarer will play you for a singleton. |pg||
pc|s5|nt|itinerant: safely arrived!|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: nagy pulled the 3S card, changed his mind and swapped for 3H|pg||
nt|petergill: Then, declarer will be surprised to find @DQxx onside, and having risen king on the 2nd spade, will go down. |pg||
pc|s3|nt|itinerant: nothing to the play here|pg||

mc|9|nt|dan_hohor: hi all :)|pg||
nt|petergill: South's failure to do a t/o X over 3@C suggests South has 2 or less cards in one major, which makes De Livera's play less attractive|pg||

mb|2D!|nt|itinerant: it may seem at first glance that an off-shape 2NT by brightling would be cute - but bidding 3C will get you to the notrump game if that's wherer you belong|pg||
nt|petergill: Other table in this match is in 3@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|itinerant: wow!|pg||
nt|itinerant: nagy's enjoying the vulnerability|pg||

nt|dan_hohor: the optimum contract, but game is 50% on a @h finesse|pg||
nt|nigel: Hi Dan Liley slowly closing the gap|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: hi Nigel :) ty for joining|pg||
nt|petergill: Bruce's team was seeded 1, De Livera 2, my team 3, some Polish former World Champs 4, Lilley 6 and Milne an "erroneous" seeding of 14. |pg||
mb|4H|nt|avivs:  EW can almost make 3NT with the hearts blocked|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|nigel: Delivera may drop the heart king here|pg||

mb|p|nt|itinerant: only a spade lead would makee this interestng|pg||
