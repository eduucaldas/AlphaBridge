nt|vugraphzdb: I have told them, Mark. Who was Admiral Capal?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|jtr: Could try 3NT|pg||

mb|p|nt|chessmaste: He sailed for the EBU|pg||
nt|jtr: If she can ask for a single she will|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: hmmmm|pg||
nt|jtr: 5@d looks a better bet than pass|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It does|pg||
nt|jtr: 5@c rather|pg||

nt|roswolf: west is one of the world championship team and her partner is a solid performer in ebu competitions|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: Slightly delayed start as the ladies gathered, but we're on our way now.|pg||
nt|roswolf: do we know the systems|pg||
nt|viren169: Nice 7@S yesterday missed by most pairs|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|vugraphzda: Afraid not|pg||
nt|viren169: off we go here|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: who ever dealt this was unkind |pg||
nt|viren169: Will West pull it?|pg||
nt|garnetts: really tough hand to start with |pg||
nt|viren169: pass... opps always lead a maj on this auction!|pg||
nt|garnetts: ironically a club lead beats 5@D but not 3NT|pg||
nt|viren169: 3N is cold...|pg||
nt|roswolf: The trials are to determine the England teams for the Lady Milne in Manchester in April. |pg||
nt|garnetts: Thats why it is tough if west pulls |pg||
nt|roswolf: England will have two teams in Manchester because they are hosting the event.   |pg||
nt|viren169: Would you pull?|pg||
nt|garnetts: My view she probably should as from her point of veiw a club lead looks obvious |pg||
nt|roswolf: Pairs finishing 1, 2 and 3 will be |pg||
nt|garnetts: also a @D slam may be cold with a stiff club opposite |pg||
nt|roswolf: selected for the England team, pairs from 4 onwards will be invited to play in the EBU team, which is self-funding.  |pg||
nt|viren169: My vote is pass... the opps have to find the right lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: agree with you there|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: Jajjer thinking long |pg||
nt|vugraphzda: Jagger|pg||
nt|roswolf: she is a very deliberate player especially on big boards|pg||
mb|5C|an|alert|nt|daman: looks like 4@H for NS     E will need to lead a @C and then give partner a ruff to beat it|pg||
nt|roswolf: pessimist9ic view by south|pg||
nt|garnetts: I know it fails here but the pull is much better bridge|pg||
nt|viren169: ouch...|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@D asking for a singleton was perhaps better |pg||
nt|roswolf: The 20 pairs will play 6 board rounds against each other pair.  The scores will be cross-imped, with a maximum of +25 IMPs available to the winners and no limit on the minus score ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: for the losers.|pg||
mb|d|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|nt|cuttysark: Decalrer needs to guess well in clubs to make ten tricks|pg||
nt|viren169: Good dble...|pg||
nt|roswolf: unlucky board for the leaders|pg||
nt|garnetts: West has been very unlucky in my view |pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|nt|roswolf: might be vindicated by the club ruff which is available|pg||
nt|daman: I would have bid game if only to test the waters|pg||
nt|daman: only if the led a @C|pg||
nt|cuttysark: North is generally quite an exciting bidder - South will have seen some of her more imaginative pre-empts before|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I can live with 3@D with this format, but it's not a bid I love|pg||
pc|h5|nt|chessmaste: Old fashioned limit raise|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Inverted raises have not reached England it appears|pg||
nt|chessmaste: They have, but This pair live up North |pg||

nt|roswolf: the score shown is only for interest|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: We're playing 4 6-board matches this evening but are presenting it as one long 24-board match. This means that we'll pause every 6 boards and change the names but the running score ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: will continue.|pg||
nt|viren169: not sure everyone will open 3N with East's hand.|pg||
nt|garnetts: since it is good bridge to pull maybe will happen elsewhere too|pg||
nt|viren169: ummmmmmmmm|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes indeed not too much wrong with 1@D|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S!|nt|daman: that must be an intermediate 2@S opening|pg||
nt|roswolf: intermediate opening|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Tough for NS to reach 4@H now|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|garnetts: Have to say if you do not open 3NT with that--then you might as well use it for something else|pg||
nt|viren169: E/W will be trying to get something back in the next few boards|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|daman: EW would have bid 4@S over 4@H|pg||
nt|daman: insurance|pg||
nt|cuttysark: excellent result for EW - a 1@S openers might not achieve this|pg||
nt|daman: this is a bonus|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: I TRUST THIS IS FINIS|pg||
nt|viren169: Not everyone's opening on East's hand|pg||
pc|d4|nt|roswolf: e/w should play normal bridge they will be given presents by other pairs in this long event|pg||
nt|garnetts: sneaky lead |pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|d7|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4th highest etc wasnt it|pg||
nt|garnetts: send one back and a low club will test west|pg||
nt|viren169: South will assume Pd has led from the K|pg||
nt|roswolf: as a genral point it is apparently correct that if you lead 4th highest of your longest and strongest suit you will defeat contracts of any tupe about 52% of the time which is why ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: i do so when i am in doubt about what to lead!!|pg||
nt|copeyj: Maybe not Gad, if she can see dummy|pg||
nt|copeyj: gm all btw :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|viren169: sorry K in dummy|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|garnetts: a low heart has been suggested by Georgia Ray--and then a low club--that will test anyone|pg||

mb|1S|nt|jtr: And she did!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Wouldn't we all?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: I passed on your advice, David|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Sound overcall for West|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Walddk2: 3@H is enough at these colours|pg||
mb|3D|nt|jtr: 2 or 4@h i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Or even 2, but not 4|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|jtr: Pass works best by North|pg||
nt|jtr: It might even make|pg||
nt|jtr: Pass works even though partner has only one point in @hs  They could have a lot more|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Suppose West cashes a couple of hearts then switches to a spade. |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|nt|jtr: That would be inconvenient|pg||

pc|c4|pc|h9|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hA|pc|c5|pc|hT|pc|h7|pg||
nt|jtr: Very hard for West to visualise the defence|pg||
nt|chessmaste: It will without that spade switch|pg||
nt|jtr: She might get out with a @d|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Is it so hard to attack the potential entry? What other chance do you have?|pg||
nt|jtr: I am not sure the 2nd @h was a good idea|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Many players do not envisage a singleton @DK with declarer|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c6|nt|jtr: A diamond would have worked at trick 2|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h8|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk2: Cashing the third heart is also OK as long as she switches to a spade now|pg||

nt|daman: NS might try to slither into 3NT on this|pg||
nt|viren169: well defended by N/S|pg||
nt|garnetts: some good bridge played here first two hands |pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|garnetts: Not keen on this opening bid though|pg||
mb|d|nt|viren169: Dbl or 3@D?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|garnetts: Don't necessarily want a spade lead and the stiff K might have been trash |pg||
nt|roswolf: remember the score you can see is only a very rough guide |pg||
nt|roswolf: The 20 pairs will play 6 board rounds against each other pair.  The scores will be cross-imped, with a maximum of +25 IMPs available to the winners and no limit on the minus score ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: for the losers.|pg||
nt|viren169: Singleton K not so good|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|roswolf: the last boardseems likely to be played in some number of spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: West will be checking the cards - how often do you hold @CAQ doubleton?|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: I suppose, for the sake of the BBO archives, we should say who is playing as this might be lost if we change the names later. For boards 1-6 we have Tracy Capal (North), Kath ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: Nelson (South), Susanna Gross (East) and Sally Brock (West).|pg||
nt|daman: 3NT now?|pg||
nt|roswolf: well she is nv and it is a biodders game nowadays|pg||
nt|roswolf: bidders|pg||
pc|hK|nt|cuttysark: 2@S is presumably strong but not game-forcing by a passed hand. North is maximum, but will be wondering where the tricks might come from|pg||
nt|viren169: trump lead is good here|pg||
nt|viren169: or switch|pg||
nt|garnetts: This is a sound indication as to why 1@S was a poor opening --forced to rebid a queen high suit |pg||
nt|viren169: As someone said if u are dealt AK... you do not have to look for for any other lead|pg||
nt|viren169: North could have bid 3@S|pg||
nt|garnetts: Also I prefer 3@D to double|pg||
nt|viren169: It is a pushy 4@S|pg||
nt|viren169: 2@S didnt promise 6?!?!|pg||
nt|roswolf: doesnt seem to be enough tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: south's trump pips arent quite good enough|pg||
nt|garnetts: What else would you suggest over 2@S ---poor North can hardly imagine a 2@S rebid is on Q10xxx---likely to have seen a 2NT rebid with just five spades too |pg||
nt|viren169: 8 of @S would have been nice|pg||
nt|viren169: 3@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: well it is a filthy opening bid + north good reasonably expect more|pg||
nt|garnetts: Cut to the chase--if North thought south held hearts then would have expected 2NT not 2@S which in my view is a much better bid than 2@S |pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe a furth argument for passing initially|pg||
nt|garnetts: Better to pass than to be forced to rebid Q10xxx|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair comment|pg||

nt|athene: you don't have much defence|pg||
nt|daman: no kidding|pg||
nt|daman: how about  'one' quick trick?|pg||
nt|athene: but i think many people would open it on the basis that with 55 in the majors, you don't need to worry, because you are playing it anyway :)|pg||
nt|athene: east now has a nasty problem|pg||
mb|p!|mb|d|mb|p|nt|athene: passing isn't safe but neither is bidding|pg||
nt|daman: but you are distorting your hand    I wold think with 5-5 in the majors you aren't going to get shut out of the auccion very often|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p!|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|daman: and when you open that trash   it is very difficult for your partner to defend because they surely expect something other than the hand you have|pg||
nt|daman: like   'defense'|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: ouch|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I agree, it's best suited for a weak both majors bid, like 2@D or 2@H|pg||
nt|athene: surely west doesn't think this "double then bid" sequence shows a good hand?|pg||
nt|daman: but it served its purpose on this hand    pushed EW into potential trouble|pg||
mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: I would have risked a double with the South cards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Partner opening at red, and opps are in 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: many specs are telling me this is cold|pg||
nt|athene: of course it makes, with @DQJ doubleton|pg||
nt|athene: but that's very lucky - i don't think EW were on the same wavelength at all|pg||
nt|athene: east is limited by the pass over 1@S so X then 3@D has to be red suits|pg||
nt|daman: a lot of zigging and zagging|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It also needs @CK on side|pg||
nt|athene: west is hoping that east has 5 (or even 6) diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and @HK of course|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's worse than terrible|pg||
nt|athene: so she can see quite a lot of tricks - when dummy hits i am sure she wants to take back the 3nt bid :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Do you have an English word for that?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: well i have the suit and dont have 4 of a major but should have tolerance for one of them|pg||

nt|cuttysark: bye Shirley|pg||
nt|roswolf: another slam and wesy having @CAQ|pg||
nt|eggy: still gets an imp though|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: The 20 pairs will play 6 board rounds against each other pair.  The scores will be cross-imped, with a maximum of +25 IMPs available to the winners and no limit on the minus score ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: for the losers.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|nt|pelu: strange that W in OR only bid 5@C - why not a cuebid in 4@s?|pg||
nt|roswolf: THE OPEN ROOM SEQUENCE LOOKS ODD|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 4@C would normally be a solid suit. |pg||
nt|eggy: Standings at start of play today are on http://www.ebu.co.uk/results/2010January-July/LadyMilneTrials/index.htm|pg||
nt|ady: eithert 2 spades for e/w   or maybe a diamond contract for n/s|pg||
nt|roswolf: east will pass|pg||
mb|1D|nt|pelu: 1@C OK - but what sh East bid now? - |pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: my last hand all ,  thx and great fun!|pg||
mb|2D|nt|roswolf: a reverse 2@S perhaps|pg||
nt|roswolf: would be better|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think the rebid is so impossible that I am with the 2@C opener|pg||
nt|eggy: Obviously NS have no fear of their famous opponents ..|pg||

nt|eggy: I'm not sure that there is much long term mileage (vig as Rose called it) overcalling 1D when S has passed|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: X not alerted|pg||
nt|eggy: Looks like it showed a strong NT type though|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes normal treatment|pg||
nt|eggy: not that Nevena is interested|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: i dont like this now - i think impossible to bid the slam sensibly now|pg||
nt|cuttysark: If playing 1430 one could now use RKC|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 9 tricks can be made except on a club lead|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Five of England's European team for Ostend in Belgium this summer are competing: Fiona Brown & Susan Stockdale playing together, plus Sally Brock, Heather Dhondy and Nevena Senior ...|pg||

nt|athene: east really doesn't have enough playing strength to see nine fast tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If she can make 3NT on power, partner must be able to double again, George|pg||
