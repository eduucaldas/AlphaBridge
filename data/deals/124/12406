mb|1H|nt|sybarra: could well have a red save in the offing|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would double as south|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2H|nt|sybarra: I wouldnt,  my pard always leaps in spades|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah my pard's are well trained|pg||
nt|sybarra: since I usually promise other suits,  esp. the other major |pg||
mb|3D|mb|4H|nt|ady: 4@H best for e/w     4@S  could be beaten|pg||
nt|sybarra: geoffrey,  glad you trained them.....then |pg||
nt|roswolf: now the guessing game starts|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: is 3 @D the right bid with N?  or 4?  anyone?|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h3|nt|ady: east an aggressive 4@H on good shaped  when only raise to 2@H     West has excellent cards for the aggrfessive action |pg||
nt|roswolf: the 8 card suit wins but were e/w put off doubling by their effort on the first board?|pg||
nt|ady: now west declines to double at the 5 level   |pg||
nt|roswolf: probably at least -1|pg||
nt|vugraphzcr: south is still thinking|pg||
nt|sybarra: play ace of @H  ruff a H!,  cash a, q of @d  (pitch the spade) then try a another @D?|pg||
nt|ady: without spade lead looks to me down 1   probably losing 3 trump tricks|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|d9|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|ady: king was a good effort    makes with singleton jack or 9   or 2-2|pg||
nt|vugraphzcr: even if its J singel,you make the board|pg||
nt|sybarra: and  it is so much easier from this vantage point |pg||

nt|Walddk2: 4@H by West on board 3 in the other room|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|hedyg: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  for BBO-TV. Watch both vugraph rooms at the same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Some need Flash Player 9, some ...|pg||

nt|hedyg: i hate to pass with an ace|pg||

nt|april7: W will reach 4@H probably|pg||
nt|april7: N 1NT with the 2 tens|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|hedyg: i would have bid 1@H and pass 1@s by pd or any other bid she makes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@D by Gerstner is better in my opinion. It does not show a strong hand, just ensuring that you get to the right strain|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|april7: must be a strong bid at least 16!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, catching up now|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@D shows at least 16 for you, Avram?|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||

pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|c8|pc|c2|pg||
nt|april7: @H is best now|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|d|nt|roswolf: i would have thought on the bidding that east was likely to hold the acs + distribution|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: if there is singleton jack or there are 2-2, either play wins|pg||
nt|roswolf: now west has to bid the right suit|pg||
nt|ady: e/w may get to 4 hearts    trump lead best|pg||
mb|2D!|an|both Majors|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|roswolf: ah a gadget may have struck|pg||
nt|sybarra: was there any clue of no ruff by E  (last hand)  ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: yes i think so|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sybarra: looking like a leb sequence |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: could be Shirley|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not really, as an overruff was certain and reducing the   of EW trumps could not be good for the defense|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|sybarra: houston we have landed:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: west showing both suits|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: this should make even on a trump lead   |pg||
nt|marlowepi: E has done well to pass here. W embarked on a dangerous auction since he is not a passed hand|pg||
pc|dT|nt|roswolf: remember juniors have no fear|pg||
nt|marlowepi: whether i remember that or forget it, the chosen sequence remains dangerous:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: us oldsters bear all the scars of experience|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even my scars have scars:)|pg||
nt|ady: west did pass after 1@D opening  and has since shown a 2 suiter that was not good enough to take eaelier action|pg||
nt|vugraphzcr: well but west is limit because he didnt overcall 2d on 1d to show majors|pg||
nt|vugraphzcr: execlty David|pg||
nt|sybarra: pesky that the @H's are 3/1 |pg||
nt|roswolf: dd declarer can make a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that is a good point but it only partly applies--it covers only the 55 hands (W could be 5-4 on this sequence, and he would not michaels with that). moreover-----|pg||
nt|ady: west has a problem getting to hand to play a club towards the king  and is in danger of being overruffed  if trying with a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzcr: so with 5-4 he could have overcall 1M|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
nt|ady: with any decent 5-4  might have overcalled the 5 card suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the reason for silence by W might be weak suits, and E does not need W to have good suits for slam to have play:   xxxxx   Qxxxx  x QJ|pg||
nt|ady: you were first this time Lotan|pg||
nt|chick: he can afford to ruff a @D high and play for @Hs no worse than 3-1|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d4|pg||
nt|sybarra: getting to hand is not the problem |pg||
nt|ady: probably best to enter with a trump|pg||
nt|marlowepi: play D and throw club|pg||
nt|sybarra: then you hae a club thru....on the cross ruff mode?  not sure that is best |pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|pc|hJ|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|chick: he needs to crossruff, just have to hope opps don't figure that out in time|pg||
nt|marlowepi: almost guaranteed if you throw club on 3rd D|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|marlowepi: if opps lead trump ten may be neutralized|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but this will result in 11 tricks|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|ady: yes  good point Marshall|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|chick: safe now because can pitch spade on @CK|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if W knew N has club ace it is another story, but he does not know that--only we do|pg||

nt|sybarra: now gettting the small hts in |pg||

pc|d6|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||

nt|othered1: Individual events, which aren't very common, especially in USA, do give you a chance so see how players manage unfamiliar partnership, usually with simplified methods.|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is an individual tourney, at  the Bridge Club of Rio de Janeiro |pg||
