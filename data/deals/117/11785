nt|hedyg: hopefully David will tell us what is said|pg||
nt|athene: well, however you play it, it's about number 9 on "things you discuss after a 1@S opener" - many pairs spend hours on things which should be about number 560|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nothing compared to what happened in a Copenhagen club some years ago.  1@S  4@H    and there they were palying on a 0-0 fit|pg||

nt|lestergold: Ranis recent emigre from US|pg||

mb|1D|nt|xenya: but that's academic of course|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: and has well done|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: surprised at 2@D on a 4/6 major suit shape|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think Dhondy should take pressure off and double his hand does not look 5 level suitable|pg||
mb|p|pc|sK|nt|mdgraham: but he only has @HA as a trick. It depends how strong 2@D can be|pg||
nt|lestergold: but n/s look lke they are saving|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: Looks like a misunderstanding over the natural of 3@H in the other room.|pg||

nt|hedyg: no alert...|pg||
nt|athene: it might be natural and forcing :)|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|athene: natural is an archaic term - it means "having some of that suit"|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: you mean not a void?|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|hedyg: welcome back|pg||

nt|athene: Not sure which game is better - 3NT or 4@H|pg||
nt|justin c: everything right for declarer here|pg||
nt|roswolf: probably doesnt mattter on this layout|pg||
nt|hedyg: 12 tricks if he plays small @D from dummy|pg||
nt|athene: the only real question is whether he can arrange to pitch the @S8 on dummy's fourth diamond|pg||
nt|athene: leading the @DJ will do just as well - if he then finesses the @D8 :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hedyg: which he wont|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|pg||
nt|hedyg: doesnt seem to care about discarding the @s loser|pg||
nt|athene: he is thinking about everything wrong, when he might have four losers|pg||
nt|athene: (@DK, @S, two clubs)|pg||
nt|roswolf: did n/s really fail to bid game!? hhhhhhhmmmmmmmm|pg||
nt|hedyg: well ducking @s wont help then|pg||
nt|athene: so he is trying to make it hard for the defence to know to put a club through|pg||
nt|athene: his idea is he might be able to get a club away on the fourth diamond|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s7|pc|s5|pc|sA|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|nt|athene: for example win spade continuation and play diamonds|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm alan is a deep thinker|pg||
nt|athene: now east when in with the @DK might play a spade rather than a club|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: but i agree, ducking the first spade didn't seem hugely advantageous on most layouts|pg||
pc|s3|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|hedyg: because his pd doesnt give count in @s........|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont think underestimating your opps is a good idea|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: now he wants to leave the @HQ as entry and play diamonds|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|d3|pg||

nt|mdgraham: South was pretty maximum for 2@H|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|lestergold: and north with powerful six card suit and solid point count was a bit strong for 3h |pg||

nt|athene: but perhaps the chances of making with both minor-suit cards wrong are just too slight, and you are giving up some legitimate chances to play for that|pg||
nt|roswolf: fun in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: and you should play the boring "draw trumps, take diamond finesse" :)|pg||
mb|1D|mb|4H|nt|athene: bidding 4major on quite strong hands can work ok|pg||
nt|athene: but it does have a disadvantage sometimes|pg||
nt|athene: you can force opps to bid over it|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but|pg||
nt|athene: and now you let them steal from you|pg||
mb|d|nt|hedyg: 4@H making|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: modern macho |pg||
nt|athene: they might go 2 or 3 down but partner can't double because he thinks you have far less|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: you can play that double by the 4@H bidder just says "i have a good hand" but that's also risky|pg||

nt|roswolf: as justin says north has taken a very odd view|pg||
pc|s4|nt|roswolf: at least it is non vul|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: well, this is the sort of decision that total tricks theory suggests is right a lot of the time - if you give partner a t/o shape with perhaps 4234 as average, you are better-off ...|pg||
nt|athene: trying for four tricks in defence|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||
nt|hedyg: small @H now..|pg||

nt|athene: time for the @HK, trying to pin singleton @HQ with south?|pg||
nt|hedyg: try to pin Q@H?|pg||
nt|justin c: Its also possible that east has an 8 or 9 card trump suit here, making defending no fun at all|pg||
nt|athene: you don't want to lose to stiff @HQ AND suffer the club ruff|pg||
nt|athene: of course, if south has the singleton @HA, then @HK is the silly card :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: true|pg||
nt|hedyg: in the CR after a strong @c opening by W, N bid 1@D=Majors|pg||
mb|3H|nt|hedyg: which did not stop Dhondy from bidding @hs|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|vugraphzaa: 2c denied 3h|pg||
nt|roswolf: i find west's final pass odd though|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: it was definitely showing majors? more likely majors/minors i would have thought|pg||
nt|hedyg: well, look at his hand |pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: will this be passed?|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: wd|pg||
nt|athene: a tricky auction this - misunderstandings abound in these situations over whether 4@H is natural or a cue for clubs|pg||
nt|justin c: it is better to have 9 trumps than 7 (as many great analysts of the game have said)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|justin c: y - need to be on firm ground as to whether 4@H is an offer to play|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|pc|sK|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|athene: even 4@C might be ambiguous - could be taken as natural or cue for hearts, given that west bid 3@H earlier|pg||
nt|athene: the main difficulty is that when you have to go through 4th suit forcing to show a GF raise in partner's second suit, he often raises your suit first which makes things murky :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this looks like a swing back for howard|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|hedyg: ruff 1@d low and 1 high and pull trumps|pg||
nt|hedyg: going to hand with trumps|pg||
nt|athene: yes, that guards against 5-1 hearts and 4-0 trumps, but not against 5-2 diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: but if diamonds are nasty i suppose you can always fall back on the heart finesse or a red-suit squeeze i suppose|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes it does|pg||
nt|athene: you are getting pretty good odds in total|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hedyg: you ruff 1 @d low and the 2nd high|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||

mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2N!|nt|athene: (with weak NT and 3 spades east would simply complete the transfer)|pg||

pc|h7|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||

nt|justin c: Nice system, this|pg||
nt|justin c: think Versace-Lauria play something similar|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: many Italians do|pg||
nt|athene: It's popular amongst the Italians to play 2@C or 2@D showing these strong-ish balanced hands.|pg||
nt|hedyg: and the treatment is responder bids like over a 2NT opening|pg||
nt|athene: They don't like opening the nebulous 1@C with 18-19 balanced.|pg||
nt|justin c: It means that a jump 2NT rebid can be used conventionally also|pg||

nt|athene: Often that's true and you need *two* ruffs to show a profit.|pg||

mb|1S|nt|athene: 1@S or 2@S possible with west|pg||
nt|athene: but two aces and 4 hearts means you might miss 4@H a bit if you open 2, i suppose|pg||
nt|hedyg: easy double|pg||
nt|athene: double, 4@S from east|pg||
nt|athene: then south wants to bid about 3@H over that, but they don't let you :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: E too good for 4@s for me|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: the argument against 4@S is that you might end up taking the last guess if they bid 5@H|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|athene: right - he involves partner with a splinter|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@H= splinter|pg||

nt|justin c: not sure Howard will consider this too much 'fun'|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm splinters not recognised |pg||
nt|athene: I am told that 4@H systemically is natural not a splinter.|pg||
nt|roswolf: well south is a regular pard of mine and seems to induce mistakes by opps|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c8|pg||
nt|hedyg: well, their CC says they play transfers from XX upwards after double by opp|pg||
nt|justin c: West might have some misgivings about this regardless|pg||

nt|lestergold: in any case at this level you would not expect elemenatary misunderstandings of this kind|pg||
