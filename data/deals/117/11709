mb|p|mb|3C|nt|Walddk2: Situated in the heart of the Highveld, Gauteng is the smallest province in South Africa, with only 1.4% of the land area, but it is highly urbanised and, as of 2007, has a ...|pg||

nt|hcbfick: should it go 3@C 4@C?|pg||
mb|4C|nt|rado: some may use 4@D here as Leaping Michaels|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Johannesburg is the main city in Gauteng|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When properly pronounced, the first letter of the name Gauteng is a voiceless velar fricative, pronounced similarly to the "ch" in the German "achtung" or Scottish "loch." This ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: pronunciation is natural in both the Sesotho and Afrikaans languages|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|rado: practical jump now:)|pg||

nt|hcbfick: I go with 4@C and 4@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rado: a better ttreatment is to use 4@D as both Majors and 4@C as other minor + unspecified Major|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This did not lead anywhere|pg||

nt|xenya: well strictly speaking, there is no game here for EW, though 3N might have a practical chance|pg||
nt|yo_yo: slam time|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Slam for NS, 6@S better|pg||
nt|sharkey: Cheap save for NS - it was hard for EW to enter due to the balanced hands|pg||
nt|sharkey: Slam coming up|pg||
mb|p|nt|chthonic: Slam a bit ambitious and does not make with 3-1 hearts|pg||

mb|4D|nt|haans: assume puppet|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|chthonic: Either in diamonds or hearts.|pg||
nt|chthonic: Dealing with multi -- assume NS will cope|pg||
nt|yo_yo: @H looks off|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and North might support them eventually|pg||
nt|yo_yo: or @D|pg||
nt|sharkey: E will be delighted to hear it's @S - dont know if he'll continue past game as no outside controls|pg||
mb|4H|nt|haans: multi been on for 40 years now time to find defense|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6NT is also a possibilty|pg||
mb|4S|nt|haans: but not for long :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: of course NT ok too :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so anything but @H OK  we think|pg||

nt|sharkey: N - 4@H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|chthonic: That may spur action that will be regretted.|pg||

nt|yo_yo: ok ok mos  @C might not make :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am never good in 2/2 fits |pg||
nt|sharkey: Dont know what 4 NT will accomplish here|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: now the lead of a @S could give another |pg||
nt|sybarra: actually can always lead up towards the q of QS |pg||
nt|haans: my choice for sure|pg||
nt|chthonic: 11 tricks should be easy|pg||
nt|haans: spade finesse = 12|pg||
nt|haans: low risk|pg||
mb|5C|nt|sybarra: q of @S |pg||
nt|yo_yo: the good old strong jump shift in action here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I like it|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: in imps you must lead spades best chance to get them down|pg||
nt|haans: time to pass|pg||
nt|xenya: vulnerable, i would sell out here|pg||
nt|sharkey: 5@C = One key card?|pg||
mb|6S|nt|rnmalik: N would like it be a declarer in 6 NT, protecting K@C|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not very fashionable here any more though|pg||
nt|sybarra: we may play 6 @D?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: with a puppet sequence Hughes may have thought the club was better |pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: looks as if @D are agreed |pg||
nt|rnmalik: except @H|pg||
nt|yo_yo: need to get that suit right ...|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont see S setting NT  given the qx of clubs|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah but he will|pg||
nt|rnmalik: on this bidding I think it would be 6@S|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no, agree shirley|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: many americans say S was not good enough for x + suit only simple overcall|pg||
nt|xenya: S feels more optimistic -- and perhaps he is right|pg||
pc|cA|nt|yo_yo: ooops now North has to think|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he didnt give correct reply if @S is meant|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont see where @S's agreed however|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no |pg||
pc|c2|nt|chthonic: Might have played a club at trick two to prevent third trump lead, maintaining control|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|haans: no gain in finesse sorry|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|yo_yo: Vorster took control then didnt know what to do, it seems to me|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rnmalik: qx@C became threat cards|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sybarra: maybe should have tried4 @S over 4 @D wonder if that would have helped?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i think if you blackwood, you have to go for it|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk4: How did 5@CX make on board 1?|pg||
nt|haans: S decarded a hearts on clubs|pg||

mb|p|nt|chthonic: Will EW contest the NS heart partscore is the main question here -- or will NS bid game?  Lots of quacks in the south hand.|pg||
nt|sybarra: any one could get in trouble here|pg||

mb|3D|nt|xenya: 1N EW?|pg||

nt|haans: had been my choice 2|pg||
nt|chthonic: Game NS can be beaten in a couple of ways, but it may make if defense leads a diamond against 4H -- |pg||
nt|sharkey: If she leads trumps twice W can play 3rd trump when in with @H|pg||
mb|4S|nt|haans: sort of must|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: will North give a suit pref signal?|pg||

nt|yo_yo: that's not such a high @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|chthonic: but against 3N, a spade lead is best|pg||

nt|rnmalik: as the cards are placed 4@C+2@D+1@S=7|pg||
nt|ralfwil: that´s OK but perhaps there is a penalty situation|pg||
pc|c3|nt|haans: slam very easy with clubs lead|pg||

nt|haans: 1@S in Acol?|pg||
nt|haans: all is quiet|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In my opinion a too strong hand for only 3@d. looks like partner has a 6-card suit and..|pg||
nt|newmoon: previous hand, West can perhaps choose 3@S first time?|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|sharkey: Kib suggests W shud bid 3@S - making it easy on E.  perhaps - not sure after pd's NV overcall and only 3 trumps.  Overbid?|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|sybarra: penunltimate bd.   here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: that´s an aspect for a possible 3nt|pg||

nt|newmoon: c u Carl  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: the good suit is what would make me do it|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|chthonic: Even a 2S bid should elicit a rais|pg||

nt|xenya: why didn't S open 1N i wonder|pg||
nt|haans: vul?|pg||

pc|h6|nt|chthonic: oh, my|pg||
nt|chthonic: a hand that was borderline opening passes?|pg||
nt|mcphee: good grief batman|pg||
nt|newmoon: in the OR East bid 2@D, thinking transfers were on after a balancing NT|pg||
nt|newmoon: Eber/Stephens not a regular pair|pg||
pc|h3|nt|xenya: ah vulnerable -- i see|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||
nt|mcphee: N just has too good a hand to pass 2@D in my book|pg||

nt|newmoon: pass is logical, yes|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|newmoon: but with Jx in partner's 5-card suit, South could make a false preference over 2@D/2@H rebids|pg||

pc|c2|pc|h5|pc|s4|pc|c7|pg||

nt|othered1: 3 or 4 NT or game in @C looks good here, with 5@Cmost likely|pg||

nt|othered1: North has a good-looking hand in context, but no easy bid.  5@C seems normal.|pg||

mb|3N|nt|jcwla: W's nice play of 3@H on 17 has paid off to the tune of 5 IMPs when the same contract failed by one in the OR, while W in the OR managed two extra overtricks in 1@C on 18 for a gain ...|pg||

nt|fann4: 3@C on a flat 7 count with 4 trumps looks terrible.|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 3@S effective bid|pg||

nt|haans: right bid now not later|pg||

mb|2C|nt|lestergold: hi all Mike Gold here from England sorry a little late folks|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi, Mike. |pg||
nt|bobh1: when people start baby psyching again, which carries its own dangers, then the pendulum may swing the other way|pg||
nt|fann4: It went for 500|pg||
nt|newmoon: 6@H not 6@S, but will they... ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: On Board 19, 3NT a better contract and 4@S does not make with that play here.|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi shirley|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hi Jordan hi Rashid|pg||
nt|haans: NS do not have it easy|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt down due to @SK|pg||
mb|2H|nt|rnmalik: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|petergill: The Italian superstars do not overcall 2@C or 2@D on 5332 shapes; most of the rest of the world seems to do so, however. |pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Or @C:) For S he find pards second color by bidding 3@C asking over the lebensol, but might 3@S was ok anyway|pg||
nt|fann4: The 'baby psyche' is so rare, and how can you worry about it on this hand.|pg||
nt|haans: i have done some this year very good effect|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think people stopped baby psyching for other reasons|pg||
mb|2N|nt|jcwla: 4@D and then we're off to the races.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: LOL   S will be sorry if he doubles 4S|pg||
nt|haans: killing now?|pg||
nt|haans: penalty x rare nowdays|pg||
nt|newmoon: what should west do ?|pg||
nt|bobh1: like sometimes their partners took them seriously|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: i dont think 3D was a wise move|pg||
nt|newmoon: East may pull to 3@H...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: his pd either has a pile of clubs or a bad hand, or both. and meanwhile he likes spades as a trump suit. why bid 3D??|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4@S X for 100 out Marshall?|pg||
nt|newmoon: or is NORTH thinking of 3@H?   lol|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S doubled for 790|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N has trivially easy pass|pg||
nt|haans: belladonna tended to double for take out|pg||
nt|haans: one reason none will play with you|pg||
nt|fann4: 4@C shows 2 suits - that and trumps. a better use than a splinter|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 6 nt best i think|pg||
nt|newmoon: many pairs bid an obligatory 2@D with North, and a positive with 2 of top 3 honours.   Here, 2@H certainly is the answer|pg||
mb|4N|nt|petergill: NS are overboard|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i wd bid only 2@D with the N hand Sid|pg||
mb|p|mb|6N|nt|lestergold: well 6S laydown and only depends on spades splitting 1/1 is that simply close to 50%?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: easy 6 missed|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: no we are off to the chicken exit|pg||
nt|rodal f: Unlucky @C spot for EW but not unwaited by the bidding. 3NT to come?|pg||
nt|newmoon: it is not North that is hesitating... N and E on same side of screen|pg||
nt|othered1: But playing double as saying only "I would have happily made that bid myself" still has lots of merit -- opponents who play "natural over doubles," 1@S forcing, might have xxxx|pg||
nt|fann4: Well bid by N, as 4@Hx is only 1 off.|pg||
nt|newmoon: ok - 6NT here we come... cold also|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 3NT had some chance. East has discarding problems on the diamonds in 3NT, and might end up endplayed by the 3rd club. |pg||
nt|bobh1: yes if double is responsive then 2@s has to be natural|pg||
nt|rodal f: And 4@S 1 of since @SQ982 make 1 trick?|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S show five spades in my book|pg||
nt|fann4: 4@S is not cold, but I'd rather be there than defending 4@H|pg||
mb|p|pc|cT|nt|newmoon: quick claim  :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|othered1: declarer had best get the @S right, or EW will find the @C ruff.  And declarer knows that from the auction.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lestergold: or Kx spads onside but you have to guess|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|hK|nt|newmoon: now he will definitely play to @S8|pg||
nt|fann4: Needs a 3-2 trump break or play the 4@H bidder for @H shortage|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: on blaance I think i want tro be in thism slam|pg||
nt|petergill: No, I was wrong, 3NT will always fail, as Hans said|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1@S u mean. Same here. A neg X would have been better. 4@S - 3@C|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rodal f: Will be hard for S|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h6|nt|fann4: going down now|pg||
pc|h8|nt|rnmalik: Why not 4@D as suggested by Jordan, W does not lose anything|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, on 20, the difference between playing the @H9 and the @HQ was 14 IMPs.  3NT making vs. -3.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|marlowepi: hard? not harder than the hard-headed bidding:)|pg||
nt|petergill: East simply has to retain 2 spades to beat 3NT|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h7|nt|rodal f: :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Should declarer have gotten that right after west showed length in two suits?|pg||

mb|5C|nt|lestergold: by conservative i mean inviting with 3S|pg||
nt|jcwla: That was on 21.|pg||
nt|petergill: With screens, we see N and E's bids simultaneously, so the pause for thought would be East before the Dbl, not North|pg||

nt|marlowepi: why not reopen with X? X seems normal|pg||
nt|rodal f: Would have prefered an X Marshall:)|pg||
nt|newmoon: and also shows a trap pass with game values|pg||

mb|4D|nt|othered1: Why is 7@S good, fishing for @DQ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: or ruffing |pg||
nt|newmoon: undo|pg||
mb|4H|nt|petergill: Scores after 2 rounds at http://www.sabf.co.za/interprov/log2m.htm. This is Round 3|pg||
nt|bobh1: its good because it makes :)|pg||
nt|fann4: No not KC. just a sort of mark time bid as W feels he is too strong to sign off in 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: should be to play, don't know what they are playing|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this is not likely to make|pg||
nt|fann4: 3 key cards|pg||
nt|haans: AKJxxx do not need the Q|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: But this board still. Would it be unnormal to find KQX@S and a single @H at S?|pg||
nt|newmoon: I do not understand.  3@C promises 4@Hs?   East showing 6-5 or 5-5 good hand now|pg||
pc|sT|nt|bobh1: from E's point of view bringing the @ds home is at worst a finesse|pg||
nt|haans: 0 3|pg||
nt|haans: good old style|pg||
nt|bobh1: he doesn't know his pard has 3 small|pg||
nt|haans: 5@S-6@S-7@S|pg||
nt|bobh1: the worst holding he could have|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|haans: what?|pg||
nt|fann4: right. AKJxxx will only pose a problem opposite xxx|pg||
pc|sA|nt|haans: nor me|pg||
nt|bobh1: could this be 0 or 3 confusion?|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|othered1: but picking up that suit, prima facie, is only about 58 percent, and north's bid make make that lower.|pg||
nt|haans: 4nt mean = if you had 3 or 4 rebid|pg||
nt|fann4: It shouldn't have been. 4@D was surely forward-going in some way, else he'd have signed off in 4@S.|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think if W has 3 he is supposed to go on on this auction|pg||
pc|d3|nt|othered1: And another reason for 7@S to be silly, is thqt the opponents mightn't bid small slam, in which case you need a much better play for 7|pg||
nt|haans: Bosenberg - Eber big name from SA 4th in Bermuda Bowl 2007 |pg||

nt|bobh1: if he had shown a strong hand, maybe not|pg||
nt|fann4: I suppose E was expecting W to continue with 3 key cards.|pg||
nt|haans: i say that is a MUST|pg||
nt|rodal f: @D 2-2=40,7%       3-1 and 1-3=49,7%        4-0 and 0-4=9,6% so odd on for 7@S if EW know they have 9: http://www.bridgehands.com/P/Probability_of_Card_Distribution.htm|pg||
nt|bobh1: here he had shown nothing so if his pd is bidding blackwood, 3 KCs must be enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: odds for 2 diamonds in dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: OR started with bds 27-28, so we now have comparisons|pg||
nt|othered1: Just add that to the annals of good pairs having trouble with key card Blackwood.  |pg||
nt|fann4: Of course you would want to be in a grand after the 4@D bid - it would mostly have the @DQ|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|lestergold: is 2D meant to be weak intermediate or strong?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: intermediate|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|lestergold: on normal methods North has a good one diamond overcall much too good for a weak|pg||
nt|rodal f: And a push to come|pg||
nt|fann4: You can look at that disaster from different angles - but what did E think the 4@D bid meant.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|newmoon: 4@C pre-accept,  now 4@H = retransfer|pg||
nt|petergill: Weide chose the old-fashioned style of doubling first; the other East followed the more modern tendency to overcall one's long suit first with about 16 points|pg||
nt|fann4: From West|pg||
mb|3H|nt|rnmalik: agree|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4H depends on spade K onside plus only one heart loser a bit less than 50% and today its sadly zero percent|pg||
nt|rodal f: Again I will follow ORDER. 3@S. What if W was by 0 honors. 4@C????|pg||
nt|bobh1: i blame West|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|lestergold: not unreasonable to bid i think quite normal the clubs and diamonds well duiplicated here|pg||
nt|newmoon: or pass = re-transfer|pg||
nt|haans: maybe spades are spades :)|pg||
nt|haans: what do you think it did mean?|pg||
nt|fann4: From West's viewpoint, despite the splinter they could have been off 2 key cards.|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: weak hand for 4@C|pg||
nt|haans: in love|pg||
nt|rodal f: Vug might can tell. I have no idea:) |pg||
nt|bobh1: his partner couldn't have a blackwood bid with no keycards|pg||
nt|fann4: It was surely some slam interest, else 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: The more modern style is intended to cope better with those modern opponents who sometimes preempt you if you double |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: yes not fair|pg||
nt|newmoon: KZN will bid all the games in sight now, after that missed slam|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|jcwla: Well, opposite passed partner, there is something to be said for 2@D.  Makes opps' auctions more difficult -- though all roads lead to 4@H here.|pg||
nt|haans: right|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|rodal f: Full speed. No first controll in @C but have @D que pard:)|pg||
nt|petergill: If @HK is played here, a club switch is needed|pg||
nt|petergill: I meant "if @HA at Trick"|pg||
pc|c2|nt|newmoon: 4-card majors, I suspect       West would drury otherwise over 1@H|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|haans: got that|pg||
pc|c7|nt|haans: he should have gone strat for Blackwwod|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|petergill: NS give count  usually|pg||
nt|newmoon: or rather, 4-card @H|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|nt|jcwla: Right, I agree and would bid 1@D in std methods.|pg||
nt|haans: strait|pg||
pc|s4|pc|d6|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes its a standard tactic but North's hand is the kind which can make game opposite  a passed partner- look how little ios needed|pg||
nt|haans: sloppy|pg||
nt|petergill: so North thinks South has 3 or 5 @Ds|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c9|nt|bobh1: 4@d was a meaningless bid...he just wanted to mention that he had support for the suit E had opened|pg||
nt|othered1: I must go.  Thanks all and bye|pg||
nt|rodal f: By Ed|pg||
nt|fann4: One shouldn't make meaningless bids, and he didn't. |pg||
nt|haans: Bye Ed|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bobh1: W had shown nothing; all he did was respond to 1@d, which players sometimes do on virtual yarboroughs|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|lestergold: i mean Ks q dim to three or fourand a stiff club for example|pg||
nt|jcwla: A third overtrick in 3NT (not 6@D) on 25 means 1 to Western Province to within 8 with 3 comparisons to come.|pg||
nt|rodal f: I'm might a bit hard, but here have been many funny bids:)|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|nt|fann4: Though as Ed said, put it down to another Keycard disaster. Could West really expect pard to have zero key cards?|pg||
nt|bobh1: it was meaningless in the sense that it didn't show a SI|pg||
nt|haans: all the more reason for 5@S-6@S-7@S|pg||
nt|fann4: West did not say nothing. he bid 1@S and then 4@D.4@D is not nothing. 4@S is nothing.|pg||
nt|haans: that would have been a bidding to remember|pg||
nt|bobh1: 4@d doesn't show a great hand|pg||
nt|fann4: Yes it does|pg||
nt|bobh1: it just shows a few @ds|pg||
nt|fann4: No it doesn't - not in my book anyhow.|pg||
nt|bobh1: so you think it's a slam try?|pg||
pc|h3|pc|cK|pg||
nt|newmoon: certainly n/s play 4-card @H|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|nt|fann4: You sign off in trumps when not interested in anything.|pg||
nt|haans: very old Acol,4@D was a natural slam try|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|fann4: I said so earlier, and have no doubt about it.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|petergill: East also was taken in by the false count card|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: time for a biltung break if your teeth are up to it|pg||

nt|rodal f: A puppet would have been good to have for EW now, but they don't use it|pg||
nt|haans: not that easy to bid|pg||
nt|newmoon: tough one to get to tho.   will East start with 2@C or 4NT?|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt looks like a good contract hard to get there|pg||
nt|fann4: It could be a great hand for that series in the American Bridge World ' Whose to blame?'|pg||

nt|newmoon: 3rd-hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|haans: or strongh raise in spades after stayman|pg||
nt|rodal f: Lucky layout in @H. 3NT are a better contract|pg||
