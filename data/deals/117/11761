mb|1H|mb|2N!|nt|fabsayc: a lisence to overbid?|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: i came across this phenomenon at brazil-players keenly watching the 'trend' of the dealing m/c and using it|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|p|mb|3H!|nt|fabsayc: i have used it too, but mostly when hands seem to break badly|pg||
mb|d|mb|5D|nt|psridhar: for eg when 2nt unusual is bid one tends to assume 5-5 -a shrewd observer will bet it is 6-5 today and use that info|pg||
nt|vugraphzxp: dealing machine is supposed to be random?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: definitely!|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|psridhar: i hv no idea -but i notice certai trends in dealing|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: not all dealing machines are as random as they should be|pg||
nt|psridhar: the trend was definitely visible in brazil-many players discussed it|pg||
pc|dK|nt|fabsayc: the one that produces the most wild hands is the Norwegian dealer (after the programmer)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|psridhar: meanwhile S here seems to hv stretched to 5h- perhaps 3h-X showed more h?|pg||

nt|psridhar: it is difficult for me to believe the dealing m/c deals at random-after the last 4X10 deals at brazil produced about 50 singeltons in all|pg||

nt|psridhar: the previous one :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well you can not really speak of odds over a short stretch of boards|pg||
mb|1N|nt|fabsayc: then it becomes like all coincidences|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d!|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: but if it persists over 1000's of hands, then it shows something wrong, such as the seed number is periodic and hence does not produce random numbers|pg||
mb|2C|an|r|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|psridhar: the point i am making is- an experienced smartie...on seeing the 2nd time 7 card suit, will expect twice more (say) and gain over his competitor ?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|psridhar: in such a short match |pg||
nt|fabsayc: periodic meaning in this sense that it repeats hands before all 635 billion possibilities can be reached|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar: good auction|pg||
