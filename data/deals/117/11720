mb|p|nt|psridhar: on the natural dia lead, w may shift to spd and get spd ruff for d2|pg||

pc|dT|nt|psridhar: that deuce of spd lead from 842 is becoming popular ( when the leader has not supported )-can make both declarer and partner guess though|pg||
nt|dslee: 1 IMP loss for finton|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||

mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar: cruel 4h - depends on trump guess , i think % play is to finesse for queen with West- catering to aqx as well; but fails here|pg||
mb|p|nt|dslee: i would have made some noise at least|pg||
pc|c3|nt|dslee: not a pass |pg||
nt|dslee: P, what would be your reaction as South?|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|c6|pg||
pc|h2|nt|dslee: anyways, money back to my pocket again :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: though it is a matter of partnership style , opening weak 2h on tht hand at fav vul is not my choice|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
nt|psridhar: i agree with dudh's pass|pg||
nt|tcpant: No after 2@H (NV) opening I don't think noise will be made... It is simple pass|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|pc|h5|pc|hA|pg||

nt|tcpant: Yes I agree... There can be 3 straight losers in Spades itself... |pg||
mb|1D!|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar: the system of opening 2d with poor weak 2 and 2M opg as clasical helps on bd 9|pg||
mb|p|pc|sK|nt|dslee: yes :) but that too old a system P:)|pg||
nt|psridhar: many play it in inida|pg||
nt|dslee: can let you miss a lot of derailments by your opps|pg||
nt|psridhar: spd king a swingy lead -losing tricks here|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s7|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dT|nt|tcpant: Most people don't play it that way... if they play 2D as Multi (inclusive of Weak 2 in majors) play 2H & 2S as Tartan ...|pg||
nt|psridhar: finton knows his pd has values ( opp hv subsided in 1nt) and didnt overcall 1s ...so spd king lead seems incorrect|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|dslee: yes indeed, if you ask finton to why he did, he will have an answer, VG, if you can find it out for us, it will be interesting|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s2|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|pc|c7|pc|c2|pg||
pc|d9|nt|tcpant: Well who are part of Indian Bridge Circuit knows it well that Finton Lewis always likes to do something "different" than the usual stuff.. Here is one of his tries|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h5|pc|h8|pg||
nt|psridhar: often he succeeds ...intelligent that he is :)|pg||
nt|dslee: and if you confront him TC, he will have multiple answers and all of it is so interesting|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c4|pc|sQ|pc|s8|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|h7|pg||
nt|tcpant: For him 33% success is also OK if playin on VG... :):);)|pg||

mb|p|nt|psridhar: kamal may opt for 1nt|pg||

nt|tcpant: Yes he will open 1NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzxp: sry board placed wrongly biding started will give you final con :(|pg||
nt|dslee: again for the benefit of the viewers, you have P as a commentator, there is a lot to know and learn from him, please mark him as a friend if you want to get a real view of the game|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|d|mb|3C|nt|tcpant: So kamalda has downgraded the @DJ|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|psridhar: dbl?? i understand it is finton but even then ...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar: perhaps south and north hands interchanged?|pg||
nt|tcpant: A bit confusing op|pg||
nt|vugraphzxp: finton having s hand|pg||
nt|dslee: this is pure trademark P:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxp: board misplaed|pg||
nt|tcpant: OK so Finton has the South hand|pg||
nt|dslee: ahhh - least a justification|pg||
nt|tcpant: At least down 2|pg||
nt|vugraphzxp: play too fast|pg||
nt|psridhar: the swingy style is not advised at imps; may be at MP it may work on your lucky day...definitely not at imps|pg||

nt|tcpant: Yes 2C making would have fetched 110 to EW but this could have gone down for -300 for 4 IMPs loss|pg||
