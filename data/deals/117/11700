nt|kit: I wouldn't be surprised to see the result duplicated|pg||
nt|janm: It was North in the other room who pushed to 5@s over 5@h, but probably the vul vs not Michaels hand figured to have extra values or shape|pg||
nt|kit: passing isn't a legal option on the South hand IMO|pg||
nt|janm: North deciding between 4@h and 4@s?|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|kit: This should be a pretty easy slam to bid -- nice hand opposite a 2@C opener|pg||
nt|janm: Another strong 2@c opening for NS - S this time|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|janm: We speculated that 2@c-2@h was a control response last time, but that seems to have been wrong - don't know what it was or what 2@d is here (except maybe semi-automatic?)|pg||
nt|kit: apparently some kind of puppet Stayman?|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Dejavu on the commentary |pg||
mb|5C|nt|janm: I'm told that the 2@d response is either a very bad hand (0-2 or maybe 0-4) or 10+ here we're seeing the 10+|pg||
nt|kit: note that this isn't a good hand for 1430, as no room to ask for queen after 5@D response|pg||
nt|kit: Of course, if you sensibly play that 4@S is the RKC bid it all becomes moot|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|bjacobs: Naturally!|pg||
nt|janm: If 4@d asked S for his Major, why wouldn't 4@s be keycard, thus giving them an extra step?|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|nt|janm: Sorry, slow!|pg||
nt|kit: some prefer 4NT to be RKC and 4@S a Q-bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|nt|kit: this probably shows queen of hearts and king of clubs|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: 30 years ago my partner of the time: "after you've agreed a suit and forced to game, next step is Blackwood" ... he was ahead of his time, I reckon|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|janm: Sure was!|pg||
nt|kit: Now, which is safer?  Heart finesse, or ace and a heart|pg||
nt|bjacobs: There was a famous auction (I've simplified it): 1@S-4@C(splinter), double from the opps, pass:  Alert!!|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Explained: "that pass is Blackwood"|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|nt|kit: Not totally obvious -- might be stiff lead and Kx of hearts onside, or hearts might be 5-0 onside|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
nt|janm: The auction was essentially duplicated in the other room, although S chose to open 2NT instead of opening 2@c and rebidding 2NT, so maybe our feeling that 4@s "should" be KCB isn't ...|pg||

nt|janm: Another 2@c opener for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Anyone care to predict the response to 2@C? :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|kit: This slam might not be so easy to get to -- you don't have a situation where one partner can do it all on his own|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|janm: 2@h showing 4-9 or something like that. This is a hand where controls would be useful in response - after 2@c and a 3 control response, N would know he had 12 and probably not 13 ...|pg||
nt|janm: tricks|pg||
mb|2N|nt|kit: how would North know there were 12 tricks?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|janm: Hmmm - so 2@h must be 3-6 and 2@d 7-9?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|janm: I'm told that 2@s showed 7-9 and also was a transfer|pg||
nt|bjacobs: to what?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|an|cue|nt|kit: The problem here, as is so often the case in a standard structure, is that the weak hand has to take control with inadequate information|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: I don't know, and the 2NT bid sounds as if maybe 2@s was just 7-9. Then 3@c = Puppet and 3@s showed the 5 card suit|pg||
nt|kit: These auctions flow a lot smoother with strong hand as captain|pg||
nt|janm: And I still think that if S had been able to show 3 controls in response to 2@c life would have been easier for N|pg||
nt|kit: Fortunately, North has enough goodies that he can just drive it to slam after the 4@H Q-bid|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's a somewhat iffy slam|pg||
nt|kit: of course it would, Jan -- it tells the strong hand something of value|pg||
nt|janm: Doesn't need much more than 3-2 trumps, does it?|pg||
nt|kit: looks like a pretty good slam to me -- virtually cold if club hook on, and plenty of play if off|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|kit: no Jan, 4th round of diamonds a problem (well, not if Qxx comes down)|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Well obviously no one is hooking the diamonds, like I probably do :)|pg||
nt|kit: I doubt if diamond finesse is percentage play here|pg||
nt|janm: Will likely be able to ruff the 4th diamond? Oh maybe not, because it might get over-ruffed. OK, I still think it's going to make most of the time that trumps split - lots of ...|pg||
nt|janm: chances|pg||
nt|kit: if Qxxx onside, which is only way it really gains, then no problem ruffing 2 diamonds in short hand|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzzr: Robinson puts down half his hand, screen mate peake: 'Aren't you playing it?'|pg||
pc|c5|nt|janm: Back to the (tortured) auction - I guess that 4@h showed A or K (obviously N knew K) and also some spade support. N asked for keycards and was rewarded when S had the spade A|pg||
nt|kit: unlucky -- get lead through strong hand --|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|janm: :) - it's always funny when a surprising hand is declarer!|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|kit: I don't think Robinson thinks its funny after trick 1|pg||
nt|janm: So much for the club finesse - now we'll see what he thinks is the right way to play diamonds|pg||
pc|s4|nt|janm: Well, he was likely to want to take the club finesse anyway|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Kit is clearly right - the % play is to play diamonds from the top|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Of course, this trump switch might make that more doubtful|pg||
nt|kit: he was always taking the club finesse, but still would rather have what might be a favorable minor-suit lead up to the strong hand|pg||
nt|kit: this trump shift actually gives declarer a big problem -- if he plays low and 9 forces king, now he can't afford to ruff 2 diamonds in dummy|pg||
nt|kit: If he goes up ace, he has to worry about short diamondhand having jack of spades|pg||
nt|kit: so now he must might conclude that diamond finesse is best -- I don't know.  Got a lot more complicated.|pg||
nt|janm: But if he plays low he won't be able to ruff 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yeah, it's an iffy slam :)|pg||
nt|janm: :)|pg||
nt|kit: from the South side :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, they had to bid it, otherwise it's 12 away, but I rather think it's gonna be 14 away|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 11 or 14|pg||

mc|11|nt|bjacobs: I think we must all agree that Arjuna did the right thing there.  There was even an element of Restricted Choice on the opening lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: With low cards in both minors, West might have chosen a diamond lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Sorry, Ian|pg||
nt|kit: no, I don't agree -- many squeeze possibilities I think make up for gain from diamond finesse|pg||
nt|janm: Unlucky both to play from the wrong side and have East find the trump shift|pg||

nt|janm: North has certainly had a lot of good hands this set!|pg||

mb|4S|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|kit: The light opening bid makes a big difference here -- East won't stay quiet|pg||
nt|janm: Always interesting what a difference the start of the auction makes - W's choice to open 1@d instead of passing has changed the tempo and feel here. |pg||
nt|kit: South won't do anything I don't think, so it is up to North to compete to 5@S himself|pg||
nt|janm: Precision players often open light, but opening 1@d is less attractive than 1M|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|6C|nt|bjacobs: You were right Kit - a 5@S bid was found :)|pg||
nt|kit: what is 5@S?  Seems like a mixup, thinking 4NT was RKC?|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: and another 13|pg||
mb|1D|nt|kiwibridge: and hits the lead as well with another 10|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure about that frank--i think he took the right line in that slam. if his RHO has Qxxx of diamonds, it will be safe to ruff twice in dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: 59-0 and there is more to come - really sad|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|kiwibridge: its 59 zip this set as we thank Erin for a great job on the vugraph|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|vugraphzzs: on a non heart lead 3nt makes lots of tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|marlowepi: bravo !! champagne for Erin !!|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzs: :) thanks|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Frank and Marshall its been a pleasure to be with you, and our great specs have kept us on out toes|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzzs: kanetkar may take the jack now but de livera will get in with club and send one back|pg||
nt|vugraphzzs: is this a slam hand?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|frankaus: last board this set, tu for your company  shirley, gary and kibs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, EW had another opportunity here|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: there may be the final set in 1 hour... we will have to wait and see|pg||
nt|frankaus: tu marshall, gary kibs for ur company|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|nt|kiwibridge: last board here, a short break and we'll be back for set 2, thanks Erin on the vugraph, great job|pg||
nt|vugraphzzs: if one person in a partnership is a timid mouse, the other one needs to be wild to make up for it|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d2|nt|vugraphzzs: he can only take 8 tricks without clubs|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||
pc|d4|nt|wilson69: 6 times d and a spade!|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|nt|sybarra2: thx all  cu for next set|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|vugraphzzs: 6 diamonds, 1 spade and 1 heart|pg||
nt|vugraphzzs: oh and the club ace, oops|pg||
nt|vugraphzzs: are you a commentator?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|marlowepi: 6D close to laydown3N a lazy bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzzs: here we have two mice|pg||
pc|h9|pc|dT|pc|s4|pg||
nt|frankaus: fine operating erin |pg||
nt|vugraphzzs: restart 11.15 or perhaps earlier if all are ready|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thx shirley, frank and specs, a nice interesting set|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: other room have 3 to play|pg||
nt|vugraphzzs: he still needs to guess whether east has the ace of spades or the king of clubs|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|s6|pc|c4|pc|s3|pg||
nt|wilson69: gotta be nine now i think|pg||
nt|vugraphzzs: but you can count points - if west has AQ @H, K @C J @D J @S, that's only 11 points, so he probaby has the ace of spades|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s7|nt|frankaus: their style has got thenm to the top - i cant see them changing|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s5|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h2|nt|wilson69: must have the ace.. |pg||
pc|c8|pc|h7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a lot depends on agreements about the 2D call n that auction, so maybe not easy for E to bid 3D with only 3 of them. but surely 3S was easy over 2N|pg||
pc|s8|nt|vugraphzzs: but east threw his hearts|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sK|pc|sT|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|h6|pg||
pc|hT|nt|vugraphzzs: well im sure if he hadn't thrown his hearts, declarer would have played a spade|pg||
pc|s9|nt|wilson69: yes im sure to.. totaly count there|pg||
nt|vugraphzzs: restart is at 2 o'clock|pg||
nt|vugraphzzs: that's an hour and five minutes for non-eastern australians|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h8|pg||
mc|10|nt|vugraphzzs: well that's it for this set, the other table is quite slow and looks to have a few boards left. Play will resume when everyone is ready.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: if they feel up to continuing that is :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzs: Probably around fifteen minutes from now.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 5 to go other table|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: was supposed to be 50 mins from now|pg||
