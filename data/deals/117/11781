pc|cA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|bagman:  This was playing against the odds|pg||
nt|kaapo: Osmo and Timo are from Oulu, Northern-Finland, as is Seppo, so you should know these guys well|pg||
nt|bagman:  Should have played the T, if that loses, she has fluid entry position in clubs|pg||
nt|zebutin: im just hoping they dont get too nervous playing under the vugraph lights... |pg||
nt|bagman:  according to the law of restricted choice there is a much bigger chance that the @CQ is singleton than it is from QJ doubleton|pg||
nt|bagman:  She has still time to attack the spades|pg||
nt|kaapo: The Elsinens as well as Koistinen - Nyberg have lots of experience playing on vugraph. They might get some advantage playing here|pg||

nt|kaapo: We should have a very interesting round coming soon|pg||
nt|kaapo: Elsinen - Elsinen will continue here|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|d|nt|kaapo: After that they've been playing much better, and we can hope to see a good performance in their second visit here|pg||
mb|3H|mb|4S|nt|kaapo: So Kari Noponen (W) - Mikko Toivonen (E) vs Antti (N) and Tiina (S)|pg||
mb|5H|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kaapo: EW play 5-card majors with some cadgets of their own|pg||

pc|dA|nt|bagman:  North happy to X with his defensive hand|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dJ|pc|d5|pg||

pc|c6|pc|s5|pc|s8|pc|h8|pg||
pc|dK|pc|hK|nt|kaapo: Noponen would likely lead the singleton club against a spade contract and then should be able to lead away from @HAQJ to get the ruff|pg||

nt|kaapo: So this might be an OK board too for the leaders|pg||
nt|bagman:  W was afraid that N had AQ bare of spades and there was diamond ruff coming|pg||
nt|kaapo: So it seems quite safe to congratulate Antti and Tiina Elsinen for winning the pairs champs 2009|pg||
nt|bagman:  that woud have been so deep game that defenders require to set the contract|pg||
nt|cenglund: That would have been to far-fetched defence|pg||
nt|bagman:  Especially there was a legitimate play to beat it|pg||
nt|kaapo: More vugraph action still to come today, from India and England|pg||
nt|kaapo: Full schedule is it http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||

nt|kaapo: But we try to announce them here at the table too|pg||
nt|cenglund: I suppose the winners won by a substantial margin|pg||
nt|cenglund: They played wery well when I watching, but this did not go for the opposition who were very, very generous|pg||
nt|kaapo: Elsinens have played good bridge throughout the tourney, with just small mistakes|pg||
nt|bagman:  to win this tournament one needs to play well and be a bit lucky|pg||
nt|cenglund: In pairs competrition like this you need also tailwind to win, usually good play is not enough|pg||
nt|bagman:  because if you are only playing well there is always a pair both playing well and being lucky|pg||
nt|kaapo: and we have the results! Congrats Antti and Tiina Elsinen! http://bridgefinland.com/sm/pari09/results/35.html|pg||
nt|kaapo: Matti Niemi - Jorma Valta second|pg||
