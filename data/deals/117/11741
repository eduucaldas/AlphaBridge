nt|doctorone: maybe S knowing N isnt holding a 4 cards major may take the decision and bid 5@d ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If partner is loaded in hearts, 3NT would work fine for Bell now. If he is not, 4@D is a better call|pg||

nt|roswolf: slamtime perhaps|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hi Roland hi Geoff|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I believe it's Hassett|pg||
nt|athene: this sort of hand is why the 2NT opener is a real "slam killer"|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hin Bill|pg||
nt|athene: south knows that all depends on what his partner has wasted in hearts|pg||
nt|athene: hi|pg||
nt|lestergold: Price and Simpson world senior champs|pg||

nt|athene: but there just isn't the room to find everything out|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h6|nt|athene: what makes these problems worse is that when you play 3NT with a shortage, and it's wrong (partner has little in the short suit), not only do you miss slam, but you frequently go ...|pg||
nt|athene: down in 3nt :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: i have a geneneral agreement that after a strong 2nt you can always stop in 4nt if you try for a minor suit slam|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h7|nt|andyv:  S being very timid with his hand|pg||

nt|athene: NS should reach 4@S here|pg||
mb|1C|nt|vugraphzyx: multi again|pg||
mb|1H|nt|rodal f: Multi again|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s should win part score battle hee|pg||
nt|athene: not many points but they do have a 5-4 spade fit and a bit of shape and that's all you need|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|rodal f: Bit funny to see what will happen in a @C contract at EW|pg||
nt|andyv:  same in OR... now S bid 4@h (p/c) and W bid 4@s|pg||
nt|lestergold: itll probabbly subside at 3S|pg||
nt|lestergold: may well go off|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: it would be much better played by north (heart lead) but even then you would have to guess the trumps to make four|pg||
mb|3H|nt|rodal f: Seems as W killed that possebility|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: double game-try|pg||
nt|athene: since he has no room and 3@S would be merely competitive|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  and E will run|pg||
nt|rodal f: By the X it seems Y|pg||
mb|4H|nt|andyv:  question is 4@c or 3N?|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps north could try 3nt now? :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  wow|pg||
nt|andyv:  faith in pd|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rodal f: In a way I liked Es pass. I trust u pard it tells|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: well gonna be heard for Bill to pick up the pesky spade J in 3 never mind 4|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks too high|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: In my view Hasset 's bid is the wildest Ive seen so far|pg||
nt|athene: the club layout is nice |pg||
nt|lestergold: he has 6 of his lousy weak no trump points in oppos suit|pg||
nt|athene: so he just has to guess trumps to make|pg||
nt|roswolf: they bid them up in the north!:)|pg||
nt|athene: north has one big extra value which is his fourth trump|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but he doesnt desfrve to make it and i think he wont where will he get the clues to the spade layout|pg||
nt|athene: if 2@S over 2@H might have been on only 3 spades|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h5|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes the fourth spade is plus but the rest is minus|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|pc|sQ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|athene: but declarer has no reason to play east for long spades|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: and i avoided the curse!!|pg||
nt|roswolf: west's bid may be a straw in the wind|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: you assume the hearts are 6-3 so that makes west the firm favourite to have three spades|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: so totally normal to play to the @SQ|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
nt|andyv:  It could be right... but i would tend to trust opps (if reliable) to not dbl into game unless they can beat it at least 2 tricks|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c5|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|c8|nt|andyv:  W could have waited and bid after NS conclude their auction... that might make the @s bid sound less substantial|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h4|pc|s8|pc|h2|pg||

nt|roswolf: another thin game possible here|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Not many loosers, but winners tell me 3NT or 4@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: this one is a little better- on an average day you would lose a heart and a club and be on a diamond guess to make|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lestergold: today its a better than average day|pg||

nt|rodal f: Y. But change the @Cs|pg||

nt|lestergold: but this game is likely to bid in open|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|d3|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would certainly hope so|pg||
nt|athene: the problem with cashing @HAK is, if the suit breaks 4-1, the defence might be able to draw two more rounds of trumps when in with the @CA|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is the Premier League|pg||
nt|athene: but on the other hand you don't really want to risk club ruffs|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might try a club to the @CK, trying to persuade the defence to release the @CA early|pg||
nt|lestergold: with the helpful lead declarer wuill be able to take some precautions against a 4/1 break|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think that subterfuge should deceive west though|pg||
nt|athene: north can't really have a singleton club, given his 3NT bid|pg||
pc|h4|nt|roswolf: true but this is a simple hand|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
nt|rodal f: Anyway the % for all contracts are a bit shaky|pg||

mb|1S|nt|doctorone: Pass by Victor?? Is this true? |pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: He opened a 10 count ealy, now 12 is not enough for him|pg||

nt|jtr: rather pass than open 1@h even playing 4 card majors|pg||
nt|doctorone: and it is rather a good 12 I think |pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: Opening 1@H is   "!&%!!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Do they still recommend that in Acol?|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|doctorone: & % $ with u Roland :)|pg||

nt|roswolf: on board 2 the other n/s bid 6@D - well done indeed|pg||
nt|athene: it looks there as though west could have rescued his partner from the endplay by leading a spade|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: but actually declarer would have had a very cute counter to that|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: @SA, @SQ forcing east to cover|pg||
nt|roswolf: the 2nt opener didnt cause them any difficulty|pg||
nt|athene: now return to hand with a trump|pg||
nt|athene: and throw *west* in with the spade!|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|athene: and he has to lead into the club tenace|pg||
nt|athene: so it was a "transfer throw-in" which is a rare bird|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes endplay either way|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: 2@H as by 2/! |pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: well bid boys|pg||
nt|athene: that would have tested declarer more sternly - he would have to place the spade honours and recognize that @CK7 was a tenace :)|pg||
mb|4N|nt|rodal f: = 7 til 11 bad|pg||
nt|vugraphzyx: 2@h 8-10 support pts|pg||
nt|roswolf: into the valley of death rode west!?|pg||
nt|athene: board 2 has kicked in|pg||
nt|lestergold: well Price Simpson here are lucky they can get out for 500|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|athene: south in the other room after the same start (2NT - 3@C; 3@D) decided to move with 4@D|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Bit harder promisses at NS then by me then|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: which looks very reasonable - if you have a void in a suit partner showed 2 or 3 cards in, 3NT must be dubious|pg||
nt|lestergold: not quite death a gain of 3 imps against the making spade game|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed bill|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rodal f: Only one question. The @H handle|pg||
pc|s5|nt|roswolf: ok deep coma then|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|h7|pg||

pc|h5|nt|lestergold: unfortunately for them there isno guarantee that team mates will rach 4S|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: the problem with these sacrifices is, the 4@S game only has to be going down a very small percentage of the time to make them unprofitable|pg||
pc|hA|pc|dK|nt|andyv:  yes... is there any reason for N to play @hs differently?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: but perhaps after the last couple of boards, West decided that all thin games will make for NS :)|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|d8|pg||
nt|lestergold: I disagree here because Simpson'snegative doube told price that they were in double fit territory and ith double fits around it is usually best to declarer the hand|pg||

nt|lestergold: 17 plus 8 wioth a five card suit how is 3N going to be avoied|pg||
nt|lestergold: Victor is conservative but isnt a liability level underbidder|pg||
nt|lestergold: off to best lead but Price likely will play on clubs first|pg||
nt|lestergold: so no entry to long diamonds|pg||
nt|lestergold: however the lead is challenging|pg||
nt|athene: not at all trivial for declarer|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|lestergold: communications with dummy arent great|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: he doesn't know the @HQ is a dummy entry|pg||
nt|athene: now spade switch?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|andyv:  and all's well:)|pg||
nt|athene: trying to establish two spades, diamond, @HA, @CK for the defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: well Price could not afford hthat duckment|pg||
nt|lestergold: and Hirst knows there is no likely future in his diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: ducking at trick 1 wasn't clearcut - spade switch was always likely|pg||
nt|athene: and might be fatal on some layouts|pg||
nt|roswolf: such things doth make swings|pg||
nt|lestergold: well the wild boy from manchester and his partner are giving the two big men a serious pasting|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can still survive if he picks the position|pg||
nt|athene: but this time he has to knock out the @HA first i think|pg||
nt|athene: so that north doesn't get in to cash his long spade|pg||
nt|lestergold: very difficult for  price there is an ionference from the play that south is not entry rich|pg||
nt|roswolf: hassett dulygained his game swing on bd 5|pg||
pc|s2|nt|andyv:  some work to do but 2@d should prevail|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: well, south can still have ONE entry|pg||
nt|lestergold: and kits unlikely to b the ace of hearts|pg||
nt|athene: he knew declarer had a double diamond stop so no point plugging away at diamonds without @HA and @CK as well to get in with|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair point|pg||
pc|s8|nt|rodal f: Will if declerer hit the @C|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|pc|sK|pg||
nt|lestergold: Price is in serious trouble if he wins and now plays heart and north ducks|pg||
nt|athene: west doesn't know who has the fourth spade, though, does he? :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: south when in with k of clubs can play a heart through to beat it|pg||
nt|athene: if he can grab one heart he can switch to clubs and he is ok|pg||
nt|athene: if he plays clubs first he is dead|pg||
nt|lestergold: no he isnt|pg||
nt|lestergold: he can only make this if he takes a first ound finesse against tghe JH|pg||
nt|athene: well it depends *how* he grabs the heart|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer is in the box seat i think but may well go astrey|pg||
nt|athene: if he leads to the @HQ then the defence get @D, @S, @CK and @HAJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: and wild Bill has shown that he knows how t defend and will asurely find the winning play|pg||
nt|athene: all in all, i think ducking the first diamond made his task harder, but it was very difficult|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lestergold: Price made the fatal assunmption that BHirst would continue dianmonds as most players would|pg||
nt|athene: in general, playing against weak opposition, you can duck in all these borderline cases because they will plug on with their first suit regardless, but against strong opposition ...|pg||
nt|athene: you have to be aware of the possibility of a switch|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|h6|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think that Price a great card player has done haset|pg||
nt|lestergold: hgasset needed to duck very smoothly|pg||
nt|athene: never cover!|pg||
nt|roswolf: still not totally gin - the tonis may still upset him|pg||
nt|roswolf: tonic|pg||
nt|athene: will south duck a small club off dummy?|pg||
nt|athene: should do, i think|pg||
nt|athene: you hope declarer has a guess with @CQ9x|pg||
nt|lestergold: Price used to be partner's with Townsend and won most national trophies in that partnership and Townthen Price made the mistake of ditching hisn partnership with  Townsend and ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: Townsend found a new partner a promising 19 year old vaguely related to me|pg||
nt|roswolf: vaguely?|pg||
nt|lestergold: of copurse Price and Simpson have been team mates with Gold and Townsend in recent years with international successes|pg||

nt|rodal f: A IMP to gain for EW?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: with no aces and a good suit, the north hand is worth far more tricks playing in hearts than as a dummy for spades|pg||

pc|d6|nt|athene: to be fair, it was very hard for south|pg||
nt|lestergold: matter of partnership agreement i think double should mean lead spade but of course north cant be sure they cannot make 5d|pg||
nt|roswolf: @SA was indicated i think|pg||
nt|athene: his partner bid and rebid hearts and east's double of 1@H suggests right away he has spades|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|s4|pc|d7|nt|athene: of course, when east rebids 2NT, he does undo the message about having spades|pg||

nt|roswolf: and now a damp squib of a hand|pg||
nt|athene: east opened with a 2-suited bid on board 13 which worked against him, as it kept NS out of the good (but likely failing) slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|athene: no 3@D opener!? i wonder why not|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|athene: is 2@S @H+minor, or @H+@C, do we know?|pg||
nt|roswolf: far too mainstream!?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lestergold: 2S just what north wants to hear|pg||
nt|roswolf: this again could be massacred|pg||
nt|lestergold: probably plus a minor|pg||
nt|athene: it's rare, when one player has shown a 2-suiter, that his partner wants to play in any other suit - especially as a passed hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but that's why you open 3@D with north!|pg||

nt|roswolf: dont like 2@H|pg||
nt|athene: and a heart void|pg||
nt|athene: but i think this is just bonkers|pg||
nt|athene: with that hand west was bidding 2@S over 2@h the first time|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: n/s in dangerous waters|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2h is merely a high card raise to 3C not ubnreasonable if tahts how you play unassuming cu bids|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: north could rebid 2nt to get the overall character of his hand across, perhaps|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lestergold: north could excuse himself and leave thec room to describe his hand's character|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps that is more constructive, and 3@C is the way to show the dead minimum|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|pc|dT|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks -2 for a useful 7 imps|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2h is wrong if playing 5 card majors of  course|pg||

nt|athene: south's hand is the poster child for having some method to show a t/o *without* spades|pg||
nt|athene: which might well be a good idea over a nebulous club|pg||

pc|c7|pc|d9|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|pc|cQ|nt|athene: there are two schemes which are commonly used - either you play X denies spades and 1@S is 4+ spades|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|athene: or you play X is 4/5 spades and 1@S denies spades|pg||
