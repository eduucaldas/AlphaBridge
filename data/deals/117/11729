mb|p|pc|hA|nt|bjacobs: Let's say you also know East has @DA - does that change the odds at all?|pg||

pc|h8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: East is known to have 3 diamonds (likely), West only 2, so it with the odds to place a specific card among 3|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ritong: for the purpose of tipping the specs, yes|pg||
pc|c4|pc|hT|pc|c2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Suppose I deal East the diamond ace, then distribute the other 4 cards at random, but two to East and two to West|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can't calculate like that|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, your point is clear|pg||
nt|bjacobs: but is it correct?|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|nt|ritong: but reasoning with initial vacant places is more reliable, besides when you learn that east has the @d A, his part also contributed a @d on that trick, right?|pg||
pc|sK|pc|c6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But how do you know that East has the ace?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I don't, but you might suspect it, on the bidding|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I could for example lead @DQ, and East will take the ace|pg||
nt|haans: i still think x have been better doos declaret belive that is Peters opnion x with 3 carder?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: The thing to consider is that it's not 100% that East has three diamonds|pg||

nt|bjacobs: You know, this hand is a good example of why I like it: you can get in on the North hand with moderate shape|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Yes, but I want to be able to show both majors immediately|pg||

pc|s2|nt|shevek: lol|pg||
