nt|petergill: Lilley led by 3 imps after 16 boards, by 2 imps after 32 boards, by 3 imps after 47 board, then on Bd 48 Bill Haughie made 3NT on a squeeze to put Lilley 14 imps ahead. |pg||
nt|petergill: Hi Gary|pg||
mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|petergill: 2@H showed 4 hearts, playing Support Dbls, I think|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Hi Peter, thought Klinger-Hoffman were playing last set?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|woozle: I suppose that non-vulnerable the suit solidity makes up for the poor hand and flat shape|pg||
nt|woozle: Nagy's double is responsive, but with four spades he would bid them himself|pg||

pc|s2|nt|woozle: On a club return, finessing is a quick down one, or rising and playing a club next means that he will need to find a winning guess in spades|pg||
pc|s3|nt|woozle: This play looks like an error|pg||
nt|woozle: Spade to ace, diamond finesse, pitch two spades on clubs would be +400...club play looks like an error since he will need to pick spades|pg||

nt|petergill: -2, destroying my prediction, as usual|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: even double dummy it can be hard to predict|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|woozle: Hard to see what was wrong with spade to the ace, diamond hook - guaranteed on the diamond finesse|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mwigor: hi erin|pg||
nt|athene: if west doubles a 1@C opener, EW will lock into hearts |pg||
nt|athene: trump break might prove a bit annoying|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: looks like 3N EW here|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: With a Cayne match on BBO, and Ron Klinger at the other table, we have plenty of competing attractions, but the four players at this table are all very good indeed at bridge|pg||
nt|woozle: North has a number of possible approaches here...some would bid 1S, some a forcing heart raise, some a splinter.|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|woozle: I like Hughes' choice - a bit strong (and skewed) for a splinter, and 1S can make it hard to promise four card heart support later, especially if the auction gets competitive|pg||
nt|woozle: I'm not sure on the rebid though - anybody know their structure?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|athene: west might now just bid 4@H - but it's the sort of hand where you really, really want partner to have a fifth trump|pg||
nt|petergill: South might double 41H|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|Walddk4: Hi Michael and Marshall|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: 3H = shortage in other major|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: hello roland, erin, michael & specs|pg||
mb|4H|nt|petergill: @CJ lead is best|pg||
nt|petergill: except North is not on lead|pg||
nt|athene: unfortunately, east is declarer :)|pg||
nt|woozle: Somebody suggested suit below, which would probably mean that 3H=short spades. Kind of mixed news for North, but he does at least have a lot of spades to ruff, and some filling ...|pg||
nt|woozle: cards in South's long suits|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: 4D = void spade and DA|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: hi marshall|pg||
nt|woozle: Apparently they're on good systemic ground, except that the first round cue style has left North in the dark about the club control|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: Hello everyone :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: players dont usually want to be anonymous until at least Baord 5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi chick|pg||
nt|mwigor: hi cornelia|pg||
nt|mwigor: south had a tough problem|pg||
nt|mwigor: forcing to the 5-level feels like too much on an aceless 4333 though|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont think he meant to force to the five level by cuebidding|pg||
nt|cindy:  hi all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome cindy|pg||
nt|athene: i guess north couldn't bid 2@S over the double, for whatever reason|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: no - but she raised 4@d to 5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: they ended up at that level, but the 3H bid itself is not forcing to that level|pg||
nt|athene: or perhaps he just chose not to|pg||
nt|athene: but if 2@S first time was a weak jump shift, north must be worried that he hasn't really described his hand very well|pg||
nt|athene: i.e. he hasn't got any defence and partner might be counting on some :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer's aim is to hold the trump losers to 3, while ruffing a couple of spades in his hand - I think|pg||
nt|petergill: Matthew McManus is in charge of scoring, created the website for this event, also is Chief Director of this event, and has played (once) in Australia's Open Team. A multi-talented ...|pg||
nt|petergill: guy. |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: he comes to our Nationals each year too, lovely guy|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|nt|woozle: A poor combined performance. Either somebody misbid or their system needs a tune-up, because slam is laydown and I wouldn't expect many to miss it at this level.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mwigor: so effectively thats what she did|pg||
nt|athene: yes declarer is going to try to set up dummy|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|petergill: West thought East might be 4351, hence 4@h, not 3NT|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: strange Nagy went for a suit contract knowing it would be a 4-3|pg||
pc|dK|nt|petergill: 2NT was forcing enquiry, 3@S showed shape|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|nt|petergill: Zoli Nagy has played in Australia's Open Team many times, most recently in 2007. |pg||
nt|athene: but for that purpose he doesn't want to get dummy forced - fortunately south can't attack clubs so often|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|petergill: well, roughly showed the shape 4342 or 4351|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hoping for the latter?|pg||
nt|petergill: The bad major suit breaks might be bad news for declarer|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: whereas 3N looks a doddle|pg||
nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
pc|h2|nt|marlowepi: i guess i would think of it as "forcing to game". which would not be the five level in all cases|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: welcome back Kit Woolsey :)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|cindy:  who whould bid 3N ?|pg||
nt|petergill: He correctly uses one of his limited entries to hand to take the @d finesse|pg||
pc|hT|nt|cindy:  S or N ?|pg||
nt|petergill: 3 rounds of trump now defeats 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: well, three rounds of trumps leaves declarer a trick short now doesn't it?|pg||
nt|petergill: Perhaps a spade from hand towards the ace at Trick 2 was even better|pg||
nt|athene: but south might be worried that his partner has a trump void, in which case cashing even one top heart might give away a vital tempo|pg||
nt|petergill: so South has to decide whether to play partner for one trump or for @CK?|pg||
nt|athene: if declarer has a fifth heart and the @CK clearly there's no defence so south will be thinking about forcing dummy, playing his partner for the @CK |pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|mwigor: mcdonald would have to |pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|petergill: There is a case for West if 4-4 in majors to bid 2@S over 2@H, and more importantly East can rebid 3NT on 4342 and 3@S on 4351, but few Aussie partnerships go into that much detail ...|pg||
nt|petergill: in planning system. |pg||
pc|h7|nt|mwigor: walsh can't really on Jx|pg||
nt|petergill: Hi Kit|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|cindy:  thats the spot|pg||
nt|mwigor: yes|pg||

pc|s2|nt|athene: ok, well done|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|pc|h5|pg||
nt|petergill: I have to go out in about 5 minutes, so it's great to have you back|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|nt|petergill: Chris Hughes' lowest spade might be interpreted in some partnerships as suit pref showing @CK - but|pg||
pc|s6|nt|marlowepi: no but N could bid 3S to see if S could bid a delayed 3N, which would show tenuous stoppage|pg||
nt|mwigor: i guess this is another bid 3NT if thats a feasible option hand|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I echo that sentiment|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|pc|sT|pc|d5|pg||
nt|athene: a spec suggests that east needs @CK for 2@H but i am sure Nagy would have bid 2@H on @HJxxxx and the spade|pg||
pc|sA|nt|petergill: all partnerships that include Chris Hughes play natural count all the time, I think|pg||
pc|d7|nt|marlowepi: hamman's rule could be applied here yes, though aceless with a lousy Qxx is not ideal. i nm,y view N shd bid 3S to see if pd can back into 3N|pg||
nt|mwigor: thats not what 3@s says though|pg||
nt|mwigor: it says i have a 5th @s|pg||
nt|mwigor: so it leads to 4@s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not for me it doesnt|pg||

nt|cindy:  still struggling to find a spot to play|pg||
nt|chick: would 4@S play any better than 5@D?|pg||
nt|petergill: Henry Christie deduced that if East had five @h's, he would have played a spade from hand at Trick 2, not a @D|pg||
nt|petergill: since East with 5 hearts in a 9 card fit would not be in such a rush to set up @d winners|pg||
nt|woozle: Nigel has suggested that South should make another move and I agree - the hand is a good one and the club control is a dangerous thing to suppress|pg||
nt|petergill: as Gary said, 3NT was very much the spot|pg||
nt|kit: if South opens a frisky weak 2@S at favorable, things will get very interesting|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|petergill: We commentators almost get tired of writing that "3NT would have been better" - it's something we have to write a lot on BBO Vugraph, as the years roll by|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mwigor: hi cindy|pg||
nt|cindy:  hi :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: matter of partnership agreement|pg||
nt|woozle: Someone has suggested that North should start with 1S..I have to disagree. I think it's terrible to have four card support for a major and not announce it at the first turn.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the Hamman rule - if available then bid it|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mwigor: mcdonald-walsh have given up their strong club these days|pg||
nt|mwigor: so i think 1@c was natural|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry, I mean Reverse Count (= Upside Down Count) is what Chris plays|pg||
nt|petergill: Henry Christie is a solid citizen, unlike most Aussie experts in the bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: NS can perhaps make 6NT here? give up a diamond then cash everything and east gets squeezed in the majors|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: which is "normal count" in australia|pg||
mb|4H|nt|kit: North won't quit I don't think|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@S from North??|pg||
nt|petergill: would draw a suitable dummy!|pg||
nt|kit: could be double game swing from North's point of view.  I think 4@S is clear.|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@H sounds like  a big 5-6 or 5-7 shape|pg||
nt|kit: The real question is what does East do over 4@S.  I guess he bids 5@C.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|woozle: Nagy's 2C is an interesting choice...does he not have a suitable diamond raise available or is it a tactical choice?|pg||
nt|petergill: If 4@S ..... then EW will go to 5@H or 5@C, then what? South 5@S? Then?|pg||
mb|5C|nt|kit: and now, what does South do?|pg||
mb|5S|nt|kiwibridge: 5@S|pg||
nt|petergill: 5@S I think, with the huge double fit|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|woozle: 3NT is easy with the diamod finesse working...a missed opportunity for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 2@D strong NT or other options, 2@H to play opposite weak 2@H, 2NT 22-23 I think|pg||
nt|kit: well, xxx isn't exactly a huge double fit in partner's first suit|pg||
mb|6S|mb|d|nt|mwigor: hard for mcdonald to pass 1@s but that was the spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: declarer decided that with a very weak dummy spade might well be better|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: this should be -1|pg||
nt|petergill: If West is 5-7, a save is necessary|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: I think North had to double if only to shut partner up|pg||
pc|c2|nt|petergill: There's a possible strip and throw-in to reduce the losers by one in 6@SX|pg||
pc|c3|nt|marlowepi: at least|pg||
nt|athene: give north @SQJxxx and no sure entry and it's easy to see how you might want to play the 5-2 fit|pg||
nt|kit: when Noth doesn't double, it is hard to fault South who has no defense at all|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: very greedy double from East|pg||
nt|petergill: Ron Klinger wrote up that Bruce Neill thinks that with HH after 2NT and transfer, opener should play in the major, based on a  lot of evidence.  |pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: would east get three spades and the @DK, in 4@S?|pg||
nt|athene: he would unless declarer can squeeze or endplay him, but that might be possible|pg||
nt|petergill: where H = honour card|pg||
pc|h4|nt|petergill: Yes, 4@S would have failed, North Chris Hughes did well to run|pg||
nt|athene: there's a case for simply responding 3nt with that north hand - you have loads of hcp but weak spades|pg||
nt|petergill: Many of us, including Bruce Neill (who just told me) would treat North's spades as a four card suit and simply Stayman over 2NT.  |pg||
pc|h6|nt|marlowepi: looks -2 to me|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mwigor: yes theres always four trump tricks|pg||
nt|chick: if the defense can untangle them|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont think they have to untangle them|pg||

mb|1S|nt|marlowepi: presumably it is E whpo is thinking after a double|pg||
nt|woozle: A pretty good slam for EW...I'd bid 1NT:2H,2S:4D (splinter) and West would fall in love with the working cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: if it took that long to decide to double 2S with the N hand, this could be a very long match|pg||
nt|cindy:  well  neither side can make much of anything|pg||
nt|mwigor: alan is a considered player|pg||
nt|athene: many pairs have a gadget in response to 1NT to show both minors with a major singleton|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: but here the singleton is the ace, which changes things|pg||

nt|mwigor: not sure exactly how they play it|pg||
nt|athene: saying "i have both minors and a singleton heart" might make partner bypass 3nt when it's wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: well yes, but of what sort|pg||
nt|athene: on the other hand, 5-5 shapes aren't really NT shapes|pg||
nt|petergill: Nigel Rosendorff once told me that Henry Christie is the best player in Perth in Western Australia - most of the rest of us would have given Nigel himself that rating - but now ...|pg||
nt|petergill: that Nigel has moved to live in Sydney ... |pg||
nt|petergill: Bye, I have to pick up my car which is being serviced, bye all|pg||

pc|dA|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kit: Answer -- playing in 2NT with a 6-card suit|pg||

nt|kit: South didn't really go up ace of spades???|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kiwibridge: 4NT -1?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|woozle: I'm willing to bet that Lilley would have handled the East hand differently|pg||
nt|kit: In other words, I think West had clear 3@S call|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|petergill: 5@C = 10/10 if I were giving the ratings in a bidding contest, 4@S = 6/10, 6@C = 5/10, 3NT = 2/10, partscores 1/10. |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: yes this hand is an excellent example of why 2-suiters aren't good in NT - if just one suit runs, that's not enough tricks to make 3NT assuming you got a threatening lead|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|mwigor: 5@s and 4m|pg||
nt|mwigor: (as at world champs)|pg||

nt|athene: ok bye...|pg||
nt|petergill: sorry to leave you, William|pg||
nt|woozle: If dummy still had a diamond then the endgame would produce a double-squeeze, but who needs a double squeeze when declarer so brilliantly follows his nose in clubs|pg||
nt|woozle: North probably doesn't have anything to open even if he wants to...Zol might open 1S, or 3 or 4. Zol likes his preempts to have a bit of bite|pg||
nt|kit: disaster in the diamond suit at trick 1 -- might be the difference between which side makes 2NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: in that case, it was tactically ill-considered given the colors|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mwigor: the whole point is bill's hand may well not have been at all typical for his bidding|pg||
mb|d|mb|1N|nt|mwigor: i think it wasnt that unreasonable at all|pg||
nt|chick: not really, if they double he can run and if not, would have to be down 7 to beat 620|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would say that if one of them had a hand atypical for their bidding there, E wins the distinction by a hefty margin|pg||
nt|mwigor: east is free to operate in these situations|pg||
nt|petergill: I will be back home to do Bds 33-48 |pg||
nt|athene: :)|pg||
nt|athene: i know some players who would show majors with that west hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: it is important for the person who opens the bidding not to deviate too far from the agreements|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mwigor: so that their partner can judge the hand|pg||
nt|woozle: High spade openings would work poorly, with North having an easy pass of doubles at 3S and above.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: NS playing Keri or something?|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: you dont have to operate, and you can achieve all the same objectives, if you play 3D as a forcing fitting lead-director. and there is no other valuable use for the bid really|pg||
nt|chick: except of course to show good diamonds |pg||
mb|p|pc|hT|nt|athene: EW didn't do so much bidding here|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: they can make some number of hearts although perhaps not four|pg||
nt|kit: I would have been inclined to pass 1NT with the East hand.  Does 2@D really figure to take 2 more tricks than notrump?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|woozle: Pass will probably produce about 500...3NT looks playable also, but 5D will fail|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|woozle: Heart lead is a bit awkward, since it can cost the North hand an entry|pg||
nt|woozle: but this will probably roll home on power - 3 hearts, 3 clubs, 2 diamonds and a spade|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|s4|nt|cindy:  im a little surprised N  bid 4@h|pg||

pc|s3|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|pc|d6|pc|dK|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: now if declarer plays another trump west can play three rounds|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps better was a small trump first time rather than the @SA, as west is a bit endplayed when he wins, but that might require the hand records|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s5|pc|s9|pg||
nt|athene: anyway, declarer is safe for 8 with the club right|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|s7|nt|mwigor: amusingly the contract was the same in both rooms on board 4|pg||
nt|mwigor: 3@d made 10 tricks in the other room|pg||
nt|mwigor: (played by NS)|pg||
nt|cindy:  thats not all that surprising|pg||
nt|chick: NS only took 7 tricks in this room|pg||
nt|chick: is that the value of being declarer? :)|pg||
nt|mwigor: the failure to take 8 in the two card ending was quite poor|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|marlowepi: 4H seems like an awful lot for N to bid on the previous hand. Even 1H seems questionable unless there is the specific agreement that they respond to 1D overcalls the same way they ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: would respond to an opening bid|pg||
nt|athene: north hasn't actually shown any values here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h2|nt|athene: but he doesn't really think he's going to miss game by bidding just 2@D there|pg||
nt|woozle: South suppresses his two heart stoppers again...but all likely games are easy|pg||
nt|woozle: West will lead a heart...if he thinks about his opening lead, Christie might lean toward him and ask "having no hearts?"|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h4|nt|cindy:  the danger of bidding 2@s here rather than 3N is it gives N a chance to make a lead directing double|pg||

mb|1S|nt|woozle: Either a dull game (3NT, 4S, 5C or even 4H) or a tight slam for NS|pg||
mb|2H|nt|marlowepi: should be easy 3N here|pg||
mb|3S|mb|4H|nt|woozle: 6C is much better than 6S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mwigor: its easy to make|pg||
nt|kit: 3@S somewhat conservative|pg||
nt|kit: And now the problem.  If South is going to bid 4@S now, he should have done so last turn to put more pressure on opponents|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: but is it so easy to bid?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well N could have bid 3N and so could S|pg||
nt|woozle: RKC for spades might have NS headed to an undignified 5S contract, which could go down with 6C laydown|pg||
nt|woozle: 4D splinter from Christie, which should work well provided they don't hit trump suit ambiguity later|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|nt|mwigor: but none of their actions is crazy|pg||
nt|marlowepi: from N point of view very unlikely to make exactly 8 trix in NT|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: north has quite a few points for his 2@S bid but 3@S isn't invitational there for most pairs|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: IMO double not clear at all with 10 loser hand, esp. when opps have spades|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: his double was so tiny at first i thought it was a pass|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mwigor: that is true|pg||
nt|marlowepi: was 2N forcing? or was N making a slam try??|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mwigor: simultaneous to this match there is the women's final|pg||
nt|mwigor: havas have scored 20 unanswered IMPs so far and lead 20-1|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i agree that no individual action was crazy. but i am mystified at 2N followed by 3N|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mwigor: (against lowry who had a 1 IMP c/fwd)|pg||
nt|mwigor: hi again|pg||
nt|athene: hi|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|hK|nt|woozle: Excellent auction from NS, correctly ignoring their inferior spade fit|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|woozle: With trumps breaking, Hughes will be untroubled in the play - either leading a heart up, or pitching a spade on the DK, or just noticing that he has twelve tops|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the neg double actually helps NS here if they have the sensible agreement that 2S by N is purely competitive, and the two red cuebiods show different ranges of serious raise|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kiwibridge: the 800 was a push :) no harm done to either side|pg||

nt|athene: it might look as though the defence would have been better to start with a diamond but if they cash two diamonds declarer can throw both hearts away instead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: here comes a cute little number|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that Morton gets around|pg||
nt|woozle: Hughes will open 1S, Nagy shouldn't bid, and Christie will have to choose some kind of raise|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|athene: west is likely to take the push to 5@S over 5@D i would think|pg||
nt|marlowepi: depends how auctions goes|pg||
nt|woozle: 4S is an ambitious undertaking on the NS cards, and shouldn't go close, but the devastating heart lead is unlikely|pg||
nt|petergill: 13-17|pg||
nt|petergill: 15-17|pg||
mb|2C|nt|marlowepi: like mcluhan stepping from behind the poster in "annie hall" :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at these colors if there is any dubiety to NS auction W may let them play 5D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he is not devoid of defense|pg||
nt|athene: south will just show a good diamond raise and now west doesn't know who has the club honours|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4C by W|pg||
nt|athene: i guess he does have his kings outside his partner's suit but even so...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if he bids 4C he can abide by E decision|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|athene: once he has bid 4@S he is surely intending to bid 5@S himself over 5@D if his partner doesn't double it|pg||
nt|woozle: Either 1NT is forcing or Christie has made an odd choice|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: yes, it was alerted|pg||
nt|kit: Many would just bid 3NT on South hand rather than search for heart fit|pg||
nt|petergill: With my car back with new brakes and me $560 poorer, I begin with a typo. |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2@C-2@D?|pg||
nt|kit: I guess they are playing Puppet or something like that from North's 2@D call|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|petergill: Henry Christie has downgraded his 4333 hand by a point|pg||
nt|kit: that makes the 2@C call more sensible -- don't understand the follow-up|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: ok, maybe not :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S was a favorite to saddle him with the last guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: ah, more sensible|pg||
mb|3N|nt|woozle: North has probably bid enough, but 3S looks plenty challenging anyway. A diamond lead would help though|pg||
nt|woozle: The club lead looks harmless for all. But it's not clear what Hughes should do at trick two to get out of his hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: true 4@c looks like the better bid|pg||
nt|athene: declarer will have to decide if west's bidding is consistent with a singleton @DK|pg||
nt|athene: i don't see why it isn't|pg||
nt|mwigor: but he guessed right|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: did 1D show 4+ diamonds, either first time or via 1S rebid?|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H = 4 hearts, 8-9 points, I think|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kiwibridge: @D lead = -2|pg||
nt|kit: he has a bit more than 8-9|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mwigor: i think the 1@s rebid guaranteed 5@d|pg||
nt|petergill: sorry, I miscounted his points, not quite with it|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||

mb|p|nt|marlowepi: S would rather be at favorable. i would still bid though|pg||
nt|mwigor: this should be a fairly easy grand to bi|pg||
nt|mwigor: bid|pg||
nt|woozle: A normal 3NT for NS, which will struggle with a heart lead (or early switch) but probably make otherwise|pg||
mb|1N|nt|woozle: North will be glad to be playing 2/1. because without a forcing 3D the North hand is nasty after something like 1H:2D,2H|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|cindy:  here we go again|pg||

nt|mwigor: 2@c is a puppet to 2@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: 2@d is and GF|pg||
nt|woozle: I assume that 2NT is the normal system call for South with nothing to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: contrary to popular belief, second position is a good one to preempt in, because partner;s hand is as yet unrevelaed to opps and their primary concern must be to show or find fits|pg||
nt|marlowepi: far from obvious for EW to bid slam if S bids 3D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and everybody has a relatively normal hand|pg||
nt|athene: someone needs to take charge and find out that both majors are running|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008MindSportGamesBeijing/Senior/Australia/lilley-nagy.pdf is EW's Conevetion Card from Beijing last year, when they were ...|pg||
nt|petergill: in the Aussie Senior Team that came 5th in the World Senior Teams |pg||
nt|kit: big swing on opening lead here -- heart lead it makes, club lead it doesn't I believe|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|woozle: A heart lead is unlikely but club jack to the king and a heart shift is very likely|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mwigor: in the butler in july one of them forgot and the auction 1@d-1@h-1@s-2@d was passed out|pg||
nt|mwigor: my partner and i had an identical disaster (same kit)|pg||
nt|mwigor: so one of them went into the datums|pg||
nt|athene: i think it should be west - east just knows his partner has some controls for hearts; he doesn't know about the huge trick source|pg||
nt|petergill: Kit - in some of the bridge software that you create and sell, you once studied which four card suits are good leads to 3NT , didn't you? If so, how did Q10xx and K7xx stack up?|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: imagine a club lead, for instance, taking out dummy's entry|pg||
nt|mwigor: 5N now from zol|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: East knows about the king of spades, and is able to ask for the king of hearts with keycard|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no below-game jumps available for EW if S bids 3D|pg||
nt|athene: if the spades are just a bit weaker (say, no @SQ) then you can't ruff them good and get back to them|pg||
nt|mwigor: or maybe 5@s is better|pg||
nt|athene: so i don't see how east can know to bid this grand with confidence|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|nt|mwigor: east should invite grand and west should bid it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: they are lucky to have had a clear run even to the small slam|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dont see why W should bid a grand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he has no idea about spade king, and club lead may dislodge only entry to long spades|pg||
nt|athene: well, west knows there are two big trick sources - east doesn't|pg||
nt|mwigor: 5@s over 5@c asking for third round @s control might be better|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|pc|h5|nt|marlowepi: if W doesnt know about S king he cannot view that suit as a trick source|pg||
nt|athene: i think after the 3@H rebid, west should just take control|pg||
nt|athene: or, at worst, he takes control over 4@D|pg||
nt|mwigor: thats not enough though is it|pg||
nt|athene: he can blackwood then spiral scan for the @SK|pg||
nt|athene: or whatever they use to find kings|pg||
nt|marlowepi: spiral scan headed your way bill|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: EW are whispering about their auction to their respective opponents|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: over here we have to pre-alert if we play stuff but we dont really know it:)|pg||
nt|petergill: I think it said K10xx is not the best holding to lead from, if my memory is correct|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: at worst partner has stiff @SK and club lead takes out your entry i suppose|pg||
pc|h8|nt|woozle: East tries the second top club but the third round looks like giving up, with no way to stop dummy's diamonds from running|pg||
pc|h6|nt|cindy:  haha|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i have long pre-alerts:)|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|pc|sT|pc|sK|pg||
nt|kit: from safety considerations, that's right|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h4|pc|hT|nt|woozle: The second round is reasonable, since south might be 4522 or 3532, (although it costs a club trick if S has Q9xx) but the third round is defeatist|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|pc|d6|nt|marlowepi: good defense thus far|pg||

nt|petergill: a bit with Chris Hughes, are the main disciples of the idea. |pg||
nt|vugrapha2: 4HX is the final contract, missed exactly how they got there|pg||

pc|dA|nt|marlowepi: well, have to admit this auction really stuck it to EW|pg||
nt|athene: but it can be good to have defence for your pre-empts|pg||

nt|athene: this is what Reese was talking about when he babbled about "a pre-empt which is always weak is a blunt sword" or something|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, in all fairness let us note that when S opens 3C he hardly imagines opps will fetch up in 5D|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: north actually played the 9 then the ten, if that makes any difference to south's play|pg||

nt|marlowepi: exciting contest, evenly matched teams|pg||
nt|woozle: Did north really pitch a winning spade to keep a losing diamond?|pg||
nt|woozle: Lilley will open, Nagy will bid some spades, and South must bid at almost any level with this freak|pg||
nt|woozle: NS can make 5H...EW would do very well to buy this in 4S (doubled or not)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|kit: bidding is easy -- balanced hands belong in notrump, distributional hands don't|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|marlowepi: as recommended in this room:)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: i think it was south that bid 4H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: Probably 3H from Hughes, but a FNJ of 3C would be good if systemic|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: but it was North who raised hearts|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugrapha2: isnt it funny, this hand is good enough for a splinter opposite a 1-level overcall, but opposite the two level overcall she was only worth 2NT|pg||

nt|woozle: Appalling effort from Hughes...Now Christie's hands are tied|pg||
nt|woozle: I retract my abuse|pg||

nt|kit: What should South lead?  A heart is my clear 4th choice|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|nt|athene: a tricky and delicate sequence for NS|pg||
nt|athene: if 2@S over 2@C would have been forcing, then this is NF and suggests better spades with less outside, i would have thought|pg||

nt|petergill: Chris Hughes and Henry Christie are not a regular partnership|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: do we have any idea what's happened in the open room?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|vugrapha2: yeah north is imagining less hcp, longer spades|pg||

pc|s7|pc|s3|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|h5|nt|woozle: NS allow themselves to get robbed, Nagy will pay about 150 for the privilege|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|marlowepi: 3S seems like a lot on 3-card support|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a very awkward hand for NS, and an object lesson for those who would sniff at the overcall by E|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h2|pc|h9|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: yes the overcall in NS's 4-3 fit has propelled them into playing in EW's 4-3 fit |pg||
nt|woozle: Lilley move a bit closer again as Haughie-Braithwaite stop in 2S on board 9, making 140|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mwigor: the south hand is awkward over the 2@c overcall in standard methods|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d2|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer's line of play reasonable -- if he had gotten the spades right, he would have had 7 tricks|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|marlowepi: sorry i guess that was covered, was basting the pheasant|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lambasting the peasant|pg||
nt|mwigor: one good approach is to switch 2@d and 2@s bids then south can bid 2@d to show a negative free bid or better in @s|pg||
pc|dA|nt|cindy:  good def here|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: now east gets a diamond ruff with his little spade|pg||

pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: yes, switching the bids sometimes helps but here after 1@H (2@C) 2@D! 2@H south still has a bit of a problem|pg||

nt|marlowepi: is 3H restricted to trial bids? could it be first move on a slam-try hand? if so, maybe S could bid 4C instead of 4S, though admittedly the trumps are very thin|pg||

nt|marlowepi: impossible, S has at least a 6 card suit, there cant be control issues:)|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps lilley will call the director on his partner for following to the second spade with a card he can't have|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: which ever way I suppose, trust pard and don't get overboard with the poor variety|pg||
nt|petergill: Gary, the vital thing is to make responder declarer in game. Thus when you are going to game, opener must not respond 3@S with spades|pg||
nt|kit: well, that game was certainly reasonable|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: NS want to be in 4@s but a @c lead will beat it|pg||

mb|5H|nt|athene: ah sorry west is of course on lead|pg||
nt|woozle: likely two down, with a spade trick blown on the opening lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: could he not bid 4N - two suits?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: which makes the club somewhat easier to find|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: This is the last board for the set, restart will be in 45 minutes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: club is correct though diamond tempting|pg||
nt|kit: you hate having strong hand exposed -- much easier to defend|pg||
mb|d|nt|petergill: so good ways to play are 3@C = any maximum, 3@D = min with @H, 3@H = min with spades, (or reverse min and max in those), or 3@C = any weak two in @H and 3@D = any weak two in ...|pg||
nt|petergill: spades with step to relay, etc|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: some would bid 2H to confirm four card heart fit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ok, more kit, i c|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: 2H shows a stronger hand, 15-16|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: still short even with favorable lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: wasn't a question of showing 2 suits -- question was whether to pass the double or not IMO|pg||
pc|sK|nt|marlowepi: yes, was only saying that there si another treatment over relay|pg||

nt|mwigor: so there is a lot of focus on stopping low|pg||
nt|cindy:  think S might have bid 2@c over 1@h|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: you have to stay low if you agree to respond light, and with the bid range (13-16) there is no room for invitation if you bid 2H everytime ytou have 4|pg||

nt|woozle: West has a tough call as dealer - lots of tricks, but too few controls for a one-bid and too poor a suit for a three-bid|pg||
nt|woozle: (I like an aggressive preempt as much as the next guy, but I like my vul 3m openings to be good dummies in 3NT)|pg||
nt|petergill: on Bd 27|pg||
mb|1C|nt|marlowepi: have to say i would bid 2C with N hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: ??|pg||
mb|2D|nt|vugrapha2: 2D = 16+, 4+ clubs, no major|pg||
nt|petergill: Good point Kit, but in Australia people bid to the five level on unsuitable hands so often after the Dbl, that other people open more and more 4@S openers in order to reap the ...|pg||
nt|petergill: dividends |pg||
nt|petergill: I kid you not. |pg||
mb|3C|nt|petergill: 6@C is very unlucky. |pg||
nt|kit: 6NT has 12 tricks here, but 6@C was pretty unlucky to go down in other room|pg||
nt|petergill: Last board - thanks to commentators Kit Woolsey and Gary Hanna. |pg||
nt|vugrapha2: the michaels bid might warn them off a suit slam in a 4-4 fit|pg||
nt|kit: An very hard to diagnose the tricks -- if West's jack of diamonds were a small diamond, 6@C would be considerably superior to 6NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: South will likely make a slightly aggressive double, then North has to choose between 3CX, 3S, 3NT and 4S.|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks to our operator Erin Tewes and to the ABF and Nick Fahrer. |pg||
nt|kit: Yes, now East will be more inclined to just blast to 6NT|pg||
mb|3H|nt|marlowepi: another object lesson for those who would poohpooh a 2C overcall with no texture and no shape|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: i've been told by many people, if you're not likely to play the hand, don't use michaels|pg||
mb|6N|nt|cindy:  5@c here is a good save   think they will bid it ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it can preempt spades, thatis the main thing|pg||
nt|woozle: 3S is the winner here, but it's playing for a small upside|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: but you also want a club lead, not some lame diamond|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: 3NT will make seven tricks, probably no more, no less|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: and 2 likely entries so even if they have a double stopper u have great chances against 3N|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we havent gained much of an idea of the winner yet with 2-3 the score in this segment sofar|pg||
pc|h5|nt|cindy:  i think S should bid 3@c over 1@h ... assuming that is weak|pg||
nt|cindy:  partner is passed hand so why not take up some space|pg||
nt|petergill: A good tip - but perhaps South thought there might be a six or seven level sacrifice available? |pg||
nt|kit: well, Lilley is picking up a ton here|pg||
mc|12|nt|vugrapha2: Nagy tried to claim 13 on a squeeze if north ducked the heart|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: but of course then hughes decided to take it|pg||
nt|petergill: After Bd 32, only four boards 27-30 unscored, but Bd 27 is good for Lilley and the 5@HX is good for Buchen. |pg||
