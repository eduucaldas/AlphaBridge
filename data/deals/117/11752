mb|2H|nt|roswolf: 2 senior World champions + a leading pair from the north|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Who may want to change his flag, as he is from Sweden atm :)|pg||
nt|athene: hi, good morning everyone|pg||
nt|ady: sorry if North plays|pg||
mb|2N|nt|andyv:  3N |pg||
nt|andyv:  but not from W:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: not sure i would have protected there|pg||
nt|lestergold: Liggins playing with a non regular partner I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: but has an even guess in Hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: fine player Willie Whittaker tho|pg||
nt|eggy: It's a new partnership, but a sreious one|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Willie is Scottish, another player the English "stole" from north of the border|pg||
nt|ady: 6NT  works out better   as able to get  better count|pg||
nt|lestergold: N/S partners in real life for the benefit of foreign specs|pg||
nt|lestergold: Ligins a long and distinguished career|pg||
nt|eggy: Doesn't need that much for 7 from Michelle's perspective now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW 15-17 and mostly natural.|pg||

nt|andyv:  or Ms?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyx: Mr, thnx|pg||
nt|andyv:  :))|pg||
nt|calabres: Hi again. Welcome to Round 5 for the Qualifying of the Portuguese National Open Teams. |pg||
nt|lestergold: Hooland of course very fine player and lost his partner Armstrong tragically last year to an untimely death|pg||
nt|eggy: Both are  N/S World Champions of course now|pg||
nt|lestergold: now in my view 4n here is quantitave and denies hearts but perhaps they have a different understanding |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: I think south intends it as agreing hearts and is therefore blackwood|pg||
mb|p|nt|calabres: Results after 4th Round: http://www.freewebs.com/fpbridge/CNEO_F1_2009_R4.pdf|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Luis|pg||
nt|calabres: ciao Andy|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@s is playable|pg||
nt|vugraphzyx: 5@d also|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@d a bit easier|pg||
nt|rodal f: So the gong gomg came as a helpful one for EW?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyx: south is thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzyx: still...|pg||
nt|vugraphzyx: and a little bit|pg||
nt|andyv:  can S be sure N has 5@s here?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might wrong to tell what a spec wrote, but shitt. To much vine by the dinner?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyx: i guess so|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: and that is how N has read it too from the looks of it|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|andyv:  6 can make if E leads pd's suit|pg||
nt|rodal f: @S to hit then. But should be easy after Ws bid|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Is this auction real?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Did West bid 3NT??|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I don't believe my own eyes|pg||
nt|vugraphzyx: yep... more TD action on table :)|pg||
nt|athene: it looks normal to me to bid in fourth; the only issue is whether you bid 1nt or 2@C :)|pg||
nt|ady: it seems north has taken it as rkc|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5d? passing the buck?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|andyv:  good start |pg||
nt|roswolf: the world champions go for the throat|pg||
nt|mdgraham: auction slightly out of sync... |pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|pg||
pc|h9|nt|andyv:  and there we have it|pg||
nt|andyv:  W should dbl now|pg||
nt|rodal f: As we said Roland. It's saterday and dinner just fined. To much vine at the dinner?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit funny. Looks as a puch:)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|andyv:  this may be a push|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr Push|pg||
nt|roswolf: well that was not inspired by south|pg||
nt|lestergold: asking for truimp queen suggested|pg||
nt|ady: 5@D   asking for queen of trumps I think|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I think West is Espen Erichsen|pg||
pc|h8|nt|lestergold: so by their methods carefully bid and not unreasonably have stopped short of the slam|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h5|pc|hA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South is more generally known as "Binkie"|pg||
mc|8|nt|eggy: avoidance in hearts|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|gnasher: That's a surprise|pg||
nt|eggy: Looks like 2D now would have shown a much better hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: Gold cannot bid 2D as this would probably show a more than minimum hand|pg||
pc|h2|nt|eggy: not everyones treatment nowadays of course|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|pc|h4|pg||
nt|gnasher: If you don't play equal-level conversion, does that make th North hand a 2D overcall?|pg||
nt|eggy: and if you play it that way, perhaps it's better to pass over 1NT?|pg||
nt|othered1: Well, if 1N were forcing, pass would be my choice|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|d5|pg||

pc|d3|nt|eggy: It won;t be forcing|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|c2|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|othered1: Then it's a really tough call.|pg||
nt|lestergold: Gold will not pass holding 13 points and 4 good hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: and they are good points not softies|pg||
nt|eggy: 2D is not too attractive either I think|pg||
nt|lestergold: risk of missing avul game too great for huis liking|pg||
nt|othered1: true, then this hand is just a price you pay for that philosophy|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|gnasher: This should go one down.  If declarer trys to ruff a heart, East can ruff in|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lestergold: Gold would never bid a 5 card minor overcall on this sort of hand|pg||

nt|Walddk4: happens|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Why did they not double?|pg||
nt|roswolf: well a perfecto slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: a thin 4H for N/S |pg||
nt|mdgraham: and is well known as the inventor of Binkie Points, a rather abstruse method of hand evaluation  |pg||
mb|1S|nt|andyv:  probably came to the table as auction was ending|pg||
nt|rodal f: U can wander Roland:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyx: n/s tyhought it was a distributional hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzyx: like a 5/5 or better|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 6@D would be a feat|pg||
mb|1N|nt|andyv:  it was close:)|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: hello everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  good support for all suits|pg||

nt|andyv:  meanwhile, this auction will take off soon|pg||
mb|2C|nt|roswolf: have n/s got the methods?|pg||
nt|lestergold: and they arent ecven in biddeing|pg||
nt|lestergold: at these colours not easy|pg||
nt|lestergold: especially with Whittaker putting one in|pg||
nt|eggy: Not an any vul really|pg||
nt|ady: west 2@S trying to keep opps a t bay   will get too high|pg||
nt|lestergold: already too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: but 50s is ok|pg||
nt|athene: "equal level conversion" now|pg||
mb|2D|nt|andyv:  wonder why S didn't raise|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Mike Gold|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hood morning all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: David, could you please insert player name for North?|pg||
nt|roswolf: slamtime perhaps|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hi Roland hi Geoff|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I believe it's Hassett|pg||
nt|athene: this sort of hand is why the 2NT opener is a real "slam killer"|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hin Bill|pg||
nt|athene: south knows that all depends on what his partner has wasted in hearts|pg||
nt|athene: hi|pg||
nt|lestergold: Price and Simpson world senior champs|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Click on North and insert name|pg||
nt|athene: but there just isn't the room to find everything out|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if north pulls 2@C to 2@D that doesn't show a huge had|pg||
nt|athene: hand|pg||
nt|athene: it just says "i was doubling in case you have hearts, but as you haven't, let's play in diamonds" :)|pg||
mb|p|pc|sA|nt|athene: declarer will presumably play for heart ruffs in dummy|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|nt|athene: what makes these problems worse is that when you play 3NT with a shortage, and it's wrong (partner has little in the short suit), not only do you miss slam, but you frequently go ...|pg||
nt|athene: down in 3nt :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: i have a geneneral agreement that after a strong 2nt you can always stop in 4nt if you try for a minor suit slam|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|athene: but East can keep ruffing higher than dummy|pg||
pc|sK|nt|andyv:  S being very timid with his hand|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: hmm bill you are in pessimistic mood today|pg||
nt|lestergold: Bil Hirst Bill Hirst from manchester Ive heard him referred to as wild Bill|pg||
nt|athene: north will be relieved he had a heart stopper :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: best move here is to cash out|pg||
nt|athene: so it should be 110|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s9|pg||

nt|mdgraham: NS 6@C here, but it's going to be hard to reach|pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: Simpson a towering figure of brain and brawn and a national hero outside bridge|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  4 loser hands hard to bid sometimes|pg||
nt|andyv:  esp. in 4th seat|pg||
nt|rodal f: If 2NT is 20-21 I like that from S. Hope they then have puppet|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@d GF?|pg||
nt|athene: West needs to get his hand across as accurately as he can in anticipation of the expected 4@S over 4@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4H for N/s not a bad contract basically on club fi8nesse which happens to be wrong|pg||
nt|athene: South has a hard decision - double, 5@C or 6@C all possible|pg||
nt|athene: no doubt he is intending to pull 4@S to 5@C|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Callaghan will remove 4@S to 5@C, to show a hand that is stronger than a direct 5@C  |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: love the shape for the t/o x opposite a passed pard|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Seems as a multi|pg||
nt|vugraphzyx: multi|pg||
nt|mdgraham: over which North may bid 6@C, but we will see|pg||
pc|dK|nt|andyv:  i don't like 2N as opener... hand is too strong|pg||
nt|athene: he wants to leave his partner well-placed|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: 4@H   is down 1 |pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe the phantom ?|pg||
nt|eggy: I wonder if EW are GF?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rodal f: There the 20-21 came|pg||
nt|vugraphzyx: 3@C puppet stayman|pg||
nt|roswolf: good guy as well|pg||
nt|athene: as it happens East has enough spades that that 4@S didn't come to pass :) or perhaps should say it DID come to pass :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: its close stuff insurance comes to mind|pg||
nt|eggy: if playing 2/1 the pass of 4H is probably forcing|pg||
nt|ady: 5 diamonds can be made   will need the spade finesse and set up long spade|pg||
nt|ady: spade finess the right way of course |pg||
nt|lestergold: if Liggins gets this right it will deserve a roun of applause|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|andyv:  well, they should get to 4@h anyway|pg||
nt|rodal f: Puppet or stayman vug opp?|pg||
nt|athene: a normal decisio by north|pg||
nt|mdgraham: of course, South may not get the chance to remove anything....|pg||
nt|athene: decision|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|rodal f: thx:)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lestergold: bidding may suggest south is short spade and that may help Liggins|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d9|pg||
nt|eggy: He might try it on the auction, although if NS switch to clubs, it may be slightly anti % risking 500|pg||
nt|ady: South has shown length in clubs and heats   so not may well get spade right|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|nt|vugraphzyx: "puppet stayman" |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|andyv:  looks like in OR, W opened a polish 2@s bid and N couldn't find the bid box to raise his partner's strong action|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|athene: i think it's sensible to play 1@H X 3@S as a splinter because knowing of the singleton spade might well be the critical factor in partner judging to go to the 5-level|pg||
nt|lestergold: Brunner maybe hpoing/ expecting that pard has a defensive somethi8ng somewhere|pg||
nt|eggy: H4 was probably neutral|pg||
nt|lestergold: Liggins may try or a three three spade break of course with the added possinility of qx spade |pg||
nt|ady: not worth double on the hope of down 1|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|hA|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: of course, the double is "takeout" but at such a high level you pass without lots of shape|pg||
pc|hK|pc|c3|nt|rodal f: Does the stayman have anything with the man's way to be? I'm a novice|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|lestergold: she hopes more than own one an knows that 5d was a save so i do not blame here|pg||
nt|lestergold: what do you guys think would you take that spade finesse at the table?|pg||
nt|eggy: I think it's against the odds now ..|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think its very tough choice here|pg||
nt|eggy: know John bid 4H but the vul x balanced agains two bidding oppo looks very thin too|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|c2|pg||
nt|eggy: and I was accused of being a "wild bidder" on Wednesday|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h9|pc|s8|pc|cK|pg||
nt|eggy: I think that he will play Holland for a punt on shape only|pg||
nt|ady: cant do it now|pg||
nt|eggy: but Glyn has an exceptional nose in these situations|pg||
nt|lestergold: i am inclined to think that he will get i wrong but hes a very good layer|pg||
nt|lestergold: player|pg||
nt|ady: cant make now|pg||
nt|eggy: actually, does he have the entries anymore?|pg||
nt|lestergold: no hes badly placed|pg||
nt|lestergold: burned his communication voatds|pg||

nt|lestergold:  boats|pg||
pc|h8|pc|s2|pc|s9|pc|c5|pg||
nt|eggy: so I think he'd already decided on his line, unless he intends to finesse S now, which is hin only chance I think|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lestergold: ive got severe butter fingers today|pg||
nt|athene: if south has most normal t/o distributions, you do better to take the money than try to make a thin contract your way|pg||

nt|eggy: Well I'm not one to question David's judgement, but when S takes out 4S, doesn't his hand look pretty massive?|pg||
nt|lestergold: I would question it on this occasion but i may get disowned|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: "not the best contract"  Townsend|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|d|nt|lestergold: Townsend not known for not sarcasm|pg||
nt|eggy: But flexibility is a very good hand surely as you sort of expect a pass a lot of time.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lestergold: or savage irony!|pg||
mb|4D|nt|othered1: some would consider 3@S conservative|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: I think David had an ace and a KQ undislcosed in the suiots that Townsend has effectively implied he held|pg||
nt|othered1: but effective|pg||
nt|eggy: That said, as Daivd took it out on a flat hand at even, maybe they play it more take out oriented than most|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lestergold: well when I commentate on Gold I usually get told off for blaming his partner for everything but on this ccasion I canrectify that with cautious confidence|pg||
nt|eggy: You feel that 3S was a touch wet, but he didn't want to push them too far I imagine|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||

nt|athene: NS should reach 4@S here|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzyx: multi again|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rodal f: Multi again|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s should win part score battle hee|pg||
nt|athene: not many points but they do have a 5-4 spade fit and a bit of shape and that's all you need|pg||
nt|ady: this is missable|pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: eminently missable|pg||
nt|lestergold: and has been missed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@S=6-card suit, 8-11 hcp|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rodal f: Bit funny to see what will happen in a @C contract at EW|pg||
nt|andyv:  same in OR... now S bid 4@h (p/c) and W bid 4@s|pg||
nt|lestergold: itll probabbly subside at 3S|pg||
nt|lestergold: may well go off|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: it would be much better played by north (heart lead) but even then you would have to guess the trumps to make four|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Seems as W killed that possebility|pg||
nt|ady: 3 small clubs opposite singleton     very suitable|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: double game-try|pg||
nt|athene: since he has no room and 3@S would be merely competitive|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West anticipates a NS vulnerable game, so bids to the limit immediately|pg||
pc|s7|nt|andyv:  and E will run|pg||
nt|rodal f: By the X it seems Y|pg||
pc|s3|nt|andyv:  question is 4@c or 3N?|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps north could try 3nt now? :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|andyv:  wow|pg||
nt|andyv:  faith in pd|pg||
nt|lestergold: needs an ability here to mak a forcing bid showing hearts and a self splinter in order to galvanise a weak no trumper into action with the north hand|pg||
nt|ady: this will be short|pg||
nt|eggy: Hard, unless you have a "mild try" in your armoury|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|rodal f: In a way I liked Es pass. I trust u pard it tells|pg||
pc|sK|pc|h6|pc|s6|nt|lestergold: well gonna be heard for Bill to pick up the pesky spade J in 3 never mind 4|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks too high|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: In my view Hasset 's bid is the wildest Ive seen so far|pg||
nt|athene: the club layout is nice |pg||
nt|lestergold: he has 6 of his lousy weak no trump points in oppos suit|pg||
nt|athene: so he just has to guess trumps to make|pg||
nt|roswolf: they bid them up in the north!:)|pg||
nt|athene: north has one big extra value which is his fourth trump|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but he doesnt desfrve to make it and i think he wont where will he get the clues to the spade layout|pg||
nt|athene: if 2@S over 2@H might have been on only 3 spades|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|lestergold: yes the fourth spade is plus but the rest is minus|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as it happens, 4@H is on a guess or two|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|dT|nt|athene: but declarer has no reason to play east for long spades|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|lestergold: and i avoided the curse!!|pg||
nt|roswolf: west's bid may be a straw in the wind|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: you assume the hearts are 6-3 so that makes west the firm favourite to have three spades|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: so totally normal to play to the @SQ|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c8|pc|c5|nt|andyv:  It could be right... but i would tend to trust opps (if reliable) to not dbl into game unless they can beat it at least 2 tricks|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|roswolf: i would certainly hope so|pg||
nt|athene: the problem with cashing @HAK is, if the suit breaks 4-1, the defence might be able to draw two more rounds of trumps when in with the @CA|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is the Premier League|pg||
nt|athene: but on the other hand you don't really want to risk club ruffs|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might try a club to the @CK, trying to persuade the defence to release the @CA early|pg||

nt|athene: but it is a bit too intermediate in strength for some pairs|pg||
nt|athene: now he is committed to doubling, really, as 2@D could have been so much weaker|pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: 4H a little optimistic and a lot ofm work to do especially with the 4/1 reak|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: Patterson Crouch bid the slightly below odds on hand one and guessed right in trumps|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lestergold: well bid boys|pg||
nt|athene: that would have tested declarer more sternly - he would have to place the spade honours and recognize that @CK7 was a tenace :)|pg||
nt|ady: Liggins left well alone|pg||
nt|lestergold: well can harly expect Liggins to move with his 6 count|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D isn't especially strong since East had plenty of ways to show a real 3@D raise (he has two suits to cue)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: = 7 til 11 bad|pg||
nt|vugraphzyx: 2@h 8-10 support pts|pg||
nt|roswolf: into the valley of death rode west!?|pg||
nt|athene: board 2 has kicked in|pg||
nt|lestergold: well Price Simpson here are lucky they can get out for 500|pg||
nt|ady: some do with 4 trumps   a singleton and outside ace|pg||
nt|eggy: I doubt he would have passed if his trumps were a bit better|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: south in the other room after the same start (2NT - 3@C; 3@D) decided to move with 4@D|pg||
nt|lestergold: when you are well ahead you tend not to push as much|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ady: if either east or westg had 9@H instead of a small one  4@H would be reasonably good even with 4-1 split|pg||
nt|athene: south takes the high road even though at least one of his kings is likely wasted as they are facing shortage|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rodal f: Bit harder promisses at NS then by me then|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||
nt|athene: which looks very reasonable - if you have a void in a suit partner showed 2 or 3 cards in, 3NT must be dubious|pg||
nt|lestergold: not quite death a gain of 3 imps against the making spade game|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed bill|pg||
nt|athene: now @SAK, spade|pg||
nt|athene: if east ruffs, declarer just throws a diamond|pg||
pc|c8|nt|rodal f: Only one question. The @H handle|pg||

pc|s4|nt|lestergold: unfortunately for them there isno guarantee that team mates will rach 4S|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: the problem with these sacrifices is, the 4@S game only has to be going down a very small percentage of the time to make them unprofitable|pg||
pc|sK|nt|eggy: Willie trying to play absolutely safe, but the defence making it as uncomfortable as possible|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|andyv:  yes... is there any reason for N to play @hs differently?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: but perhaps after the last couple of boards, West decided that all thin games will make for NS :)|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ady: still ok for 8 tricks|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h4|pc|s7|pg||
nt|lestergold: I disagree here because Simpson'snegative doube told price that they were in double fit territory and ith double fits around it is usually best to declarer the hand|pg||

nt|roswolf: this could br a swing hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or go off in it if you got there - particularly if played by North  |pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Roland to comment this one. His type of hand:) 20-20|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w 3n likely|pg||
nt|ady: split deck|pg||
nt|athene: yes, certainly|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  mine too|pg||
nt|athene: you are short of entries to take the trump finesse twice|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  look for slam here|pg||
nt|athene: the opening lead helped in that respect|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lestergold: and 3n likely to make why swing?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: yeh roland hacked into the dealing bot|pg||
nt|ady: spade position nice for declarer|pg||
nt|ady: difficult to see how defence can come to 7 tricks on the lay out|pg||
nt|lestergold: but with only one entry to dummy how is that entry to be used|pg||
nt|athene: wow, no 1@H overcall|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rodal f: Need some type of bidding as the first board then Andy:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: ok, so you haven't got great texture in your suit, but you are NV and it is only the 1-level|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|andyv:  they are getting there Frank:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@d by N now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  S is bailing out... prob. 2@c|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or? Running for money|pg||
nt|athene: interesting, borderline decisions here - mainly a matter of style|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: dim finess club finmesse both on 2 spades a heart 4 clubs 2 dims without the heart guess|pg||
nt|roswolf: well victor as west in the other room is more conservative|pg||
nt|athene: how often do you raise partner's response with three cards? only with a side singleton, or will a weak doubleton do?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|andyv:  and now 2@d by N|pg||
nt|rodal f: Now 2@D|pg||
nt|lestergold: 17 plus 8 wioth a five card suit how is 3N going to be avoied|pg||
nt|lestergold: Victor is conservative but isnt a liability level underbidder|pg||
nt|lestergold: off to best lead but Price likely will play on clubs first|pg||
nt|lestergold: so no entry to long diamonds|pg||
nt|lestergold: however the lead is challenging|pg||
nt|athene: not at all trivial for declarer|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
nt|lestergold: communications with dummy arent great|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: he doesn't know the @HQ is a dummy entry|pg||
nt|athene: now spade switch?|pg||
nt|eggy: he may start with a spade to the 8|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|andyv:  and all's well:)|pg||
nt|athene: trying to establish two spades, diamond, @HA, @CK for the defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: well Price could not afford hthat duckment|pg||
nt|lestergold: and Hirst knows there is no likely future in his diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: ducking at trick 1 wasn't clearcut - spade switch was always likely|pg||
nt|athene: and might be fatal on some layouts|pg||
nt|roswolf: such things doth make swings|pg||
nt|lestergold: well the wild boy from manchester and his partner are giving the two big men a serious pasting|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can still survive if he picks the position|pg||
nt|athene: but this time he has to knock out the @HA first i think|pg||
nt|athene: so that north doesn't get in to cash his long spade|pg||
nt|lestergold: very difficult for  price there is an ionference from the play that south is not entry rich|pg||
nt|roswolf: hassett dulygained his game swing on bd 5|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andyv:  some work to do but 2@d should prevail|pg||
nt|eggy: spade or diamond?|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: well, south can still have ONE entry|pg||
nt|lestergold: and kits unlikely to b the ace of hearts|pg||
nt|athene: he knew declarer had a double diamond stop so no point plugging away at diamonds without @HA and @CK as well to get in with|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair point|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rodal f: Will if declerer hit the @C|pg||
pc|h9|pc|s9|pg||
nt|athene: if you don't raise with three very much, you need to pull 1nt to 2major with five a lot more|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, partnership style. The South hand is balanced, which argues for a no-trump rebid|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: Price is in serious trouble if he wins and now plays heart and north ducks|pg||
nt|athene: west doesn't know who has the fourth spade, though, does he? :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: south when in with k of clubs can play a heart through to beat it|pg||
nt|athene: if he can grab one heart he can switch to clubs and he is ok|pg||
nt|athene: if he plays clubs first he is dead|pg||
nt|lestergold: no he isnt|pg||
nt|lestergold: he can only make this if he takes a first ound finesse against tghe JH|pg||
nt|athene: well it depends *how* he grabs the heart|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer is in the box seat i think but may well go astrey|pg||
nt|athene: if he leads to the @HQ then the defence get @D, @S, @CK and @HAJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: and wild Bill has shown that he knows how t defend and will asurely find the winning play|pg||
nt|athene: all in all, i think ducking the first diamond made his task harder, but it was very difficult|pg||
nt|ady: may go down now|pg||
nt|eggy: definitely now i think|pg||
nt|ady: clear hearts|pg||
nt|eggy: I think Holland may have mis-signalled his length though|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lestergold: Price made the fatal assunmption that BHirst would continue dianmonds as most players would|pg||
nt|athene: in general, playing against weak opposition, you can duck in all these borderline cases because they will plug on with their first suit regardless, but against strong opposition ...|pg||
nt|athene: you have to be aware of the possibility of a switch|pg||
pc|h5|pc|c6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and Qx isn't a bad holding to be led up to|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lestergold: I think that Price a great card player has done haset|pg||
nt|lestergold: hgasset needed to duck very smoothly|pg||
nt|athene: never cover!|pg||
nt|roswolf: still not totally gin - the tonis may still upset him|pg||
nt|roswolf: tonic|pg||
nt|athene: will south duck a small club off dummy?|pg||
nt|athene: should do, i think|pg||
nt|athene: you hope declarer has a guess with @CQ9x|pg||
nt|lestergold: Price used to be partner's with Townsend and won most national trophies in that partnership and Townthen Price made the mistake of ditching hisn partnership with  Townsend and ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: Townsend found a new partner a promising 19 year old vaguely related to me|pg||
nt|roswolf: vaguely?|pg||
nt|lestergold: of copurse Price and Simpson have been team mates with Gold and Townsend in recent years with international successes|pg||
nt|eggy: Declarer's 10 was a givaeaway though|pg||
nt|athene: no, sure|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: well not thatvague I suppose |pg||
pc|d6|nt|eggy: as N known to hold the 9|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but equally you might raise spades with @SAKx support.|pg||
nt|athene: west returned the @H2 perhaps trying to ask for a club|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Nobody said this game was easy |pg||
nt|athene: but there's no rush to cash the @CAQ, as it happens|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s6|nt|rodal f: But as often said before. Partscore u often get paid if u make opps to play NT|pg||
nt|ady: 2 or 3 down|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: diamond to dummy, and club to the @CK, perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: trying to make|pg||
nt|athene: but then the roof will fall in :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rodal f: So a @D lead?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: many twists and turns in this hand|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: will Callaghan be able to read the position of the @CA?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: very instructive - all about control and timing|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|athene: no|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think he had much to guide him|pg||
nt|athene: in situations where you opened 4th in hand and end up in a low-level contract you can usually work out quite a bit about the defenders' hands|pg||
nt|athene: because they must have some strength between them but neither of them could open|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|eggy: blimey 3 down now|pg||
pc|c9|nt|rodal f: But don't need that as long as declerer don't see his best line|pg||
nt|roswolf: which is why it could well be a swing|pg||
nt|lestergold: a fascinating battle of wits finally won by Price|pg||
nt|athene: as expected, NS got some imps back from their thin 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: which was reached in the other room (5-4 spade fit and about a 21 count means it's going to be bid!) but it wasn't let through|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s7|nt|andyv:  a @d lead would seem obvious|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|d5|pg||
pc|c8|pc|dT|pc|d8|nt|vugraph815: a spade was thrown earlier by n not a club|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: 6@H isn't very good and shouldn't be reached|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 11 tricks in hearts for e/w|pg||
mb|3H|nt|rodal f: Wd Macedo|pg||
nt|athene: although if west super-accepts, they might power into it|pg||
nt|athene: they might well get to the 5-level before they find they are missing @CA @HQ|pg||
nt|ady: 3@H  not a super accept with most    shows 4 trumps and minimum|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N!|nt|andyv:  hard to avoid 4 losers|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: if e/w push the boat out here they could well make 3N|pg||
nt|athene: east doesn't know there is so much wasted in those 3-3 fits in spades and diamonds|pg||
mb|4D|nt|rodal f: As it's hard to set 4@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: not a very good contract but layout is favourable|pg||
nt|lestergold: they need some goodies|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: though west dows have AK    AK   outside   not bad    but very flat|pg||
mb|4H|nt|andyv:  that was undisciplined|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  if you are going to pull dbl, then you probably shouldn't have b id 2@h to begin with|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree with u totaly Andy|pg||
nt|ady: should be 10 tricks|pg||
nt|eggy: looks like, despite being tapped, the club finesse comes to the rescue here|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 3NT was presumably some sort of slam try, so east now feels he has done enough|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lestergold: well Simpson go yes hes a gung ho sort of chap|pg||
nt|lestergold: 9 tricks well roll in in practice|pg||
nt|lestergold: no maybe not|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|ady: Selway has judged well    5-3-3-2   opposite a minimum   not a good slam|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|athene: the spades run for the defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: the spades will cash  wont they|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|c5|pg||
nt|athene: so declarer will lose four spades and a club at least|pg||

nt|ady: club finesse or clubs 3-3  or doubleton 10C all ok|pg||
pc|hA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 3N was an overbid but understandable when they need results|pg||
nt|lestergold: only a slight overbid|pg||
nt|athene: heart switch can't cost now, can it? |pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|nt|eggy: perhaps Liggins hoping that the defence co-operate in an elopement|pg||

nt|athene: pass denying 3@H (support doubles)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but i think 2@H describes the hand better|pg||
mb|d|nt|andyv:  I'll bring the coffee:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: A IMP to gain for EW?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: with no aces and a good suit, the north hand is worth far more tricks playing in hearts than as a dummy for spades|pg||
nt|roswolf: this could lead to a massacre|pg||
nt|lestergold: psr conract is 4h x off  one by N/S|pg||
mb|2S|nt|andyv:  unless they win the auction:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: the spotlight will be on south to find the right lead|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rodal f: So right u was:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  now they should win an imp|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: 4@S will be very easy here, with the void facing the weak suit|pg||

nt|lestergold: this time they get it|pg||
pc|d7|nt|andyv:  well, I guess not|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: hard for the defence to see the best line, really, with the big trick source concealed|pg||
nt|ady: heart looks best|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D worked quite well in that it shut west out from making any sort of descriptive rebid, but that has harmed the defence more, perhaps|pg||
pc|s9|nt|rodal f: So a push again|pg||
nt|andyv:  yeap|pg||

nt|athene: An interesting case here of two-way avoidance.|pg||
nt|eggy: Good evening|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome back to Steve Eginton|pg||
nt|athene: If East plays @SAK and another, declarer finesses diamonds to keep East off lead.|pg||

nt|roswolf: and now a damp squib of a hand|pg||
nt|athene: east opened with a 2-suited bid on board 13 which worked against him, as it kept NS out of the good (but likely failing) slam|pg||
nt|ady: still discards if  south ruffs   |pg||
nt|eggy: If south rffs he can afford to ruff high can't he?|pg||

mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|athene: no 3@D opener!? i wonder why not|pg||

nt|roswolf: far too mainstream!?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 2S just what north wants to hear|pg||
nt|roswolf: this again could be massacred|pg||
nt|lestergold: probably plus a minor|pg||
nt|athene: it's rare, when one player has shown a 2-suiter, that his partner wants to play in any other suit - especially as a passed hand|pg||
mb|2N|nt|athene: but that's why you open 3@D with north!|pg||
nt|eggy: curiousauction to Moysian in the open room|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|athene: if East plays three rounds of spades, declarer would simply finesse diamonds into west; if he cashed a top spade and then switched, declarer would finesse diamonds the *other* way|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: this can go 3 down on best defence|pg||
nt|eggy: I wonder what 2NT meant|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|athene: @CAK, club ruff, diamond ruff, @HA, diamond ruff, @SA|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the only testing defence is to play @SA @SJ, or @SJ right away|pg||
nt|athene: and leave declarer having to bring the diamonds in|pg||

nt|roswolf: his night mare hand|pg||
nt|ady: a very reasonable 4@S    both red finesses wrong   |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: light opener with 10hcp and no aces|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: what would burn say|pg||
nt|roswolf: not wery complimentary!?|pg||
nt|athene: he says that people overdo the aggressive raising witha  5-4 major fit|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: a bit of a silly auction in the other room|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm in open hasset got well overboard|pg||
nt|roswolf: east in the other room was very aggressive|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps dixon's 4@S was a "rage" bid|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|lestergold: Dixon's 4 spade bid looks absurd|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|athene: often when partner pulls your lucrative penalty double you overbid|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: perhaps his thought was:- the delayed double is just penalties of hearts and doesn't promise any spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: very indsiplined by the distinguished Mr. Dixon|pg||
nt|athene: therefore, to pull to 2@S, partner should have 6@C and 5@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: dont like 2@H|pg||
nt|athene: and a heart void|pg||
nt|athene: but i think this is just bonkers|pg||
nt|athene: with that hand west was bidding 2@S over 2@h the first time|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: n/s 25 hcp wont produce much|pg||
pc|hK|nt|roswolf: n/s in dangerous waters|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2h is merely a high card raise to 3C not ubnreasonable if tahts how you play unassuming cu bids|pg||
nt|athene: nope, 4333 hands are just rubbish :)|pg||
nt|ady: looks 2 down if cashing out|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: north could rebid 2nt to get the overall character of his hand across, perhaps|pg||
pc|h9|nt|lestergold: north could excuse himself and leave thec room to describe his hand's character|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps that is more constructive, and 3@C is the way to show the dead minimum|pg||
nt|ady: might  make if playing the J@D|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|roswolf: looks -2 for a useful 7 imps|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2h is wrong if playing 5 card majors of  course|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: which it seems they are|pg||
nt|athene: lots down now|pg||
nt|ady: could take the next 10 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: west gets a chance to signal for clubs on the run of the hearts|pg||
nt|athene: the play began the same way in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: @HK to @HA, spade to the @SJ|pg||
nt|ady: did well to get out for 3 down then|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|cK|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|nt|ady: going well|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|athene: south's hand is the poster child for having some method to show a t/o *without* spades|pg||
nt|athene: which might well be a good idea over a nebulous club|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|ady: now down 1|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d9|pc|d7|pc|c7|pg||
nt|lestergold: another much needed gain for Rosen|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h5|pc|dK|pc|c9|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: there are two schemes which are commonly used - either you play X denies spades and 1@S is 4+ spades|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: or you play X is 4/5 spades and 1@S denies spades|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: 7 imps in|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|nt|ady: can make|pg||

mb|1D|nt|lestergold: 5 or 7 hand for e/w|pg||
nt|eggy: Reissmann must have switched to a low club|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|eggy: otherwise it would have been -2 or minus a bunch|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|an|4+!S 0/1!D|mb|p|nt|lestergold: townsend better double to ensure that any slams go off|pg||
nt|lestergold: dont know why he didnt|pg||
mb|3H|nt|lestergold: also wants a club lead against 3N|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|eggy: £@C is, I think, a Jourdain splinter|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He does not want to discourage them from bidding slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|eggy: 3@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: how does he know whetehr 2 clubs are cashing or not and in spades how does he know his pard will lead clubs|pg||
nt|eggy: which is a splinter in partner's 1st suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: well no story to tell after all|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|nt|gnasher: what do you think of  a 4C splinter from East?|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|pc|sA|nt|eggy: The reason for playing it is that a splinter in the 4th suit is relatively rare, whereas in oartners more common and difficult to show|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: It would have been a standard bid by the late Milos Sujic|pg||

nt|roswolf: for ensuring that this fine event is brought to BBO vugraph. Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentators Mike and Bill for their wit and perceptive comments and to our specs ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: whose contributions keep us on our toes!|pg||
nt|lestergold: well c some of you for some more of what is effectively the British trials|pg||
nt|roswolf: resumption in 50mins from now|pg||
nt|lestergold: always a hard fought business|pg||
nt|eggy: well done|pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: fourth best club lead here didn't cause declarer any acute anguish|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: he smiled and started looking for his tenth trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: so bye for now and thx to hard working excellent fellow commentators excellent operator and last not least specs|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: thx all|pg||

nt|ady: thx specs|pg||
nt|eggy: Thanks to the 3 Davids - Burn, Edwin and our oprator dave debbage|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|athene: 2@H is control-showing, i assume|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: 2@D would be 0-1 control, 2@H is 2 controls|pg||
nt|lestergold: this 3N contract likely to make on any lead|pg||
nt|eggy: his first time I believe - good job done|pg||
nt|ady: last contract could actually make if Ranis left a diamond entry in hand before playing further spades|pg||
mb|r!|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|lestergold: if no club lead simpson will play on diamodns|pg||
nt|eggy: and also to the Manchester Bridge club, Jeff Smith of the Manchester CBA and the max Bavin of teh EBU|pg||
mb|2N|nt|athene: well, he might play on clubs, and lose two clubs and three diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: might  lose 3 trump tricks   but with Q@C favourable  will still make|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: should still play obn dims|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: spade lead was a definite possibility from south, i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: spade lead declaer has time and entries  to develop dims|pg||
mb|4S|nt|roswolf: bye for now|pg||
nt|athene: if declarer plays diamonds, does north not have a chance to lead clubs through twice?|pg||
nt|athene: not sure it's that easy|pg||
nt|athene: i guess it's ok as the cards lie|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: hust 2 club tricks for the defence if they hurry in 4@S|pg||
