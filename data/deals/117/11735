mb|d!|mb|p|nt|shevek: (bridgewise, what is it that makes Bj√∂rn Fallenius unique?)|pg||
nt|Walddk3: 11 rounds of 10 boards over two days|pg||
nt|Walddk3: I was going to wait until he appeared in the VG room|pg||
mb|3C|nt|benjent: This looks - single-dummy - like a simple major suit game. With the @s break, not so simple|pg||
mb|3D|mb|d|nt|shevek: now everyone will know who has the spades |pg||
nt|haans: 3@D say all suits are wrong|pg||
nt|Walddk3: He is the only player who has played for one country (Sweden), then another (USA)  ..... and then *back* to play for his native country! No-one every did that, so that is what ...|pg||
nt|Walddk3: makes him unique|pg||
mb|4C|nt|Walddk3: *ever|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|shevek: how about Zia?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: No|pg||
nt|Walddk3: He never played for Pakistan again after he played for USA|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: Fredin did just put the X in front of Wrang|pg||
nt|benjent: Didn't Kitty Bethe play for the US, then for England in a European, and then ... maybe ... back to playing for the US?|pg||
mb|p|pc|dK|nt|Walddk3: You could be right, Ben. I  am too young to remember :)|pg||
nt|benjent: heh heh|pg||
nt|shevek: 5-0 split is about 4%|pg||
nt|shevek: however after the bidding declarer knows at least 1-4|pg||
nt|benjent: I had an idea that JJ Ferris played cricket for Australia, then England, then Australia again ... but I've just checked, and he only switched once|pg||

mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c6|nt|benjent: I wonder what Fallenius is supposed to do if he wants to completely reject the idea of slam|pg||
nt|bg: spec pointed out that 5 hearts would ask for trump quality but N decide not to ask and took the fateful shot|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: 4H=14-16|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: 2H opening 10-13|pg||
nt|bg: no need for S to bid over 3nt pard has bid dia and he has club and spade cards|pg||
nt|benjent: Optimistic 6@h from Fredin, really. He has a minimum. Sharpish, but still a minimum. Fredin surely could have had another push for slam without just banging it out|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S may have recieved a lead directing x|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
