mb|p|mb|3C|nt|Walddk2: Situated in the heart of the Highveld, Gauteng is the smallest province in South Africa, with only 1.4% of the land area, but it is highly urbanised and, as of 2007, has a ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: population over 10 450 000, making it the most populous province in South Africa|pg||
nt|hcbfick: should it go 3@C 4@C?|pg||
mb|4C|nt|rado: some may use 4@D here as Leaping Michaels|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Johannesburg is the main city in Gauteng|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When properly pronounced, the first letter of the name Gauteng is a voiceless velar fricative, pronounced similarly to the "ch" in the German "achtung" or Scottish "loch." This ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: pronunciation is natural in both the Sesotho and Afrikaans languages|pg||
nt|rado: ty we start tomorow with matchpoints:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|rado: practical jump now:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And it is in Hebrew too, one of the languages I speak|pg||

mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|mb|5S|nt|hcbfick: Stephens cld have much less|pg||
nt|hcbfick: But now only 5?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Anyone for 4@D, Leaping Michaels with the West hand? Diamonds and a major, forcing|pg||
nt|hcbfick: I go with 4@C and 4@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rado: a better ttreatment is to use 4@D as both Majors and 4@C as other minor + unspecified Major|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This did not lead anywhere|pg||
pc|d7|nt|hcbfick: Eber wanted to extract info from partner and did not get what he was hoping for? |pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|pc|dQ|pg||
mc|13|nt|Walddk2: Stephens did not visualise such a strong hand opposite. Perhaps Eber should have bid the slam himself|pg||

nt|xenya: well strictly speaking, there is no game here for EW, though 3N might have a practical chance|pg||
nt|yo_yo: slam time|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Slam for NS, 6@S better|pg||
nt|sharkey: Cheap save for NS - it was hard for EW to enter due to the balanced hands|pg||
nt|sharkey: Slam coming up|pg||
mb|p|nt|chthonic: Slam a bit ambitious and does not make with 3-1 hearts|pg||
nt|xenya: sp 3 off might not be a great disaster -- we shall see|pg||
mb|3C|nt|haans: 3@C lead directing?|pg||

mb|4D|nt|haans: assume puppet|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|chthonic: Either in diamonds or hearts.|pg||
nt|chthonic: Dealing with multi -- assume NS will cope|pg||
nt|yo_yo: @H looks off|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and North might support them eventually|pg||
nt|yo_yo: or @D|pg||
nt|sharkey: E will be delighted to hear it's @S - dont know if he'll continue past game as no outside controls|pg||
mb|4H|nt|haans: multi been on for 40 years now time to find defense|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6NT is also a possibilty|pg||
mb|4S|nt|haans: but not for long :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: of course NT ok too :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so anything but @H OK  we think|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree|pg||
nt|sharkey: N - 4@H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|chthonic: That may spur action that will be regretted.|pg||
nt|chthonic: Nope.|pg||

mb|4N|nt|sybarra: 9 off the top  |pg||
nt|chthonic: Well done|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: they are playing bds 1 - 14|pg||
nt|xenya: S's sequence probably show a very good hand with long @Ds|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ok ok mos  @C might not make :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am never good in 2/2 fits |pg||
nt|sharkey: Dont know what 4 NT will accomplish here|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: now the lead of a @S could give another |pg||
nt|sybarra: actually can always lead up towards the q of QS |pg||
nt|haans: my choice for sure|pg||
nt|chthonic: 11 tricks should be easy|pg||
nt|haans: spade finesse = 12|pg||
nt|haans: low risk|pg||
mb|5C|nt|sybarra: q of @S |pg||
nt|yo_yo: the good old strong jump shift in action here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I like it|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: in imps you must lead spades best chance to get them down|pg||
nt|haans: time to pass|pg||
nt|xenya: vulnerable, i would sell out here|pg||
nt|sharkey: 5@C = One key card?|pg||
mb|6S|nt|rnmalik: N would like it be a declarer in 6 NT, protecting K@C|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not very fashionable here any more though|pg||
nt|sybarra: we may play 6 @D?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: with a puppet sequence Hughes may have thought the club was better |pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: looks as if @D are agreed |pg||
nt|rnmalik: except @H|pg||
nt|yo_yo: need to get that suit right ...|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont see S setting NT  given the qx of clubs|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah but he will|pg||
nt|rnmalik: on this bidding I think it would be 6@S|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no, agree shirley|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: many americans say S was not good enough for x + suit only simple overcall|pg||
nt|xenya: S feels more optimistic -- and perhaps he is right|pg||
pc|cA|nt|yo_yo: ooops now North has to think|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he didnt give correct reply if @S is meant|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont see where @S's agreed however|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no |pg||
pc|c2|nt|chthonic: Might have played a club at trick two to prevent third trump lead, maintaining control|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|haans: no gain in finesse sorry|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|yo_yo: Vorster took control then didnt know what to do, it seems to me|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rnmalik: qx@C became threat cards|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sybarra: maybe should have tried4 @S over 4 @D wonder if that would have helped?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i think if you blackwood, you have to go for it|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk4: How did 5@CX make on board 1?|pg||
nt|haans: S decarded a hearts on clubs|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Walddk4: Thx|pg||
nt|sybarra: and it was a @H  lead |pg||

pc|s3|pg||

nt|hcbfick: If one does use 4@C as Eber did and follow up with another bid surely he must have a monster?|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: had jumpt to 2@H or 3@H = not preemtive|pg||

nt|rnmalik: as the cards are placed 4@C+2@D+1@S=7|pg||
nt|ralfwil: that´s OK but perhaps there is a penalty situation|pg||
pc|c3|nt|haans: slam very easy with clubs lead|pg||

nt|mcphee: honor twice in @D also a consideration, as is a low @H toward the Q|pg||

mb|p|nt|newmoon: I mean SOUTH continues with a 3rd @D - and North ruffs in with the @S10|pg||

nt|newmoon: 3@S?|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3D|nt|haans: easy 3nt|pg||

pc|h8|pc|hJ|pg||

nt|vugraphzzc: Yes, Bosenberg has gone back to Johannesburg for the day|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thx|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|Walddk2: And a misunderstanding right away. 2@D meant as a transfer, interpreted as natural|pg||

nt|haans: 1@S in Acol?|pg||
nt|haans: all is quiet|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In my opinion a too strong hand for only 3@d. looks like partner has a 6-card suit and..|pg||
nt|newmoon: previous hand, West can perhaps choose 3@S first time?|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|sharkey: Kib suggests W shud bid 3@S - making it easy on E.  perhaps - not sure after pd's NV overcall and only 3 trumps.  Overbid?|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|sybarra: penunltimate bd.   here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: that´s an aspect for a possible 3nt|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|chthonic: I peeked.  NS made 5S in both of the final two hands...|pg||
nt|sharkey: I have to leave - ty all|pg||
nt|sharkey: bye|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but we all agree that 3@d was too weak|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mcphee: 1@S opening a tad shy but not without merit|pg||
nt|haans: rule of 19 say open <north |pg||
nt|newmoon: c u Carl  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: the good suit is what would make me do it|pg||
nt|mcphee: 2@H?|pg||
nt|mcphee: who knows npw|pg||
nt|haans: 2nt for me|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chthonic: Even a 2S bid should elicit a rais|pg||
nt|haans: not liking it|pg||
nt|xenya: why didn't S open 1N i wonder|pg||
nt|haans: vul?|pg||
nt|haans: and u have the answer|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps opposite a passed partner they play something else|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: play variable  vul & non vul|pg||
pc|h6|nt|chthonic: oh, my|pg||
nt|chthonic: a hand that was borderline opening passes?|pg||
nt|mcphee: good grief batman|pg||
nt|newmoon: in the OR East bid 2@D, thinking transfers were on after a balancing NT|pg||
nt|newmoon: Eber/Stephens not a regular pair|pg||
pc|h3|nt|xenya: ah vulnerable -- i see|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||
nt|mcphee: N just has too good a hand to pass 2@D in my book|pg||
nt|haans: pay back time :)|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I had passed on 1@s as S|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||
nt|xenya: still surprising she didn't rebid 1@S|pg||
nt|haans: good lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Vorster will wish she had bid game in a minute|pg||
nt|newmoon: pass is logical, yes|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|newmoon: but with Jx in partner's 5-card suit, South could make a false preference over 2@D/2@H rebids|pg||
nt|newmoon: and 1NT may keep opps out|pg||
nt|ralfwil: pass is probably the best in the long run|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h5|pc|s4|pc|c7|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|pc|s8|pc|s2|pg||
nt|xenya: 1N is quite a normal contract here -- but cards are very unfriendly |pg||
nt|sybarra: think she got a better lead|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Eber didnt have a good lead actually|pg||
nt|newmoon: there will be a hospitality break after bd 14 - probably 30 minutes|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|yo_yo: everything gives tricks|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s7|pc|sA|pg||
nt|haans: N were most likely to have @DQ|pg||
nt|chthonic: I would have opened, by the way...|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mcphee: it is an weird hand for N/S|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like 2 off -- like in the other room|pg||
pc|d2|nt|xenya: oh dear |pg||
pc|d7|pc|dT|pg||
nt|mcphee: N close to opening 1@S|pg||
nt|chthonic: It counts 12.0 on the K-R evaluator|pg||
nt|mcphee: S close to a 3@D rebid after hearing 1@S|pg||
pc|d4|nt|haans: ERROR?|pg||

mb|1D|mb|d|mb|2D|nt|Walddk2: Carol? I think Hughes passed|pg||
mb|2S|nt|hcbfick: Stephens will be familiar with Eber/Bosenberg's system so he shld just act accordingly.|pg||
