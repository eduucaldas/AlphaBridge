nt|Walddk2: Cold grand slam in clubs|pg||
nt|roswolf: as grands go this looks straightforward to bid|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|Walddk2: The sharks at MP would bid 7NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: its harder to count tricks in these hand so these two suited grands are pretty hard to get to|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|jillm:   roland what is 2s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6+ clubs, 11-15|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|lml: that actually makes it a lot easier|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: than a standard system|pg||
nt|roswolf: well they will have gadgets to cope|pg||
nt|jillm:  if north had opened a standard 1c east could have ocalled 1d and west could preempt and make things a little more difficult|pg||
nt|lml: it usually denies 4 card major in this type of system|pg||
nt|lml: but it doesnt say so on the card|pg||
nt|lml: you open 1@H and canape|pg||
nt|lml: if you had 34|pg||
nt|roswolf: i hope that the gadgets ARE there|pg||
nt|lml: if you had 4|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 2@S denies a 4-card major i think - they open 1@H with 4 spades and have a special bid (2@H opener) for 4 hearts and long minor|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT relay, 3NT in theory a balanced maximum|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Max it is|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe they count stiff ace as balanced|pg||
nt|lml: South has such a great hand here.  He needs to find out about hearts|pg||
nt|athene: the key is that both long suits are running|pg||
nt|roswolf: balanced is a slight stretch|pg||
nt|athene: south can rkcb in clubs and then perhaps spiral for the @HQ - but i am not sure you can get down to side queens|pg||
nt|lml: he may not have wanted to show a singleton ace|pg||
nt|athene: especially with clubs as trumps, you don't usually have enough room|pg||
nt|roswolf: le punt is likely too|pg||
nt|roswolf: the key is what 4@C is?|pg||
nt|lml: this is along the same paths as our system|pg||
nt|lml: 4@C here should be keycard|pg||
mb|4C!|mb|p|nt|athene: either 4@C or 4@D will be RKCB for clubs, i am sure|pg||
nt|lml: at least that is what I play|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We had a very impressive auction from Sweden earlier today where Bertheau pinpointed a vital jack with Nystr√∂m. They then bid the making 7@D on  AQJxx  Kxx  as opposed to the ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: failing 7@S   KQxxx  Axx|pg||
mb|4N!|nt|jillm:  they may have a method of breaking the relay to ask for side suit queen (or third rd control), and if they don't South might take a chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: if rkcb south will still be wondering about the heart position|pg||
nt|athene: 2 keycards + @CQ|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: ok, he doesn't look for the perfecto|pg||
nt|lml: Cooke couldnt find out what he needed to know|pg||

nt|mdgraham: I can have some fun here - Alan Kay and I used to play together regularly, and I know all these players well |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Are N-S really both from Northern Ireland?|pg||

nt|lestergold: South used to be Burn's regular partner and lives in London so does Ranis|pg||
nt|lestergold: Ranis recent emigre from US|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South is known affectionately as "Binkie", and is the inventor of Binkie Points - a rather abstruse method of hand evaluation |pg||
nt|lestergold: Mike Gold here good afternoon all|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|buffytvs: hi Mike and kibitzers|pg||
nt|lestergold: well will these distinguished seniors reach the cold grand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: quite an effective barrage by NS|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I would think so...|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Ray|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|lestergold: should be a good match Allerton a former under 2 world chamion|pg||
nt|lestergold: Frances Hindesn a verys trong player one of the very best lady players in England|pg||
nt|buffytvs: a prodigy :)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mdgraham: East taking the cash and letting the promise go|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: safe option by Dhondy|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@S is only down 2, EW can make 5@H |pg||
nt|buffytvs: I'll leave the explanation of the bidding to you Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: i havent a clue|pg||
nt|vugraph815: 2n is 6+ clubs and 3 hearts|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Hi Mike, Ray and Tony|pg||

nt|lestergold: hi Roland|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|vugraph815: 1d alerted transfer|pg||
nt|buffytvs: ok|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Frances Hinden (Finch) and Jeffrey Allerton (jallerton) are two of our regular vugraph commentators. They are also a pair away from the table|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lestergold: and a very strong pair at the table|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: perhpas...|pg||
mb|5D|nt|lestergold: club now down 3?|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, sorry 3 off|pg||
nt|vugraph815: sorry couldnt see the west discard|pg||
nt|lestergold: which actually would be a small profit for Dhondy|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North has quite a few "nuisance" cards outside his spade suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: n another day e/w would be cold for 6H|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: when the opps are playing a complex relay system, it's often a good idea to get into their auctions -- we'll see whther EW try to do that as the session goes on|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: well not a triumph for all these artificual bids whenthere are 13 top tricks in  denominations|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Interesting result from the CR|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I like Allerton's 3NT opposite 12-14|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lml: that should be looking for a second round control though really|pg||
nt|Walddk2: at these colours|pg||
nt|roswolf: does have style|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: yup linda|pg||
nt|Walddk2: West passed? That's criminal NV v V in my opinion|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jillm:   maybe 3c means something other than what west has|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: so bid 1NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: unlikely to go 6 off though|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|Walddk2: You can't pass and let the opponents have a free run|pg||

nt|roswolf: murky auction time|pg||

mb|1N|nt|vugraph815: 10-13|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: hi Justin|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lestergold: with this barrage psyche no chance of N/S getting into auction but they cant make much in any case|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I don't think NS were ever getting in over 3@C or 2NT, whatever West could do to show clubs|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lestergold: likely to be flat|pg||
nt|lestergold: especially as even 3h is off|pg||
pc|c8|nt|xenya: although 3 makes thanks to a favourable spade distribution|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh yes sorry u right|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6 off? any bets on this?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think impossible to identify the wasted values here and 4 is normal to reach|pg||
nt|xenya: which menas that 4 also makes -- but only double dummy of course|pg||
nt|buffytvs: i think they'll get a second diamond trick in the wash|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d9|nt|lestergold: yes double heart finesse|pg||

nt|lml: North will bid something I think|pg||
nt|athene: 5@H is a lot to bid |pg||
nt|athene: especially with three small spades|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: he assumed his partner was short in spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@H is natural in 3rd|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: 1h nat 3rd in hand|pg||
nt|lml: he just had to bid with a passing partner and this vul|pg||
mb|1S|mb|3C!|nt|lml: I knew he would|pg||
nt|athene: 3@C fit-showing jump|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They have reversed 1@H and 1@S, but only in 1st and 2nd|pg||
nt|lml: tough call for West|pg||
nt|lml: pass seems right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Do you bid 1@S or double with East's cards?|pg||
nt|roswolf: should pass imo|pg||
nt|lml: I am a doubler|pg||
nt|lml: but I wont argue with 1@S|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S looks ok; you expect to double hearts later on if partner hasn't raised spades already|pg||
nt|jillm:  i bid 1s and then double next time|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed|pg||
nt|lml: he has quite a good hand|pg||
nt|lml: sometimes you are at the three level the next time around though|pg||
nt|athene: west's double should be a responsive double of hearts, i think|pg||
nt|athene: that's a good general agreement for use against all these artificial raises|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|d|mb|p|nt|jillm:  if I double I could be at 3 level next time around also, with my partner not having enough to bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: another principle situation where you need general agreements|pg||
nt|lml: well here you are he doubled in a millisecond|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jillm:  I do not like west's pass at all, he knows his partner is void|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lml: in this situation though I am not sure it suggest 5-4-4|pg||
nt|roswolf: well they have penalised too early|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|pc|s4|pg||
nt|lml: I think East would double with a good hand and some support|pg||
nt|lml: but still he has to have a heart void|pg||

nt|lml: 4@S is a big bid though.  You don't have a great fit.  The @HA is wasted|pg||
nt|lml: maybe|pg||
nt|athene: 3NT perhaps, relying on that @H10|pg||
nt|athene: if you can stop south getting in...|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think 4@S was a great bid from one of the few lady players in this competition|pg||
nt|athene: taking the money looked reasonable with no game certain to make, or even reasonable sure|pg||
nt|jillm:  partner must have a very good hand at this vulnerability |pg||

nt|wilkinsona: looks like hearts..|pg||
mb|r|nt|buffytvs: dbl = stolen bid therefore hearts...?|pg||
nt|lestergold: at these colours fairly standard to make any old bid if you have 13 cards|pg||
nt|justin c: 3N might survive|pg||
nt|lestergold: not now they have identified heart fit|pg||
nt|buffytvs: should pass by N here show spades?|pg||

mb|5H|nt|mdgraham: surprised at 2@D on a 4/6 major suit shape|pg||

nt|lestergold: oh well its all academical|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: but he only has @HA as a trick. It depends how strong 2@D can be|pg||

nt|lestergold: my son wouldnt touch any weak no trumps with a barge pole|pg||
nt|buffytvs: loks as if Dixon treated his hand as a 1-suiter?|pg||
nt|lestergold: nor would I|pg||
nt|buffytvs: if that were my only option, I would not bid on his hand myself|pg||
nt|lestergold: a one suiter vul of q to the umph!|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5 umph|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lestergold: pteempted himself out of laydown game|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North worried about spades, so reraiss to 3@H to make it difficult for East to protect  |pg||
pc|s2|nt|wilkinsona: clearly NS adopting a policy of active bidding|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: cards very favourable for Mr. Dixon's attemopt to give a massive penalty against a part score|pg||
nt|buffytvs: the saving grace is that the @CQ is doubleton|pg||

pc|dK|pc|dT|pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|lestergold: and north with powerful six card suit and solid point count was a bit strong for 3h |pg||

nt|lml: with short clubs that might have been the lead|pg||
nt|lml: better to take his heart play from dummy|pg||
nt|jillm:  other table went down with diamond shift trick two|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: @SJ lead ducked to the stiff queen next door. 12 tricks|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: yes, leading a heart from dummy is going to gain a trick whenever the @HK is right, regardless of the trump break|pg||
nt|athene: so i think declarer should make 2@H even with stronger defence|pg||
nt|lml: at the other table North ruffed the last diamond with the @HK instead of the @H8|pg||
nt|lml: which seems a little strange|pg||
nt|jillm:  ew gave north a problem and north did not have count on hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|jillm:  although if ruffed low could always pull last trump|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|nt|buffytvs: not this time...|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: interesting hand here|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mdgraham: Direct approach from East|pg||
nt|lestergold: and i think cold for 11 tricks so what will vul Ranis do?|pg||
nt|lestergold: his opener a little short of defensive tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: a chastened mr. Dixon a little more conservative at these colours|pg||

mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3S!|nt|lestergold: perfectly sound opener but he cannot fancy defenmding here|pg||

nt|justin c: 4@S (over 4@H) not much of a bargain anyway|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: cold for ten in 4@H, I think - two hearts and a spade to lose  |pg||
nt|lestergold: actually only ten tricks in hearts because of lack of entries to take heart finesse|pg||
nt|mdgraham: can't get to dummy for the heart hook|pg||
nt|lestergold: thx spec for pointing that out|pg||

nt|athene: transfer responses worked well, buying NS a tempo|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D!|mb|p|mb|1S!|nt|roswolf: they should bill|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 2@H shows a good spade raise|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|athene: (south denied 4 spades with 1@D)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: not sure this is exactly a good raise though :) maybe they switched things around|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: remember that South is limited|pg||

nt|athene: i suppose it's good in the context of 14-16 NT|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: Was not easy for Frances Hinden to switch to a club at trick 2 in the other room (heart lead). She went for a diamond, and then 4@S could no longer be defeated|pg||
pc|h8|pg||

nt|lml: yes he knows who has the @CK|pg||

nt|Walddk2: As it is, N-S in the other room did very well to make South declarer. I would also have switched to a diamond I must confess|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: the rationale is this|pg||
nt|jillm:  even if he makes the imaginative play it would not cost west to rise with the king, there are no diamond tricks coming|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|sK|nt|lml: it does avoid the diamond play|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sA|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|pc|h3|pc|d3|pg||
mc|9|nt|jillm:  how can it cost to rise king, you can see you have no diamond tricks and the only other possible trick you could have is a trump|pg||

nt|mdgraham: agreed|pg||
nt|lestergold: yup|pg||
nt|lestergold: a bit of a misfit hand here|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|lestergold: N/S may reach 4S here which can be made unless east leads or switches to an early club|pg||
mb|1H!|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: but I don't think it will be made -- surely it's right to cash the top diamonds and finesse in clubs when the @DQ doesn't appear?|pg||
mb|1S!|mb|p|nt|xenya: is 2@H systemic or tactical?|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|lestergold: latter id say |pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: although there may be entry problems with that plan|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|lestergold: reasonable in fourth position|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: oh quite|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraph815: 2s was invitational with 5s|pg||

pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: now will Hinden find the killing club switch?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||

nt|buffytvs: I think so, yes|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||
nt|lestergold: should she have found it?|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|wilkinsona: how did Victor read that..?|pg||
nt|lestergold: the dim switch looked natural nough with three small in dummy visible|pg||
nt|lestergold: because Silverstone knows that hinden cant see his hand and has probably attacked dims with something in the suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: at any rate I dont think we can be hard o Hinden I cant see how she could work out that a club was the killer|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep, and the size of the spot perhaps...|pg||
nt|buffytvs: this isn't over yet actually...|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|hT|nt|buffytvs: oh sorry, it is -- had a mirage about the heart spots|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||

nt|athene: true, that's another points :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: pity diamonds were trumps|pg||
nt|athene: yes, maybe better to make spades trumps for beer purposes|pg||
nt|athene: not just because they are a better fit|pg||
nt|jillm:  wow it looks like this board was stolen at the other table|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed petty larceny|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@S  5+ hearts  11-15|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|athene: 2@C would be both majors 8-13 so if he shows spades it's a max|pg||
mb|1N|nt|roswolf: hate 1nt|pg||
nt|athene: EW playing X as a 1@S overcall and 1NT as a t/o double of hearts, by the look of it|pg||
nt|lml: is 1NT takeout?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to the camp|pg||

nt|lml: it seems reasonable to me|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: i think west is just about worth 2@S - passing first time over 2@H in other room was a little bit wet|pg||
nt|lml: I think he bid 4@H with the intent of doubling 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: club lead|pg||
nt|athene: play partner for the @HA, i suppose|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hJ|nt|Walddk2: They can tap this to pieces. I don't think a club lead is good|pg||
nt|athene: yes you are right|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: it looks pretty likely that spades are precisely 4-4-4-1 round the table|pg||
nt|roswolf: -2 if declarer is lucky|pg||

pc|h6|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|c4|nt|xenya: but it seems unusual to try for a ruff holding AJx of trumps|pg||
nt|lestergold: overtrick here depends on finding the Ax club position probably will cos its the natural way to play them|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h7|pc|cJ|pg||

nt|lestergold: yes then defence cant unravel their 5 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: that we be hard to find play|pg||

nt|lestergold: yes i think dixon's doubkle was an indisciplined noise|pg||
nt|vugraph815: silverstone thinking|pg||
nt|lestergold: if hearts was a natural buid on his left what on earth was dixon's double meant to tell Silverston?|pg||

pc|sK|nt|lestergold: this could be a swing because 4h has no play|pg||
nt|lestergold: kill point|pg||

pc|cT|pc|h2|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|dQ|pc|d4|pg||
nt|athene: it had to be a diamond into the @DAJ|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|h6|pc|dT|pg||
nt|lml: I was trying to think about what is the safest play in trumps since obviously he has no idea they arent splitting|pg||
nt|roswolf: he might make dd|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And now they gave it back. What a rollercoaster hand|pg||
nt|jillm:  east did very well to lead club Ace and shift to spade king|pg||
nt|athene: he has to know which black winner to cash|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: if he tries the @S10, it's no good|pg||

nt|lestergold: no i cant see how it was right not to test hearts first|pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Binkie shaking his head, perhaps|pg||

mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|xenya: but he had all the entries he needed (all=1 in this case)|pg||

nt|xenya: that's right|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|lestergold: well the 3d bid forced Ranis to overbis as 3S would have been a slight underbid but fortunately Binkie had Ranis's bid!|pg||

nt|athene: in situations like that you have to go back over the play mentally and remember all the spot cards played by the defence early on|pg||
nt|lml: its one of those you think about after the match and try to figure out what you should have done (not double dummy) but generally|pg||
nt|athene: almost always they give you the key to the distribution|pg||
mb|2H|nt|roswolf: light weak 2|pg||
nt|jillm:  by his thinking it seems like north is trying to figure that out now |pg||
nt|Walddk2: So take your time and ask yourself some questions. There is no prize for finishing first|pg||
nt|lml: well he actually does have a heart suit|pg||
nt|lml: it seems normal to me at this vul|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I like the pace at this table, but Garvey surely played too fast on 11|pg||
nt|jillm:  and it is very hard to go on to the next board when you do that, very hard to let it go|pg||
nt|athene: playing fast can induce the defenders into hasty innacuracies|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|Walddk2: and yourself|pg||
nt|athene: if you think you can speed the whole table up and it will benefit you more, you do it, surely|pg||
nt|Walddk2: which was what happened when he tried to cash @S10 which he should know would not stand up|pg||
nt|jillm:  grant baze was the master of that, and barry crane|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the other room west tried 3@H which wasnt a success|pg||
nt|lml: I think it is easier to let that board go for Garvey.  He has been having a good session|pg||
nt|athene: Meckstroth too|pg||
nt|lml: he thinks he has enough... he wishes he made it but ...|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|roswolf: east should pass - he must have seen pard's weak 2's before at favorable|pg||

nt|lml: very weird|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: West will pull out|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: oops|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why would he?|pg||
nt|roswolf: nope northern stubborness|pg||
nt|lml: I guess he had told his story already so you are right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It must be partner's decision|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe he has 9 tricks outside hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: w says the sequence gives him an option to pass|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: spade lead now for lots of tricks|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|sK|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jillm:  this is going to be a push |pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: or 5 down|pg||
nt|athene: declarer going all out to take the diamond finesse|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The heart suit is dead now|pg||
nt|lml: North has 2 heart tricks now|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think -5 is deserved here|pg||
nt|athene: north doesn't know that his partner has a second heart|pg||
nt|lml: if NOrth wins and plays clubs it could be worse|pg||
nt|jillm:  down more if North takes ace and shifts to club after running spades|pg||
nt|athene: he looks a bit silly if he captures this and east actually started with @HQ10x|pg||
nt|lml: can East really have that and play in notrump?|pg||
nt|roswolf: then he would have bid 4@H|pg||
nt|lml: yeppers|pg||
nt|athene: well, peoplehave been known to play in 3nt with 4-card support for a weak 2|pg||
nt|lml: still when you are looking at down 2 maybe you should just take it|pg||
nt|roswolf: EAST CLEARLY HAS A DOUBLETON|pg||
nt|lml: down 1|pg||
nt|roswolf: sorry to shout|pg||
nt|lml: I like beating non vul undoubled contracts without worrying too much about undertricks|pg||
nt|lml: North has to be very sure after all East can have anything|pg||
nt|athene: as far as the score goes, an extra 50 or two isn't so important, true|pg||
nt|athene: but psychologically, if you take the absolute maximum every time, on defence|pg||
nt|jillm:    east should have more than he does|pg||
nt|athene: it really crushes the opps psychologically|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sT|nt|roswolf: -5 here we come|pg||
nt|lml: so its decent to win it and here it pays dividends|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: if you take them three down, not two down, and four down, not three down, ever single time|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|lml: sometimes you get 5 down when you were trying to take 1 down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Conclusion. N-S make 3NT. They should have bid, vulnerable|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Cooke's pause worries me|pg||
nt|athene: declarer's @S10 was a nice play|pg||
nt|roswolf: clearly south has his doubts too|pg||
nt|lml: on the positive side declarer is pretty well going at least 2 down no matter what|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe @S9 would have been a better choice as North's return|pg||
nt|athene: but the play in hearts must have some significance|pg||
nt|athene: surely north would hold up his @HA if there was any danger|pg||

nt|mdgraham: also 3N if NS don't lead spades|pg||

nt|lestergold: but i felt that the diamond losers combined with east's 4 hearts was going to be extremely difficult for declafrer as it proved|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|mdgraham: and the usual interference....|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade lead is now guaranteed against all contracts|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: but 10 imps back on 5|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: seems declarer can perhaps get home if he wins the spade return in dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: a trick should be lost in each suit here|pg||
nt|lestergold: butv silverson has to return a spade so that Dixon can switch to the club the defence timing is crucial here|pg||
nt|lestergold: otherwise there will be no club loser|pg||
nt|lestergold: returning a diamond hoping to setup a ruff will be to slow a defence|pg||

nt|jillm:  at the other table they also o'called 1nt but north bid 2d so ew got back to hearts,  garvey made a nice pass here, a good suit and an entry|pg||
nt|athene: big opportunity for Small here|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||

nt|jillm:  another potential swing|pg||
nt|roswolf: especially on bds 17-20|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S opener was really something|pg||
mb|3S|nt|jillm:  yup|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hinden's 4@S is my style|pg||
nt|athene: now NS play 4@C as non-leaping michaels i think so south will be a bit stuck maybe|pg||
mb|4C|nt|athene: he can double or just bid 4@C anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: a great bid by the lady again|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: shows c and h|pg||
nt|jillm:  i think you need a better hand to overcall 4c|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed|pg||
nt|athene: garve might like his hand facing 5-5 in hearts and clubs :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe Cooke put a club among his hearts|pg||
nt|roswolf: lots of prime controls|pg||
nt|jillm:  i didn't realize he showed hearts also|pg||
nt|athene: he has room for 4@D as a generic slam try|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Non-leaping Michaels, clubs and hearts|pg||
nt|athene: but he may feel he is too good|pg||
nt|lml: he has quite a nice hand here|pg||
nt|athene: or you could play 4@D = slam try in @H, and 4@S = slam try in @C |pg||
nt|roswolf: north is odds on to explore and may punt a slam|pg||
nt|athene: lots of room, just a Q of agreements|pg||
nt|jillm:  if his partner is supposed to be 5/5 and he is looking for slam he might bid 6h to set clubs up for pitches|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|roswolf: indeed 5nt pick a slam is possible|pg||
mb|5D|nt|lml: he could easily bid the heart slam |pg||
nt|roswolf: going a scientific route|pg||
nt|jillm:  roland, what was 5d?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I have no idea|pg||
nt|athene: looks as though 4@D was natural - or Cooke thought it was|pg||
nt|Walddk2: D support I guess|pg||
nt|roswolf: natural|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: overboard|pg||
nt|lml: this might be hard to beat|pg||
nt|roswolf: could make 5@H with the chinese finesse i suppose|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I think you can make 5@H legitimately|pg||
nt|athene: well lead @HJ certainly picks up the hearts|pg||
nt|athene: so you have just two diamond losers|pg||
nt|jillm:  i would be very nervous if I were North playing a 4/3 after a preempt by opponent|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jillm:  has to shorten the "long" suit right away|pg||
nt|lml: I think there might have been a shot on a small spade lead but not this one|pg||

nt|athene: maybe pitch a @D from dummy on this trick|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s7|pc|s2|pg||

mc|10|nt|athene: but even so, it looks as though they had a misunderstanding over 4@D as well|pg||
nt|roswolf: an original push|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 17 also played in game next door|pg||

nt|mdgraham: a somewhat creative defence|pg||

pc|s5|nt|lestergold: because this is what tends to happen|pg||

mb|3D|mb|4D!|mb|p|nt|justin c: grand slam here for EW|pg||
nt|lml: hello|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Linda Lee|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@D may not be everyone's cup of tea in first, but it's their style|pg||
nt|athene: no weak-2@D opener available for NS (they play Multi) but Garvey would probably have bid 3@D anyway|pg||
nt|lml: I am old fashioned.  I remember when three level preempts used to show 7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That was in the 1930's, Linda|pg||
nt|athene: 7? he has 8! :) one to spare :)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: oh, you mean seven cards in your suit|pg||
nt|lml: its not just that he has 6, its the quality of the suit and the fact that his hand is flat|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But it does make it harder for E-W to bid their reasonable grand slam|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 4@D is very pre-emptive - west has to bid 4major on a wide range of strengths|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Tough for Hirst to express his values. 4@H could be anything|pg||
nt|lml: well I would bid again on the East hand.  Lets see if he does|pg||
nt|athene: because going to the 5-level voluntarily is very serious indeed|pg||
nt|lml: then Hirst should get excited|pg||
nt|lml: if East takes a bid then they might still get quite high|pg||
nt|athene: South's decision over 4@D was interesting too - he knows opps prohbably have at least a small slam on|pg||
nt|roswolf: rehi all|pg||
nt|lml: 4@S seems like a reasonable slam try|pg||
nt|athene: one theory is that if you bid 5@D there, west will bid 5major showing values (or double) and you make it *easier* for them to bid a slam|pg||
nt|lml: hi Geoff|pg||
nt|athene: but if you just pass, west will bid a heavy 4major|pg||
nt|athene: and east might pass with a heavy 4@D|pg||
nt|athene: and there they rest|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: as indeed happened|pg||
nt|lml: well you got it right|pg||
nt|athene: this is why people like to pre-empt lots these days :)|pg||
nt|lml: I would have bid again|pg||
nt|lml: 4@S is pretty safe|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|nt|lml: West will know you have 6 and on a terrible hand he can often pass|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||
nt|roswolf: while pre-empts are nasty why no forward move?|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is too cautious imo|pg||
nt|lml: I would make a forward move even if that weren't true|pg||
nt|lml: I agree complete with you|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||
nt|justin c: after the 3@D opening you probably dont want to be in 7|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lml: but then again you convinve yourself that things might not be spltting|pg||
pc|h5|nt|justin c: increased chance of bad major suit break|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pg||

mb|p|nt|buffytvs: I believed the 1@S bid :)|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|lestergold: what is this 2d nbid flannery?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: throwing a diamond - if they play another, run @H10 and throw your last diamond - that might work |pg||
mb|2N|nt|lestergold: switch to diamond|pg||
nt|mdgraham: don't mention the F-word - Roland might be watching|pg||
nt|vugraph815: 2d is explained as weak with both majors|pg||
nt|lestergold: i tell you io have been temptedt to use another even worse f word|pg||
nt|lestergold: well without a spokem in the wheel e/w will play in at least 6|pg||

nt|buffytvs: that would be my guess|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D!|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|lestergold: 7 is actully not a good contract as it needs both majors to behave u need better odds for a grand|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: 2d bid with most of ones assets in the form of defensive values in diamonds not my idea of a bid in fornt of partner |pg||

nt|Walddk4: She has a much better hand that she has shown|pg||

nt|lml: West's double is just a touch aggressice with 4HCP but I think we all would fo it|pg||
mb|4D|mb|d|nt|athene: you could bid 1@H i suppose but you don't expect it to work|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1@S has scope|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: http://www.ebu.co.uk/events/?eventid=12  for standings after round 3|pg||
nt|roswolf: south will bid on?|pg||
nt|lml: he might|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@D is only 1 down|pg||
nt|athene: not easy - opps were forced to guess and 4@H might be going down|pg||
nt|jillm:  south knows his partner has 5d and a distributional hand, it is good insurance to bid|pg||
nt|athene: north could have a spade trick for instance|pg||
nt|lml: it is a close decision|pg||
nt|lml: part of it is style|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes and he knows e/w are conservative bidders (mostly)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I like Jill's "take out insurance" theory|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe both contracts are 1 down, but since 4@H could easily make, it's safer to bid 5@D|pg||
nt|lml: in fact if diamonds weren't 2-1|pg||
nt|lml: it would make|pg||
mb|5D|mb|d|nt|athene: he knows that opps don't have a trick source in either black suit - it might all come down to whether he thinks they are in an 8- or 9- card heart fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: he is looking at 1.5 defensive tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: I think that is a very reasonable decision|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: not much to the play, anyway|pg||

nt|lestergold: how is his pard going to take him for 9 and a half playing tricks??|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's quite hard to get 700 these days |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Bowles/Howard a small bidding misunderstanding|pg||
nt|buffytvs: so the match is stll tied!|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..bet he wished that 6 clubs rolled in though..|pg||
nt|buffytvs: NS found a good save in 5@D here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: splinters on after a double?  "Yes"  "No"|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: that was comical|pg||
nt|xenya: which is rather surprising -- it's a standard sequence|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|lestergold: well here the distinguished seniors need to replicate the excellent save ound in the open room|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: all on the last board it seems|pg||
nt|lestergold: could be a tie|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D!|nt|lestergold: but when vul the 5 level for thec opposition tends to kick in|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: quiet pass from south|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course the young couple need to find the good game of course |pg||
nt|buffytvs: in the OR, South bid 1@D over the 1@C opening, and they were off to the races|pg||
mb|d|mb|4D!|nt|lestergold: how could it ossibly be other than a splinter?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, possibly. A matter of agreement.|pg||
nt|buffytvs: the dbl could have the same effect here|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm now will Silverstone find the tieing bid?|pg||
nt|buffytvs: i would think so|pg||
nt|lestergold: should i my opinion|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The transfer response backfired. If a natural 1@H, N-S would have been out of it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That's life|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes|pg||
nt|buffytvs: an intrinsic drawback of txfrs|pg||
nt|lestergold: he knows it cant be expensive and he knows that 4H is likely making|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: sure you would have x for take out ..or not Roland?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I play 1@H as take-out|pg||
nt|lestergold: Roland here to witness the kill|pg||
mb|5D|mb|d|mb|p|nt|lestergold: north's double implies hearts so on general principles one cannot be pre=empting in a suit shown by the opposition|pg||
nt|lestergold: well done Silverstone a very experienced player|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: so what happens in the event of a tie?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|roswolf: 15-15 vps|pg||
nt|lestergold: cos it is going to be!!|pg||
nt|buffytvs: no extra bds then?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: in any case at this level you would not expect elemenatary misunderstandings of this kind|pg||
nt|roswolf: nope|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: It is best in practice, though, to have "system on" as your default agreement. It might not be best in theory, but it saves a lot of memory strain|pg||
nt|lestergold: I agree Mike|pg||
nt|xenya: very true|pg||
nt|lestergold: its also best to have 'common sense' on at all times|pg||
nt|buffytvs: hi Jan|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No, it's a league|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Just a dull tie|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Round 4 of 7|pg||
nt|lestergold: not dull its been a fascinating match here|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h8|pc|hA|nt|mdgraham: For example, it is quite possible to play that 1@S-dbl-4@h is to play|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|sA|pc|d4|nt|lestergold: yes in about 1840|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mdgraham: Thanks operator!|pg||
