mb|3S|mb|p|nt|mohitz: hi Sridhar, Anindya|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: hi mohit|pg||
nt|psridhar: that 3s is systemically a preemptive raise-should be used with a bit of mix else it can become predictable|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|psridhar: here for eg E has a borderline decision ; if he knows 3s is weak he will get in ..like he did now|pg||
nt|vugraphzxn: http://royale.hpage.com/welcome_66997828.html for scores till round 10|pg||
nt|psridhar: if east is worried that south might have 'trapped' by bidding 3s he may pass|pg||
nt|psridhar: now ew may bid and make 5d vul game|pg||
nt|rishabh: W should bid 4NT to choose a minor?|pg||
mb|4N|nt|psridhar: west also has a borderline decision -doesnt know how strong his pd is for passing first and then balancing|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mohitz: true|pg||
nt|rishabh: yes this rates to have some @ss with p|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rishabh: lucky make|pg||

pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||

mb|d|mb|2S|nt|mohitz: partscore deal here|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|psridhar: over 2s many play good bad 2nt- here for eg direct 3d by E would show a good hand and 3d via 2nt( artifical) wd show weaker competing hand|pg||
nt|rishabh: W would be tempted to bid game now|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: i happen to know that this Ew pair play bad good 2nt- that is direct 3d shows competing type|pg||
nt|rishabh: may be they play the other way round|pg||
nt|vugraphzxn: Anil asking the to East..|pg||
nt|psridhar: that also explains the pass by ew-well judged|pg||

mb|p|pc|h6|nt|psridhar: wow it might even make|pg||

mb|1S|mb|1N|mb|d|nt|psridhar: usually in such situations the side having higher hcp ends up declaring nt|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|psridhar: but it is 20-20 here :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|mohitz: KRV doesn't like his opening :)|pg||

nt|psridhar: Weak defense but shape for playing strength|pg||
nt|mohitz: whats your opinion on overcalling 1NT on 15 counts at such vul, sridhar?|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|psridhar: it is not 15 hcp alone mohit-but the 3 aces that anil knows to evaluate:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|d|nt|mohitz: true but nothing much in that hand apart from the 3 aces|pg||

nt|mohitz: 3@HX+2|pg||
nt|psridhar: yday there was heated discussion on what to open on 6m and 5M- here for eg by opening 1c E has lost the 8 card spd fit|pg||
mb|p|pc|h8|nt|vugraphzxn: East says sorry putting dummy..not sure why|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|nt|psridhar: i firmly hold the view that u open 1s on min 5-6 and 1c on max 5-6|pg||
