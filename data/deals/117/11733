pc|h7|pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||

nt|psridhar: competing i suppose|pg||

pc|h6|pc|h8|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||

nt|jaapfr: 3@S-1 decent result|pg||
pc|cT|pc|s5|pc|c2|pc|c8|pg||

mc|8|nt|jain: so looks like a decent set for EW which shd push them places |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: tx|pg||
nt|psridhar: direct 3s shd be weak and X of 2s and then 3s shd contain some dfense|pg||
