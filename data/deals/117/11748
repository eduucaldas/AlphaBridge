nt|xenya: michaels would help|pg||
nt|jcwla: Get those two-suiters in early.|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: Bertheau could have shown sp+d|pg||
nt|janm: Vul vs not, Bertheau chooses to overcall 1@s instead of making a Michaels bid, so it sounds as if he's not going to try to get diamonds into the picture|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: assuming 1H meant hearts|pg||
mb|3D|nt|yuval10: NOW he is|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Wrong! He's willing to balance with 3@d with both opponents limited|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: yes, but weaker than if showing it directly|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h4|nt|janm: 1@h was alerted just because it was limited by the Strong Club system? Or is there something else?|pg||

nt|janm: West was heavy for the 2@h bid, but sensibly decided that the 3 level belongs to the opponents (sensibly in general, even if not on this hand)|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c7|nt|yuval10: lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: and claim..|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N!|mb|p|nt|jcwla: In the ongoing debate between MP lovers and IMP lovers, this board is Exhibit 972 for the MP side.  In IMPs, bidding to a good but un-making slam incurs a big penalty here.|pg||
mb|4C!|mb|p|nt|janm: Yes, if S can find out that partner has 3154 with the spade Q and minor Aces, he'll certainly want to bid slam - whether 6@s, 6@d or 6NT isn't clear|pg||

nt|vugraphzzq: 6-7 zz 3-1-5-4|pg||

mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzzq: 4H even number of aces|pg||
nt|yuval10: 6NT is the only contract with a slight chance, as it appeares|pg||
nt|janm: The problem is that an EW pair who happens to play this against a NS that stay out (probably not a good pair remember - you ought to bid this one) is going to lose a big swing - ...|pg||
nt|janm: that's why IMP pairs doesn't do a great job of sorting out which pairs are best.|pg||
nt|yuval10: A@h lead will give it away, for instance|pg||
nt|xenya: well a small chance if E leads @HA or goes up|pg||

nt|yuval10: but how do you enter W ?|pg||
nt|janm: The spade lead starts attaching the entries to the red suits - I don't see how he can get the 9th trick unless they have to give him a 4th spade|pg||
nt|yuval10: if N, while in with the 2nd @h, play @s ?|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sQ|nt|bg: do not need to enter W N will doit or give 9th trick in spades|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|yuval10: that is, if declarer knows to play exactly A@d, AK@c|pg||
nt|bg: true but as specs we know how to play it;))|pg||
nt|janm: It does look as if N will be end-played eventually - suppose E plays A and a diamond here; S plays a club. Then heart to the Q, another club, cash the clubs, exit with a heart|pg||
nt|janm: N shows out on the second diamond, and surely S has to have at least 6 and probably 7 clubs for the 3@c bid, so the hand is going to be pretty double dummy for East|pg||

nt|janm: I don't think it matters what S does here - if he ducks, E can't go wrong |pg||

pc|cA|pg||
nt|Walddk3: 2 more matches after dinner|pg||
nt|bg: now E has to be careful to cash all three clubs|pg||
nt|janm: Interesting heart - I was thinking he'd want to play a club, but this is essentially the same position - E should know the shape now, and presumably (from the opening bid) also ...|pg||
nt|janm: knows that N has the AK of hearts|pg||

nt|xenya: this set started with 3 rather dull hands, but it became truly fascinating towards the end|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: Östberg toughing spades, hearts and clubs|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|dT|nt|janm: Of course it's always easier for us than for the players, since we're looking at all the cards, but E should be also, since he "knows" N has the heart AK and can't have more than 3 ...|pg||

nt|vugraphzzq: 2 minutes for this board...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcwla: Agreed, a fascinating segment.  As we reach the end, a big thank you to Roland Wald, to our excellent VG operator, Johan Wahlberg, to Jan Martel, Vladimir Ivanov, Bruce Gowdy, and ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yuval Yener, and to all specs.|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|yuval10: should be a quick claim in 4@s|pg||

nt|yuval10: was a great set for EW up to this point|pg||
mb|d|nt|yuval10: oops|pg||
nt|janm: It's worth the risk to take away the opponents' bidding space on what might be a slam hand. Especially after a strong club and vague DBL - EW know they have a bunch of HCPs but ...|pg||

pc|s4|pc|h8|nt|yuval10: i do, after such a frustrating session, they're entitled to unleash it a little bit :)|pg||
nt|janm: I think that East first thought that 4NT was minors and then when W bid 5@s he decided that it was Blackwood and he had shown no aces when he had 1 so he bid 6|pg||
mc|11|nt|r_tibre: if opps have misbid, they are anyway paying the price.. but if not, u gifting them a few for nothing|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: Thx all. We´ll be back at 19:00|pg||
