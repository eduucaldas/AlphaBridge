pc|c5|pg||
nt|woozle: On a club return, finessing is a quick down one, or rising and playing a club next means that he will need to find a winning guess in spades|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|petergill: the challenge here is to bid 6@H|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: on 16 as a spec points out Bd 16:  Buchen set up the squeeze - just leading clubs beats the contract regardless|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|nt|woozle: Hard to see what was wrong with spade to the ace, diamond hook - guaranteed on the diamond finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: hi erin|pg||
nt|athene: if west doubles a 1@C opener, EW will lock into hearts |pg||
nt|athene: trump break might prove a bit annoying|pg||
mb|2N|nt|petergill: With a Cayne match on BBO, and Ron Klinger at the other table, we have plenty of competing attractions, but the four players at this table are all very good indeed at bridge|pg||
nt|woozle: North has a number of possible approaches here...some would bid 1S, some a forcing heart raise, some a splinter.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|woozle: I like Hughes' choice - a bit strong (and skewed) for a splinter, and 1S can make it hard to promise four card heart support later, especially if the auction gets competitive|pg||
nt|woozle: I'm not sure on the rebid though - anybody know their structure?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: west might now just bid 4@H - but it's the sort of hand where you really, really want partner to have a fifth trump|pg||
nt|petergill: South might double 41H|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@H|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Hi Michael and Marshall|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: 3H = shortage in other major|pg||
mb|4D|nt|marlowepi: hello roland, erin, michael & specs|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: @CJ lead is best|pg||
nt|petergill: except North is not on lead|pg||
nt|athene: unfortunately, east is declarer :)|pg||
nt|woozle: Somebody suggested suit below, which would probably mean that 3H=short spades. Kind of mixed news for North, but he does at least have a lot of spades to ruff, and some filling ...|pg||
nt|woozle: cards in South's long suits|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: 4D = void spade and DA|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mwigor: hi marshall|pg||
nt|woozle: Apparently they're on good systemic ground, except that the first round cue style has left North in the dark about the club control|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: Hello everyone :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: players dont usually want to be anonymous until at least Baord 5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi chick|pg||
nt|mwigor: hi cornelia|pg||
nt|mwigor: south had a tough problem|pg||
nt|mwigor: forcing to the 5-level feels like too much on an aceless 4333 though|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont think he meant to force to the five level by cuebidding|pg||
nt|cindy:  hi all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome cindy|pg||
nt|athene: i guess north couldn't bid 2@S over the double, for whatever reason|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: no - but she raised 4@d to 5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: they ended up at that level, but the 3H bid itself is not forcing to that level|pg||
nt|athene: or perhaps he just chose not to|pg||
nt|athene: but if 2@S first time was a weak jump shift, north must be worried that he hasn't really described his hand very well|pg||
nt|athene: i.e. he hasn't got any defence and partner might be counting on some :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer's aim is to hold the trump losers to 3, while ruffing a couple of spades in his hand - I think|pg||
mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|woozle: A poor combined performance. Either somebody misbid or their system needs a tune-up, because slam is laydown and I wouldn't expect many to miss it at this level.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mwigor: so effectively thats what she did|pg||
nt|athene: yes declarer is going to try to set up dummy|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|petergill: Zoli Nagy has played in Australia's Open Team many times, most recently in 2007. |pg||
nt|athene: but for that purpose he doesn't want to get dummy forced - fortunately south can't attack clubs so often|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i guess i would think of it as "forcing to game". which would not be the five level in all cases|pg||
pc|h3|nt|cindy:  who whould bid 3N ?|pg||
nt|petergill: He correctly uses one of his limited entries to hand to take the @d finesse|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|cindy:  S or N ?|pg||
nt|petergill: 3 rounds of trump now defeats 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: well, three rounds of trumps leaves declarer a trick short now doesn't it?|pg||
nt|petergill: Perhaps a spade from hand towards the ace at Trick 2 was even better|pg||
nt|athene: but south might be worried that his partner has a trump void, in which case cashing even one top heart might give away a vital tempo|pg||
nt|petergill: so South has to decide whether to play partner for one trump or for @CK?|pg||
nt|athene: if declarer has a fifth heart and the @CK clearly there's no defence so south will be thinking about forcing dummy, playing his partner for the @CK |pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|nt|peachy: then, finding out maybe of spade void, could dampen the plans|pg||

nt|cindy:  still struggling to find a spot to play|pg||
nt|chick: would 4@S play any better than 5@D?|pg||
nt|petergill: Henry Christie deduced that if East had five @h's, he would have played a spade from hand at Trick 2, not a @D|pg||
nt|petergill: since East with 5 hearts in a 9 card fit would not be in such a rush to set up @d winners|pg||
nt|woozle: Nigel has suggested that South should make another move and I agree - the hand is a good one and the club control is a dangerous thing to suppress|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|d|nt|mwigor: hi cindy|pg||
nt|cindy:  hi :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: matter of partnership agreement|pg||
nt|woozle: Someone has suggested that North should start with 1S..I have to disagree. I think it's terrible to have four card support for a major and not announce it at the first turn.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mwigor: mcdonald-walsh have given up their strong club these days|pg||
nt|mwigor: so i think 1@c was natural|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry, I mean Reverse Count (= Upside Down Count) is what Chris plays|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: NS can perhaps make 6NT here? give up a diamond then cash everything and east gets squeezed in the majors|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: which is "normal count" in australia|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|woozle: Nagy's 2C is an interesting choice...does he not have a suitable diamond raise available or is it a tactical choice?|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: 3NT is easy with the diamod finesse working...a missed opportunity for EW|pg||
pc|hA|nt|petergill: 2@D strong NT or other options, 2@H to play opposite weak 2@H, 2NT 22-23 I think|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|mwigor: hard for mcdonald to pass 1@s but that was the spot|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: declarer decided that with a very weak dummy spade might well be better|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mwigor: this should be -1|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|pc|h8|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at least|pg||
nt|athene: give north @SQJxxx and no sure entry and it's easy to see how you might want to play the 5-2 fit|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|pc|d3|nt|athene: very greedy double from East|pg||
nt|petergill: Ron Klinger wrote up that Bruce Neill thinks that with HH after 2NT and transfer, opener should play in the major, based on a  lot of evidence.  |pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: would east get three spades and the @DK, in 4@S?|pg||
nt|athene: he would unless declarer can squeeze or endplay him, but that might be possible|pg||
nt|petergill: where H = honour card|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, 4@S would have failed, North Chris Hughes did well to run|pg||
nt|athene: there's a case for simply responding 3nt with that north hand - you have loads of hcp but weak spades|pg||
nt|petergill: Many of us, including Bruce Neill (who just told me) would treat North's spades as a four card suit and simply Stayman over 2NT.  |pg||
pc|s8|nt|marlowepi: looks -2 to me|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|mwigor: yes theres always four trump tricks|pg||

pc|d5|pc|dA|nt|woozle: Making three or four depending on the diamond play, but it's hardly relevant|pg||

mb|1N|nt|marlowepi: presumably it is E whpo is thinking after a double|pg||
nt|woozle: A pretty good slam for EW...I'd bid 1NT:2H,2S:4D (splinter) and West would fall in love with the working cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: if it took that long to decide to double 2S with the N hand, this could be a very long match|pg||
nt|cindy:  well  neither side can make much of anything|pg||
nt|mwigor: alan is a considered player|pg||
nt|athene: many pairs have a gadget in response to 1NT to show both minors with a major singleton|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: but here the singleton is the ace, which changes things|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: it would be illuminating to know what options he was considering|pg||

nt|marlowepi: it was to put E into a fit|pg||
nt|chick: the last time I played in a 4-0 fit was a missed splinter :)|pg||

nt|cindy:  i hate exp;aining these things to teammates|pg||

nt|cindy:  operator ?|pg||
nt|mwigor: not sure exactly how they play it|pg||
nt|athene: saying "i have both minors and a singleton heart" might make partner bypass 3nt when it's wrong|pg||
pc|dA|nt|marlowepi: well yes, but of what sort|pg||
nt|athene: on the other hand, 5-5 shapes aren't really NT shapes|pg||
nt|petergill: Nigel Rosendorff once told me that Henry Christie is the best player in Perth in Western Australia - most of the rest of us would have given Nigel himself that rating - but now ...|pg||

pc|h5|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sT|nt|petergill: 5@C = 10/10 if I were giving the ratings in a bidding contest, 4@S = 6/10, 6@C = 5/10, 3NT = 2/10, partscores 1/10. |pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: yes this hand is an excellent example of why 2-suiters aren't good in NT - if just one suit runs, that's not enough tricks to make 3NT assuming you got a threatening lead|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|mwigor: 5@s and 4m|pg||
nt|mwigor: (as at world champs)|pg||
nt|chick: this is a scramble to get as many tricks as possible before opps realize they can draw trump|pg||
nt|mwigor: not sure if its changed since|pg||
pc|s8|nt|cindy:  they don't know their methods ?|pg||
nt|mwigor: the defence dont actually need to draw trump|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c4|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|s7|nt|petergill: 5@C makes on any defence, though declarer doesn't know that - for now|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|pc|dT|pg||
nt|mwigor: my guess is andy bid 3@d to decide whether to bid 4@s over 4@h|pg||
nt|athene: but if they both run you are probably making slam anyway - or at least you are cold in five|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mwigor: he wasnt expecting the auction to die there|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|cindy:  huh ?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|nt|marlowepi: if 3D is not forcing then the goal of being able to make a 4 level decision may have to wait until the next deal|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mwigor: bill had Axxx of @h which andy wouldnt have expected|pg||
pc|h3|pg||

nt|woozle: If dummy still had a diamond then the endgame would produce a double-squeeze, but who needs a double squeeze when declarer so brilliantly follows his nose in clubs|pg||
nt|woozle: North probably doesn't have anything to open even if he wants to...Zol might open 1S, or 3 or 4. Zol likes his preempts to have a bit of bite|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: in that case, it was tactically ill-considered given the colors|pg||

nt|chick: not really, if they double he can run and if not, would have to be down 7 to beat 620|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would say that if one of them had a hand atypical for their bidding there, E wins the distinction by a hefty margin|pg||
nt|mwigor: east is free to operate in these situations|pg||

nt|athene: :)|pg||
nt|athene: i know some players who would show majors with that west hand|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mwigor: it is important for the person who opens the bidding not to deviate too far from the agreements|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mwigor: so that their partner can judge the hand|pg||
nt|woozle: High spade openings would work poorly, with North having an easy pass of doubles at 3S and above.|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: NS playing Keri or something?|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: you dont have to operate, and you can achieve all the same objectives, if you play 3D as a forcing fitting lead-director. and there is no other valuable use for the bid really|pg||
nt|chick: except of course to show good diamonds |pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|athene: EW didn't do so much bidding here|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: they can make some number of hearts although perhaps not four|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Pass will probably produce about 500...3NT looks playable also, but 5D will fail|pg||
pc|h3|nt|woozle: Heart lead is a bit awkward, since it can cost the North hand an entry|pg||

pc|d6|pc|dJ|nt|athene: now if declarer plays another trump west can play three rounds|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps better was a small trump first time rather than the @SA, as west is a bit endplayed when he wins, but that might require the hand records|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s6|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: anyway, declarer is safe for 8 with the club right|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||

nt|mwigor: 3@d made 10 tricks in the other room|pg||
nt|mwigor: (played by NS)|pg||
nt|cindy:  thats not all that surprising|pg||
nt|chick: NS only took 7 tricks in this room|pg||
nt|chick: is that the value of being declarer? :)|pg||
nt|mwigor: the failure to take 8 in the two card ending was quite poor|pg||
nt|athene: giving west a ruff doesn't cost a trick because drawing his trumps means you run out of winners anyway|pg||

nt|woozle: West will lead a heart...if he thinks about his opening lead, Christie might lean toward him and ask "having no hearts?"|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|nt|cindy:  the danger of bidding 2@s here rather than 3N is it gives N a chance to make a lead directing double|pg||

nt|athene: it might look as though the defence would have been better to start with a diamond but if they cash two diamonds declarer can throw both hearts away instead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: here comes a cute little number|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that Morton gets around|pg||
nt|woozle: Hughes will open 1S, Nagy shouldn't bid, and Christie will have to choose some kind of raise|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|athene: west is likely to take the push to 5@S over 5@D i would think|pg||
nt|marlowepi: depends how auctions goes|pg||
nt|woozle: 4S is an ambitious undertaking on the NS cards, and shouldn't go close, but the devastating heart lead is unlikely|pg||
mb|1N|an| |nt|marlowepi: like mcluhan stepping from behind the poster in "annie hall" :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at these colors if there is any dubiety to NS auction W may let them play 5D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he is not devoid of defense|pg||
nt|athene: south will just show a good diamond raise and now west doesn't know who has the club honours|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4C by W|pg||
nt|athene: i guess he does have his kings outside his partner's suit but even so...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if he bids 4C he can abide by E decision|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|athene: once he has bid 4@S he is surely intending to bid 5@S himself over 5@D if his partner doesn't double it|pg||
nt|woozle: Either 1NT is forcing or Christie has made an odd choice|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: yes, it was alerted|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: ok, maybe not :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S was a favorite to saddle him with the last guess|pg||
mb|p|pc|c7|nt|woozle: North has probably bid enough, but 3S looks plenty challenging anyway. A diamond lead would help though|pg||
nt|woozle: The club lead looks harmless for all. But it's not clear what Hughes should do at trick two to get out of his hand|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mwigor: true 4@c looks like the better bid|pg||
nt|athene: declarer will have to decide if west's bidding is consistent with a singleton @DK|pg||
nt|athene: i don't see why it isn't|pg||
nt|mwigor: but he guessed right|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: did 1D show 4+ diamonds, either first time or via 1S rebid?|pg||

The point Kate made to me was: All the top American pairs know when and how certain bids are RKCB, or in the auction ...|pg||
nt|petergill: (1@D) 1@S (Pass) 2@D (raise) 2@H by opener whether Pass by the overcaller or 2@S by the overcaller is weaker. Of Sydney's top pairs, most didn't know the answer to the latter ...|pg||
nt|petergill: question, although Hans-Nunn did. Such pairs should have discussed these sorts of things. |pg||
nt|kit: it looks normal to get to 3NT.  If the defense knocks the ace of hearts out of dummy early, I don't think declarer has enough tricks.|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT is far from cold here|pg||
nt|kit: The North hand is a good example of the advantage of playing 2/1 truly game forcing.  If North can't bid 3@D forcing, he has problems|pg||
nt|petergill: Henry Christie (South) rebid 2NT over 2@D at the other table. Any thoughts on whether that is the best style?|pg||
nt|kit: not my style -- but I don't think a 3@C bid shows extras.  I know I'm in the minority on that.|pg||
nt|petergill: Other table: Club lead to king, @H switch not found, as South's 2NT rebid did not sound like a singleton @d to East|pg||
nt|kit: I like the 2@H rebid to show 6, and the 2NT rebid showing a balanced hand|pg||
nt|petergill: I rather like the Henry Christie style. |pg||
nt|kit: Perhaps I'm biased from playing Precision, where opener never has extras :)|pg||

nt|mwigor: this should be a fairly easy grand to bi|pg||
nt|mwigor: bid|pg||
nt|woozle: A normal 3NT for NS, which will struggle with a heart lead (or early switch) but probably make otherwise|pg||
mb|1H|nt|woozle: North will be glad to be playing 2/1. because without a forcing 3D the North hand is nasty after something like 1H:2D,2H|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|cindy:  here we go again|pg||
nt|mwigor: braithwaite-haughie have an interesting bit of kit here|pg||
nt|mwigor: 2@c is a puppet to 2@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: 2@d is and GF|pg||
nt|woozle: I assume that 2NT is the normal system call for South with nothing to bid|pg||
mb|3N|nt|marlowepi: contrary to popular belief, second position is a good one to preempt in, because partner;s hand is as yet unrevelaed to opps and their primary concern must be to show or find fits|pg||
nt|marlowepi: far from obvious for EW to bid slam if S bids 3D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and everybody has a relatively normal hand|pg||
nt|athene: someone needs to take charge and find out that both majors are running|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: A heart lead is unlikely but club jack to the king and a heart shift is very likely|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mwigor: in the butler in july one of them forgot and the auction 1@d-1@h-1@s-2@d was passed out|pg||
nt|mwigor: my partner and i had an identical disaster (same kit)|pg||
nt|mwigor: so one of them went into the datums|pg||
nt|athene: i think it should be west - east just knows his partner has some controls for hearts; he doesn't know about the huge trick source|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|athene: imagine a club lead, for instance, taking out dummy's entry|pg||
nt|mwigor: 5N now from zol|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: East knows about the king of spades, and is able to ask for the king of hearts with keycard|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no below-game jumps available for EW if S bids 3D|pg||
nt|athene: if the spades are just a bit weaker (say, no @SQ) then you can't ruff them good and get back to them|pg||
nt|mwigor: or maybe 5@s is better|pg||
nt|athene: so i don't see how east can know to bid this grand with confidence|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mwigor: east should invite grand and west should bid it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: they are lucky to have had a clear run even to the small slam|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dont see why W should bid a grand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he has no idea about spade king, and club lead may dislodge only entry to long spades|pg||
nt|athene: well, west knows there are two big trick sources - east doesn't|pg||
nt|mwigor: 5@s over 5@c asking for third round @s control might be better|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c7|nt|marlowepi: if W doesnt know about S king he cannot view that suit as a trick source|pg||
nt|athene: i think after the 3@H rebid, west should just take control|pg||
nt|athene: or, at worst, he takes control over 4@D|pg||
nt|mwigor: thats not enough though is it|pg||
nt|athene: he can blackwood then spiral scan for the @SK|pg||
nt|athene: or whatever they use to find kings|pg||
nt|marlowepi: spiral scan headed your way bill|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: EW are whispering about their auction to their respective opponents|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|marlowepi: over here we have to pre-alert if we play stuff but we dont really know it:)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: at worst partner has stiff @SK and club lead takes out your entry i suppose|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|woozle: East tries the second top club but the third round looks like giving up, with no way to stop dummy's diamonds from running|pg||
pc|d7|nt|cindy:  haha|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dA|pc|sT|pc|h3|pc|d6|pg||
pc|dK|nt|woozle: The second round is reasonable, since south might be 4522 or 3532, (although it costs a club trick if S has Q9xx) but the third round is defeatist|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h6|pc|dT|pg||
pc|d9|nt|marlowepi: good defense thus far|pg||

nt|woozle: Not Zol's greatest moment...maybe he's tired|pg||
nt|woozle: Now, a more mundane deal, looking like an EW heart partial or anybody's 1NT|pg||

nt|marlowepi: excellent moment to make an anti-percentage bid:)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|cindy:  if this isnt a jump shift i dont know what is|pg||
nt|athene: this is what Reese was talking about when he babbled about "a pre-empt which is always weak is a blunt sword" or something|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, in all fairness let us note that when S opens 3C he hardly imagines opps will fetch up in 5D|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: north actually played the 9 then the ten, if that makes any difference to south's play|pg||
nt|mwigor: in the concurrent women's final havas lead lowry 65-29|pg||

nt|petergill: In the Women's Final ref http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=sn&E=5&R=&T=R the top seeded Havas team lead by 64 imps, so we will see this match all day I ...|pg||
nt|petergill: think|pg||
nt|petergill: Can declarer capitalise on this choice of lead?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|petergill: It gives declarer an 8th trick, and can declarer also dig a diamond trick out of the mire?|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|cQ|pc|h9|pg||
nt|petergill: the idea of the lead was to pin North's bare queen or bare nine, not partner's |pg||
nt|petergill: I think playing on @d's might be declarer's best chance|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|dT|pc|dA|pg||
pc|hT|nt|petergill: keeping the spades as entries so that diamonds can repeatedly be led from dummy|pg||

nt|petergill: the club switch leaves declarer with a (im?)possible (?) minor suit squeeze as an alternative - cashing his major winners now|pg||
