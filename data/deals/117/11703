nt|Walddk2: 3NT is a practical bid and that will make|pg||

nt|woozle: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: oh well, the spade honours got crashed in the rush to beat the contract|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|petergill: Hi Kieran|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|petergill: The very high standard of the bridge in our Spring Nationals Open Final last weekend has not been duplicated so far in this match.  |pg||
nt|woozle: dangerous deal - close to the values for game, but wicked splits.|pg||
nt|daman: hi Kieran|pg||
nt|woozle: I'm surprised by Hughes' pass over 1NT - looks very wet when game is quite possible with this exciting shape|pg||
nt|daman: 1NT seems normal     with a 3@D bid later as backup|pg||
nt|petergill: Bds 2 and 3 here were duplicated at both tables in uninspired manner, Bd 3 being trick for trick the same at each table, I think|pg||
nt|woozle: Klinger has a tough call here - 2NT works with the values but he ought to fear the spades; 2C might end the auction too quickly|pg||
nt|petergill: A take-out Dbl of 1NT by the passed hand West does seem normal to me|pg||
nt|daman: this hand is loaded with danger|pg||
mb|2H|nt|daman: for both sides|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Klinger is looking for a three-step description, but South's 3D preference will consume the space he needs for the full description|pg||
mb|3D|nt|daman: no idea why West passed|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: There is a good case to play Lebensohl by responder after 1m - 1NT - 2M - |pg||
pc|sT|pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sK|pg||
nt|petergill: I learnt that from Boye Brogeland, so hat South can stop in 3@C or 3@D over 2@H in this auction, or go forward in either minor|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|pc|cQ|pc|c2|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s8|nt|woozle: This deal had some handling problems, but with the ace of spades ducked declarer can afford an extra trump loser|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|chick: if that was to keep them out of their diamond fit, it worked|pg||

nt|cindy:  so the blame cannot be shared|pg||

mb|1H|mb|2C|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|woozle: North has a tough bid here - 1NT suggests a stopper and most people will have a suit that looks more like five to bid a major|pg||

nt|mwigor: but andy may have bid it thinking that his opponents probably made 4@h|pg||
nt|mwigor: so he had 620 as protection|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: in that case, it was tactically ill-considered given the colors|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mwigor: the whole point is bill's hand may well not have been at all typical for his bidding|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|mwigor: i think it wasnt that unreasonable at all|pg||
nt|chick: not really, if they double he can run and if not, would have to be down 7 to beat 620|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would say that if one of them had a hand atypical for their bidding there, E wins the distinction by a hefty margin|pg||
nt|mwigor: east is free to operate in these situations|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mwigor: it is important for the person who opens the bidding not to deviate too far from the agreements|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mwigor: so that their partner can judge the hand|pg||
