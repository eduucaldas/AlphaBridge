nt|brolucius: Brunner discovered that she was missing one keycard and the trump queen.|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|p|nt|roswolf: the other room had a shaky auction|pg||
mb|2C!|an|art GF no 5 cRD major|mb|p|nt|roswolf: and how will the nebulous diamond fare here|pg||
nt|athene: Well, not "shaky", I wouldn't say - they knew what they were doing.|pg||
mb|2D!|an|11-13 bal|mb|p|mb|2H!|an|relay|nt|brolucius: Yes, although it is unusual to play 4NT as Blackwood on that auction.|pg||
nt|roswolf: here come the relays|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C is just a GF relay.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|an|4/4 majors|mb|p|mb|3H!|an|natural|nt|brolucius: 6NT is better than 6@H, since you might make 6NT without scoring four heart tricks.|pg||
nt|roswolf: have they agreed @H|pg||
nt|brolucius: Many thanks to Kath for giving us this information on the bidding. Much appreciated.|pg||
nt|roswolf: YUP:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: it's hard going :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D!|an|cue|mb|p|mb|4S!|an|rkcb |nt|athene: Having agreed hearts at the 3-level they might be able to stop in four, not five, which would be a moral victory I guess.|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: South has bid hearts first and may appreciate that a diamond lead through the North hand may be bad news. 6NT would be played by North.|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S will surely be Kickback (RKCB for @H)|pg||
mb|4N!|an|1/4|nt|roswolf: will stop in 5@H i fancy|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this might be passed|pg||
nt|brolucius: Very impressive to have your first nine bids all alerted as artificial.|pg||
mb|5C!|an|ask QT|nt|roswolf: 10|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: ... and counting... as they would say in a James Bond film.|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|athene: East could have doubled 4@D for the lead.|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H was sort of not quite alertable.|pg||
nt|roswolf: south still thinking    ..... carambas|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe 6NT; at least that contract will be right-sided and declarer will have time to get count|pg||
nt|athene: There's an interesting tactical issue - do you deliberately avoid making a lead-directing double if you think it will scare opponents away from a doomed slam?|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|nt|athene: So here for instance if East doubled 4@D that would tell NS there was no slam and they might stop in 4@H when even 5@H was down.|pg||
nt|roswolf: 6nt great bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: well done Peter Crouch|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well, that's a good bid, anyway. Well done. His bravery may be rewarded.|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: crouch  wondering what's the delay on the other side|pg||
nt|brolucius: The black-suit count will suggest that West has longer hearts.|pg||
nt|athene: Zia is a strong exponent of NOT making lead-directing doubles if they might help opponents at all.  Of course the other side of the coin is, his partners often face a MUCH harder ...|pg||
nt|athene: task on lead against slams.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: while i am not a great fan of relay systems this added to judgment is gorgreous to see|pg||
nt|roswolf: expect a spade lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: Even when you have no idea of the count in an unplayed suit (diamonds here), it is still sound to base your heart decision on the count in two other known suits.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: East can work out not to lead a diamond, for sure.  North has the @DK, so at best it would save the overtrick.|pg||
nt|athene: At MP I would expect East to put the @DA on the table, but not imps.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Patterson is a favourite to get it right. I put my money on him. Is there a bookie around?|pg||
nt|brolucius: There is no temptation to play on diamonds because declarer knows that four heart tricks will give him the slam even if the @SJ does not drop in three rounds.|pg||
nt|athene: Sometimes in these situations running the clubs can induce a misdefence, but here, North's hand is an open book because of the relays.|pg||
nt|roswolf: i agree roland but a couple of cokes is strong temptation|pg||
nt|athene: The defence know he has 4-4 majors and if he ran the clubs they would know he had exactly 4-4-3-2.|pg||

mb|2H|nt|andyv:  3N |pg||
nt|andyv:  but not from W:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: not sure i would have protected there|pg||
nt|lestergold: Liggins playing with a non regular partner I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: but has an even guess in Hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: fine player Willie Whittaker tho|pg||
nt|eggy: It's a new partnership, but a sreious one|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Willie is Scottish, another player the English "stole" from north of the border|pg||
nt|ady: 6NT  works out better   as able to get  better count|pg||
nt|lestergold: N/S partners in real life for the benefit of foreign specs|pg||
nt|lestergold: Ligins a long and distinguished career|pg||

nt|andyv:  or Ms?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyx: Mr, thnx|pg||
nt|andyv:  :))|pg||
nt|calabres: Hi again. Welcome to Round 5 for the Qualifying of the Portuguese National Open Teams. |pg||
nt|lestergold: Hooland of course very fine player and lost his partner Armstrong tragically last year to an untimely death|pg||
nt|eggy: Both are  N/S World Champions of course now|pg||
nt|lestergold: now in my view 4n here is quantitave and denies hearts but perhaps they have a different understanding |pg||
mb|5C|nt|lestergold: I think south intends it as agreing hearts and is therefore blackwood|pg||
mb|p|nt|calabres: Results after 4th Round: http://www.freewebs.com/fpbridge/CNEO_F1_2009_R4.pdf|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Luis|pg||
nt|calabres: ciao Andy|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@s is playable|pg||
nt|vugraphzyx: 5@d also|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@d a bit easier|pg||
nt|rodal f: So the gong gomg came as a helpful one for EW?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyx: south is thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzyx: still...|pg||
nt|vugraphzyx: and a little bit|pg||
nt|andyv:  can S be sure N has 5@s here?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might wrong to tell what a spec wrote, but shitt. To much vine by the dinner?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyx: i guess so|pg||
mb|5D|nt|eggy: and that is how N has read it too from the looks of it|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  6 can make if E leads pd's suit|pg||
nt|rodal f: @S to hit then. But should be easy after Ws bid|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Is this auction real?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Did West bid 3NT??|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I don't believe my own eyes|pg||
nt|vugraphzyx: yep... more TD action on table :)|pg||
nt|athene: it looks normal to me to bid in fourth; the only issue is whether you bid 1nt or 2@C :)|pg||
nt|ady: it seems north has taken it as rkc|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5d? passing the buck?|pg||
mb|5H|nt|andyv:  good start |pg||
nt|roswolf: the world champions go for the throat|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  and there we have it|pg||
nt|andyv:  W should dbl now|pg||
nt|rodal f: As we said Roland. It's saterday and dinner just fined. To much vine at the dinner?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit funny. Looks as a puch:)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|andyv:  this may be a push|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr Push|pg||
nt|roswolf: well that was not inspired by south|pg||
nt|lestergold: asking for truimp queen suggested|pg||
nt|ady: 5@D   asking for queen of trumps I think|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|pc|c7|pg||
nt|lestergold: so by their methods carefully bid and not unreasonably have stopped short of the slam|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|eggy: avoidance in hearts|pg||
pc|h3|nt|roswolf: this is clearly on ice - the manchester gods are smiling on the WC's|pg||
nt|roswolf: john hassett is north i trust?|pg||
nt|athene: a diamond lead would have given declarer some cause for concern (takes out entry to west) but the hearts then come to the rescue|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup bill|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hT|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pc|sK|nt|rodal f: Next to come? Claime|pg||
pc|s2|pg||

pc|h6|pc|h8|pc|hJ|nt|andyv:  5@d played as strangely in other room as 6@d was bid here|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|lestergold: odds would change |pg||
pc|s9|nt|vugraphzyx: td on table again|pg||
nt|Walddk4: get him down, quick!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's difficult to play with a TD on the table|pg||
nt|andyv:  unless he's bringing the wine|pg||
nt|rodal f: Belive there will be a warning for W from the TD|pg||
nt|andyv:  for frivolous bids?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyx: something like that|pg||
nt|andyv:  haven't seen that one for a few years|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
pc|h9|nt|eggy: quite rightly even a 50% slam is only neutral and that was the best it could be|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: declarer has to decide which major-suit finesse to take|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: they are both almost certain to work|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|nt|roswolf: either today!!!|pg||

nt|athene: We saw East opened 1NT on a 5422 with five spades a moment ago.  But he might think this hand is too good.|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|athene: A spectator suggested that North took that line in 6NT on the slight chance that if the heart lost the defence wouldn't find the diamond cash.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Maybe he thought that even if the finesse lost, East would not find the diamond switch. Far fetched, but possible|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is ultra modern in both rooms|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c3|nt|roswolf: might be flat?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|brolucius: 2@S was bid as an obstructive effort, but every now and again partner has a good hand.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|pg||
nt|roswolf: or thinks he has|pg||
nt|athene: If you really want to respond on that West hand you have to play some system otherwise partner makes a game-try and goes down at the 3- or 4-level too often.|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|pc|s5|pc|c4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Do they play 1NT as forcing?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Middle club back because North has no clear suit preference message to pass.|pg||
nt|roswolf: small heart now|pg||
nt|brolucius: I doubt it, with four-card majors.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|d9|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||

pc|s3|pc|sJ|nt|brolucius: How could he tell to play a heart?|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: Even with East being a bit over-exuberant he still gains against 2NT in the other room.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|roswolf: yes a defensive slip |pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||
nt|athene: If you play in 2NT and the other table doesn't, you lose about 4-5 imps on average.|pg||
mc|8|nt|roswolf: gives the undertrick away|pg||
nt|athene: 2NT is just a bad place!|pg||
nt|brolucius: West will thank you for blaming East for them getting too high!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think it was a slip. Crouch was on a guess as to which red suit to switch to|pg||
pg||

nt|lestergold: Hi Roland hi Geoff|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I believe it's Hassett|pg||
nt|athene: this sort of hand is why the 2NT opener is a real "slam killer"|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hin Bill|pg||

nt|athene: hi|pg||

pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|athene: what makes these problems worse is that when you play 3NT with a shortage, and it's wrong (partner has little in the short suit), not only do you miss slam, but you frequently go ...|pg||
nt|athene: down in 3nt :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: i have a geneneral agreement that after a strong 2nt you can always stop in 4nt if you try for a minor suit slam|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: bet the clubs get lost|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Spec asking which Hackett is playing. It is father Paul. The twins are on the de Botton team in Divison 2|pg||
nt|brolucius: North's 2@D looks a bit borderline to me at the other table. I don't blame Brunner for raising.|pg||
nt|athene: As Kaplan said, we lost the club suit in the 1950s.  The diamonds went in the 1970s and the hearts are sinking fast.|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: raising the stakes|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c8|pg||

nt|rodal f: If 2NT is 20-21 I like that from S. Hope they then have puppet|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@d GF?|pg||
nt|athene: West needs to get his hand across as accurately as he can in anticipation of the expected 4@S over 4@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4H for N/s not a bad contract basically on club fi8nesse which happens to be wrong|pg||

nt|vugraphzyx: 3@C puppet stayman|pg||
nt|roswolf: good guy as well|pg||
nt|athene: as it happens East has enough spades that that 4@S didn't come to pass :) or perhaps should say it DID come to pass :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: its close stuff insurance comes to mind|pg||
nt|eggy: if playing 2/1 the pass of 4H is probably forcing|pg||
nt|ady: 5 diamonds can be made   will need the spade finesse and set up long spade|pg||
nt|ady: spade finess the right way of course |pg||
nt|lestergold: if Liggins gets this right it will deserve a roun of applause|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  well, they should get to 4@h anyway|pg||
nt|rodal f: Puppet or stayman vug opp?|pg||
mb|d|nt|rodal f: thx:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: bidding may suggest south is short spade and that may help Liggins|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|eggy: He might try it on the auction, although if NS switch to clubs, it may be slightly anti % risking 500|pg||
nt|ady: South has shown length in clubs and heats   so not may well get spade right|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|vugraphzyx: "puppet stayman" |pg||
pc|h4|nt|andyv:  looks like in OR, W opened a polish 2@s bid and N couldn't find the bid box to raise his partner's strong action|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|athene: i think it's sensible to play 1@H X 3@S as a splinter because knowing of the singleton spade might well be the critical factor in partner judging to go to the 5-level|pg||
nt|lestergold: Brunner maybe hpoing/ expecting that pard has a defensive somethi8ng somewhere|pg||
nt|eggy: H4 was probably neutral|pg||
nt|lestergold: Liggins may try or a three three spade break of course with the added possinility of qx spade |pg||

mb|3H|nt|athene: (Well, even if you didn't Crouch would anyway>)|pg||

nt|roswolf: this is the Premier League|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|lestergold: hard to bid but excellent spade game for N/S|pg||
nt|roswolf: on board 2 the other n/s bid 6@D - well done indeed|pg||
nt|athene: it looks there as though west could have rescued his partner from the endplay by leading a spade|pg||
nt|ady: e/w may reach 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but actually declarer would have had a very cute counter to that|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: @SA, @SQ forcing east to cover|pg||
nt|roswolf: the 2nt opener didnt cause them any difficulty|pg||
nt|athene: now return to hand with a trump|pg||
nt|athene: and throw *west* in with the spade!|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: and he has to lead into the club tenace|pg||
nt|athene: so it was a "transfer throw-in" which is a rare bird|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes endplay either way|pg||
mb|2H|nt|rodal f: 2@H as by 2/! |pg||
nt|ady: tricky on 4-1 split|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 4H a little optimistic and a lot ofm work to do especially with the 4/1 reak|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: Patterson Crouch bid the slightly below odds on hand one and guessed right in trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well bid boys|pg||
nt|athene: that would have tested declarer more sternly - he would have to place the spade honours and recognize that @CK7 was a tenace :)|pg||
nt|ady: Liggins left well alone|pg||
nt|lestergold: well can harly expect Liggins to move with his 6 count|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rodal f: = 7 til 11 bad|pg||

nt|roswolf: into the valley of death rode west!?|pg||
nt|athene: board 2 has kicked in|pg||
nt|lestergold: well Price Simpson here are lucky they can get out for 500|pg||
nt|ady: some do with 4 trumps   a singleton and outside ace|pg||
nt|eggy: I doubt he would have passed if his trumps were a bit better|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|nt|athene: south in the other room after the same start (2NT - 3@C; 3@D) decided to move with 4@D|pg||
nt|lestergold: when you are well ahead you tend not to push as much|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|ady: if either east or westg had 9@H instead of a small one  4@H would be reasonably good even with 4-1 split|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|rodal f: Bit harder promisses at NS then by me then|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|athene: which looks very reasonable - if you have a void in a suit partner showed 2 or 3 cards in, 3NT must be dubious|pg||
nt|lestergold: not quite death a gain of 3 imps against the making spade game|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed bill|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|rodal f: Only one question. The @H handle|pg||

pc|dT|nt|rodal f: And a push|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: unfortunately for them there isno guarantee that team mates will rach 4S|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: the problem with these sacrifices is, the 4@S game only has to be going down a very small percentage of the time to make them unprofitable|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|eggy: Willie trying to play absolutely safe, but the defence making it as uncomfortable as possible|pg||
pc|h5|nt|andyv:  yes... is there any reason for N to play @hs differently?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: but perhaps after the last couple of boards, West decided that all thin games will make for NS :)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|ady: still ok for 8 tricks|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|lestergold: I disagree here because Simpson'snegative doube told price that they were in double fit territory and ith double fits around it is usually best to declarer the hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: and 3n likely to make why swing?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lestergold: yeh roland hacked into the dealing bot|pg||
nt|ady: spade position nice for declarer|pg||
nt|ady: difficult to see how defence can come to 7 tricks on the lay out|pg||
nt|lestergold: but with only one entry to dummy how is that entry to be used|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rodal f: Need some type of bidding as the first board then Andy:)|pg||

nt|rodal f: Or? Running for money|pg||

nt|lestergold: dim finess club finmesse both on 2 spades a heart 4 clubs 2 dims without the heart guess|pg||
nt|roswolf: well victor as west in the other room is more conservative|pg||
pc|h8|nt|andyv:  and now 2@d by N|pg||
nt|rodal f: Now 2@D|pg||
nt|lestergold: 17 plus 8 wioth a five card suit how is 3N going to be avoied|pg||
nt|lestergold: Victor is conservative but isnt a liability level underbidder|pg||
nt|lestergold: off to best lead but Price likely will play on clubs first|pg||
nt|lestergold: so no entry to long diamonds|pg||
nt|lestergold: however the lead is challenging|pg||
nt|athene: not at all trivial for declarer|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h3|nt|lestergold: communications with dummy arent great|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: he doesn't know the @HQ is a dummy entry|pg||
nt|athene: now spade switch?|pg||
nt|eggy: he may start with a spade to the 8|pg||
pc|d4|nt|andyv:  and all's well:)|pg||
nt|athene: trying to establish two spades, diamond, @HA, @CK for the defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: well Price could not afford hthat duckment|pg||
nt|lestergold: and Hirst knows there is no likely future in his diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: ducking at trick 1 wasn't clearcut - spade switch was always likely|pg||
nt|athene: and might be fatal on some layouts|pg||
nt|roswolf: such things doth make swings|pg||
nt|lestergold: well the wild boy from manchester and his partner are giving the two big men a serious pasting|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can still survive if he picks the position|pg||
nt|athene: but this time he has to knock out the @HA first i think|pg||
nt|athene: so that north doesn't get in to cash his long spade|pg||
nt|lestergold: very difficult for  price there is an ionference from the play that south is not entry rich|pg||
nt|roswolf: hassett dulygained his game swing on bd 5|pg||
pc|d2|nt|andyv:  some work to do but 2@d should prevail|pg||
nt|eggy: spade or diamond?|pg||
pc|dT|pc|c5|pg||
nt|athene: well, south can still have ONE entry|pg||
nt|lestergold: and kits unlikely to b the ace of hearts|pg||
nt|athene: he knew declarer had a double diamond stop so no point plugging away at diamonds without @HA and @CK as well to get in with|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair point|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rodal f: Will if declerer hit the @C|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: Price is in serious trouble if he wins and now plays heart and north ducks|pg||
nt|athene: west doesn't know who has the fourth spade, though, does he? :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: south when in with k of clubs can play a heart through to beat it|pg||
nt|athene: if he can grab one heart he can switch to clubs and he is ok|pg||
nt|athene: if he plays clubs first he is dead|pg||
nt|lestergold: no he isnt|pg||
nt|lestergold: he can only make this if he takes a first ound finesse against tghe JH|pg||
nt|athene: well it depends *how* he grabs the heart|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer is in the box seat i think but may well go astrey|pg||
nt|athene: if he leads to the @HQ then the defence get @D, @S, @CK and @HAJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: and wild Bill has shown that he knows how t defend and will asurely find the winning play|pg||
nt|athene: all in all, i think ducking the first diamond made his task harder, but it was very difficult|pg||
nt|ady: may go down now|pg||
nt|eggy: definitely now i think|pg||
nt|ady: clear hearts|pg||
nt|eggy: I think Holland may have mis-signalled his length though|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lestergold: Price made the fatal assunmption that BHirst would continue dianmonds as most players would|pg||
nt|athene: in general, playing against weak opposition, you can duck in all these borderline cases because they will plug on with their first suit regardless, but against strong opposition ...|pg||
nt|athene: you have to be aware of the possibility of a switch|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|pc|d5|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think that Price a great card player has done haset|pg||
nt|lestergold: hgasset needed to duck very smoothly|pg||
nt|athene: never cover!|pg||
nt|roswolf: still not totally gin - the tonis may still upset him|pg||
nt|roswolf: tonic|pg||
nt|athene: will south duck a small club off dummy?|pg||
nt|athene: should do, i think|pg||
nt|athene: you hope declarer has a guess with @CQ9x|pg||
nt|lestergold: Price used to be partner's with Townsend and won most national trophies in that partnership and Townthen Price made the mistake of ditching hisn partnership with  Townsend and ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: Townsend found a new partner a promising 19 year old vaguely related to me|pg||
nt|roswolf: vaguely?|pg||
nt|lestergold: of copurse Price and Simpson have been team mates with Gold and Townsend in recent years with international successes|pg||
nt|eggy: Declarer's 10 was a givaeaway though|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lestergold: well not thatvague I suppose |pg||

nt|ady: 2 or 3 down|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|rodal f: So a @D lead?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: many twists and turns in this hand|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|pc|s2|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: very instructive - all about control and timing|pg||
pc|c9|pc|dJ|pc|s9|pg||
nt|eggy: blimey 3 down now|pg||
pc|sT|nt|rodal f: But don't need that as long as declerer don't see his best line|pg||
nt|roswolf: which is why it could well be a swing|pg||
nt|lestergold: a fascinating battle of wits finally won by Price|pg||
nt|athene: as expected, NS got some imps back from their thin 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: which was reached in the other room (5-4 spade fit and about a 21 count means it's going to be bid!) but it wasn't let through|pg||

mb|1D!|an|10-15|mb|p|nt|roswolf: dont think so but anything is possible|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|athene: I wouldn't expect EW to take the unfavourable push to 4@S here.|pg||
nt|brolucius: No, it was only the known double-fit in the other room that took them there.|pg||
nt|athene: In the other room it was the double-fit issue which did it.  But here, the nebulous 1@D opener has buried EW's diamond fit so they won't compete anything like as fiercely.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Some play 3@H now by North - as not showing a particularly good hand, but a 'pure' raise.|pg||
mb|2D!|an|good raise !H|mb|d|an|D|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: the waters become murky|pg||
nt|brolucius: But that is when the main suit has been named. 1@D did not name North's good suit of course.|pg||

pc|c2|nt|roswolf: :)|pg||

mc|10|nt|athene: Perhaps they play all transfers so North passes with a 1NT bid, bid 1NT with clubs, 2@C with diamonds and so on.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: There is a heart-club squeeze on East after that, but declarer finessed @HJ|pg||
mb|p!|mb|2C!|nt|brolucius: It seems that North read South's 3@S as natural (and why not?)|pg||

nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
mb|4C|an|undiscussed!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: When the other pair is in 7, it does not matter a lot if you bid game or slam, but N-S obviously don't know that|pg||
nt|athene: They will play 6@D, i am sure.|pg||
nt|roswolf: they should and n/s are on form in their constructive bidding|pg||
mb|5C|nt|Walddk2: Only 4 IMPs in it (game or slam). 12 - 16|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: If you play a relay system and you get a free run you really should get to the right contract.  You give up a lot of small disasdvantages elsewhere so you have to reap the maximum ...|pg||
nt|athene: benefit from when you get the machinery going.|pg||
nt|roswolf: oh oh has a wheel come off?|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: npo|pg||
nt|brolucius: A relay system that contains an undiscussed step in the middle seems a bit risky.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If undiscussed, 4@D is much safer|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: It looks as though North broke out of relays over 3@D.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Patterson and Crouch have bid extremely well on all the big hands. No wonder they have a huge lead. |pg||
nt|athene: Not sure why; if 3@H was asking for more information that looks the obvious move with North's hand.|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s4|pc|c2|pg||
nt|brolucius: Brunner and Holland are a brilliant pair normally, with a great record. But it has been a poor set for them.|pg||

mb|1D|nt|andyv:  the old bridge joke of pd who raised 1N to 2N holding nothing... when asked why he responded "I was always told that 1NT was the hardest contract to play."|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: hehehe|pg||
nt|eggy: actually there was no bidding on the pass out which probably means it hasn't been played yet|pg||

nt|ady: possible slam here|pg||
mb|2N|nt|eggy: crouch patterson managed the slam fairly comfortably in the end - oppo bidding helping if anything|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: even if you agree "responsive doubles" you need more discussion|pg||

mb|4C|mb|d|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Would a X from W have been more flexible?|pg||

nt|lestergold: Wild Bill has chickened|pg||
nt|athene: i would prefer to bid 4@H choice of games with north|pg||
nt|athene: saying "i have four spades and longer minor"|pg||
nt|athene: the only problem is, you have clubs not diamonds|pg||
mb|r!|nt|athene: so you need to be sure partner isn't going to bid 5@D|pg||
nt|eggy: well that improves the slam no end|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|andyv:  I would think ti would be|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: double may encourage south if knowing no losers outside clubs|pg||
mb|4N|nt|rodal f: But by the X N would have passed THIS time|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|eggy: and the bidding became easier as Michelle could Q 4H and N will know it isn't the Ace (even if missing it himself)|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|nt|eggy: That's a little odd - surely S has denied 2nd round club control|pg||

nt|roswolf: if declarer plays the cards rather than the man he will get this right|pg||
pc|hA|nt|brolucius: Not much value in light T/O, I would have said. If you are not worth a take-out double, you can pass for the moment - particularly when you are outgunned with the major suits ...|pg||

pc|s8|nt|athene: These very loose 1@D openers are the biggest weakness in many Precision-based systems.  Hard for partner to judge the hand in competition when you could have anything in diamonds ...|pg||
nt|athene: from a void to seven solid.|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|s6|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|nt|brolucius: A good, if obvious, switch to spades from East.|pg||

pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|athene: 3@C was dubious anyway though.|pg||
mc|7|nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|athene: One important factor was that north has three small spades.|pg||

nt|lestergold: hm in open hasset got well overboard|pg||
nt|roswolf: east in the other room was very aggressive|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps dixon's 4@S was a "rage" bid|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|lestergold: Dixon's 4 spade bid looks absurd|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|athene: often when partner pulls your lucrative penalty double you overbid|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: perhaps his thought was:- the delayed double is just penalties of hearts and doesn't promise any spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: very indsiplined by the distinguished Mr. Dixon|pg||
nt|athene: therefore, to pull to 2@S, partner should have 6@C and 5@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: dont like 2@H|pg||
nt|athene: and a heart void|pg||
nt|athene: but i think this is just bonkers|pg||
nt|athene: with that hand west was bidding 2@S over 2@h the first time|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: n/s in dangerous waters|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2h is merely a high card raise to 3C not ubnreasonable if tahts how you play unassuming cu bids|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: north could rebid 2nt to get the overall character of his hand across, perhaps|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lestergold: north could excuse himself and leave thec room to describe his hand's character|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps that is more constructive, and 3@C is the way to show the dead minimum|pg||
nt|ady: might  make if playing the J@D|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|s3|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks -2 for a useful 7 imps|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2h is wrong if playing 5 card majors of  course|pg||

nt|ady: going well|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|hT|pg||
nt|athene: south's hand is the poster child for having some method to show a t/o *without* spades|pg||
nt|athene: which might well be a good idea over a nebulous club|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|c8|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s2|nt|lestergold: another much needed gain for Rosen|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|athene: there are two schemes which are commonly used - either you play X denies spades and 1@S is 4+ spades|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|athene: or you play X is 4/5 spades and 1@S denies spades|pg||

nt|brolucius: 3@C did not look too bad to me. He may have thought that he had a good secondary fit for diamonds. No reason why South should not hold 3 or 4 diamonds.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|2S!|an| !S+minor|nt|athene: Yes, North was envisaging more of a double fit - that's why I mentioned the 1@D opener makes it hard for responder to judge.|pg||
nt|brolucius: It sure does.|pg||
nt|athene: Maybe he should have realised that West would have bid 1@S the first time with a spade overcall :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: strong club is essentially flawed|pg||
nt|brolucius: You must send an email to Meckstroth/Rodwell, explaining that!|pg||
mb|3C!|an|p/c|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: north should pass quickly|pg||
nt|athene: Meckwell would have opened a special bid to show a 3-suiter short diamonds.|pg||
nt|athene: So north would have no desire whatsoever to go to the 3-level with his @DAKJx|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hQ|pc|h9|nt|athene: I wonder if South had a penalty double available?  Do they play X as 4major-5minor perhaps?|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|s3|nt|brolucius: West's second heart is doubtless a suit preference card for spades.|pg||
