mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|frankaus: transfer advance - the new generation of bridge - i like it|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|qing: 5@C is superior but as the card lie, nothing can beat 3NT either|pg||

nt|qing: West wants to probe more with 3 good @H support, but he has @S stoppers |pg||

nt|qing: sometimes 3NT may not be the best theoretical game but often the practical one |pg||
pc|sA|pc|sJ|pc|h7|pc|s4|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|pc|h8|pc|h9|pg||
nt|qing: even if N has the @DA and S the @DQ, N is unlikely going to lead it|pg||
nt|frankaus: did he really disc a 1H?|pg||

mb|p|nt|qing: the format of the game is IMP, not MP, so overtricks do not weigh that much|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|2D!|nt|qing: so far W is having a good time, averaging > 16 HCP in 3 hands|pg||
nt|frankaus: how high will NS save in @H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dslee: x by kista|pg||
nt|qing: is 2@D a transfer or something like suction?|pg||
nt|dslee: suction, @H or two black suits|pg||
mb|3S|nt|qing: if it's suction, I'd try 3@S with S|pg||
nt|qing: pass or correct|pg||
mb|p|nt|dslee: Key and KK are a new ptrship and kista and kiruba are vetrans |pg||
nt|qing: from West's point of view he's still unsure oppo have found @S or @H fit|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dslee: in this confusion, thumb rule is to chop :)|pg||
nt|qing: EW has a lucky 5@C to make, but this is going to make the life very hard|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: if u chop thums u end up with 8 fingures :)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|dslee: if that needs to be reached, then on 2@D kista got to bid 3@C|pg||
nt|qing: but even without suction, it is not trivial to find 5@C -- for example, if W opens a 15-17 1NT|pg||

mb|p|nt|dslee: part game for KK and Key max max|pg||
mb|1C|nt|qing: but we don't seem to get any comparisons|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|d|mb|r|nt|qing: NS seems to play a more natural system whereas EW plays big @C|pg||
nt|dslee: Let me introduce all the kibbers to one of the topmost Indian players - p Sridhar who is kibbing with us here - except Key, Sridhar is a contemporary with all the other three on ...|pg||
nt|dslee: the table here|pg||
mb|2C|nt|qing: redouble shows 3 card @H support here|pg||
mb|2H|nt|qing: so S will compete to 2@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|qing: which doesn't show value|pg||
nt|qing: but usually 5@H|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|frankaus: t/o i expect|pg||
nt|dslee: interesting, what shd Kiruba do now |pg||
nt|frankaus: 2@D|pg||
nt|qing: this could be precarious, and perhaps E pushes too hard facing a passed pd|pg||
nt|frankaus: 3@D i mean|pg||
nt|qing: after all he doesn't have @S|pg||
nt|dslee: kiruba might bid 2@S & Kista might bid 3@D chop =-1|pg||
nt|dslee: all the more when NS does not have a game|pg||
nt|frankaus: opps bid & raise X = t/o |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|qing: notice that even though this is pairs, the scoring is IMPs|pg||
nt|dslee: hmm, knew that this will be a swinger and here it is|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|d6|pc|d4|pg||
nt|dslee: 13 IMP|pg||
nt|qing: with W's double, it is probably not too hard to read the @S situation, and get some overtricks |pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|pc|d5|pc|dT|pg||
nt|qing: so this could be 1070|pg||
nt|dslee: oppssss 15 then|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|hK|pg||
nt|frankaus: 870 or 1070 not a great number of imps |pg||
pc|dA|pc|h6|pc|d2|nt|dslee: 13 or 15 :)|pg||
pc|d9|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|dslee: would love to see Kista pull it bacl|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|dslee: No slam qing :)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|frankaus: peter halls book  competative bidding at pairs has a  really good chapter on X in competition - worth a read|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N!|mb|p|nt|qing: well I'm sure E didn't bid 3NT|pg||
nt|qing: and the cuebid follows|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|qing: South bid 3NT as serious I guess|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D!|nt|dslee: South knows what and who East is :)|pg||
nt|qing: unfortunately NS may find using RKC that they miss a keycard and trump Q|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|dslee: SPecs, in India, there are a lot of excellent players who are some of the world ruler, but Kista (Krishnan) is just one, who is there and cant ever be back - he is special and ...|pg||
nt|dslee: watch his game |pg||
mb|4N|nt|qing: but fortunately @S is not 2-2 so he probably wouldn't have made the slam in most cases|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1S|mb|d|mb|2S|nt|frankaus: 4@H looks a good chance here|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|frankaus: now can they set it?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|dslee: for the benefit of the viewers, the BBO id of the four players are nrk(kiruba), kista(krishnan), key1809(kaizad) and kkkumar(kkumar) can add them as friends|pg||
pc|c4|nt|qing: well if S divines the position, EW can't set it|pg||

nt|dslee: Guess for Key to take the @H fin or run with @H K|pg||
nt|dslee: ruff with @H 10 can be fuzzy|pg||
nt|vugraphzxp: s thinking|pg||
nt|dslee: I bet he has to now :) knowing Key, he will run @H K|pg||
nt|vugraphzxp: still thinking defenders trying to look bored|pg||
nt|frankaus: sitting and hoping for a clue |pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|nt|dslee: Hmm, a tactic followed by nrk and kista, no clues on who has what|pg||
pc|hK|pc|s2|pg||
mc|9|nt|dslee: see, the money on my side :)|pg||
nt|qing: you are right!|pg||
nt|dslee: these are my best of friends in Indian bridge:)|pg||
nt|dslee: say thanks to all these 4 players who gave you a good game in the last 6 deals :) all the best to both the pairs|pg||
nt|qing: on this hand, S can improve his play and avoid guessing by playing a @H up towards his @HK|pg||
nt|qing: if West has the @HA, E can't get in to give him a ruff|pg||
nt|qing: so you can make whenever trump is 3-2|pg||
nt|qing: do we have more boards or this will be it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxp: 19 minute break|pg||
nt|vugraphzxp: sorry 11 mt|pg||
nt|qing: thanks|pg||
nt|vugraphzxp: next round another set of 6 boards |pg||
nt|dslee: folks its a break, but in the meantime, let me introduce you to psridhar who is going to be the main commentator here henceforth|pg||
nt|dslee: Welcome P and its an honor to have you here with us |pg||
