mb|4H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: If 4@C is a cue bid, Petersson will be a lot happier if he can let partner redouble to show 1st rd ctrl|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But I don't lnow their methods|pg||
nt|haans: and why learn :)|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  Dis N ever show all his playing tricks?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: can S see the 8-card @d suit on this bidding?|pg||
