nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Bill Jacobs, Ralf Willquist, Geoffrey Wolfarth and Hans Sjöström|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Our operator is Johan Wahlberg|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello Geoffrey and Hans|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello Bill|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Ralf HI Goeffrey|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Hi all|pg||
nt|roswolf: is this their first board or have they played a few already?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The players are on board 14 at the moment, so we missed 4 boards|pg||
nt|ralfwil: What is the actual standing?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Two-way club for N-S, natural-ish for E-W|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There is no update after round 7 I am afraid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.sterik.se/Portals/48/docs/files/2009-10-31obs11.htm  after round 6|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: http://www.sterik.se/Portals/48/docs/files/2009-10-31obs12.htm is the correct one|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So 4th against 1st|pg||
nt|haans: Björn Fallenius - Peter Fredin took the lead after last games match very entertaing match|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@s on EW if they find @sQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: here we go|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C for E-W either natural or a 17-19 NT. They play transfer responses|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: Apparently not after interference|pg||
mb|d|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|ralfwil: maybe also difficult with 5-5 in majors|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Not much to go on|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2: Right, but you know, Fredin's flair ...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's hard to find a reason for getting the spades right ... so flair it will have to be|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Peter has a good nose for smelling cards position, so let us see|pg||

pc|h8|pc|h6|pc|h7|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|haans: he may assume 6-2 distribution in @D|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: the T/O double may give some |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Sensitive auction, and this contract might just make - it depends on the lead|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|roswolf: not clear what his alternative was|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bjacobs: South's invite with 13 points shows maturity.  If the North hand is an opening bid, then the South hand is not worth forcing to game|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pg||
pc|d6|nt|haans: Can only agree to: fabsayc: in NA we don't see opening bids on north junk either|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|roswolf: 10 tricks with west discarding his spades|pg||

pc|h5|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|nt|bjacobs: @HJ suit preferencing for spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The conclusion must be that passouts don't exist at tables where N-S play|pg||

pc|s2|pc|h9|pg||
nt|roswolf: has west got a hard hat?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ralfwil: In vul  S´s hand is far from opening in my opinion|pg||
pc|c5|nt|haans: Mårten - did win the  Swedish Pairs Championship  3 times running in 1990th  Claimed he was lucky = Swedish 'low level" attitude not an opinion|pg||

mb|1D!|nt|roswolf: 3nt anyone?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Well, we all could have predicted the opening bid ...|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|2S!|nt|bjacobs: West knows he has the best hand at the table, even though he's the only guy who has said "pass"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Provided that Fallenius is selected, he will be the first one to have represented his native country, then a new country (USA), and then back to the nation where he started|pg||
nt|bjacobs: "selected"?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: These are trials, Bill|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: So he does not have an automatic berth|pg||
nt|bjacobs: They certainly are ... there's evidently a jury involved, or at least a judge|pg||
nt|roswolf: have sweden got that many world class pairs?|pg||
mb|4D|nt|roswolf: is this clear-cut|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Yes, there is a selection committee. One of the members is Jan Kamras, the NPC of the Open team|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Could anyone of you bid 1nt on W after the opening 1@d?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I guess 6@D only goes down if South leads a club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And yes Geoffrey, Sweden could field two very strong teams|pg||
nt|roswolf: i could have bid 1nt but i wouldnt have on that relative junk|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I don't think Fallenius is seriously thinking about slam.  He is trying to decide between 5@D and 4@H|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If he bids 4@S though, my comment doesn't stand|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: http://www.sterik.se/Portals/48/docs/files/2009-10-31obs12.htm   look at 11th and 12th spot, and you will see what I mean. It must be a strong field with those two pairs in those ...|pg||
