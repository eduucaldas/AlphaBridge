mb|p|mb|1C|mb|d|nt|mwigor: hi erin|pg||
nt|athene: if west doubles a 1@C opener, EW will lock into hearts |pg||
nt|athene: trump break might prove a bit annoying|pg||
mb|1S|nt|petergill: With a Cayne match on BBO, and Ron Klinger at the other table, we have plenty of competing attractions, but the four players at this table are all very good indeed at bridge|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|athene: west might now just bid 4@H - but it's the sort of hand where you really, really want partner to have a fifth trump|pg||
nt|petergill: South might double 41H|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Hi Michael and Marshall|pg||
mb|d|nt|marlowepi: hello roland, erin, michael & specs|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: @CJ lead is best|pg||
nt|petergill: except North is not on lead|pg||
nt|athene: unfortunately, east is declarer :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: hi marshall|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: Hello everyone :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: players dont usually want to be anonymous until at least Baord 5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi chick|pg||
nt|mwigor: hi cornelia|pg||
nt|mwigor: south had a tough problem|pg||
nt|mwigor: forcing to the 5-level feels like too much on an aceless 4333 though|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont think he meant to force to the five level by cuebidding|pg||
nt|cindy:  hi all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome cindy|pg||
nt|athene: i guess north couldn't bid 2@S over the double, for whatever reason|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mwigor: no - but she raised 4@d to 5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: they ended up at that level, but the 3H bid itself is not forcing to that level|pg||
nt|athene: or perhaps he just chose not to|pg||
nt|athene: but if 2@S first time was a weak jump shift, north must be worried that he hasn't really described his hand very well|pg||
nt|athene: i.e. he hasn't got any defence and partner might be counting on some :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer's aim is to hold the trump losers to 3, while ruffing a couple of spades in his hand - I think|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|mwigor: so effectively thats what she did|pg||
nt|athene: yes declarer is going to try to set up dummy|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|dJ|pc|d6|pg||
nt|petergill: Zoli Nagy has played in Australia's Open Team many times, most recently in 2007. |pg||
nt|athene: but for that purpose he doesn't want to get dummy forced - fortunately south can't attack clubs so often|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|marlowepi: i guess i would think of it as "forcing to game". which would not be the five level in all cases|pg||
pc|s2|nt|cindy:  who whould bid 3N ?|pg||
nt|petergill: He correctly uses one of his limited entries to hand to take the @d finesse|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|cindy:  S or N ?|pg||
nt|petergill: 3 rounds of trump now defeats 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: well, three rounds of trumps leaves declarer a trick short now doesn't it?|pg||
nt|petergill: Perhaps a spade from hand towards the ace at Trick 2 was even better|pg||
nt|athene: but south might be worried that his partner has a trump void, in which case cashing even one top heart might give away a vital tempo|pg||
nt|petergill: so South has to decide whether to play partner for one trump or for @CK?|pg||
nt|athene: if declarer has a fifth heart and the @CK clearly there's no defence so south will be thinking about forcing dummy, playing his partner for the @CK |pg||
pc|hA|nt|mwigor: mcdonald would have to |pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|nt|mwigor: walsh can't really on Jx|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h5|pg||
nt|cindy:  thats the spot|pg||
nt|mwigor: yes|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|nt|athene: ok, well done|pg||
pc|s8|pc|h6|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|pc|d4|nt|petergill: Chris Hughes' lowest spade might be interpreted in some partnerships as suit pref showing @CK - but|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no but N could bid 3S to see if S could bid a delayed 3N, which would show tenuous stoppage|pg||
nt|mwigor: i guess this is another bid 3NT if thats a feasible option hand|pg||
pc|dK|pc|c6|pc|d9|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: a spec suggests that east needs @CK for 2@H but i am sure Nagy would have bid 2@H on @HJxxxx and the spade|pg||
pc|c9|nt|petergill: all partnerships that include Chris Hughes play natural count all the time, I think|pg||
pc|c5|nt|marlowepi: hamman's rule could be applied here yes, though aceless with a lousy Qxx is not ideal. i nm,y view N shd bid 3S to see if pd can back into 3N|pg||
nt|mwigor: thats not what 3@s says though|pg||
nt|mwigor: it says i have a 5th @s|pg||
nt|mwigor: so it leads to 4@s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not for me it doesnt|pg||

nt|cindy:  still struggling to find a spot to play|pg||
nt|chick: would 4@S play any better than 5@D?|pg||
nt|petergill: Henry Christie deduced that if East had five @h's, he would have played a spade from hand at Trick 2, not a @D|pg||
nt|petergill: since East with 5 hearts in a 9 card fit would not be in such a rush to set up @d winners|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|mwigor: hi cindy|pg||
nt|cindy:  hi :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: matter of partnership agreement|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: mcdonald-walsh have given up their strong club these days|pg||
nt|mwigor: so i think 1@c was natural|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry, I mean Reverse Count (= Upside Down Count) is what Chris plays|pg||
mb|2N|nt|athene: NS can perhaps make 6NT here? give up a diamond then cash everything and east gets squeezed in the majors|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: which is "normal count" in australia|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|petergill: 2@D strong NT or other options, 2@H to play opposite weak 2@H, 2NT 22-23 I think|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|mwigor: hard for mcdonald to pass 1@s but that was the spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: declarer decided that with a very weak dummy spade might well be better|pg||
mb|d|nt|mwigor: this should be -1|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|4N|nt|marlowepi: at least|pg||
nt|athene: give north @SQJxxx and no sure entry and it's easy to see how you might want to play the 5-2 fit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: very greedy double from East|pg||
nt|petergill: Ron Klinger wrote up that Bruce Neill thinks that with HH after 2NT and transfer, opener should play in the major, based on a  lot of evidence.  |pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: would east get three spades and the @DK, in 4@S?|pg||
nt|athene: he would unless declarer can squeeze or endplay him, but that might be possible|pg||
nt|petergill: where H = honour card|pg||
pc|c4|nt|petergill: Yes, 4@S would have failed, North Chris Hughes did well to run|pg||
nt|athene: there's a case for simply responding 3nt with that north hand - you have loads of hcp but weak spades|pg||
nt|petergill: Many of us, including Bruce Neill (who just told me) would treat North's spades as a four card suit and simply Stayman over 2NT.  |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|marlowepi: looks -2 to me|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
nt|mwigor: yes theres always four trump tricks|pg||
nt|chick: if the defense can untangle them|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont think they have to untangle them|pg||
pc|d5|nt|marlowepi: E shd pitch H|pg||
pc|d6|nt|marlowepi: he has 3 natural tricks, mistake to trump with 9|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the discard has already happened anyway|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|pc|dT|nt|petergill: Ishmael Delmonte is another expert who would Stayman with those North cards - honours in the doubletons, very poor suit|pg||

mc|12|nt|mwigor: not any more|pg||

mb|1N|nt|marlowepi: presumably it is E whpo is thinking after a double|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: if it took that long to decide to double 2S with the N hand, this could be a very long match|pg||
nt|cindy:  well  neither side can make much of anything|pg||
nt|mwigor: alan is a considered player|pg||
nt|athene: many pairs have a gadget in response to 1NT to show both minors with a major singleton|pg||
mb|2N|nt|athene: but here the singleton is the ace, which changes things|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: it would be illuminating to know what options he was considering|pg||
mb|3C|nt|cindy:  i dont think they can even make 2@s|pg||

mb|3N|an|5+/5+ minors NF|nt|chick: if that was to keep them out of their diamond fit, it worked|pg||

nt|chick: the last time I played in a 4-0 fit was a missed splinter :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: was 2S something special then?|pg||
nt|cindy:  i hate exp;aining these things to teammates|pg||
nt|cindy:  i didnt see an alert|pg||
nt|mwigor: 2@s was a weak two of some sort|pg||
nt|cindy:  operator ?|pg||
nt|mwigor: not sure exactly how they play it|pg||
nt|athene: saying "i have both minors and a singleton heart" might make partner bypass 3nt when it's wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: well yes, but of what sort|pg||
nt|athene: on the other hand, 5-5 shapes aren't really NT shapes|pg||
nt|petergill: Nigel Rosendorff once told me that Henry Christie is the best player in Perth in Western Australia - most of the rest of us would have given Nigel himself that rating - but now ...|pg||
nt|petergill: that Nigel has moved to live in Sydney ... |pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: useful sequence to be able to show 5/5 minors like this|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|petergill: 5@C = 10/10 if I were giving the ratings in a bidding contest, 4@S = 6/10, 6@C = 5/10, 3NT = 2/10, partscores 1/10. |pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: yes this hand is an excellent example of why 2-suiters aren't good in NT - if just one suit runs, that's not enough tricks to make 3NT assuming you got a threatening lead|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mwigor: 5@s and 4m|pg||
nt|mwigor: (as at world champs)|pg||
nt|chick: this is a scramble to get as many tricks as possible before opps realize they can draw trump|pg||
nt|mwigor: not sure if its changed since|pg||
pc|d4|nt|cindy:  they don't know their methods ?|pg||
nt|mwigor: the defence dont actually need to draw trump|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|petergill: 5@C makes on any defence, though declarer doesn't know that - for now|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|nt|mwigor: my guess is andy bid 3@d to decide whether to bid 4@s over 4@h|pg||
nt|athene: but if they both run you are probably making slam anyway - or at least you are cold in five|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mwigor: he wasnt expecting the auction to die there|pg||

pc|c9|pc|h3|nt|cindy:  huh ?|pg||

nt|chick: not really, if they double he can run and if not, would have to be down 7 to beat 620|pg||

nt|athene: i know some players who would show majors with that west hand|pg||
mb|2C|an| |nt|mwigor: it is important for the person who opens the bidding not to deviate too far from the agreements|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: so that their partner can judge the hand|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: NS playing Keri or something?|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: you dont have to operate, and you can achieve all the same objectives, if you play 3D as a forcing fitting lead-director. and there is no other valuable use for the bid really|pg||

nt|cindy:  thats not all that surprising|pg||
nt|chick: NS only took 7 tricks in this room|pg||
nt|chick: is that the value of being declarer? :)|pg||
nt|mwigor: the failure to take 8 in the two card ending was quite poor|pg||

nt|athene: but he doesn't really think he's going to miss game by bidding just 2@D there|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|cindy:  the danger of bidding 2@s here rather than 3N is it gives N a chance to make a lead directing double|pg||

pc|h5|nt|mwigor: that is true|pg||

nt|marlowepi: that Morton gets around|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|athene: west is likely to take the push to 5@S over 5@D i would think|pg||

nt|marlowepi: 4C by W|pg||
nt|athene: i guess he does have his kings outside his partner's suit but even so...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if he bids 4C he can abide by E decision|pg||
mb|4S|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|athene: once he has bid 4@S he is surely intending to bid 5@S himself over 5@D if his partner doesn't double it|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|sA|pg||

nt|mwigor: this should be a fairly easy grand to bi|pg||
nt|mwigor: bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|cindy:  here we go again|pg||
nt|mwigor: braithwaite-haughie have an interesting bit of kit here|pg||
nt|mwigor: 2@c is a puppet to 2@d|pg||
mb|4D|nt|mwigor: 2@d is and GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: contrary to popular belief, second position is a good one to preempt in, because partner;s hand is as yet unrevelaed to opps and their primary concern must be to show or find fits|pg||
nt|marlowepi: far from obvious for EW to bid slam if S bids 3D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and everybody has a relatively normal hand|pg||
nt|athene: someone needs to take charge and find out that both majors are running|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|mwigor: in the butler in july one of them forgot and the auction 1@d-1@h-1@s-2@d was passed out|pg||
nt|mwigor: my partner and i had an identical disaster (same kit)|pg||
nt|mwigor: so one of them went into the datums|pg||
nt|athene: i think it should be west - east just knows his partner has some controls for hearts; he doesn't know about the huge trick source|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|athene: imagine a club lead, for instance, taking out dummy's entry|pg||
nt|mwigor: 5N now from zol|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: East knows about the king of spades, and is able to ask for the king of hearts with keycard|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no below-game jumps available for EW if S bids 3D|pg||
nt|athene: if the spades are just a bit weaker (say, no @SQ) then you can't ruff them good and get back to them|pg||
nt|mwigor: or maybe 5@s is better|pg||
nt|athene: so i don't see how east can know to bid this grand with confidence|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|mwigor: east should invite grand and west should bid it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: they are lucky to have had a clear run even to the small slam|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dont see why W should bid a grand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he has no idea about spade king, and club lead may dislodge only entry to long spades|pg||
nt|athene: well, west knows there are two big trick sources - east doesn't|pg||
nt|mwigor: 5@s over 5@c asking for third round @s control might be better|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: if W doesnt know about S king he cannot view that suit as a trick source|pg||
nt|athene: i think after the 3@H rebid, west should just take control|pg||
nt|athene: or, at worst, he takes control over 4@D|pg||
nt|mwigor: thats not enough though is it|pg||
nt|athene: he can blackwood then spiral scan for the @SK|pg||
nt|athene: or whatever they use to find kings|pg||
nt|marlowepi: spiral scan headed your way bill|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: EW are whispering about their auction to their respective opponents|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|marlowepi: over here we have to pre-alert if we play stuff but we dont really know it:)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: at worst partner has stiff @SK and club lead takes out your entry i suppose|pg||

nt|mwigor: he couldnt have that and bid blackwood|pg||
nt|marlowepi: when did E say that?|pg||
nt|athene: ah right you mean on the auction they actuall yhad|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sure, i was responding to the claim that W should take control over 3H, which was long before blackwood|pg||
nt|athene: well, 3@H was the limit bid, so it was west's duty to take charge after that, i still claim|pg||
mb|3C|nt|athene: you are never not playing six, are you? so you can surely find out about the @SK|pg||
mb|d|nt|marlowepi: would agree if there were a clear path to finding out all he needed to know|pg||
nt|marlowepi: we dont do double negatives in the colonies bill|pg||
mb|3H|nt|marlowepi: wweak 2 for me|pg||
nt|athene: this is where control-bidding auctions can be pernicious - people are told it's good to have "co-operative" auctions and then there's a whole lot of buck-passing and no-one just ...|pg||
nt|athene: takes charge|pg||
nt|marlowepi: too many flaws for 3C. suit short, too much defense|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: he might bid 2S|pg||
nt|cindy:  plenty of points|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: looks like 9 in spades|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: he doesnt know west has a 5 count|pg||
pc|cK|nt|cindy:  why didnt he bid 3@c instead of 3@c|pg||
pc|c5|nt|marlowepi: interesting question:)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|chick: :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: care to run that by us again?:)|pg||
nt|cindy:  2@c|pg||
nt|cindy:  sorry butterfingers|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, have to admit this auction really stuck it to EW|pg||
nt|athene: but it can be good to have defence for your pre-empts|pg||
nt|athene: it means when opps bid game you can double them and beat them|pg||
nt|marlowepi: excellent moment to make an anti-percentage bid:)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|cindy:  if this isnt a jump shift i dont know what is|pg||
nt|athene: this is what Reese was talking about when he babbled about "a pre-empt which is always weak is a blunt sword" or something|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, in all fairness let us note that when S opens 3C he hardly imagines opps will fetch up in 5D|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: north actually played the 9 then the ten, if that makes any difference to south's play|pg||
nt|mwigor: in the concurrent women's final havas lead lowry 65-29|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c9|nt|marlowepi: maybe has to do with their kit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: anyway good stop|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: yeah they can respond very light and they have good 2nd round bidding by responder|pg||

pc|d3|pg||

nt|marlowepi: exciting contest, evenly matched teams|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|2C|nt|marlowepi: as recommended in this room:)|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: isnt it funny, this hand is good enough for a splinter opposite a 1-level overcall, but opposite the two level overcall she was only worth 2NT|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: holding 4 more points than now|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|athene: a tricky and delicate sequence for NS|pg||
nt|athene: if 2@S over 2@C would have been forcing, then this is NF and suggests better spades with less outside, i would have thought|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: yeah north is imagining less hcp, longer spades|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|cT|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|nt|marlowepi: 3S seems like a lot on 3-card support|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|marlowepi: a very awkward hand for NS, and an object lesson for those who would sniff at the overcall by E|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s9|pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: yes the overcall in NS's 4-3 fit has propelled them into playing in EW's 4-3 fit |pg||
pc|s8|nt|mwigor: the south hand is awkward over the 2@c overcall in standard methods|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h2|pc|sK|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry i guess that was covered, was basting the pheasant|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lambasting the peasant|pg||
nt|mwigor: one good approach is to switch 2@d and 2@s bids then south can bid 2@d to show a negative free bid or better in @s|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|cindy:  good def here|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: now east gets a diamond ruff with his little spade|pg||
nt|athene: well done by west to duck that trump|pg||
pc|d7|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cJ|nt|marlowepi: well i like the negative free bid in spades part if thet idea, but what exactly would 2S show then|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: yes, switching the bids sometimes helps but here after 1@H (2@C) 2@D! 2@H south still has a bit of a problem|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|mwigor: now south could pass maybe as they've shown their hand and its a misfit|pg||
nt|athene: yes, perhaps|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h4|pc|h6|pg||
nt|athene: he has shown the fifth spade and his partner didn't want to know|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d5|pg||
nt|cindy:  well...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if 2S was not even forcing i dont see the point of the bid. hearts in N hand probably at least as good as spades in S hand|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|mwigor: i think 2@h is a good raise to 2@s|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|athene: not the auction that south dreamed of when he first picked up the hand|pg||
nt|athene: he has to pass now|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|mwigor: 3@h probably a short suit trial|pg||
nt|athene: or not, of course :)|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cindy:  they have a chance to get two @s on def|pg||
nt|marlowepi: is 3H restricted to trial bids? could it be first move on a slam-try hand? if so, maybe S could bid 4C instead of 4S, though admittedly the trumps are very thin|pg||
nt|cindy:  think thats the best they can do|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: at least he doesn't have to put his hand on the table|pg||
pc|d4|nt|marlowepi: attack on clubs might be awkward|pg||

nt|athene: ruffing heart finesse takes care of the club loser...but there's the small issue of trump control of course|pg||
nt|marlowepi: impossible, S has at least a 6 card suit, there cant be control issues:)|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps lilley will call the director on his partner for following to the second spade with a card he can't have|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: don't leave yet, kibbers!!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: was 32 played?|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: there's no 32|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: who opened 1C here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: so that we wont confuse this with roulette?|pg||
nt|mwigor: why no 32?|pg||
mb|1C|nt|vugrapha2: oh hang on there is|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: the list stopped at 31 - and the other table finished a while ago|pg||
mb|1H|nt|marlowepi: well that is certainly one way to look at it. another is that you arent going to buy it for 1H, so you can bid 2H on minimum openers with a fit and bid 1H forcing on other hands ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with either heart tolerance or a good hand|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: yes, he was probably planning to invite until he was told east was 13-14|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: ah ok|pg||
mb|p|pc|h6|pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1H can work sometimes, but when it does the payoff is usually smallish. when it backfires, though, it usually costs a fortune--typical scnario you pick off opps 44 fit so they play ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in 3NT making  instead of 4H down|pg||

nt|lml: probably a heart is best now.  Lets see if Klinger does that|pg||
nt|chick: little choice but to keep forcing the dummy|pg||
nt|lml: yes he knows the spades are good|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lml: well that is another way of putting pressure on declarers trump I suppose but this one he can ruff in hand|pg||
nt|chick: the ruff sluff is irrelevant since all the side suit tricks are good|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h6|pc|d3|pg||
nt|lml: its just that it might be a bit stronger to get him to ruff in dummy|pg||
nt|lml: since West has the @HJ it doesnt matter|pg||
nt|lml: well he could try to crossruff or he could try to draw some trump|pg||
nt|lml: both work on the lie of the cards but Hughes doesnt know that|pg||
nt|chick: seems like crossruffing is pretty safe, although double dummy, drawing trump works better because the Q falls|pg||
nt|lml: he knows he can ruff hearts in dummy but he might be worried about getting the DxJ through|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|d6|pc|h8|pg||
nt|chick: with trumps splitting, he can hardly go wrong|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sJ|nt|lml: hes doing the crossruff line which I think is better in percentage terms|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|hT|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lml: hes home now and he is a happy camper|pg||
mc|9|nt|lml: I agree with all comments that he could also have played for 3-2 diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: 3-2 after the ruff|pg||
nt|chick: even if the @DJ lost to the Q overruff, he was safe|pg||

mb|1H|nt|marlowepi: have to say i would bid 2C with N hand|pg||
mb|2C|nt|marlowepi: ??|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: another object lesson for those who would poohpooh a 2C overcall with no texture and no shape|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy:  5@c here is a good save   think they will bid it ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it can preempt spades, thatis the main thing|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: but you also want a club lead, not some lame diamond|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|nt|marlowepi: and 2 likely entries so even if they have a double stopper u have great chances against 3N|pg||
pc|c3|nt|cindy:  i think S should bid 3@c over 1@h ... assuming that is weak|pg||
