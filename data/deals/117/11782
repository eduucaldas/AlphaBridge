mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|athene: West may balance 2@D.|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: Not ideal shape, though - that's the way you 'find' a lot of 3-3 spade fits...|pg||
mb|d|nt|benjent: You mean balance over 2@d? It always hurts to have a hand like West and have the oppos bidding, and bidding your suit just to rub it in|pg||
nt|athene: Some would bid a natural 1NT with West over 1@H.|pg||
nt|benjent: Meanwhile, Melbourne is worrying about just how much this is going to hurt now :)|pg||
nt|roghog: Howard Melbourne is quite a good at predicting, I hear. He's leading in a newspaper competition with a Â£25K prize|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|athene: He shouldn't be worrying that much - he has five cards in a suit partner promised!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c3|nt|benjent: Yes, but if partner really really had the blacks, why didn't he have a swing the first time around? I'd be worried with Melbourne's hand|pg||
nt|roghog: Fantasy Fund Manager, in the Telegraph|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
nt|athene: True, you know partner either is very light or offshape - the second looks more likely since you have a five-count.|pg||
nt|athene: But you still have five of them - 3-2-4-4 would be much nastier!|pg||
nt|benjent: It's not obvious looking at @SA10x on the board, but a @s switch is Small's best play now. Difficult. Challenging. Awkward. Good luck|pg||
nt|athene: It's hard to put partner with @SKQJ when he didn't lead one, I think.|pg||
nt|benjent: Or 3343 with 4 small diamonds. Gothically bad. Cruising for real punishment|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|nt|athene: I remember a hand from Bridge World a while back where you had that sort of problem and people bid 2@H, deciding that partner had to have heart length.|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|pg||
nt|benjent: Shazaam! Nice play, Mr Small!|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|s8|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can use the diamond finesse to get rid of the @S10|pg||
nt|benjent: Needs to cash @cA first, to get rid of South's pesky trump|pg||
nt|roghog: Declarer will be counting South's points|pg||
nt|athene: he still has to drop the @HA too, though.|pg||
nt|benjent: And then guess the hearts to make. No worries, mate|pg||
nt|athene: South should perhaps have falsecarded there with the @SK|pg||
nt|athene: trying to look like a man with the @HA|pg||
nt|roghog: Has North enough to open without A@H?|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|d5|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d3|pc|dJ|pc|d9|pg||
nt|athene: Or south could play @SQ then a *small* spade - if declarer puts north with @SKJx he can lead a heart to the @HK|pg||
nt|athene: Well, he didn't cash the @CA, so no chance now.|pg||
nt|benjent: Rrrrrats. I was looking forward to the guess, and Melbourne is up to it.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: Exactly the same idea as last hand - East is trying to cash a diamond to throw a loser, but someone is going to ruff it.|pg||
pc|cT|pc|sT|pc|d6|pg||
nt|benjent: But this time it was working!|pg||
nt|benjent: Now he needs North to be 4162 ... not tonight Josephine|pg||
nt|benjent: Osbourne probably wondering which @h switch is most cunning|pg||
nt|athene: The problem is, that he could always just lead a spade and pin declarer in dummy.|pg||
nt|athene: So if he doesn't, it's suspicious,|pg||
nt|athene: declarer should reject the chance to lead up to the @HK as it's a Grosvenor of sorts.|pg||
nt|benjent: A couple of kibs have pointed out that 4162 is pretty close to impossible - North would have rebid 1@S rather than 2@d.  I agree - I was just pointing out what was needed, not the ...|pg||
nt|benjent: odds of it.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: Sure, if you need a particular layout to make your contract, you are supposed to assume it exists, even if it's the layout "both defenders lost their minds" :)|pg||

nt|athene: Some number of diamonds now; I suppose 3 is normal.|pg||
mb|3D|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|athene: If the colours were reversed he might bid 4 or 5.|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|benjent: Single dummy, 4@h looks easy, just a question of overtricks. One round of trumps will change that view|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: No double of 4@D from South - that is much more likely to help opps than partner.|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h2|pc|d2|pg||
nt|benjent: Luckily the @sQ falls, otherwise Hassett would probably play North for the @cQ (he will count out for the long @c's)|pg||
nt|athene: How about trying to endplay South?|pg||
nt|athene: You might be able to get rid of his diamonds and put him in with his trump winner to save your black-suit guess perhaps?|pg||
nt|benjent: To lead away from the @sQ? Possible, but that entails stripping @c's - which will drop the @cQ!|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d9|pg||
nt|athene: you don't need to strip the clubs though - if south leads one that's just fine :)|pg||
nt|roghog: @D first anyway, to score the ruff in dummy|pg||
nt|benjent: Shocking lead problem for South now|pg||
nt|benjent: Best is probably the odd-looking @cQ - try to look like a man with QJ, hope partner actually has the J and that declarer goes wrong|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|pc|dQ|pc|h8|pg||
nt|benjent: The problem with playing the @d is that declarer is likely to drop partner's @sQ next, which can't be good for you|pg||

nt|benjent: Good day for the stiff @hA offside|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cQ|nt|athene: wow - 3@H and another heart|pg||
nt|benjent: If 3@h was uncomfortable, how's 4@h Bill?|pg||
nt|benjent: 4@h has lots of playable suits, and if you could do everything successfully, you could make a lot of tricks. Unfortunately, entries are short AND the layout is suboptimal|pg||
nt|athene: Declarer has to decide whether to rely on diamond ruffs, or using the spades|pg||
nt|benjent: Trying for @d ruffs is likely to induce a @h switch - which is actually ok for declarer|pg||
nt|athene: Even if trumps lie as nicely as you could wish (@HAx onside) you still have to lose the lead a lot of times to draw trumps.|pg||
nt|benjent: I'd suggest win the @cA and duck a @d, preferably to East|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|pc|c6|pg||
pc|h3|nt|benjent: If the defence is a bit careless, you may find that the 4th diamond is get over-ruffed by the defence's natural trump trick|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|roghog: Sorry, have been explaining something to VG team. Should have both rooms for next match|pg||
nt|benjent: It's nice when declarer takes EXACTLY the opposite line to what you've been blabbing on about :)|pg||
nt|benjent: Can't he see all four hands?|pg||
nt|athene: A spade now limits declarer to @SAK, @DA, @CA and the long trump for -400|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|s8|pg||
nt|benjent: Of course, the ultimate crushing experience would be if declarer makes his contract doing the opposite of my line. Thankfully, he is absolutely no chance at all. Phew!|pg||

nt|athene: Declarer had to duck that - now East can get in with his diamond spot.|pg||
nt|benjent: I've been advised by a number of kibs not to be so polite, so perhaps I might just say now that if you're going to butcher a hand, best to do it properly, rather than spread it ...|pg||
nt|benjent: across several hands|pg||
mc|5|nt|benjent: Who would have thought EW had a game on? :)|pg||
nt|athene: A poker writer called Mike Caro says there's a "Misery Threshhold"|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|athene: so once you are going down, say, 3 in a freely bid vul game, you might well go 4 or 5 down without really feeling it's any worse|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|roghog: A light vul opening, nevertheless|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: My friend Cathy calls it the Suicide Point|pg||

nt|athene: West cashes the @HA, not putting declarer with quite so many hearts :)|pg||
mc|4|nt|benjent: 4@s is the more likely EW contract. A @d lead from South will probably shoot it, but West should make it.|pg||
nt|athene: 1NT is a fairly common ploy, although usually people don't do it at this vulnerability.|pg||
pg||
qx|o6|st||md|4SJT6HK832D8653C83,SA875HAQTDQ74CAQ4,SQ942HJ5DT2CKT976,SK3H9764DAKJ9CJ52|sv|e|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|athene: If you raise hearts, that will induce opps to bid spades!|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|benjent: 1@s - with J10x - may have been a more prudent ploy|pg||
nt|athene: A lot of vulnerable undertricks for NS on the last two boards.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: A bit like the joke "sorry partner, went for 800  - good job they didn't double!"|pg||
pc|h2|nt|roghog: Not tempted by the pancake 18-pointer|pg||
nt|benjent: Not vulnerable undertricks here....|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|pc|h3|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|benjent: What's the range of the 1NT rebid? Maybe 11-13 would turn West off.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|roghog: Always tempting to rest on this sort of hand in a long event - and not bother about overtricks|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|benjent: Well, losing @c finesse, no squeeze, 10 tricks pretty comfortably. I guess Melbourne will play it out just to play with NS's tortured minds|pg||
nt|roghog: This is a trial for the English Camrose team. You play 7 60-board matches|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: Well, if you think opps are on tilt, perhaps you play a boring hand out as fast as possible to get to a more swingy hand whilst they are *still* on tilt :)|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|benjent: Not so much :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: I think he decided he was going to bid game if partner super-accepted, otherwise go for the safe positive score.|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d3|pc|d5|pg||

mb|3C|nt|athene: Although the heart holding isn't ideal.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: Sometimes people say "he only has three hearts but they are good" - but that's not what you want when you have the short spades.  You don't want partner, playing a heart contract ...|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps in a 4-3 fit, to waste the big hearts ruffing.|pg||
nt|roghog: 3@s just competing. Bid something else to try|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|4C|nt|benjent: Good pass by Small. He would be confident that Osbourne has short @s's and 6+@c's, but he can't be sure just how 4@s might go. Best to go quietly.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|benjent: Another matter for Osbourne - he has an excellent two-way hand, easy re-opening X for him|pg||
mc|10|nt|benjent: When I say 2-way, I mean he has good cards for offence and defence. He has no real fear of 4@s, and in fact 3@s might be going down if partner has good @s's, even in a dreadful ...|pg||
nt|benjent: hand|pg||
nt|athene: North can't really bid 4@C first time because partner, with a good hand and short spades, is going to bid 5@C over it too often, I think.|pg||

nt|benjent: Partner shouldn't really be thinking game - it's obviously a competitive hand, with roughly evenly divided points, so raising is really just announcing a fit. Any points you have ...|pg||

nt|athene: if you like multi-2@D opener, why not play it as a response as well?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: weak jump shift in a major or perhaps some strong hands (club raises and things)|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|pg||
nt|benjent: Let's you get some extra hand types out through 2@h and 2@s. The Italians mostly play along those lines|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
nt|benjent: Mr Safe would play a @c to the K, a @h to the A, cash @cA ditching a @d, then play a @s|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h5|nt|athene: if the @HK is right, you might want to pitch a heart on the @CA and then try to ruff a diamond in hand|pg||

nt|benjent: For those who came in late, there was a problem with the setup, and for this set we don't have CR comparisons. Apparently we will have comparisons for the next set.|pg||
nt|roghog: David Debage is doing his best as VG Operator. Many thanks to him|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|athene: awkward for NS now - they will surely end up in some game going down|pg||
nt|athene: i am not convinced by the "standard" approach of double showing just a penalty double in at least one of overcaller's suits|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: because when opps (as they always will) bid the suit you haven't got, you are often stuck|pg||

nt|athene: 2@S fit-showing jump, i guess|pg||
nt|athene: and double is t/o of hearts|pg||
nt|benjent: 5@d from West is the go - but hard to organize|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 5@D to protect the @SK :) not easy|pg||
nt|benjent: We would have to see something like a bid from N, then a 2-places-play bid from a very courageous Melbourne|pg||
nt|athene: 2NT was a possible call by west over 2@S, showing long clubs with secondary diamonds, but he still isn't getting to play it|pg||
nt|roghog: West reasonably preferred double to 3@d - partner may want to bail out in 3@c|pg||

mb|4D|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|benjent: Melbourne has almost done the right thing - but Hassett is going to raise - which will put the spotlight on Osbourne for the lead|pg||

nt|benjent: Now you would love to play @sA as South :)|pg||
nt|athene: There's a case for north's double having some lead-directing significance, but usually people just double to say "11 tricks seems a lot; i don't think this will make" |pg||
nt|athene: also, you might not know what lead you do want - you don't know which void west has|pg||
nt|benjent: Osbourne knew his side had 9+@h, but 8+@s, so the @s lead seems more likely to hold up|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: also, if west did have a spade void, that would give east at least four, and he might have done something over 1@H|pg||

mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: 1NT was a definite possibility for East, over 1@D - 4@H still the same eventual destination.|pg||
nt|benjent: I don't mind 1@d in 1st & 2nd - you vaguely expect to play the hand, and it may discourage a @d lead / encourage a @c lead|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|c9|pg||
nt|benjent: In 3rd/4th, I think you're below 50% to play the hand, and you should encourage the lead from partner that you want (it, a @c)|pg||

pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
nt|benjent: Yep, fair point|pg||
nt|roghog: Just needs to lead @D towards dummy to force the A and discard @S|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3H!|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s2|nt|athene: When you have that East hand, it matters enormously whether partner can have a singleton heart for 1NT.|pg||
