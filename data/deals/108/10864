nt|othered1: if it doesn't have an alternative conventional meaning 4@C might be a descriptive choice.  That's a large if, however.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: or 3N|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right. E has a 4-loser hand. not very good for NT (in context), but promising for suit slam. at IMPs E should bid 5C over 4N  but at MPs far from clear|pg||
nt|othered1: That's still a not a completely cold slam andmissing it isn't hateful.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think E has to bid 3N. without seeing the W hand, it should seem to E that the diamond card is a lot more important to show than the 5th club|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in retrospect, probably W should bid 4C rather than 4N over 3N|pg||
nt|othered1: Really, east would have a different choice if he knew west was poking around for slam, not just the best game, at a level or two below 4N|pg||
nt|othered1: That may be amethods problem more than anything else.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if that is available. i cant see a reason why it would be conventional in that auction, which has reduced to a groping sequence|pg||
nt|othered1: It doesn't feel like a groping sequence if east bid 4@C over 2N.  Would look like an intentional, descriptive auction to me.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the "Live" running scores lasted 4 boards the died, disgraceful really, the WBF should take responsibility and commission the Australians to use their world class scoring systems|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, but i think it would be wrong for E to bypass 3N. W hasnt shown all that much as of 2N|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzut: yes|pg||
mb|1H|nt|marlowepi: last hand now. thanks to operator baris for a fantastic job.|pg||

nt|marlowepi: i must leave for the Greek VG room. thanks to my excellent fellow commentators and to all specs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N knows no heart queen and shd bid 6N|pg||
nt|othered1: Bye Marshall!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so long all|pg||
nt|othered1: This is a real trap hand.  6N should be top and I'll bet not all that common a contract.|pg||
mb|6N|nt|othered1: to make 7 you need either a @C split or @C-@H squeeze.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s5|nt|othered1: Declarer will play this out, but 1440 is the score -- defense to 7 is very obvious.|pg||
