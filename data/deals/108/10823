nt|andyv:  hi MMike and Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: we start with an excellent roland slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: only 21 combined points N/S|pg||
nt|chick: yikes, can't even use MikeG to distinguish :(|pg||
nt|april7: it starts with a 5@D contract by NS and a too expensive sacrifice in @H by EW|pg||
nt|lestergold: ii think 5d is infrangible|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can't you go wrong in diamonds?|pg||
nt|april7: and 6 unmakable|pg||
nt|lestergold: noty that it will make necessarily if ace of dims is cashed first then the declarer will have a losing restricted choice option|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, if you start with the ace|pg||
nt|april7: resticted joice come into picture|pg||
nt|lestergold: well we have all spotted it|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think declarer should be free to do whatever he/she wants to do|pg||
nt|lestergold: however the bidding has to happen and its not clear wihether game will even be bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: it is a pairs event after all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: waiting to start?|pg||
nt|chick: isn't clubs also a possible NS trump suit?|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course |pg||
nt|mdgraham: certainly - same number of cards, after all  |pg||
nt|lestergold: and i think just as good a contract|pg||
nt|april7: 1@C 2@H 3or4@C4@H 5@C ,let see what is the end, probably only 5|pg||
nt|lestergold: the key poin being that either minor will provide tht discar for the spade loser|pg||
nt|andyv:  any reason for W to preempt?|pg||
nt|chick: too good|pg||
nt|lestergold: west has an opene not a [preempt|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind you if south opens a strong club (italians playu strong clubs dont they?)|pg||
nt|lestergold: west may consider some jump action|pg||
nt|april7: so:1@C1@H3@C4@Hand......???|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think that's an English invention|pg||
nt|lestergold: what is english invention?|pg||
nt|andyv:  strong club|pg||
nt|chick: ok, let's predict .... P P 1@C (good enough to reverse into diamonds) 1@H P 4@H 5@D ...?|pg||
nt|lestergold: schenken invented one long time ago to|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, but he smoked cigars and no one could get close to him|pg||
nt|april7: so then: 1@C jumppass some @H from E  and @C from S or X|pg||
nt|lestergold: Bee must have done|pg||
nt|VUGRAPHZST: 1st session starts in 5 minutes|pg||
nt|lestergold: Anyone gonna entertain us?|pg||
nt|andyv:  you are on, Mike|pg||
nt|chick: wow, we Never get 5 minutes to figure out a hand, what shall we do with the time :)|pg||
nt|april7: I played against Bee in NY 25 years ago|pg||
nt|lestergold: I met them both in the mid seventies at the Cavendish i remmeber Howard being a very tall guy|pg||
nt|april7: in the Cavendish club, it was calcutta tournament|pg||
nt|chick: if 1@C is artificial, N will not bid over hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: i playes his club when i was a student at oxford many decades ago|pg||
nt|lestergold: i played rubber bridge at the cavendish|pg||
nt|andyv:  instead of the Little Major?|pg||
nt|lestergold: i never played the luittle major but i rmember flint and thoseguys|pg||
nt|andyv:  the antiserum to the big club systems|pg||
nt|april7: when he came in all said:the prince is here|pg||
nt|chick: ok, for all us youngsters, what is the Little Major?|pg||
nt|andyv:  open 3 card majors|pg||
nt|lestergold: Flint or reese?|pg||
nt|andyv:  lots of canape|pg||
nt|andyv:  Reese|pg||
nt|mdgraham: A system invented by Reese and Flint. 1@C showed hearts, 1@D showed spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: they were awesome especially for their time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=103  Fulvio Fantoni. Off to the Bermuda Bowl in Brazil next week|pg||
nt|andyv:  he and Shapiro worked on it to counter the italian Club system. Flint and Reese were the main designers of it.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: But as a system, it never caught on|pg||
nt|chick: I can understand that :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Shapiro refused to play it |pg||
nt|mdgraham: He used to call it the Little Corporal|pg||
nt|andyv:  he did try a few times|pg||
nt|lestergold: hah hah|pg||
nt|lestergold: he was funny|pg||
nt|lestergold: when he was sober|pg||
nt|lestergold: which wasnt often|pg||
nt|lestergold: do u know what shapiro used to say whenever he met a new lady?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I can imagine |pg||
nt|chick: I'd hate to ask :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: ah, we are off|pg||
mb|1C|nt|lestergold: he used to say How about a spot of ...........sorry bbo censor just cut in|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|chick: so far my prediction is perfect|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h, 4N if 1C is natural|pg||
nt|lestergold: but was the club natural?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mdgraham: if East bids 3@H or 4@H, South is likely to double|pg||
nt|andyv:  even dbl is possible|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chick: dang, I almost got it right :)|pg||
mb|p|pc|c6|nt|lestergold: 3 off 500 too much|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|cT|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2 off ?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mdgraham: two down, surely?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lestergold: i miscount 2 off is a profit|pg||
pc|s8|nt|andyv:  8 tricks|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|april7: only 2 down I see|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|s4|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d9|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: howeve i think this will be repeated|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|pc|dK|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|april7: this will be a very good score for EW|pg||
nt|chick: I think very hard for N to bid no matter what S does|pg||
nt|andyv:  with stiff @h and lack of negative dbl from pd, 4N is very tempting|pg||
mc|8|nt|lestergold: south did bid she doubled for possible takeout and understandably Fulvio thought that the odds were to pass|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, assuming all NS get to game. That may not be the case |pg||
nt|mdgraham: although it does seem that EW will rapidly arrive in 4@H|pg||
nt|april7: but many pairs will be pushed into game|pg||
pg||

nt|lestergold: in a pairs not that liekly some will be allowed to play in minor part score and thus this will be a phantom against those cases|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|andyv:  as we noticed yesterday, almost anything is possible here due to the wide variety of playing strengths of the players|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|april7: 4@S might go down with @D lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: there will be a row of 4S-1 here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: not a lot of might |pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: muts lose 2d a spade and a heart|pg||
nt|mdgraham: seems likely. The trump split is not conducive|pg||
nt|lestergold: conducive that is a long word fro av erage bridge player|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|dA|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|h5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: think East will cash @SK and play on clubs, hoping to get both hearts away  |pg||
nt|april7: then he is 2 down|pg||
nt|lestergold: that will risk 2 off|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: i dont think a good match point line|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|nt|andyv:  in mp, probably not the best thing to do|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|lestergold: in mps u now concentyrate on damage limitation|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, it's pairs, forgot that|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|dJ|pc|d7|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d9|pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||
pc|c3|nt|andyv:  unfortunate for E that S had such an easy hand to lead from.|pg||
mc|9|nt|chick: will be fairly flat I'd guess|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks a standard game|pg||
nt|andyv:  depends... those playing mini splinters might stop at 3|pg||
nt|lestergold: only underbidders will profit|pg||
nt|april7: could also be some overbidders|pg||
nt|lestergold: u can win a paqirs event underbididng if teh cards a re spitting|pg||
nt|lestergold: roland isnt playing in this event|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Typing lessons going well, Mike?|pg||
nt|andyv:  that's because they allow Flannery to be played|pg||
nt|april7: if @S 2-2 12 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: roland cashes 11 rop tricks in the blacks and ruffs a heart in dummy form the twelth trick slam made|pg||
nt|lestergold: ok spades and clubs both break etc etc and no diamond lead|pg||
nt|VUGRAPHZST: south - north need to change seats|pg||
nt|mdgraham: seats broken?|pg||
nt|andyv:  since this is a pair event, there will usually be some break after every 2 boards|pg||
nt|andyv:  living the commentators plenty of time to be silly|pg||
nt|andyv:  leaving|pg||
nt|lestergold: we dont need time for that we can do i instantly|pg||
nt|andyv:  Fantoni trying to make it easier for the newspaper columns|pg||
nt|lestergold: Schapiro was a ch........english bridhe establishment censor cut in libel lawyers activiated|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Who won the pairs yesterday?|pg||
nt|lestergold: sue grabbit and runne are after me|pg||
nt|andyv:  fantoni-nunes|pg||
nt|lestergold: heard of them Mike?|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|s7|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|andyv:  pulling trump not best in 4-3 situations|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|s9|pg||
pc|d5|nt|andyv:  E should just have played passive and continued with @ds|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mdgraham: indeed. The problem was that East did not have many entries to hand  |pg||

mb|p|nt|april7: 1NT by N|pg||

mb|p|nt|april7: I mean the endcontract|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d8|nt|chick: could make as many as 9 tricks, everything is onside or splitting nicely|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|lestergold: but communications are not that great|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Apparently the ball that remove Strauss was a no-ball. Bowden did not spot it|pg||
nt|lestergold: entries to south hand distinctly limited|pg||
nt|chick: a kib wants to know if Fantoni's partners are allowed to bid NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: ha ha|pg||
nt|april7: 8 tricks because @C break well|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|andyv:  easy 4@d bid here|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: isn't 3@S preemtive?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: usually|pg||
nt|chick: depends on agreements|pg||
nt|andyv:  apparently not|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: mrs riolo bids straight forward|pg||
nt|chick: apparently a limit raise here|pg||
nt|april7: in modern bridge it should be|pg||
nt|mdgraham: two off likely here, but NS go quite well in spades|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
nt|april7: this will be very good for NS because a lot of pairs will be in 4@S going down|pg||
nt|ritong: 8 tricks in @ss with a natural defense|pg||
nt|andyv:  i'm not sure there's reason for it to be preemptive on this auction...when W passes, he's not waiting for reopening dbl, so a limit raise is much more possible with N hand|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||

nt|andyv:  6@h pretty decent|pg||
nt|chick: slam depends only on @DA onside|pg||
nt|april7: or rd Q of @C|pg||
nt|ritong: so it s a coinflip|pg||
nt|ritong: maybe not great playing mps|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|april7: 3rd Q of @C also ok|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|andyv:  Everyone has to remember that many of the E/W pairs we will see today are, at best, intermediate players|pg||
nt|april7: I mean slam makes also if Q of @C is 3rd|pg||
nt|ritong: plus the fact that playing on vugraph versus fulvio does not improve that|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|andyv:  very true|pg||

nt|andyv:  not too many early claims here. I think yesterday, Fantoni and Nunes learned it was better to play the hand out rather than explain the claim:)|pg||
nt|chick: lol kibs are telling me they want to watch me on vugraph .... for their daily laugh :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 5NT was perhaps misguided - East would need an awful lot for 7@H|pg||
nt|ritong: just for the record, do NOT use 5 NT missing one key|pg||
nt|andyv:  hee hee|pg||
nt|VUGRAPHZST: 60% - 60% for this board|pg||
nt|april7: might make p jump to 7|pg||
nt|mdgraham: assuming 5@C was the correct reply, West knows there is a key card missing|pg||
nt|andyv:  the partnerships that use 5N missing a key card, don't jump to 7 |pg||
nt|chick: but what is the point?   You are already committed to 6 anyway|pg||
nt|andyv:  there is no point|pg||
nt|ritong: how so, what is the point?|pg||
nt|april7: partner might think that all keycards are there|pg||
nt|ritong: not only he might|pg||
nt|andyv:  but for a lot of beginners, they think they have to bid 5N after the response to tell pd they are going to slam|pg||
nt|ritong: it affirms that all the keys are there*|pg||

nt|chick: keep remembering ... this is not a high-level event.   Many players are intermediates and may not even know this.|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|nt|jcwla: 6 of anything but @C's here.|pg||

mc|12|nt|chick: that one was even Chick-proof :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: bound to be some pairs in 6@H, and some pairs may miss it, combined 34-count notwithstanding |pg||
nt|mdgraham: and, of course, some pairs may bid seven|pg||
nt|VUGRAPHZST: last round now, 2nd session begins later in 2 1/2 hours|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as we have seen on a number of amusing occasions, possession of only three aces does not necessarily preclude a final contract of 7NT  |pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Alex... great job!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Thanks Alex|pg||
nt|VUGRAPHZST: ty all, stay tuned|pg||
nt|mdgraham: with two four-card majors, respondiing 3NT to 1@C is a bit of a mixed pairs bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  unless 3N is game forcing with 4-4 in majors and N forgot:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: is that it, Alex? Or one more round?|pg||
nt|VUGRAPHZST: 1 more round|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ty|pg||
