nt|geot: NT is not nice here before you see that the diamons behave, and when the heart K is onside as well nine tricks is possible to make |pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe not so happy when the @h finesse is right|pg||

nt|geot: but of course the heart finesse will be taken, so 2 down|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|nt|murat e: maybe south returns a sp|pg||

nt|murat e: he will get some matcpoints for sure|pg||
nt|jtr: He will still get a good score for minus one|pg||
nt|geot: but guess that was the best line, the K of hearts could have been a singleton as well, and the bonus is saving some MPs as you said Murat|pg||
nt|geot: by going only one down|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
