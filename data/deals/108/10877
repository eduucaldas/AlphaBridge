nt|davidstern: So declarer will make 10 tricks here|pg||
nt|davidstern: Nice hand for battle of game contracts|pg||
nt|davidstern: And technique issues|pg||
nt|davidstern: So not a great result for N/S who were 5th before this session|pg||
nt|imp_jan: the most interesting imo is if south shld show a 2 suiter rigth from the beginning |pg||
nt|davidstern: I would have preferred 3@S by North to show four card support - that would make 4@S an easy bid for South over 4@H but over a simple 2@S raise it is hard|pg||
nt|davidstern: These little nuances are so important in the game and to allow proper hand assessment|pg||

nt|davidstern: The club brreak is only a problem on perfect defence - they have to get a heart and a spade and then switch to diamonds else all will be OK for declarer|pg||
