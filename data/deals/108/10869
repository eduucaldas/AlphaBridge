nt|jbgood: lucky 4 spades in now|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: if you play "unusual vs unusual" north could cue one major to show a good hand with clubs|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: and hence 3@C would be nonforcing|pg||
nt|athene: it's borderline whether he's worth that though|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|nt|athene: the worst possible holdings in both majors|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|pc|c4|pc|d3|pg||

pc|c3|pc|s2|pc|d4|pg||
nt|jbgood: hi btw - was asked to join you for a few:)|pg||
nt|athene: :)|pg||
nt|athene: well a 3@C bid over 2@D might have got the defence off to the optimal start but it shouldn't have made any difference to the outcome|pg||
nt|jbgood: with a void in prd's you dont look for a sacrifice on marginal values|pg||

nt|hedyg: disc 2@ds..|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|lestergold: 4h is maybe slightly overboard for e/w but as north south can make 2/3  spades is no big deal|pg||
nt|chick: missed his chance if N returns a @D|pg||
nt|hedyg: he sure did!|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 2 off for 200 looks like|pg||

pc|h5|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h4|nt|lestergold: making?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jbgood: very difficult to save in 5 @d here - a normal contract  and result i think|pg||

pc|hA|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|hedyg: high @d, no honour from even nr of cards of with honour from odd nr of cards|pg||
nt|hedyg: or*|pg||
nt|lestergold: nunes has to cash the dim to probably gain couple of imps or if not lose 1 or 2 no high stakes on this hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: Nunes holding head with both hands, rubbing eyes.. now staring at dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: they all seem to be holding heads in this room|pg||
nt|jcwla: With 3@S failing in the CR, this will be a good gain for Fantunes.|pg||
nt|hedyg: has moved the @cs from the left to the right in his hand..|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe thinking of sheeps heads for dinner|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hedyg: and played @s.......|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh world champion gets it wrong|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: we love it when that happens|pg||
pc|s5|pc|d5|pg||

nt|jbgood: lead not the winner this time - but I like it:)|pg||

mc|9|nt|lestergold: oh 3s went off we see|pg||

nt|athene: e.g. by bidding 3nt|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or trying to arrange for pd to bid it|pg||
nt|athene: if partner raises with 3 a lot you have to but then it helps the defence because they know you have a balanced hand with only four spades|pg||
nt|marlowepi: which could be right even if pd has 4 spades|pg||

nt|athene: good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk5: OK, afternoon|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Bill, welcome :)|pg||
nt|athene: or good evening of course, depending how early you got up :)|pg||
nt|athene: hey Hedy|pg||
nt|hedyg: evening here on Rhodos|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: When does the evening start in England? It's 18:25 now|pg||
nt|begse: hello william|pg||
nt|athene: hello|pg||
nt|hedyg: after drinks i would think Roland|pg||
nt|athene: evening can start after we get 100 for no more wickets :)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT seems to be conventional, confirmed as good/bad 2NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: so W showed a bad opening with long @ds|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|Walddk5: England in a very good position|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s9|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|s4|nt|hedyg: who said 4th from longest and strongest?|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|chick: Thanks to our excellent operator, Alex!   Great job!!!|pg||
nt|jaapfr: did you like 4@S opening here with 4 small @H?|pg||
nt|VUGRAPHZST: ty all, great comments & games, thats all for now, tomorrow Open Teams 14:00 GMT |pg||
nt|jbgood: we may act as if it is about winning - but it is not. It is to find the bid that succeeds most often. And there we may have different opinions..|pg||
nt|jaapfr: tx Alex you were superrr|pg||
nt|VUGRAPHZST: ty all|pg||

pc|c8|nt|hedyg: in the CR E passed over 2@s overcall|pg||
nt|jcwla: 21 a push at 4@S/S-1.|pg||
nt|hedyg: who said the kids are afraid of Fantunes?|pg||
nt|chick: not me, juniors are fearless :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: its obviously theother way round Fantunes terrified of the kiddies|pg||
nt|hedyg: not at all, he is thrilled that they came! encouraged them a lot|pg||
nt|jcwla: The 2@S overcall is pretty yecchy, but S could show some @S card I would think, a bit too quiet here.|pg||
nt|haans: they may be impresssed without afraid|pg||
nt|hedyg: he has always mentored juniors|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lestergold: i know i am terrified of m,y kiddies especially one of em|pg||

pc|dT|pc|d7|pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: no, i was just thinking about the ending, you are right|pg||
nt|athene: declarer's @DKQ in his hand mess things up|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if W were 4351, a precondition, he would have discarded a diamond and a heart, not 2 hearts|pg||
nt|jbgood: pitching a heart seems natural|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c6|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|jbgood: as does the semihigh spade|pg||
nt|athene: if declarer gets to dummy he can finesse clubs AND lead a heart up by leading the @CQ|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dummy seems reachable nough|pg||
nt|athene: indeed|pg||
nt|athene: i should have said "when he gets to dummy" :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but what u suggest only works if W does not cover club queen|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: not really|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: and west is surely going to cover from Kx|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|pc|c5|pg||

pc|s5|pc|sA|pc|sK|pc|s9|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|athene: it might look as though he was better-off to use his dummy entry to lead a heart, not a club, with the idea that he can play @HQ, duck heart, later reach dummy with @HK for the ...|pg||
nt|athene: club finesse|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|nt|athene: but if he does that the defence can get a heart ruff|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|pg||

nt|lestergold: Roland has been dealing the cards again|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|p|mb|p|nt|begse: very nice 5@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: I cant afford any more sheep heads|pg||
mb|p|nt|begse: not easy to bid|pg||
nt|athene: best to take the low road with that north hand with 2@D now|pg||
nt|athene: rather than an aggressive 2NT|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jcwla: With 2@S making an overtrick in the CR, we have a new leader.|pg||
nt|lestergold: this should be off|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe not on this lead|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|nt|athene: of course, if your partner bids like this with 4@D5@C you are very stuck|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|hedyg: can lose 2@hs and 1 @c in 5 @d though|pg||
nt|begse: need to find @h anyway|pg||
nt|hedyg: however playing 2 @d should be np|pg||
pc|c5|nt|begse: safe enough|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|hedyg: Hedyproof|pg||
nt|athene: games which depend on a void facing a weak suit are always very hard to diagnose|pg||
nt|lestergold: best now is 4 rounds of hearts|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|hedyg: good switch|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pg||
nt|lestergold: thatb will do too|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sQ|pc|s8|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: north had the option of unblocking the diamond in which case i think the heart defence would have been needed|pg||
nt|hedyg: J@s for @H|pg||
nt|lestergold: however the important thing is that 2s should be defeated|pg||
nt|hedyg: you do what you can with the cards you were dealt|pg||
nt|chick: an excellent description of bridge, Hedy :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d6|pc|d7|pc|sT|pg||
nt|athene: when the suit gets bid, the person with the void puts his partner with big cards there|pg||
nt|hedyg: naturally|pg||
nt|chick: or, as Joe Shair says, of Life :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: 1 off is good bridge|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|pc|d4|pc|dT|pg||
nt|lestergold: especially as it appeas to have been let thru in closed|pg||
nt|hedyg: if the J@H is in E unblocking the Q@D and playing for a finesse there that goes off would make him go down in a making 2@s|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|c3|nt|fabsayc: anyone see a clue to heart break?|pg||
nt|hedyg: it is easier for us who see all the cards|pg||
pc|s4|pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||
pc|h5|nt|hedyg: nope|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|pc|h2|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: both sides had an 8-card fit only (@S, @D) but both made nine tricks|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d6|nt|marlowepi: this should fail by one|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|nt|marlowepi: maybe they mis-sorted their hands bill|pg||
nt|jbgood: guess my analysis of the last hand was up to my usual standard - totally off the mark:)|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|pc|d2|nt|athene: no, i was the mad one, imagining that @CQ would work|pg||

pc|sK|pc|sQ|pc|s8|pc|sT|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d3|nt|athene: west had to put a club back to kill the dummy entry before diamonds were unblocked, didn't he?|pg||
pc|c6|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: promotion in short trump hand was lost when W very inadvisedly continued diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: now club goes on @DK|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no, trumps promotion in hearts enough|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|h6|pg||
nt|athene: yes four rounds of hearts would have been nice |pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pc|c2|pc|hQ|pg||

nt|hedyg: last board of this match|pg||
nt|athene: but this time EW are going to be in 4@S fairly quickly|pg||
nt|hedyg: then we have a shortish break ( ca 10 mins)|pg||
nt|jcwla: So Fantunes down 6 with 1 board to play.|pg||
nt|hedyg: last board of this match and of the festival|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|lestergold: 4s cold e/w|pg||

nt|chick: An excellent job by our wonderful vugraph operator, Alexis!!|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5hy a good save at any rate|pg||
mb|5H|nt|athene: but he doesn't like 4333 and @DK under the opener|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|5S|nt|hedyg: he is not counting the K@d ( quite rightly)|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: two clubs, diamond, heart to lose|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear allowed to get away with 5h undoubled this could cost the 6 plus needed|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: thank you Fulvio Fantoni, Michel Eidi and Vincenzo Delle Cave for offering us this occasion to meet our old friends again and make new ones in a wonderful environment|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5s oh dear overboard|pg||
nt|lestergold: and doubled|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hedyg: Alexis did a great job all week|pg||
nt|jcwla: 5@H the contract in CR.|pg||
nt|lestergold: so Fantoni team get the imps they need!|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|hedyg: W is monk99 on BBO|pg||
nt|chick: Nunes probably realizes they are behind and hoping to catch up|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c3|pg||
nt|hedyg: we will wait for the announcement of the winner i hope..|pg||
nt|lestergold: actually is it enuf for 6 imps?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Heading down 2, meanwhile this will be down 1 for 100 + 100 = 200 = 5 IMPs -- and Red Sea Festival will hold on by 1.|pg||
nt|lestergold: no ur right only 5|pg||
nt|jcwla: Would be different story with diff vul here.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hedyg: E is nisoes on BBO|pg||
nt|athene: when you lead KQx you hate to see this layout but the pitch on the @HJ doesn't help declarer|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: assuming the defence rise @HQ and cash their diamond, of course|pg||
nt|athene: a club pitch is useless|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed all on a pin head|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|sK|pg||
nt|fabsayc: even if useless per se, does put south to test which this line does not|pg||
nt|hedyg: i agree with Martin ( for once )|pg||
nt|athene: right - you might get some sort of elimination as well if you play red suits before the clubs|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|athene: the defence might tangle the clubs and give a ruff/discard |pg||
pc|d6|nt|jcwla: I've been called that before.|pg||

nt|jbgood: they are more frequent than you woulde imagine:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that is why i try to play 3N:)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jbgood: and when taken - they usually end up in a paper colums|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: does this count as NS spade wastage? :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|marlowepi: when overlooked they often end up in columns too|pg||
nt|marlowepi: go for it S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: confess i would have bid 2C as N also |pg||
nt|athene: yes fantoni might well bid 2@C|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: S worried about taking a fanton save|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: wow|pg||
pc|dK|nt|marlowepi: the one thing u should NOT do is bid 5H slowly. |pg||
nt|athene: there was a complete lack of doubling of this|pg||
nt|jbgood: i must admit that 2 @c is remote for me |pg||
nt|athene: i would have thought east was obliged to hit 5@H with a pretty good likelihood of a trick|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|marlowepi: good likelihood of TWO tricks|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|d9|pc|d5|pc|dT|pg||
nt|athene: if you force opps to wander in at the 5-level, you assume they are going down unless there's a LOT of evidence to the contrary?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well E ought to do something|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|sK|pg||
nt|marlowepi: his hand is good offensively and defenmsively|pg||
mc|9|nt|jbgood: if prd has spade values - 5 hearts may easily make|pg||
nt|athene: he was cautious on board 22 as well|pg||
nt|athene: he didn't make a negative double of 2@S overcall|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that pass was biyondo pale|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps he is overcome by all the excitement of vugraph|pg||
nt|jbgood: he - East - has my vote|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well i fhis partner can come out of his cave so can he|pg||
nt|VUGRAPHZMU: this was last round of teams and we have a winner Fantonakis team, |pg||
nt|marlowepi: his partner has an absolute pile of rubish and 5H is still down 2 with 4S making. that says it all, in my view|pg||
nt|athene: 5 over 5 was wrong yet again in the other room|pg||
nt|jbgood: bye all|pg||
nt|athene: east sort of bid his hand twice|pg||
nt|athene: 3@C was presumably spade fit and some hcp strength|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E shd definitely bid twice|pg||
nt|athene: then 4@S over 4@H shows the extra spade offence|pg||
nt|athene: but then 5@S over 5@H is one too many|pg||
nt|athene: he has his honour in their suit, not his own|pg||
nt|athene: yes, he is allowed to bid twice, but not three times, i think|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i meant in here. E cant pass 5H out|pg||
nt|VUGRAPHZMU: This was a Fantoni Festival as he won Open and Mixed pairs and today just won the teams event|pg||
nt|VUGRAPHZMU: I will give more detailed results in few minutes|pg||
