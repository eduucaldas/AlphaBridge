mc|9|nt|murat e: lead of 10 guaranteed the jack and either the king or ace so no harm coverin with queen|pg||
nt|benjent: At teams, I guess Nab would have decided his only chance to beat it was that partner had been unhelpful. At pairs, he would have been concerned about handing over an easy overtrick|pg||

nt|benjent: about.|pg||
nt|murat e: take 10 of dia from east and slam is very bad for instance...|pg||
nt|lestergold: Once players go past 3N in mps they tend to strive to bid the minor suit slam rather than five because of mp considerations|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is an odds on slam and shoukld be bid in a pairs especially|pg||
nt|lestergold: probably in any form of scoring|pg||
nt|lestergold: in a strong field mandatory|pg||
nt|benjent: The auction at this table looked like a game invite, so I don't think slam was really in their heads. And ... competing against 3NT, 420 actually scores up well|pg||
nt|lestergold: the result does but hard to envisage this in the auction|pg||
nt|benjent: Sure, but 3NT could just be cold off from West's point of view. It looked to me like East asked for a spade stopper, or a partial spade stopper, and West correctly decided his Jx ...|pg||
