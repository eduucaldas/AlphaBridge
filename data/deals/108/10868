mb|1D|nt|hedyg: 1@d alerted, 14+ natural, f1|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: we have Giorgio Duboin playing on an essentially Lebanese team vs a Greek team|pg||

mb|1S|nt|chick: and not far ahead of second|pg||
nt|othered1: intermediate,natural 2-bid? |pg||
nt|jaapfr: 6@D is expected|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|hedyg: hi Jordan :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: And hi all.  Well, we're only about 55 minutes late -- that's almost like being on time, right?|pg||
nt|hedyg: our operator is Alexis, kalispera Alexis|pg||
nt|haans: maximum for 1@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|VUGRAPHZST: hello to everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk6: They were back late after a cruise|pg||
nt|hedyg: we are 5 minutes short of being 1 hour late i would say, so we are practically early!|pg||

nt|jstokes: very friendly lie here for declarer|pg||
nt|haans: so we must guess then :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jaapfr: and not E pass on 3nt|pg||
nt|chick: assuming they are game-forced, 3@H is reasonable, but not passing 3N|pg||
nt|othered1: Maybe east wasn't confident about the opening 2-bid strength, so held way back later.  But I think east's hand may be a clear exception to Hamman's Rule |pg||

nt|hedyg: animated Italian discussion..|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|hedyg: prefer X to 2 NT for sure|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hmm - a lot of factors against the 2@S opening: poor texture, vul 2nd seat, side void.|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: i do belive 2@C was gazzilli after minor opening|pg||
nt|hedyg: no, it just showed @ds and @c|pg||
nt|jcwla: 2@S?  Yecch.|pg||
mb|d|nt|jaapfr: a wise ""chick"" lol|pg||
nt|othered1: I hate to apportion blame without enough system knowledge to know what actual decisions they faced.  But east does seem to hold the vast majority of the blame for missing 6.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|jcwla: Do you like the raise to 3@S?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|othered1: neatly avoiding the 4-4 fit.  This can pick up loads of matchpoints if NT makes the same|pg||
nt|hedyg: well...yech or not NS have 3NT due to @s blockage, can they bid it now?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|hedyg: N seems to me to have defensive values|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: i am not enamoured with it, no|pg||
nt|jcwla: Me neither.|pg||
nt|jcwla: One overtrick IMP to Hanna as on the same auction the CR E (Sapounakis) made eight tricks on Board 1.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Board 9 that is.|pg||
nt|jstokes: this will work out well |pg||
nt|hedyg: you have the stopper you bid?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|chick: but it won't because of the ability to ruff a club and a diamond with the long trump in each hand|pg||
nt|jaapfr: do you believe he will not make this???|pg||
nt|haans: lucky them|pg||
pc|s4|nt|hedyg: i guess 3@c was positive..|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s9|nt|hedyg: Fantoni: we are very lucky!|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hT|pg||

mc|11|nt|chick: will make for 600, but 4@H makes for 620 .... a loss at MPs|pg||

mc|10|nt|marlowepi: N has extras, but there are a lot of losers for 5D. still, he has a right to expect an ace for the 3S cue|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d9|nt|hedyg: N sorry he ever bid till he sees dummy..|pg||
nt|jcwla: Another overtrick IMP to Hanna on 10 as the CR S (Nasr) made ten tricks in 2@S (which was bid in balancing seat over 1NT-P-P).|pg||

nt|andyv:  actually N bid 3N after 3@s bid by S|pg||
nt|cindy:  this is like the last set   fantoni is like a bulldozer|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S has to have some values for 3S, and if they include an ace as they should then it seems to N that 5D is far more likely then 3N esp with EW red|pg||
mb|1N|an|12-15|nt|jaapfr: y was bid by an italian me fantoni (must be new to the game)|pg||
nt|cindy:  what do you think S should do ?|pg||

mb|1D!|nt|jcwla: I guess 2@S followed by 3@H over 3@C still more conservative than jumping to 4@H.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|hedyg: seems so :)|pg||
nt|haans: very hard to find 5@D|pg||
mb|d!|nt|jcwla: Anyone for 1@C (if nautral) with the W hand?|pg||

nt|jcwla: 6 to Tzilis when 4@HX failed by one in the CR.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pc|s3|nt|jcwla: Maybe E/W were waiting for the N/S red to be a deeper shade of red and the E/W white to be a paler white, maybe then would compete.|pg||

pc|c9|pc|c6|nt|lestergold: could have been defeated but how were they expected to find the way|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jcwla: Some players who are just starting in bridge don't understand passing with the W hand.  But it is balanced and has almost as many losers as cards in its longer suits.|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|haans: spec glen say : FN now play 3rd seat 2X as "up to 12"|pg||
nt|hedyg: leads Slawinsky, high from even nr without honour or odd nr with honour|pg||
