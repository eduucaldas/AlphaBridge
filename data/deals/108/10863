nt|lestergold: indeed|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|sharynr: roth stone openers|pg||
nt|lestergold: explaining 1400 phantoms to team mates- not a good prop|pg||
nt|sharynr: even I would open the North hand...albeit 1NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: it is an opener by today's standards for sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: about my average in fact|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharynr: i think west should have got out while the going was good|pg||
mb|p|pc|h9|nt|sharynr: hoping that \North would balance with other than X|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 3s bid seems wrong i want to exit this auction immediately and hope my partner has not too many losers in his suit|pg||
nt|sharynr: exactly|pg||
nt|sharynr: but east should bid 4@S|pg||
nt|sharynr: imo|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|h6|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes becaus 3s should promise a mch better suit- 6 cards or a great 5 card suit at least|pg||

nt|lestergold: northnw ants to encourage that resgtricted choice heart finesse perhaps or is north that clever|pg||

pc|cQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: +e|pg||
nt|othered1: in standard, you open a 4-card suit and rebid whatever  your agree (1N or 2m) over 1@S response.  Here maybe that wouldn't show 14 HCP, as in some precision approaches.|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think they play 13=15 nt  maybe |pg||
nt|othered1: Really a matter of what price you want to pay for the imperfect hand.|pg||

nt|othered1: This was bid simply q uantitatively here and found a lucky fit.|pg||
nt|othered1: without 4-card support drury on east's hand type would be a significant overbid.|pg||

mb|p|nt|jimmygod: and also the vugraph operator|pg||
nt|sybarra: skip the spade suit,  you Ed?|pg||
nt|othered1: north might worry that a game try of 4@H will transfer east into 4@S.  I would raise as south in a 5-card ajor system|pg||
mb|p|nt|jimmygod: 2@d shows a single major preemptive hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: THX also to the Chinise federation and BBO - Wald - and all there woorkers. By them no vug for us:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, and hard to see how E/W got all the way to 2N on those cards|pg||
nt|h_karluk: interchange EW then slammish|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: 3@D is a reasonable, natural action.|pg||
