mb|p|nt|rodal f: This can become a doubble score. Let's see|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sybarra: 1 @S or 2 nt|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: A spot at NS?|pg||

pc|h7|pc|h5|pc|h8|pg||
nt|sybarra: *5 card ht suit |pg||
nt|othered1: third routine contract in a row to begin.|pg||
nt|sybarra: can he make this Ed?|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c2|nt|rodal f: Would any prefere an X at the last hand?|pg||
pc|d4|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|hT|nt|jimmygod: A @c switch is needed to beat 6@d|pg||
pc|c4|pc|d3|pc|s4|pg||
pc|h9|pc|s3|pc|d7|pc|c3|pg||
nt|jimmygod: @s finesse is needed now, but it seems unlikely to happen.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d8|pc|s6|pc|d5|pg||
nt|jimmygod: it requires more work for South than at the other table|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|rodal f: Would NS have stolen it if N bidded 2@H?|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4441 hand hard to handle   |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: so 1 nt in interesting choice |pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|sybarra: and I think they play 13-15 nt |pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: 2@D looks like force|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|d5|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|othered1: West's action is normal in some quarters or mandated by system, but just sayinig 1N makes swings likely|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jimmygod: I guess @ds are the last 4 tricks for NS|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s4|pc|h5|pg||
nt|rodal f: So then 2@C later will be invitt max for the major sertch|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s9|nt|sybarra: my comment while you were gone was that 4441 hand difficult to hand |pg||
pc|s8|pc|h3|pg||

nt|sybarra: I was not offended by the bid |pg||

pc|c6|pc|sT|pg||
nt|sybarra: just not makeabl |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sybarra: +e|pg||
nt|othered1: in standard, you open a 4-card suit and rebid whatever  your agree (1N or 2m) over 1@S response.  Here maybe that wouldn't show 14 HCP, as in some precision approaches.|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think they play 13=15 nt  maybe |pg||
nt|othered1: Really a matter of what price you want to pay for the imperfect hand.|pg||
nt|sybarra: true|pg||
nt|othered1: and north south have taken their tricks effectively.|pg||

pc|dK|nt|andyv:  sorry, Zhuo:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Excellent 6@C and not a ridiculous grand|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|rodal f: Seems as one down|pg||
pc|s8|nt|andyv:  so, not unreasonable to take a first round @c hook|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder if W knew it was 4 card support?|pg||
nt|othered1: This was bid simply q uantitatively here and found a lucky fit.|pg||
nt|othered1: without 4-card support drury on east's hand type would be a significant overbid.|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree with that|pg||
