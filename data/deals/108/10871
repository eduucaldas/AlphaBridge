pc|sT|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
nt|othered1: West's action is normal in some quarters or mandated by system, but just sayinig 1N makes swings likely|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s8|pc|c4|pg||

nt|othered1: in standard, you open a 4-card suit and rebid whatever  your agree (1N or 2m) over 1@S response.  Here maybe that wouldn't show 14 HCP, as in some precision approaches.|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think they play 13=15 nt  maybe |pg||

nt|Walddk6: 3@H would have worked better as it is. Tough decision for Fu now|pg||

nt|Walddk6: What is Fu supposed to do with that hand?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|andyv:  easy 6@s bid now|pg||
nt|andyv:  or could rkc here|pg||
nt|othered1: NS don't open "any 11" obviously|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: this is why oppanants pre-empt, X from west here can be much less than he actually has|pg||
nt|santyclz: 20 is a bit heavy for a simple overcall even at the 3 level.  20+ good suit is too much.|pg||
nt|rodal f: But the vug operator have full controll there. Ure name are?|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: without the hitch by west, I'd think north has a reopening, especially opposite a conservative partner.|pg||

nt|h_karluk: well some chance there - say North holds up / otherwise possible block in suit|pg||
mb|p|pc|cJ|nt|andyv:  and interesting 5@c bid... perhaps read partner's 3N as showing long @cs|pg||

nt|sybarra: cue bids starting but not enoug.....hmmmm|pg||
nt|santyclz: Rule 2:  when in doubt, support your partner.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|andyv:  but auction should almost preclude a @S lead|pg||

pc|cT|nt|andyv:  @s lead doesn't make much sense when S was willing to play 3N|pg||
nt|andyv:  passive D may be best although low @d would put immediate guess to declarer|pg||

pc|c5|nt|sybarra: maybe so |pg||
nt|capercliff: but 3@c isnt exactly asking for @c stopper, he already bid 2N|pg||

nt|sybarra: multi  |pg||
mb|2C|nt|rodal f: Able to make a better score the the other room? 4@S?|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: 1+ might again for NS|pg||
mb|3D|nt|rodal f: Seems EW will by this. NS are gona miss there @C|pg||
nt|jwit: I don't mind a weak 2 with four of the other major, when my suit is strong and the four bagger is weak.  This one is marginal.|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|capercliff: sure, and some might not even consider this a weak 2 VUL|pg||
nt|tsadek: misunderstanding put them in best contract|pg||

nt|santyclz: (Maybe I've been watching too much jr's, too.)|pg||
