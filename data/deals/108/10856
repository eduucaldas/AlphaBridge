mb|p|nt|rodal f: As long as weak NTs are used|pg||

mb|p|nt|h_karluk: tho seems normal lead is @c|pg||
nt|rodal f: Correct Hamid|pg||
pc|s4|nt|othered1: and only when east played.  Here, @D by north wouldn't have done much.|pg||

pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|andyv:  and interesting 5@c bid... perhaps read partner's 3N as showing long @cs|pg||
nt|jimmygod: 5@c was really an excellent score for NS in OR|pg||
nt|andyv:  @d lead is a problem and very tough to find|pg||
nt|sybarra: cue bids starting but not enoug.....hmmmm|pg||
pc|s6|pg||

pc|s8|nt|othered1: 3@S preemptive?  Lawful, I guess.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|andyv:  @s lead doesn't make much sense when S was willing to play 3N|pg||
nt|andyv:  passive D may be best although low @d would put immediate guess to declarer|pg||
nt|andyv:  E taking too long...@d switch is obvious so by taking this long he inferes he has A@D|pg||
