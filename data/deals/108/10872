nt|curtsolo: both pairs at this table playing fairly standard 2/1 with a few gadgets|pg||
nt|sybarra2: welcome to Ed Shapiro,  one of reg. commentators on bbo |pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone.  |pg||
nt|curtsolo: greetings, Ed|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Curt!|pg||
nt|curtsolo: reports so far have indicated the day has been full of wild boards and big swings... so we have a close contest going into this final quarter|pg||
nt|sybarra2: neither Ed nor I know any of them, any back ground Curt?|pg||
nt|sybarra2: I think this might be my 3rd year of comenting on this tourney but then ...too old here to remember|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2D|nt|curtsolo: sure... Paul Pressly is a local professional player in KC; Steve Stewart is his most regular partner (as well as a sometimes-partner of mine when I'm in town)|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|curtsolo: Van Wyk and Arba are longtime regular partners from the St. Louis area|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|nt|sybarra2: for those who may have missed beginning, or from elsewhere in the world,  this is competition between Kansas City and St. Louis,   |pg||

pc|d3|pc|d5|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|d8|nt|curtsolo: as I understand it, this event was developed by Alan Popkin of St. Louis|pg||
nt|sybarra2: 2 cities with enormous competition |pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|curtsolo: Popkin is typically playing in this event tonight, but his team was ousted in the St. Louis pre-qualifying event|pg||

pc|sT|pc|s3|pc|s6|nt|curtsolo: as a KC native, I can speak more to the tendencies of the EW pair here... you can expect Pressly to be sound with his bidding... Stewart will be the more aggressive of the two|pg||

mb|p|nt|curtsolo: and still no double digit swings this quarter... talking to Steve Stewart during the break, he indicated that the first half featured numerous double digit swing boards|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|curtsolo: Pressly did not have a penalty double at his disposal even if he'd wanted to go that route here|pg||
nt|curtsolo: flat 15 not the best penalty, though|pg||
nt|ritong: any flat|pg||
nt|ritong: when you hold flat 20, you are on lead constantly|pg||
nt|curtsolo: yes, I'd rather penalize with 14 hcp and a good long suit to lead|pg||
