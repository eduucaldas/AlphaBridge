nt|han: 1S - 2H -p- p - p seems a normal auction|pg||

mb|d|nt|kiwibridge: 2@D is a horrible bid|pg||
nt|iris100:  made 12 tricks in the open room|pg||
nt|iris100:  11|pg||
nt|iris100:  only small @S lead (not very likely) holds it to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|wygbe1: south can do the same by winning in hand, cashing d ace, and leading a spade - setting up the spade suit with ruffs, as h are 22|pg||

nt|vugraphzus: hi all|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|sharynr: hi haans :)|pg||

nt|sybarra: NED girls right on the edge |pg||

nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: very rarely we see flat board in this champioship|pg||
nt|sybarra: not a great start for NL in the OR |pg||
pc|hK|nt|kiwibridge: defence|pg||
nt|murat e: ý dont agree with 5 clubs either easts aces good for defence and not good for offence|pg||
nt|murat e: especially when bad breaks are expected according to bidding|pg||
nt|kfay: You might wonder why Meckstroth wouldn't correct to 5@d when Kevin bids 5@c.  Playing a precision 1@c Kevin could easily be 3325 or something|pg||
nt|chick: A 6-5 hand is very hard to give up on though, usually takes a whole lot more tricks on offense|pg||
nt|kfay: Although that can't really be true after this auction|pg||
pc|d4|nt|petergill: Entries are getting a bit awkward|pg||
nt|petergill: @d now is best|pg||

nt|chick: certainly not if it means majors :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: director is called|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a nice simple 3nt for me to start ith?|pg||
nt|don paulus: N still some action ?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Very pleasant morning to all of you|pg||
nt|andyv:  4N here would be pick a minor...but does N have enough?|pg||
nt|murat e: 2 nt to show minors maybe|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|haans: must still find @DJ|pg||
nt|sharynr: i don't see the N-S team on the roster of players|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: wow game made other room|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi Rahed, don't think we've met.|pg||
nt|haans: close between 2 and 3|pg||
nt|haans: clubs right dim right|pg||
nt|han: nice bid by North here|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Basar is our operator and he's a great one :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree!  worked with him yesterday |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: he should pass this|pg||
nt|rnmalik: would you give a try for 3NT by E|pg||
nt|mcarroll: But will probably venture 3NT|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @D lead by S would hurt.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes @D sinks it|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: ý heard like  "min. hand and no 4 cards @H"  on 2@D alert|pg||
mb|3S|nt|haans: that is my choice|pg||
nt|santyclz: (Rashed), sry.|pg||
nt|haans: spade right|pg||
nt|han: only 12 HCP but such good shape and suits|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: ty:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder if W thought the 2 @D was michaels?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: director is just watching bidding now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: with @H lead he makes (she)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Salam Basar, thanks for the info|pg||
nt|murat e: this 2nt lebensohl type|pg||
nt|kfay: Dwyer will probably live to regret this bid|pg||
nt|murat e: yes a very undisciplined bid|pg||
mb|d!|nt|haans: an other fast claim?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: We are meeting now:)|pg||
nt|santyclz: We can guess, any game force, bal min, relay, ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think Visser can bid 3 nt now |pg||
nt|petergill: The Argentina youth flew from Argentina to New Zealand, then to Turkey, so is probably the most travelled competitor in the field. |pg||
nt|wygbe1: i also would have passed|pg||
nt|iris100:  tough lead|pg||
nt|tweety1: hello every1|pg||
nt|han: Hi Veysel|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: sorry, I mean E-W|pg||
nt|don paulus: and @s ok if he finds Q|pg||
nt|iris100:  how many S will overcall 1@H do you think?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: and checking convention card|pg||
nt|jaapfr: Noname=? besides no name:)?|pg||
mb|4C|nt|vugraphzus: they started early .so i missed the first board s play.sorry.|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT looks safe, should make easily. |pg||
nt|vugraphzus: 4+@H.could be 5 @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: np|pg||
nt|haans: nothing to see or miss|pg||
nt|don paulus: we got the result - thats fine|pg||
nt|sybarra: tremendous number of frequent flyer miles!|pg||
nt|petergill: If played by East, a heart lead would shoot 3NT. |pg||
nt|han: East can now hold it to 4|pg||
nt|han: by playing a low heart|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a crazy auction to say the least :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Although 3NT would have been easier|pg||
nt|mcarroll: in danger of losing 3@Ss and @CA|pg||
nt|april7: thats an aggressive bidding,making on good dietsribution , but might go down if N takes first trick and continues @D so S with K of @S gives N a @D ruff through an uppercut|pg||
nt|april7: first @S trick though taking by N|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Ruud von Seida|pg||
nt|boedhy: hi all|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Ruud|pg||
nt|andyv:  well done.  Note that 5@h would have been the winning call for E/W|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: must be bad defense-@S lead only helps|pg||
nt|andyv:  is S really taking this long?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: if S makes this .then we have a more enjoyable match|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: yes he is in the tank|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: sound polish|pg||
nt|rnmalik: all roads lead to 11|pg||
nt|rnmalik: tough as I see it. |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Early lead for Noname, NS made 5@D on board 1|pg||
nt|chick: disciplined pass by S though|pg||
pc|sA|nt|tweety1: afraid to finess? :)|pg||
nt|han: declarer could have guaranteed +1 by playing the heart jack at trick 1|pg||
nt|boedhy: Hi Martin|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kiwibridge: and a great lead|pg||
nt|april7: actually E should go down on best defence|pg||
nt|murat e: north did not believe|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk5: Good morning to David Carlisle|pg||
nt|wygbe1: w does best to lay off trumps and play side suits|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: definitely|pg||
nt|garnetts: Good morning everyone|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi David welcome aboard|pg||
nt|petergill: I think Michael Whibley is in NZ's Open Team in Brazil next month, so he has a lot of World Championship bridge to play in the next month.  |pg||
nt|marlowepi: if S bid as aggressively as N on the previous hand, he would bid 2C for majors over 1NT (if available)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: OTs looming S no entry|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Cant set up the long @S and enjoy it so looks like no way to avoid 3 losers|pg||
nt|andyv:  he does have to be careful with entries|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|nigel_k:  Hi everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Nigel Kearney|pg||
nt|iris100:  Hi Nigel|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: hello|pg||
nt|wygbe1: hi|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Hi Jim and Iris|pg||
nt|boedhy: Can be beaten also if they arrange @c ruff|pg||
nt|sybarra: a mini muiderberg  |pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: (I just made that up)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Jan van Cleeff|pg||
nt|arigun2: hi there|pg||
pc|h7|nt|don paulus: keeps control in @h & @s - can afford to try @c after @d|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: hi .welcome |pg||
nt|fahir: goodmorning from istanbul|pg||
nt|arigun2: welcome to Fahir Uzumcu|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: yes.she has very long surname |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Several ways to go down, but this defence is not one of them|pg||
nt|april7: another @D and N after ace of @S reaches S with ace of @C to recieve an uppercutz|pg||
pc|c2|nt|petergill: Both Wests have followed the best, if obvious, line of play|pg||
pc|c5|nt|haans: service unavailable|pg||
nt|sybarra: not a lot of hope on this hand |pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Jan|pg||
pc|c9|nt|Walddk5: Turkish team|pg||
nt|imp_jan: hi folks and andy, of course|pg||

nt|Walddk5: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Asp/RoundTeams.asp?qtournid=724&qroundno=9  for standings after 8 rounds. First 8 after 13 rounds advance to the quarter-finals ...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: tomorrow|pg||
nt|fahir: thanks Cengiz:)|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Good morning Fahir and Cengiz|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Excellent organisation, well done guys!|pg||
nt|fahir: thank you Roland:)|pg||
nt|chick: fortunately, there wasn't a singleton trump honor|pg||
nt|kfay: The score reported here is inaccurate.  USA Blue was only down by 5 heading into this set|pg||
nt|kfay: so the actual score is more like 50-33|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jaapfr: ty|pg||
nt|april7: @H or @C??? that is the question|pg||
nt|boedhy: well still @c Ace and @d will beat it...|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: maybe @D 4 can help |pg||
nt|april7: 3 of @D even better|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: north is still wondering|pg||
nt|fahir: 12 tricks seem not so easy|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rnmalik: 2 boards attacking bridge-both rooms:)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|andyv:  @h continuation to shorten dummy would have been a little stickier|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|haans: had it spade ruff|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: our excellent operator here is Basar|pg||
nt|mrace: hi all|pg||

nt|arigun2: welcome to Timucin Erkoc|pg||
nt|mrace: Hi there Fahir  and Cengiz :)|pg||
nt|fahir: team name is USA BLUE , red playing in BAM event :)|pg||
nt|mrace: its 2 .32  am here, i will try not to make deep finesse commentating :)|pg||
nt|arigun2: official web site http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Results.htm|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: south is still thinking|pg||
nt|arigun2: that not what we expect Timo :)|pg||
nt|arigun2: too early to do that here also|pg||
nt|arigun2: ns reached a good 6@h after a complicated auction|pg||
nt|mrace: they will get paid for that slam|pg||
nt|arigun2: @h lead would be best for defense but @s and @d is friendly outside|pg||
nt|mrace: yup|pg||
nt|mrace: i cant see any possible line that he may chose to go down |pg||
nt|mrace: but never say never :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|iris100:  now its down|pg||
pc|h2|nt|haans: opps did win a trick here no overtrick|pg||
nt|imp_jan: but still 5@C is a make|pg||
nt|andyv:  home free now|pg||
pc|hT|nt|santyclz: Possible beer hand!|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|don paulus: 1st swing in the match|pg||
nt|rnmalik: what ever be the result I would have gone for 3NT-@D lead looks dificult from S|pg||
nt|andyv:  well done|pg||
pc|h5|nt|arigun2: this one is one of "rare never" i think :)|pg||
nt|fahir: now ok for south |pg||
pc|h4|pc|c7|nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Two down unless he plays a club now|pg||
nt|han: risky play by declarer|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|haans: were on right course|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a delicate push|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: ty very much.trying to do my best|pg||
pc|d9|nt|sharynr: prob should trump and then lead diamond to 10 if no king|pg||
nt|sybarra: jrs. care about that |pg||
pc|d4|nt|kiwibridge: A and another @D gave a @C pitch other room, costs 10 imps|pg||
nt|boedhy: ai |pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|mrace: that line could cause problem if W had the @H A|pg||
mc|10|nt|sharynr: but unlucky nevertheless|pg||

nt|Walddk2: a heart perhaps|pg||
nt|drorp:  Marion knows declearer has KQ@D, or atleast Qxxxx, he wouldn't bid 3NT with Qxxx or less, so ducking here is a better technique normally...|pg||

nt|don paulus: it was all limit and all key cards favourable|pg||

nt|Walddk5: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Asp/RoundTeams.asp?qtournid=724&qroundno=11  for standings after 11 rounds. First 8 after 13 rounds advance to the quarter-finals ...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: tomorrow|pg||
nt|jaapfr: previous sessions same story some 8 dull boards and then 1 or 2 firecrackers|pg||
nt|mcarroll: E bid 3NT in Open|pg||
nt|rnmalik: very true|pg||
nt|imp_jan: but admitted to handle spade suit yr self is not so easy|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|santyclz: This hand has some action potential.|pg||
nt|haans: we all say the same :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: :)|pg||
nt|iris100:  standard 4@S now|pg||
nt|han: I guess that was impossible, east would need to have 2362 shape and west wouldn't have a 2D raise|pg||
nt|kfay: 1@c is 2+|pg||
mb|1H|nt|don paulus: 2 @h NS ?|pg||
nt|don paulus: gambling 3 nt|pg||
nt|jaapfr: how to get opps out of 4@S|pg||
nt|don paulus: think N should escape|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @S makes here |pg||
mb|2D|nt|haans: 3@D max|pg||
nt|petergill: EW will bid to 4@S, Blair Fisher will bid 5@D, then what?|pg||
nt|haans: slam in spades|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S Michaels, 5/5 spades and a minor|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think to 5 @H by n/s|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S EW|pg||
nt|han: East can double now to show values|pg||
nt|sybarra: this look lebensohlish by Cam |pg||
nt|jaapfr: fine 5@C|pg||
mb|d|nt|sharynr: 1st board a push|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H I mean|pg||
nt|sybarra: in tempo pls.  5 @H |pg||
nt|haans: 6@S please|pg||
nt|han: the doubleton spade is about perfect for the double|pg||
nt|chick: 3N pretty solid again|pg||
nt|kfay: Dwyer's double shows values|pg||
nt|kfay: takeout|pg||
nt|murat e: if NS reach three notrumps play is tough|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: how to make opps pass|pg||
nt|garnetts: Interesting choice by East--but if 1@C is nebulous it is probably best to pass|pg||
nt|haans: 7@H good sac|pg||
nt|petergill: Blair might bid 5@C or 5@D or 5@H, I'm not sure which|pg||
nt|sybarra: there is the lead director |pg||
nt|wygbe1: i would think south is worth 2s, and n has easy raise to 4|pg||
nt|han: I think 2S is a very bad call|pg||
nt|han: but E may know better|pg||
nt|chick: apparently so|pg||
nt|jaapfr: do i see a phantom i think 5@S can be made|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ?|pg||
nt|april7: 4@H by S losing only 1@S,1@H and 1 @C|pg||
nt|boedhy: well lots off ways to go dwon ...probably will create some swings...|pg||
nt|mcarroll: EW will be surprised to get a big gain on this board - in Open S is in 3NT dbled - heading for 800 or 1100|pg||
nt|boedhy: and they will bid it|pg||
mb|2S|nt|haans: not right|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we're back|pg||
nt|petergill: 5@C cue is his choice, as a slam try|pg||
nt|petergill: Blair is on lead to @s, so it is not lead directing|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Andy Vinock|pg||
nt|tweety1: dbl cld be better|pg||
nt|don paulus: always lose 3 @c ?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: mb  not|pg||
nt|don paulus: or ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Gambling 3N is on my short list for Silliest Convention ever devised|pg||
nt|mrace: par on this hand is 2 @S i guess|pg||
mb|d!|nt|garnetts: I really do not like that with only four hearts|pg||
nt|sybarra: true sorry |pg||
nt|petergill: Luke bids 6@C, in case they have a 4-4 club fit with his @d losers able to be discarded on the long @H's |pg||
nt|haans: looks like 6@S will be the end|pg||
nt|petergill: Andy Hung now thinks that partner has @D's!|pg||
nt|haans: after a cue cannot sac|pg||
nt|petergill: The lack of entries to dummy makes the play of @H contracts difficult|pg||
nt|haans: if hung x no 6@S|pg||
nt|petergill: Andy Hung is one of the stars of Australian youth bridge - he has won international youth events such as the Pacific Asia Teams playing for Australia|pg||
nt|han: hi Andy|pg||
nt|chick: E showing his other suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: what would you bid Hans, with east hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: another boring board|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: now the passed hand starts to push|pg||
nt|santyclz: 3nt?|pg||
nt|chick: if leb, this is an invitation by S|pg||
nt|sybarra: lebensohl requests pard to bid 3 @C and then will show suit |pg||
nt|chick: her* sorry :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: little bit of magic but hey....club ace on side, ht ace on side,  etc |pg||
mb|p|nt|han: this would make it easier for west to bid 4S though|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sure with helpful lead:)|pg||
nt|cindy:  6 @s is a little rich|pg||
nt|april7: 4@S or 5@C to expensive|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: nothing |pg||
nt|sybarra: nothing wrong with 5 clubs is there?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  1@s is not enough with South, maybe she was considering 3@s|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  North will raise to game anyway|pg||
nt|iris100:  for a junior, 2@S is quite disciplined|pg||
nt|andyv:  good morning Roland, Veysel, Han and everyone|pg||
nt|tweety1: hello Andy|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 5@C makes|pg||
nt|chick: this can be set, but sure not obviously enough to warrant a double|pg||
nt|cindy:  one fixed, stay fixed|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i think 6@S too much bravery   agree?|pg||
nt|cindy:  once fixed|pg||
nt|murat e: declarer must duck first round of hearts|pg||
pc|cA|nt|haans: but close to something|pg||
nt|sharynr: lol|pg||
nt|sybarra: forcing pass by Andy?|pg||
nt|haans: if NS find there 8 @H EW more likely to find spades|pg||
nt|don paulus: interesting lead for declarer|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes!|pg||
nt|jaapfr: with @H lead much tougher|pg||
nt|chick: will certainly paint the picture of how to play it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: too many losers for 6S. pd was under pressure. you want to REWARD him for making a winning competitve decision, not punish him|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Board 18|pg||
nt|andyv:  staying low on this hand is the trick|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 4@H here is down on a club lead or switch|pg||
pc|c6|nt|haans: 2-2 in M do not like|pg||
nt|rnmalik: but only 8 tricks on @D lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes|pg||
nt|haans: well done|pg||
nt|chick: ummm, yes you are right, can set up hearts for the losing diamond|pg||
nt|imp_jan: ew elected to play in spades though|pg||
nt|andyv:  same problem here along with picking up @s suit and staving off @h ruffs|pg||
nt|imp_jan: yep, heart ruff coming up|pg||
nt|andyv:  no palatable line of play for W|pg||
nt|imp_jan: still a bit unlucky: @Hk and @Ca off side..|pg||
nt|andyv:  true|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: still thinking|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rnmalik: yes|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we lost our score from board 2|pg||
nt|rnmalik: -1, if no defense error|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and got away with it|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: screen has gone down.declarer asking some questions|pg||
nt|santyclz: I wasn't recommending 3nt, but half expected it in a jr's game.|pg||
nt|tweety1: no excitement this brd  a draw|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|petergill: Great 6@S bid by Andy Hung|pg||
nt|ybob: 8 tricks cold|pg||
nt|han: declarer worries about diamonds being 3-1|pg||
nt|kfay: One wonders how many times E/W have to be doubled or almost doubled before they start to relax|pg||
pc|dK|nt|petergill: Note that even with two aces, Blair Fisher has the discipline not to double 6@S|pg||
nt|haans: does not need @DK right but no @D lead|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 5@S is a good sac over 5@C, won't get a good score tho :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sharynr: but looks like a good hand for vul save|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true|pg||
nt|petergill: For those (like me) who find access to the website and its Results page (including its Running Scores section) almost impossible, here are the standings after 5 matches, with some ...|pg||
nt|petergill: Round 6 results in brackets|pg||
nt|sybarra: per spec:  juniors invite and later bid 5S|pg||
nt|chick: lebensohl did them in ... let E show his clubs and W then knows what to do :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|han: but there is little he can do about that|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this is what we like, lots of excitement|pg||
nt|rnmalik: unfavourable cards placement for W and 2@C|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|mrace: going 1 d|pg||
pc|c4|nt|haans: did hung bid it to make?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kiwibridge: will be -1 in the end|pg||
nt|andyv:  can always play for the revoke|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kiwibridge: it's going to be a high scoring match|pg||
nt|rnmalik: seems so|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Neth will go into lead as 3NT coming home on 2 - no @D lead|pg||
nt|murat e: few will agree with easts double|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|marlowepi: for me its not even oprimarily about too rich or too brave. its about the effect of bids like 6S on partnership---W should WANT his pd to bid aggressively in these situations, and ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the way to encourage him to keep doing so is to give him some slack|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i saw as phantom 2x playing from dummy the clubs and 2x N AK and so developing @CJ as tr 11|pg||

nt|ybob: W shows QJ @C K @D Q@S cant have A @D|pg||

nt|iris100:  on board 3|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they need a quiet board or 2 to settle the nerves|pg||
nt|cindy:  some partners need no encouragement :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: same with commentators:)|pg||
nt|april7: weak 2?|pg||

nt|andyv:  perhaps 9@c may have been easier to read?|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 6@H?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: almost pushed them into it|pg||
nt|sybarra: who is Oze Ckis?|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 5@d is on the finesse in hearts|pg||
nt|imp_jan: save against 4@s brw|pg||
mb|1D|nt|don paulus: so only + 1 ?|pg||
nt|don paulus: nm|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes but the point is that bids like 6S may discourage pd from competin in close situationsfor fear of turning a plus into a minus|pg||
nt|cindy:  thats true|pg||
nt|imp_jan: btw|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: i don't think so|pg||
nt|don paulus: 16 tricks - any extra points for that ?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: EW have 4@H here|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: +1 sorry.will fix it|pg||
nt|cindy:  i agree|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Obviously their standard are higher vulnerable|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|haans: not esasy to make|pg||
nt|sharynr: especially club lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx specs, Poland I am told |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the expected 1@D|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yet another makeable 4@S contract|pg||
nt|andyv:  pretty aggressive call with this vul|pg||
nt|fahir: in swiss part usa blue win 37-20 against neth.red but no carry over here|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzus: wow|pg||
nt|sharynr: undo?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: no its real!!|pg||
nt|haans: must be S that bid|pg||
nt|sharynr: very risky bid :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: east bid 2nt|pg||
nt|don paulus: or is it only 15 ?|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no bid from W?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: would you go for 5@C-cards decently placed-friendly:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: there is spade ruff|pg||
nt|petergill: then Yilankaran 88, Neth Orange 86, Austria 84, Meyoukas 84, Aotearoa 83 but a 19-11 win moved them into the top eight, Neth Girls 83, Scotland U26 83, 21st Australia on 76, France ...|pg||
nt|petergill: on 76, other team's scores available by request|pg||
nt|sybarra: how many teams are in event, do you know peter?|pg||
nt|haans: @D lead = no make|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt with no good lead for N|pg||
nt|haans: that was an agressive double|pg||
nt|ybob: 9@D fine lead|pg||
nt|han: Egypt and Noname are currently ranked 16th and 18th, and to get to the top 8 they could really need a big score this round|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|sharynr: oh, I am sure it shows minors BUT....|pg||
nt|han: Egypt is 13 VPs behind, Noname 14|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i agree Marshall with yr analysis|pg||
nt|boedhy: 3NT doubled - 7 isnt the way to get back into the match....|pg||
nt|chick: sometimes the juniors take their fearlessness to dizzying heights :)|pg||
nt|kfay: So Netherlands now leads by 31|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: E make NS not bid slam?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: maybe it means i have jacks|pg||
nt|sharynr: one needs to HAVE the minors to show them at the 3 level, with no HCP|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no doubt on lead of A@S only|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Information.htm  for the tournament website, but Service Unavailable quite frequently I am sorry to say|pg||
nt|santyclz: A good hand for contructive jump shifts, a treatment we seldom see in the US.|pg||
nt|haans: after S pass you can act knowing THEY have game|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  A bit careless then as two clubs can be ruffed with @sK and @sJ, losing only to @sQ|pg||
nt|andyv:  these first few hands aren't helping either of them|pg||
nt|ralfwil: This can be fun!|pg||
nt|cindy:  like the lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: most people who find themselves in that situation automatically start rethinking their podition :)|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|garnetts: 4@D is better than 4@H here as it suggests defensive cards and helps West guage what to do if NS continue|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the web site seems unreachable whilst play is lon :(|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry that we cannot access the website so have to rely on locals at Yeditepe University in Istanbul providing info to us. |pg||
nt|haans: 3@C mean = do not lead clubs :)|pg||
nt|april7: everybody is bidding without values|pg||
nt|april7: I mean S and W|pg||
nt|kfay: 1NT shows 4 spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: nothing to the play expecta quick claim|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry Peter,  missed you said 40 teams|pg||
nt|iris100:  that carelessness cost 13 IMPs|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  A tricky 4@s for N/S on this one as well|pg||
nt|iris100:  4@C wont cheer N up|pg||
nt|chick: Must be terrible pressure on teenagers to know the whole bridge world is watching them play.   Then to add a disaster can only make it worse.  |pg||
nt|sybarra: frankly, these kids love it! |pg||
nt|mcarroll: 4@H and 3NT make|pg||
nt|boedhy: nothing to bid with east |pg||
mb|2N!|nt|kiwibridge: we may have a flat board at last|pg||
nt|petergill: 40 teams, including some U21 teams|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @C mini splinter|pg||
nt|haans: but also a warning to opps|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: sorry for connection problem|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But there will be 2@d from S and 2@h fromE|pg||
nt|april7: also S should be a little stronger|pg||
nt|fahir: now they are playing for bronze medal , 2 rounds 16 boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: can they miss now|pg||
nt|han: North has 11 HCP, but they look so bad|pg||
nt|han: it's tough to pass with 11 HCP though|pg||
nt|sybarra: you shouid have seen them at DC Nationals |pg||
nt|chick: maybe so, but it's still a lot of pressure|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'd think I would love it too, if only we could get the world youth watching|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes. After 2@C GF|pg||
nt|boedhy: probably 1 off..|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: east -west are looking very calm  after 1400|pg||
mb|4N|nt|don paulus: K @h counted as a key card - so = 2|pg||
nt|andyv:  anyone know what 2N inquires?|pg||
nt|sybarra: especially now since many are out of school |pg||
nt|andyv:  same auction in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 5nt = all + Q|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: cant miss now|pg||
nt|don paulus: 2 of the remaining 3 kings now|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: should bid 7nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: he did|pg||
nt|iris100:  I donÂ´t think this will make|pg||
nt|mcarroll: As does 5@C if follows the Rabbi's Law and drops singleton @CK|pg||
nt|sybarra: a splinter I approve of with good cards in outside suits |pg||
nt|mrace: on this lead he will settle with making 5|pg||
nt|chick: eventually, they'll learn to bid that way as well :)|pg||
nt|murat e: any number of notrumps up to 5 ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: only bad if partner double|pg||
nt|ybob: 9@H is a nice card !!|pg||
nt|haans: and N have found a lead|pg||
nt|cindy:  making 3 i guess|pg||
nt|rnmalik: A@C safety play|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: you have no reason to lead clubs|pg||
nt|petergill: After 6 rounds, USA Blue lead on 130, Japan-Czech 2nd on 112 or 113 , Neth Red on 108, Greecour on 106, Italy Red 105, Aotearoa 102, 42 and others somewhere up there too|pg||
nt|han: I wonder what 3@c is, I would have bid 4@c with the south hand (splinter with 4 trumps) but maybe NS can show that hand in a different way|pg||
nt|han: Operator, can you find out what these bids mean for us?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a modest 1 imp for Noname i presume|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|nt|haans: a very easy grand to bid|pg||
nt|haans: claim before 1st trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: a very fast match|pg||
nt|garnetts: yes but maybe North did not bid enough|pg||
pc|c6|nt|haans: it did mean expect 4-1 in all suits|pg||
nt|andyv:  S is only a 12 count and N did pass originally, so jumping to 4@c seems a bit optomistic|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: they are just whispering.cant hear them .sorry|pg||
nt|tweety1: 2nt shows strenght here i guess|pg||
nt|jaapfr: she likely hits@SAK for 9 and suddenly makes 12 tr lol|pg||
nt|cindy:  or more|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|petergill: Jorrit Schafer from Belgium does not double, in case 6@S or 6NT is makeable|pg||
pc|d8|nt|rnmalik: acdemic discussion-you see any chance for 5@D|pg||
nt|haans: W has 18 hcp that is also hard to understand|pg||
nt|don paulus: 4 @c 2 @h 2 @s 1 @d|pg||
nt|han: yes good point Andy, in that case I would just bid 4@h|pg||
nt|han: I think it is impossible to stop in 3@h with the south hand once north moves over 2@h|pg||
nt|tweety1: 4 @c or +h may seem attractive but remember your pd is a passed hand|pg||
nt|tweety1: NS knows that they have 23 hp max|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sybarra: we do have an optimistic Blair today |pg||
nt|tweety1: umm 3 @c is a great bid then|pg||
nt|tweety1: N shd have stop at 3 level with a mass hand like his..|pg||
nt|han: I don't agree unless NS have a way to show a club splinter below 3@h, which I strongly doubt|pg||
nt|andyv:  have to play @hs for one loser...since W needs to be kept out of lead after @d shift, probably need to dbl hook the @hs|pg||
nt|tweety1: see the alert Han|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 2@C 2@D and 1@S loser|pg||
nt|jaapfr: more than 12:)?|pg||

pc|d6|nt|Walddk5: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Asp/RoundTeams.asp?qtournid=724&qroundno=10  for standings after 10 rounds. First 8 after 13 rounds advance to the quarter-finals ...|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: with their playstations etc if they could be shown what fun this  game is and you get to meet people all over the world|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sharynr: i would think 5-0|pg||
nt|boedhy: because off the low bidding probably the @h were 2-2... |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes ideal hand for a splinter bid - especially having shown where the trick potential is |pg||
pc|dK|nt|kiwibridge: but still possible|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Looks like that|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|haans: singel bids make it easy for defence  to defend. very rarely told|pg||
nt|murat e: east run out of clubs so easy 11 tricks|pg||
nt|chick: E does not want the lead|pg||
nt|chick: won't matter what he returns, but from his point of view, every card gives a trick|pg||
pc|c5|nt|petergill: Blair's bidding was optimistic, and his card play excellent, when I partnered him in the San Francisco Nationals about 20 months ago. |pg||
nt|boedhy: there should be no problems in the defence|pg||
nt|fahir: @dK is o the right side no problem to take 12 tricks now|pg||

nt|andyv:  S did not seem to have a plan on how to play the hand in OR|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: screen went down and declarer is asking some questions to east now|pg||
nt|andyv:  and W shifted to the 10@d at trick 2 which I think poses a lot more problems for declarer than does @S shift|pg||

nt|imp_jan: 3@H = constrcutive (lebensohl)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk5: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Information.htm  for the tournament website. Better link than the one before|pg||
nt|garnetts: Now ignore partner and go on|pg||
nt|chick: if so, they can pick up a lot of imps here|pg||
nt|mcarroll: % @D makes|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 5|pg||
nt|sybarra: 5 @D is gin|pg||
nt|imp_jan: yep|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: an other boring board|pg||
nt|don paulus: can they stay out of slam ?|pg||
nt|haans: serenisima say 'doesnt happen only to me' and right you are :)))|pg||
nt|ybob: D. D. win 6@H|pg||
nt|iris100:  3SA now|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Same contract and play in Open so flat board - the level of technical ability is impressive|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Arend Bayer|pg||
nt|cherdano:  hello everyone|pg||
nt|rnmalik: brave bid of 2NT-no negative DBL|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: south alerted 3 cl but not north|pg||
nt|chick: good discipline by E|pg||
nt|rnmalik: very correct|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and 4@H (dbl?) is 2 off|pg||
nt|mrace: u have 24 boneless hcp and pd opens !|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Juan from Argentina let 1NT go, but Andy bids 2@D Multilandy|pg||
nt|chick: its hard to give up on a suit like that one :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@H and 5@Seak|pg||
nt|andyv:  they may still get to 6@hs|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: w|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  do we know whether NS have an agreement about 4@H?|pg||
nt|sharynr: would 1NT not be enough?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes and 3@S?|pg||
nt|garnetts: very marginal game at best|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes |pg||
nt|garnetts: I think that North should bid 4@S ---very prime 17 for a suit|pg||
nt|chick: 11 IMPs if they make this |pg||
nt|sybarra: easy for us to see from here, mabe not easy at the table |pg||
nt|andyv:  4@c almost mandatory and should get them to 6|pg||
pc|hK|nt|haans: what would 1nt has showed|pg||
nt|haans: sry|pg||
nt|sharynr: this hand i believe|pg||
nt|garnetts: North would have done better to call 1@S and investigate over the 1NT rebid|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: good for morale : thanks pard I am min ; np I'll bid my hand again|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D = one long major|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt was massive bidding :(|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sharynr: but we have seen thay East likes to bid....so lets see how she plays now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no great number of @C tricks and entries will be few|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: he write some notes.cant see it|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and 12 tricks without a @h shift|pg||
pc|h2|nt|cherdano:  good slam but not that easy to bid over the interference by EW|pg||
nt|rnmalik: to me it does not make-@H lead no entry no 3rd entry|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H pass or correct|pg||
nt|cindy:  5-2 fits usually play better than 4-3 fits|pg||
nt|jaapfr: they did what you asked Cindy (but il love the 4-3 fits)|pg||
nt|cindy:  :-)|pg||
nt|imp_jan: cue bidding i gather|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|sharynr: This must be very exciting for the players, coming together to Istanbul!|pg||
nt|haans: may be hard for them to play their best bridge|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: needs @S switch now|pg||
nt|sybarra: the dbl gives som clues |pg||
nt|sybarra: but is it enough |pg||
nt|haans: multilandy are the hottest thing around just now|pg||
nt|tweety1: ah|pg||
nt|chick: I know we're not supposed to have favorites when commentating, but I sure can't help cheering for a 13 year old, regardless of country :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 1 @D entry to play Q@S game over|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it depends on a lot of factors|pg||
nt|cindy:  it does|pg||
nt|jaapfr: true but imo the 4-3 highly underrated (generally)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|santyclz: Well, it can make.  W has to guess 4-1 rather than 5-0.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: This can be 4 off|pg||
nt|rnmalik: with such @S holding short suit lead slightly not proper|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I can see the E hand as a weak 2 @H or a 2@H opening if playing it as @Hs and a minor (5-5) preferably - but not a first hand opening bid|pg||
nt|mrace: if they bid grand they will make it|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jaapfr: but mb me too pessimistic and IF 5@S will S not be very much attempted to lead once a high @C:)?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: And yet it needs a @C ruff to go down|pg||
nt|mcarroll: the transfer bid by S has made N declarer and E has an obvious @S lead - which is best|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 3  Drijver and Michielson bid on to 5 @C |pg||
nt|andyv:  checking for 7|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: I think the "girls" are not much old if at all |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Good sacrifice|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: he didnt cover 9 |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: well done|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the cold 4@H was doubled for 7 away last board|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Easy nine tricks when diamonds break evenly and maybe 10 if declarer guesses which major suit finesse to take|pg||
nt|tweety1: refused 1 more imp:)|pg||
nt|imp_jan: in or michielsen bid 3n directly over a 2@s opener|pg||
nt|imp_jan: not impressed by that bid i am afraid|pg||
nt|mrace: they need it too|pg||
nt|murat e: this one went undoubled also strange|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|cherdano:  and it was easily bid by Italy at the other table without interference|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: seems 7 |pg||
nt|vugraphzus: 7@d is good save |pg||
nt|sybarra: ML defense to nt is just like ML opening,  @D= one long major and 2 @C = stayman and 2 of either major is that  5 card of that major and a minor|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kiwibridge: here is the bad news|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: or had a go at 6@C only failing on the awful break|pg||
nt|mcarroll: True|pg||
nt|mrace: good job|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|petergill: multilandy = 2@C for majors (Landy) and 2@D like a multi two opening, with 2M = 5+M and either 4+minor|pg||
nt|haans: or 4 cards in M + longer minor|pg||
nt|petergill: I make a good echo. :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: :)  at least the specs now know |pg||
nt|sybarra: btw Ilike it also |pg||
nt|petergill: This should go down, especially if declarer plays a spade to the king (likely, normal)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: on this line -3 may even happen|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes seems to be fiddling around so to say |pg||
nt|sybarra: although not sure what I would have done differently |pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure that hurt |pg||
nt|santyclz: That eases the guess somewhat.|pg||
nt|andyv:  everyone loves to finesse|pg||
nt|andyv:  strip and endplay would have worked here|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N practical bid over a passed pd. but certainly doesn't allow any room for exploration|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sharynr: they will warm up soon|pg||
nt|mcarroll: only 3 off now|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Same contract in Open|pg||
nt|imp_jan: north has the tom to check the red suits first and later has the option to fall back on the club finesse (not necessary to due the break in diamonds)|pg||
nt|imp_jan: time (not tom)|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  will make 7... hand plays itself|pg||
nt|andyv:  N doesn't know that yet|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: he seems he can think about 5 mins|pg||
nt|mrace: eventhough it is on @H finesse a 5th @D or 4-2 minors in easts hand would be very helpful|pg||
nt|mrace: 4-4 minors|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ralfwil: S has now 4 entrances to set up and cash @d willers|pg||
nt|arigun2: welcome to Okan Zabunoglu|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: he led @H T:)|pg||
nt|mrace: hi there Okan :)|pg||
nt|mrace: looks like a good lead for this hand, however declarer don't have much of an option|pg||
pc|s2|nt|don paulus: fell asleep ?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: all bad news for S now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: -2 I think|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I may be wrong but 2 @C with S would justify 2NT|pg||
nt|mcarroll: W inserting the @H K muddied the waters nicely|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|sybarra: now can roll home |pg||
nt|sybarra: as long as declarer does try a early @D |pg||
nt|don paulus: complete misfit and "only" 31 pts|pg||
nt|don paulus: so 6 nt far away|pg||
nt|haans: wityh a good hearts = + at least 2 point to me|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: alternative give up 1 @S|pg||
nt|imp_jan: almost all ways lead to byzantium..|pg||
nt|andyv:  best seems to play A@h and @h|pg||
nt|andyv:  but @c back (if k@h is off) will force him to make an early decision|pg||
pc|h9|nt|don paulus: well - after 3nt by E - no reason for W to try slam ?|pg||
nt|mrace: unless decides to drop Qx @H and be hero, but if not drops he will have a hard time to explain it to team m8s|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: they are all laughing now at table|pg||
pc|d2|nt|chick: anyone know the ages of EW?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ralfwil: winners (2 @s ruffs, 1 @c , and @hA)|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|haans: partner never lead from Q so play it if you have it|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not even that is required.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|boedhy: I agree Martin. But maybe if you and youre partner agree on it it will work |pg||
pc|c5|pc|s3|nt|marlowepi: seems wrong to me to play D queen|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|april7: both EW did bid @C so N might have a singleton or even void, so ace of @C lead breaky the contract, now there is a present to EW|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c8|pg||
nt|andyv:  shouldn't take 5 minutes any more:)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugraphzus: maybe because of boring boards|pg||
pc|c6|nt|rnmalik: now @SQ|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jaapfr: @C|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @C or @C or @C:)?|pg||
nt|don paulus: shhttt - she knows :)|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|sybarra: close eyes and pray for @D k on side |pg||
pc|d6|nt|petergill: Oops|pg||
nt|cindy:  better  if she wants to make it|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kiwibridge: as I said last night, never bid NT with a singleton in pards suit :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|cindy:  uhoh|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jaapfr: anyone claiming?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|rnmalik: very correct|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphzus: he is relaxed after @H K appears|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|boedhy: And its the way to keep the opps out of 4@s.....|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kiwibridge: 2 down justice|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s7|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|petergill: South ducking the spade let declarer into dummy|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 1@D  0-7|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: 1@H  4+ cards|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|imp_jan: 6@c on a finesse|pg||
mb|4D|nt|imp_jan: and seven ont the lead :)|pg||
nt|drorp:  now justin will make some big forcing bid :) and they'll probably stop in 5 as jermey just can't make a slam opposite a 0-7 hand, whatever distribution is, this hand is best possible, even better than best possible, and still off 2 keycards|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@C was 5-4 either way and 4@d likely RKCB|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|imp_jan: not sure about east's pass on 4@d..|pg||
nt|Walddk2: also known as kickback. pretty useful when clubs are trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzut: 4@d undiscussed |pg||
nt|drorp:  double usually helps the opponets more than it helps you|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|drorp:  diamond is the obvious lead anyway....|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|imp_jan: some play dbl on a splinter asks for another lead|pg||
mb|6C|nt|drorp:  too high now, but it makes :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|drorp:  if 4@d was splinter, Jermey made a big overbid cuebidding with his hand facing a known 0-7 hand.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzut: Bob hesitate a bit before he bid pass|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He might have saved a couple of IMPs by not doubling|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Although I don't think slam will be bid in the other room|pg||
nt|imp_jan: in that case usa is back in the race|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They are bidding the hand now, uncontested. I will keep you posted|pg||
nt|imp_jan: let's have a look here if zia's rule works|pg||
pc|h9|nt|Walddk2: wishful thinking, Jan :)|pg||

nt|sharynr: they may now have the "why not 1nt partner" conversation?|pg||
nt|haans: lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: this is like a football match for now|pg||
nt|garnetts: No point in having a gadget if you use it and ignore it |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed, yet one slip defence it could have made|pg||
nt|garnetts: death trap for NS here |pg||
nt|vugraphzus: north seems excited with his hand:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes could get too high in @D|pg||
nt|petergill: I think South should duck the first spade, that solves the problem, as declarer will surely play the king. |pg||
nt|haans: no but 3nt with 16 hcp after a jump?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: north pitched a club .so it makes +2|pg||
nt|iris100:  quite boring boards - another standard game|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes,  they didnt let them up from the mat |pg||
nt|hoz: hi all|pg||
nt|kfay: Lall and Fournier have reached the lucky slam here.  So a + position for the US|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: yes 0-0|pg||
nt|sybarra: if angry probably at himself |pg||
nt|vugraphzus: south i mean|pg||
nt|chick: I'm told that Dekkers is 25, Nab 21 ... thanks for the info to the kib who knew :)|pg||
nt|chick: partscores here|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 1@H-p-p- 1nt?-2@C-?|pg||
nt|sybarra: slam here now for n/s |pg||
nt|andyv:  28-3 for Jap-Cz this set and making this a very tight match|pg||
nt|mrace: re hi Okan|pg||
nt|mrace: long time :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|don paulus: no big swing this board|pg||
nt|garnetts: hard not to|pg||
nt|haans: here we may fi9nd why 3nt. they use Big Clubs|pg||
nt|haans: so 3@H was weaker that i belived|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  They may think about slam on this one but need to identify the poor trumps|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@H can make here but not bid :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  so would be a good safe, but only if you are sure 6@S is making|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: against 6 @S i meant|pg||
nt|cherdano:  yes|pg||
nt|cherdano:  3@H is probably a mixed raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: east is very aggresive player|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the web site is down again but here it is http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Istanbul.htm|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I might have played @D 9 after @CA|pg||
nt|santyclz: Excellent idea.|pg||
nt|don paulus: 6 @h now ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: that is "old" in this tourney |pg||
nt|mcarroll: 7@D on|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard to stay out of 2N|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 1@d = heart suit|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|cherdano:  sorry|pg||
nt|cherdano:  preemptive|pg||
nt|sharynr: the OR tried 6@h on bd 14, failing for an 11 imps loss|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it's a beaut hand sad break|pg||
nt|ybob: win 13 tricks|pg||
nt|rgdruru: 7@h i think|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: nab could have saved there with the double @C@H fit thx Pieter for pointing that out|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and then in all directions:)|pg||
nt|cindy:  dunno  2@c or dbl ?|pg||
nt|hoz: re hi Timo|pg||
nt|kfay: 1NT again shows @ss|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: but not now after only 1@D --what do you need these days for 2@C opening|pg||
nt|chick: personally, I think it's too old to play as a junior, but I suppose there aren't enough 13-18 year olds to fill a tourney like this|pg||
nt|jaapfr: all cards very well placed|pg||
nt|chick: even 4@H depends on good lie of the cards|pg||
nt|jaapfr: even DD i do not know what to do as S now|pg||
nt|don paulus: Laura would like 2 @s by S :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: IMO W has a better 2@C overcall here than when he did overcalll a couple of boards ago|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure you can bid it |pg||
nt|mcarroll: 7NT even|pg||
nt|mrace: what do u guys chose with S hand here ?|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|cherdano:  i would just bid 2@H at red/white and with @SKxxx|pg||
nt|sybarra: do they play wk nt Peter? |pg||
nt|andyv:  smolen?|pg||
nt|tweety1: yes|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes any time|pg||
nt|sybarra: but they might |pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: i think east REALLY likes to bid!|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: yeah.very|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this is the under 26 tourney not the under 21|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 2 losers in either @S or @HS|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|petergill: Bd 5: Luke Gardiner gave correct upside down count in @d's with @D7, and playing a heart back instead of a club was reasonable, so no need for a post mortem. |pg||
nt|garnetts: Good idea to upgrade here --even thogh it might not work out too well|pg||
nt|chick: is there an under-21 world tourney?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: adam is checking their convention card|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @dA as well as @hQ in front etc|pg||
nt|jaapfr: even unbeatable with any lead and any defense|pg||
nt|chick: even so, takes perfect play to make it, almost double dummy play|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: correct bid as per Blue team in the 60th|pg||
nt|sharynr: would be nice to have DBL mean "takeout or leave it in partner, you can do both"|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: no big decisions|pg||
nt|haans: soon @D|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 4@S on the 4-3 was very well done other room|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@H 4@S NS-another flat I think|pg||
nt|haans: to slow to show spade void |pg||
nt|iris100:  But as even 5@S makes|pg||
nt|cindy:  whats wrong with pass by S ?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: oeff 2@H by W is guts|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Board 5 was flat|pg||
nt|lml: hello|pg||
mb|3C|nt|kiwibridge: OR did go via 1@S but still reached 4@H last one|pg||
nt|sybarra: same auction as other table |pg||
nt|boedhy: looks like slem values and both have reasonable hands but it is off offcourse on @d lead ....|pg||
nt|april7: good save in 5@D against 4@S but also 5@S makes, but no S nor N can compete in the bidding|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Linda |pg||
nt|andyv:  2@c beginning of invite relay|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: or a failing 3N :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: takes the punt ouch|pg||
nt|petergill: 10-12 NT at this vul and position|pg||
nt|sybarra: thus the @D opening |pg||
nt|ybob: 4@S exclusion 5@H 2+Q|pg||
nt|cindy:  S has nothing to write home about|pg||
mb|4C|nt|garnetts: Not that bad a bid just that bad a result|pg||
nt|ybob: now 7@H|pg||
nt|haans: are you sure?|pg||
nt|ybob: 99 %|pg||
nt|andyv:  will be much tougher to dble here than in OR where W opened with 1@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: can E bid 5@H if 4@S cue ????|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they are combined here|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Best switch - means no @C ruff|pg||
nt|mcarroll: So game the limit but they may investigate slam, and hopefully stop at 5 which is safe|pg||
nt|april7: 2 keycards are missing, so EW will stay out of slam|pg||
nt|mcarroll: They have bid 7NT in Open|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Linda|pg||
nt|sybarra: wow!  lot to do here then |pg||
nt|murat e: two keycards missing but slam makes hard to reach|pg||
mb|4H|nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: another flat board I think|pg||
nt|ybob: maybe regular KCA|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Ah - W has no trump to return when in with @CA so the ruff is still available|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting that neither N or S could dbl the artificial @d bids|pg||
nt|andyv:  @s lead looks more like a favorite except for the lack of entries to N hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  old adage of leading a 4 card suit when 5-4 against NT hold true here|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  declarer has to be a bit careful here|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @D lead difficult|pg||
nt|petergill: Good lead by Andy Hung, better than say @DK|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  North realizes South has heart shortage so the hands fit badly|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But I think we all have played worse contract than 4@h on this board....|pg||
nt|jaapfr: as a kib says: just go with the book|pg||
nt|imp_jan: wonder why north did not bid 1@S, not that it matters much|pg||
nt|imp_jan: these semi finals are played over 2 x 14 brds|pg||
nt|andyv:  8@s would at least tell pd your suit isn't that good|pg||
nt|imp_jan: tomorrow the final will played over 3 x 16 brds|pg||
mb|4S!|nt|kiwibridge: 4th highes from longest suit|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: often works|pg||
nt|april7: 6@S makes on a non @D lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: 6@D is confusing|pg||
nt|rnmalik: another swing|pg||
nt|garnetts: harder to find a @D lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  this will be a good pick up for e|pg||
nt|andyv:  Egypt|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2@D+1@H+1@C+1@S=5, 2@D as it is will make|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I can tell you all the bids here,  but we might be headed in the same direction |pg||
nt|lml: it looks like North is in charge of this auction though|pg||
nt|chick: 4@H also denies the @DA, so N will know the situation well now|pg||
mb|5C|nt|andyv:  I guess not that hard:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: mazybe not |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: there would have been seperate events if enought entries it says|pg||
nt|lml: its harder to visualize 7 from the north hand if that is true|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: all cards wrong for declarer|pg||
nt|petergill: except @HJ10|pg||
nt|april7: and also 6@H|pg||
nt|sybarra: look at bidding in OR,  that looks like a strong 2 @D opening |pg||
mb|p|nt|rgdruru: Incredible since they stay in 6|pg||
nt|mcarroll: true|pg||
nt|andyv:  now 8 tricks within reach if W can read @c situation|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: @CQ good technique again, makes W think about whether Pd has !K|pg||
nt|lml: but North will invite 7 I suspect and south will go of course|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Which makes it easier - and leaves S in control|pg||
nt|lml: what North may not know is how solid South's diamonds are|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry I typed to fast its  multi with the strong option |pg||
nt|vugraphzus: south is holding 7nt bid|pg||
nt|murat e: a misundersting would lead to slam only|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://psbridge.gotdns.com/bbo/allvug/  - Vugraph Hand Records (PDF)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sharynr: the Dutch women (Girls?) have taken the lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: played 8 of spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: and now he is sad:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: have a lot of sympathy---the 6@D bid shows character and understanding |pg||
nt|garnetts: Should get the clubs right after this |pg||
nt|rnmalik: Strange defense Likely to end play himself|pg||
nt|santyclz: Quite.  Doesn't quite do it for declarer though.|pg||
nt|haans: they have to go back home and have a little talk|pg||
nt|andyv:  back to 7|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|nt|sybarra: N bid 2 nt expecting a wk major,  but was pleasantly surprised |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|jaapfr: is usa using 1@D opening as 10-15 with 2+@D?|pg||
nt|lml: this is one of the easier grands to reach|pg||
nt|lml: I like grand claimers|pg||
nt|lml: I dont want to have to work too hard in 7|pg||
nt|sybarra: me either |pg||
nt|sybarra: opening lead and claim |pg||
pc|c9|nt|jaapfr: @H @H without thinking she must be very tired|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rnmalik: 8 tricks only|pg||
nt|petergill: but the contract figures to fail, after this good lead and good defence, I think|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like -2 here also|pg||
nt|murat e: and probably happened in other room......|pg||
pc|s4|nt|cherdano:  now EW can get a trump promotion|pg||
nt|cherdano:  with @SK and three rounds of diamond|pg||
nt|chick: yeah, that's what I figured... too bad :(|pg||

nt|Walddk5: tomorrow|pg||
nt|cindy:  what time is it there ?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|haans: spade 8 was a little to much|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: how to get them right?|pg||
nt|andyv:  W may have played this a bit too fast|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kiwibridge: 10 imps again|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I love these short matches lots of swings great stuff|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: an indictment on the wbf really|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 19:22|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|ybob: but if 4@S was normaly KCA its a wrong bid|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Wrong tempo for 10 tricks now|pg||
pc|cA|pc|d6|nt|cherdano:  but the @D pitch prevents that|pg||
pc|c3|nt|haans: still down|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
nt|petergill: @H to 9 was the winning play if you can see all 52 cards, as we can|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|drorp:  the 2nd diamond loser goes on the K@s so it still makes...|pg||
nt|imp_jan: remarkable retransfer to the weak hand|pg||
pc|cT|nt|vugraphzut: Bob left from table for a while he need a WC break i think |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I can understand his reasoning. He has no tenaces to protect after North's 2@S vulnerable. Maybe Marion has|pg||
nt|imp_jan: well he just had to go to the men's room, that's all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Or maybe he needed to go to the toilet|pg||
nt|vugraphzut: he drink a lot tee and also water |pg||

nt|sharynr: i might suggest a passed out hand, but East is here :)|pg||
nt|haans: have been a winner for me|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: another big one to Noname|pg||
nt|santyclz: Tough hand, both for declarer and defense.|pg||
nt|sybarra: N/S are going to feel snake bit on this set |pg||
nt|haans: just play @CK before dim entry|pg||
nt|haans: and get extra clubs trick|pg||
nt|andyv:  and 5 more imps for Egypt|pg||
nt|tweety1: EW finds the slam and becomes the new leader :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  a chance for E/W as slam seems reasonable|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so usa red have clawed back the deficit|pg||
nt|ralfwil: For 10 tricks the @h finess must be done early|pg||
nt|jaapfr: who plays 1nt here?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ok cindy where does this end:)?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: How did he lose 3 tricks?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: spade ruff|pg||
nt|sybarra: and you know this is a push agst. a good team |pg||
nt|lml: you do but it feels good to get there anyway|pg||
nt|sybarra: you bet! |pg||
nt|lml: I never mark +1520 as a minus position :)|pg||
nt|kfay: So Netherlands now leads by 13|pg||
nt|murat e: sometimes misundersting is good...|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  yes locking declarer in dummy would have worked too to beat it legitimately|pg||
nt|haans: and N|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 43 imps in 7 boards|pg||
nt|garnetts: Very poor auction in the OR--East failing to bid 4@H |pg||
nt|andyv:  agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  East should exit with a high club to do that!|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: same contract only -3 OR|pg||
nt|andyv:  esp. when W made a slam try with 4@c bid|pg||
nt|garnetts: usually better to pass initially then act--initial action being a little weaker in good style|pg||
nt|andyv:  some players hate to pass:)|pg||
nt|chick: of course if the boards had been in reverse order, we'd say that NED clawed back their deficit :)|pg||
nt|cindy:  2@h|pg||
nt|don paulus: 2 nt ?n now|pg||
nt|cindy:  nah|pg||
nt|rnmalik: action board:)|pg||
nt|chick: er, maybe lucky anyway :)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|cherdano:  (in case declarer has @C6)|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: exactly|pg||
nt|haans: also weak openings|pg||
nt|sharynr: and so is North apparently :)|pg||
nt|haans: what an overcall|pg||
nt|2celik1: in 6|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: cze salim welcome|pg||
nt|rnmalik: corrected:)|pg||
nt|santyclz: There we go.  That's more like what we expect from jr's.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@H NS and some play|pg||
nt|andyv:  they like to play machismo bridge:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: may get too high here in n/s |pg||
nt|lml: do you like opening 1@H |pg||
nt|lml: I know 6-5 come alive but still|pg||
nt|sybarra: IF opening I might start with 1 @S   |pg||
nt|lml: I suspect east-west is going to play this hand anyway|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Not for me. I prefer a weak 2 but not with those @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: thats the problem Martin |pg||
mb|3N|nt|sharynr: better than most other bids she made|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: hard to predict pass pass board in this table|pg||
nt|2celik1: hi Gary thank you|pg||
nt|garnetts: No reason for South to even think|pg||
nt|garnetts: Well that is a certainly brave from North--well done|pg||
nt|andyv:  nice bid by N|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 1C-1@H-1@S-1nt?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: this time i do not believe you:)|pg||
nt|cindy:  i dont really like bidding 2N on that hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: I guess I would sit back and hope to get in on second round |pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  West is tempted to double for takout?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: he is thinking|pg||
nt|cherdano:  i would double too|pg||
nt|garnetts: even I might make this one|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: well passed S guess hes seen pards weak 2's before:)|pg||
nt|petergill: Team 42 is a good team, from four different countries (Bulgaria from Eastern Europe, Belgium from Western Europe, South Africa and Australia), pehaps the most geographically ...|pg||
nt|petergill: diverse team ever in the history of bridge|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Ah yes - see what happens when I go to pour coffee|pg||
nt|april7: only a partscore in @S|pg||
nt|lml: me too|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I agree with Shirley - the least worst bi is 1 @S|pg||
nt|andyv:  good morning|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  if he had doubled, EW could get to 4@H|pg||
nt|sharynr: very true, operator|pg||
nt|don paulus: diff with @c lead|pg||
nt|don paulus: 3 nt|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: lots of excitement here :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: again NOT an opener, who teaches these kids?|pg||
nt|lml: well he got both suits in|pg||
nt|mcarroll: bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: of course that may be at the 4 level coming back to me |pg||
nt|lml: I agree with that too but I would rather not open|pg||
nt|sybarra: pard sometimes takes me (seriously) for a real opening bid |pg||
mb|p|nt|2celik1: so young so much|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this ones is cold|pg||
nt|haans: 15+ for big clubs|pg||
nt|tweety1: puff|pg||
nt|garnetts: which is why West does better to pass intially and then bid--you really do need a system after a multi|pg||
nt|andyv:  if W had his bid, I'd much prefer a dbl by E at this vul than 4@S bid|pg||
nt|don paulus: well ...|pg||
pc|s4|nt|cherdano:  which would probably make|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: he passed|pg||
nt|haans: first unusual bid|pg||
nt|don paulus: thought 8 pts was in the max range|pg||
nt|don paulus: what scared him off ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: and south is about to bid 3nt with good spots|pg||
nt|haans: clubs lead?|pg||
nt|mrace: seems like they will end in 3 nt|pg||
pc|s5|nt|cherdano:  North has an easy pass of 2@C|pg||
nt|haans: pass on 2@D are S serious|pg||
nt|haans: that is something to talk about|pg||
nt|don paulus: if not - switch will follow|pg||
nt|garnetts: Just as an aside--the recommended lead is the A@D |pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, it is tough on BBO when you are playing strong players and things don't go your way|pg||
nt|sybarra: werent you ever young Gary, and felt invicible?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: W pls pass|pg||
nt|fahir: gm Andy|pg||
nt|mrace: and south didnt have chance to show @Ss|pg||
pc|sT|nt|vugraphzus: again 5-1 trumps|pg||
nt|sharynr: South is happy |pg||
nt|haans: no double = no so happy|pg||
nt|sharynr: i predict down 2|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: need @c T swtch to beat|pg||
nt|haans: clubs T?|pg||
nt|haans: all are going down|pg||
nt|chick: the juniors are fearless :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: let me think...yes I was young once but learnt sound priciples via Charles goren|pg||
nt|sybarra: hey, the wose that happens is you go down....|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @d10 is a nice lead - or?|pg||
nt|chick: 99.9% of the bridge world :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: lol|pg||
nt|cindy:  W has no choice|pg||
nt|mrace: good morning :)|pg||
nt|arigun2: good morning |pg||
nt|hoz: gm|pg||
nt|mrace: oh sry he is on lead|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @DT or @D4 no big difference|pg||
nt|cindy:  N has no choice|pg||
nt|sybarra: S being fearless  |pg||
nt|lml: I don't much like redouble by Verbeek... he would have been better placed to have bid his clubs|pg||
nt|lml: still 3NT is a good spot for east-west|pg||
nt|sybarra: 9 tricks off the top |pg||
nt|lml: if they bid the club slam I think they are more likely to drop the stiff king here|pg||
nt|lml: one of the specs told me they have no way to force with a club bid so redouble was his only choice|pg||
pc|hK|nt|nigel_k:  3NT should be defeated I think as the defence can set up clubs before declarer can establish a second diamond|pg||
nt|cindy:  i meant 3@h :-)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: E neither|pg||
nt|sybarra: guessing stiff K of clubs is beaucoup tricks  |pg||
nt|lml: he will on his way to taking his nine tricks|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rnmalik: small a winner here|pg||
nt|sybarra: aha|pg||
nt|sybarra: the 3 better you are saying |pg||
nt|haans: its tough on BBS if you do not have the cards|pg||
nt|haans: BBO|pg||
nt|sybarra: (per a jr.)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: -1|pg||
nt|mcarroll: EW have done well to push NS to the 3 level but it should make|pg||
nt|mcarroll: provioded of course that everyone passes|pg||
nt|boedhy: very strange things the Japanese youngsters in the other room are doing |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Safety play of @CA in 3NT gets all the marbles|pg||
nt|lml: if he doesnt duck the opening lead and there really is no reason to he will take all the tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: in other table marion made a great lead against slam|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rnmalik: 3 losers only|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: at least we have youth playing which is a great thing|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Es lead was a @d but not the 10|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|cherdano:  so NS will score an easy +130|pg||
nt|iris100:  3@S should go down as well|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|cherdano:  where as double would have gotten EW to a making @H partial, or game|pg||
nt|cherdano:  it doesn't usually pay to let opponents play 2@C when you are 5-5 in the unbid suits|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: played k|pg||
nt|haans: not easy to find|pg||
nt|chick: actually, I don't mind the E opener, honors are top and texture is better than the previous hand we discussed|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hey i'm getting great feedback kibitzers @H|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree Cornelia |pg||
nt|andyv:  as one spec points out, we've all been in far worse slams... and some of them even made!|pg||
pc|h6|nt|haans: i assume 1H did show 5 spades|pg||
nt|don paulus: probably transfer|pg||
nt|ybob: 1NT ask how many controls ?|pg||
nt|haans: yes mb|pg||
nt|ybob: not alert ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: 2 h was transfer |pg||
nt|haans: ty|pg||
nt|garnetts: Surely not with three trumps|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'll leap wildly with shape or support for pard|pg||
nt|andyv:  S not giving up yet|pg||
nt|andyv:  possibly unaware of how much ground they have made up this set|pg||
pc|h5|nt|2celik1: and we are in Istanbul on of the excited city on the earth |pg||
nt|don paulus: - 2 ?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: do not see how to make now|pg||
nt|andyv:  8 tricks seem to be max on this hand|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|petergill: or at least that is how I felt in the Spingold on BBO the other day being crushed (pleasantly, I have to admit) by Alan Sontag|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: E says sorry partner if i am wrong with double bid|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vugraphzus: this is real|pg||
nt|boedhy: they bid well to find the save against the game on the last board but that made the Italians bid the slam and they lead the @d still making........|pg||
nt|boedhy: sorry the Polish youngsters|pg||
nt|Gerben42: you can make up just as much by not bidding slam as by bidding slam, depending on if it makes or not|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mrace: good shift, but would go down on any other lead except than @S continue i guess|pg||
nt|mrace: still a very good game, @H finesse off, clubs don't behave|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: seems @D 6 is not helpful for Tim.he is thinking|pg||
nt|andyv:  S had a lot of 6s to lead from|pg||
nt|mrace: well south is not sure what he wants from pd|pg||
nt|hoz: at the other table, in the end game N played a small D; so it could have made|pg||
nt|mrace: maybe @DS are setting if pd has AQ|pg||
pc|hA|nt|haans: smal clubs = grave error|pg||
nt|andyv:  now time to give up the ghost|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|don paulus: S asking @c|pg||
nt|jaapfr: or can she seduce S to hit @HA:)?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|cherdano:  EW had no idea how distributional South is|pg||
nt|andyv:  now the danger zone|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 5@D sounds like the end|pg||
nt|Gerben42: from the looks of it|pg||
nt|andyv:  not sure...S seems pretty determined|pg||
pc|s7|nt|andyv:  he got it right|pg||
pc|d2|nt|nigel_k:  If South just passed a forcing bid she chose an excellent time to do so|pg||
nt|andyv:  tough problem for N|pg||
nt|imp_jan: last stop...|pg||
nt|andyv:  he appears to have signed off twice but S keeps on bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: michal seems confused|pg||
nt|Gerben42: south bidding a lot for a limited hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: and passed!!|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@D showed 18-20|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|andyv:  6@d will have one chance...@c lead|pg||
nt|mrace: so if he plays high @D that elimates this option|pg||
nt|mrace: yup|pg||
nt|chick: this will make, but note that N must duck the first 2 spade tricks to have any chance to set, because he has no entries|pg||
pc|h9|nt|rnmalik: Cannot ruff both hands make it difficult for him|pg||
nt|andyv:  because of 3 trump... with 4, 4@S is automatic, with 3, 800 or 1100 are very real possibilities|pg||
nt|garnetts: WEst should not really have the mountain he has--and 200 or 500 are much more likely|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'm afraid that 2Aces and an unsupported K is only 2 quick tricks|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: means you can provide just 2 of the 7 tricks you are bidding for, part needs to provide 3 times as many as you|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: again director is called|pg||
nt|chick: but of course partner can also promote some of your other stuff to full tricks, too |pg||
nt|vugraphzus: east says ý thought adam has spade stoper|pg||
nt|jaapfr: so usa red first 3 imps|pg||
nt|andyv:  wow... great stop|pg||
nt|andyv:  i play 5N as pick a slam so, to have read that as a stop was very well done.|pg||
nt|andyv:  somehow I don't think this auction is in their portfolio:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: so many questions in both sides|pg||
nt|Gerben42: on all 4 sides no doubt|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ybob: .|pg||
nt|haans: from specs 1@H 8-11 any 2@H trf|pg||
nt|imp_jan: so we have a very close match indeed, brd 30 is the last one, therefore both teams much in contention|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ybob: 3Nt was cold|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  As before, an extra trick can eventually be established in diamonds but not hearts|pg||
nt|boedhy: no need to play the @dd let it make |pg||
nt|april7: @D lead was not the best idea, now S makes the contract, otherwise 1 down|pg||
nt|april7: ruffing out the 10 of @D|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Since USA Blue can't be caught, they get 1st choice to choose their opponents in the quarter-finals among teams finishing 5-8|pg||
pc|d4|nt|cherdano:  i dont really blame them for giving up this trick|pg||

pc|dA|nt|nigel_k:  Playing on hearts looks like it will limit declarer to eight tricks|pg||
nt|iris100:  itrue|pg||

nt|cherdano:  but here North was so weak (no points in partner's suits) that he shouldn't mind playing 2@C|pg||
nt|haans: a double of 2@D would tell N = i have @D|pg||
nt|sharynr: agree|pg||
nt|sharynr: especially since the 1NT bid|pg||

nt|don paulus: 7 @h or nt even|pg||
nt|haans: 2@C-3@D easy |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: our 4th player is from Ecuador|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: by?|pg||
nt|garnetts: This is because a blind lead often gives away a crucial trick--so cash and ace to get a look|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: fair enough|pg||
nt|petergill: Flat board - in my opinion, a little overtrick ns not a big deal at imps|pg||
nt|petergill: Team 42 want 11 more imps to reach the magical 42 imp mark|pg||
nt|iris100:  another flat board|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: players are talking about 3@s board|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: france guys think 2down|pg||
nt|iris100:  1 SA by S in the open room|pg||
nt|sybarra: something truly didnt make sense there |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 75% of the time, all those openers do is tell declarer how to finesse|pg||
nt|jaapfr: or a senior moment:)?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: the potential @C cruff by S|pg||
nt|april7: Q of @D was known in W hand though|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: he played king of diamonds from hand|pg||
nt|april7: which was wrong|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Thinking - hmm 7NT twice in a row - and of course will find the play in 7 lol|pg||
nt|mrace: and in worst case (as in here) a good pd is there for finding what is right :)|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|2celik1: i see |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: but only at imps|pg||
nt|sybarra: 42 imp= blitz |pg||
nt|andyv:  take away the K@c and 800 is still there|pg||
nt|jaapfr: defense was fine until E forgot to get 2 aces for -1|pg||
nt|cindy:  you mean 7 clubs in north hand ?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|haans: or else much harder|pg||
nt|garnetts: more so at pairs I think|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N best here|pg||
nt|jaapfr: nah S trew  away:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3NT for EW top 9|pg||
nt|imp_jan: so nl is leading with the smallest of margins, but anything can happen |pg||
mb|2D!|nt|kiwibridge: not sure how that happened :)|pg||
nt|2celik1: so many new Zia's coming|pg||
nt|rnmalik: hope so:)|pg||
nt|petergill: yes, and it is their team name, from the Douglas Adams stories|pg||
nt|don paulus: will bid 4 @h ?|pg||
nt|ybob: probably 4@H -2 here|pg||
nt|sybarra: that is certainly not my favo Neg. X |pg||
nt|sybarra: only 6 pts and junk!|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not my favourite vul overcall either :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: i guess she was expecting spades in N 's hand.but they all are ok now|pg||
nt|sybarra: true|pg||
nt|chick: 4 hearts and 7-8 points,  AQ very likely 2 full tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/VGData/minirama.html  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|mcarroll: True|pg||
mb|3C|nt|sybarra: Andy finding the spades and minor bid "amuzing" |pg||
nt|mcarroll: But @h overcall may make it difficult to bid|pg||
nt|Gerben42: just one free throw|pg||
nt|andyv:  maybe same lead rule should apply to 5N as to 6N... make the most non-commital lead possible|pg||
nt|andyv:  light opener may get E/W too high|pg||
mb|3H|nt|haans: 3 controls (A=2 K=1)|pg||
nt|haans: they will not find @D|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Marshall Lewis|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi all|pg||
nt|don paulus: hi marshall|pg||
nt|haans: hi Marshall|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I met and spoke with Zia in 1976 -  awesome|pg||
nt|2celik1: i will take care on Kiwis by tomorrow Gary|pg||
nt|haans: having 14 hcp 3 have already bid?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: on 3rd and 4@D|pg||
nt|don paulus: 4 @s now|pg||
nt|cindy:  S is marked with a doubleton @c|pg||
nt|cindy:  would have led a singleton @c|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sharynr: 1 think I admire about young players is there very quick decisions|pg||
nt|haans: you came to a GRAND|pg||
nt|don paulus: we saved a grand for you :)|pg||
nt|haans: good opps bidding|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that is a lot of spades to bid|pg||
nt|garnetts: Also some practiced pairs reverse their normal lead structure against pre-empts--K from AK and the lead of an ace requires an attitude signal|pg||
nt|sybarra: does he X?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: he is thinking|pg||
nt|petergill: in Adams' 'Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy - answer to the ultimate question about the meaning of life = 42, for those even more illiterate than me |pg||
nt|haans: does W let is stand|pg||
nt|andyv:  and you are right...either pass, or dbl and then bid @s would have been better action by W|pg||
nt|lml: the opening 2@S bid tends to push north-south|pg||
nt|andyv:  just make sure your name isn't Shaq|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphzus: and passed|pg||
nt|iris100:  same bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 2 @H forcing?|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure he wants to give the hand away |pg||
nt|petergill: Operator, are you sure that East di not dbl?|pg||
nt|tweety1: very unlucky slam miss other room again..|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  declarer will probably take this trick, cross to a diamond, and take a spade finesse|pg||
nt|garnetts: This argument is a little futile--I will always support when I can rather than double in this situation--and with a small manipulation there is a grand for EW|pg||
nt|jaapfr: were trown away in meantime on 3rd and 4th @D Cindy|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: or "bettering" the contract, same level |pg||
nt|marlowepi: in a sense the N hand does not merit an upgrade, but with both minor tenaces to protect 2N is acceptable. the high card structure of the N hand is esepecially good for suit play, ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and if S has a major N wants to be declarer|pg||
nt|lml: the problem here is communcations|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Discussion hand.  In your partnership does the 2@h bid imply @d support or tend to show @d shortage?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I wouldnt  with E east hand |pg||
nt|vugraphzus: yes|pg||
nt|haans: if he pass W cannot bid anymore|pg||
nt|chick: 2@C will be limit raise |pg||
nt|boedhy: will make 8 or 9 tricks also|pg||
mb|p|nt|don paulus: keeps ops out of 7|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: i think east should ask rkcb with 4nt|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am not sure that 4S did anything to keep them out of 7|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: man overboard here|pg||
nt|garnetts: Is west getting desperate ?  4@H ?  |pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks Basar|pg||
nt|haans: call it tactical|pg||
nt|ybob: 1NT 2@C 2@H 4@H ?|pg||
nt|chick: which S declines to bid, given his hand full of garbage :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Rdbl = I have a H stop perhaps?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: very interesting sequence of bidding|pg||
nt|rnmalik: that shows control|pg||
nt|april7: if E plays on @S 4th @D can't be cashed by S|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: another overbid|pg||
nt|haans: but are not W to fault pass on 1@C makeable|pg||
nt|sharynr: was 1@C not forcing?|pg||
nt|haans: maybe all bid are forcing|pg||
nt|sharynr: seems both bids alerted|pg||
nt|haans: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: west always puts cards over board when he is dummy|pg||
nt|sybarra: indeed discussion |pg||
nt|haans: are opener bidding all forcing bids|pg||
nt|garnetts: But as you say I am sure we would have managed a little better in practice|pg||
nt|garnetts: Interesting choice 2@S--anyone for what I think is an obvious 2@D |pg||
nt|lml: West made a good lead|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes good safe lead|pg||
nt|murat e: touhg play|pg||
pc|cK|nt|tweety1: needs to know what this 2 @c alert means..|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: probably could be short|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: they didnt wrote note|pg||
nt|garnetts: To some extent yes--but given limited possibilities 2@D seems to be space saving|pg||
nt|andyv:  Neth. Red need a couple of calm boards |pg||
nt|andyv:  ugly 2N bid|pg||
pc|cT|nt|petergill: @HJ - that's good news and bad news, thinks South - the good news is that I'm not doubled|pg||
nt|mrace: he didnt have much of an option though|pg||
nt|mrace: 2 @H is option|pg||
pc|c8|nt|cherdano:  giving him 8 tricks|pg||
nt|sharynr: is west the only male at the table?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: yes:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: eventually:)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Difficult to bid, easy to play|pg||
nt|rnmalik: very right|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|don paulus: 3 nt makes with @d lead :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: write|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Is W thinking?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: yes|pg||
nt|mrace: but i think thats even worse|pg||
pc|d3|nt|andyv:  perhaps N was trying to show value of his hand with 2@s bid|pg||
nt|mcarroll: if so got it right|pg||
nt|rnmalik: was|pg||
nt|Gerben42: this calm enough?|pg||
nt|andyv:  can't hurt|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|iris100:  looks like 3@S, 1@D, 2@H and 1@C = just made|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Winning the spade doesn't help as dummy has no entry|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Declarer now has to guess spades though East's opening bid will help|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kiwibridge: excellent J@C|pg||
nt|garnetts: Great card by South|pg||
nt|haans: 2@H first natural bid by opener|pg||
nt|haans: even Big Clubs are changing|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and -1 I think!|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: opening 1m could lead to a wrong-sided major suit game |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|tweety1: then 2 @s is not that strong|pg||
pc|s6|nt|april7: S should duck twice|pg||
pc|sK|nt|haans: will not like were clubs honor are|pg||
nt|sharynr: she pretty much needs the @CA onside to make, and @D 3-3|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|rnmalik: The system they are playing. If 2@D natural then 2@H natural too|pg||
nt|sybarra: since not match points,  why bother with jxx of @D |pg||
nt|garnetts: Well he hasn't got reversing vales with a void in what is liekly to be partner's suit|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rnmalik: Did you meet Masood Salim, his Partner. Walking computer|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we've lost some comparisons in that break|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: i will put in scores shortly|pg||
nt|garnetts: maximum hurt here now n|pg||
nt|murat e: two down|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h4|nt|kiwibridge: I was scoring at the far eastern in Auckland 1976, Zia in black velvet and much gold chains|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: NS on the ball and well rewarded|pg||
nt|garnetts: Self inflicted wound though|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Not any longer!|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a magnet for the ladies :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: losing finesse |pg||
nt|rnmalik: swing as it is|pg||
nt|sybarra: adding to  NL lead here |pg||
nt|nigel_k:  @hQ now appears to be with West so East needs the @sQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: now she is thinking|pg||
nt|andyv:  it's a reverse, @c void being the negative part|pg||
nt|don paulus: insist on @h and down|pg||
pc|d5|nt|april7: 9 tricks now also|pg||
nt|april7: sorry, I don't kow, ask the vuegraph|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sybarra: what a finesse |pg||
pc|dK|nt|marlowepi: what was 2S? 3 controls?|pg||
nt|haans: i do not belive 4nt was an option for E|pg||
nt|iris100:  right!|pg||
nt|rnmalik: one should  know to count to 9 to make|pg||
nt|sybarra: should be a push |pg||
nt|lml: I think there might be a squeeze now|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: west seems upset after looking at dummy|pg||
nt|haans: i do belibve that 3 controls|pg||
nt|andyv:  but, can't really comment without knowing what 2@cs was all about.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|andyv:  a genetic problem with a system that has you bid Qxxx and never introduce an AKJxxx suit|pg||
pc|s4|nt|don paulus: do not like singelton trump lead - but other leads may give a trick away|pg||
nt|andyv:  otherwise, 2@d seems like the normal bid|pg||
nt|lml: well not now|pg||
pc|h8|nt|haans: many play 1@H to be semi-relay natural or stronger|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W made a common error at trick one. from KJ(T) the lowest honor is the correct card when suit is led against a suit contract|pg||
nt|mrace: he could pass, however , on 3@H, nun vulnerable, it doesnt look atractive to me 4@H bid, or perhaps we are too prefectionist seeing all hands|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|lml: if South wins it I think he might have a double squeeze|pg||
nt|lml: with clubs as the central suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: club was led in the other room |pg||
pc|dA|nt|mrace: yes i agree|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d8|nt|cherdano:  well declarer had other ideas|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: oh yes but important to extract the max damage|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not a great save against a likely NS partscore|pg||
pc|h6|pg||

nt|vugraphzus: after 4nt he can ask extras with 5nt .and he will get @d K for grand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: then W should bid 5N as a grand slam try over 5H. not practical to play it specifically as Josephine by 2C opener|pg||
nt|rnmalik: we are playing 10 boards here.|pg||
nt|petergill: so this is a good board for New Zealand (NS)|pg||
nt|haans: natural to bid 4@H going down|pg||
nt|iris100:  next board looks more interesting|pg||
nt|iris100:  4@H by W has some chances|pg||
nt|iris100:  nasty lead for N|pg||
nt|tweety1: then the only reason seems the quality of @s   to be bid.|pg||
nt|tweety1: instead of @d|pg||
nt|garnetts: Odd method--also some case for South responding with 1@S |pg||
nt|andyv:  ty... makes more sense now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: good effort both rooms|pg||
nt|marlowepi: playing the ten from KJT allows W to find out who has the queen|pg||
nt|andyv:  sorry, private|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 6 brds left in this exciting match|pg||
nt|Gerben42: italy by 23 at the moment|pg||

mb|1H|nt|vugraphzus: and threw it|pg||
nt|sharynr: :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Really, e ducked the @s?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: A great opportunity for the girls to take the lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  EW should get to 4@H here|pg||
nt|sybarra: doubt it |pg||
nt|rnmalik: CR @S lead and no@D finesse 3NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: @C lead |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 6@S looks a go|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Sorry - missed the continuation, contract in Open 5@D by EW|pg||
nt|lml: my partner hates it when I open the north hand but I dont mind it at all at this vul|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@S t/o of @S|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 2@S is t.a.|pg||
nt|mrace: and dont forget, this is juniors, every 6 card suit that starts with an A is almost solid for them, at least it was for me when i was young :)|pg||
mb|1S!|an|0-4!s|nt|Walddk5: In the other room East wanted to protect his @HK and pulled 6@S to 6NT. That was not a good idea|pg||
nt|Walddk5: @DK put an end to that contract|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But your are right Jaap, that declarer is -1 if W has @ca OR @sK, so it´s safe to cash @hA ane exit with a @c|pg||

nt|mcarroll: for|pg||
nt|andyv:  possible swing here|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: so the score soon will be 31-12 or 31-8 I think|pg||
nt|garnetts: Looks like a push here in 4@H plus one |pg||
nt|chick: N has another bid, I think|pg||
nt|don paulus: very close match - was only 2 pts difference between the teams|pg||
nt|andyv:  that's why my parents took out all the Aces in the deck:)|pg||
nt|mrace: haha|pg||
mb|2D|nt|haans: 3@C best bid|pg||
nt|sharynr: agree|pg||
nt|haans: do not understand what 4@S mean?|pg||
nt|petergill: Anticipating 4@H by EW, Norh takes the advance save with a keen eye on the vulnerability|pg||
nt|don paulus: surprising result on board 16 : 6 @s X !|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR, N bid 5@d here|pg||
nt|chick: it was still a good thing to consider, even though it didn't work out this time|pg||

nt|vugraphzus: its ok |pg||
nt|rnmalik: short and sweet-no trouble for us.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Operator, please check the result on bd 28.  It looked to be -1.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes pl|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 nt coming up some how |pg||
nt|haans: in teori thay have 3nt EW|pg||
nt|don paulus: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Asp/RoundTeams.asp?qtournid=724&qroundno=12|pg||
mb|2N|nt|haans: you can play 5nt as Q ask|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we appreciate your efforts :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: u welcome:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: does W sit?|pg||
nt|haans: do you agree with that peter?|pg||
nt|petergill: His mother makes the same sorts of pressure bids when she plays with me - putting max pressure on EW early in the bidding, giving EW the last guess|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am not sure W can sit |pg||
nt|petergill: 4@H is cold for 620|pg||
nt|haans: go back on hand. DID YOU p X THEN?|pg||
nt|chick: 4 may be a little brave though :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@S DBL was not bad but 5@C. 4NT for minors|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Everything right for EW in 6@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: west is in tank again|pg||
nt|mcarroll: difficult to see how it could be bid however|pg||
nt|imp_jan: probably a club lead now|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Not that it makes much of an imp difference.|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @S looks likt transfer to clubs |pg||
nt|petergill: West might take the Dbl as values instead of pure penalty|pg||
nt|petergill: as he has done!|pg||
nt|jaapfr: imo NS here played a more accurate match these first 8 boards|pg||
nt|rnmalik: difficult as it looks to bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  did 2@h promise 6@s?|pg||
nt|murat e: 5 dia best contract|pg||
mb|3H|nt|kiwibridge: 2@C = any game force?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: good old gazillie|pg||
nt|don paulus: - 6 = 1400 wins an imp :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i was taught by my wife to say first Sorry and then later to investigate whether i was rite or wrong:(|pg||
nt|chick: S's 2@H bid can be made on 3 hearts and 13 cards|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Nice principle Jaap!|pg||
nt|chick: I think I like your wife already :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: S obviously has seen pd's weak openings|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think the vulernability can give you good excuse |pg||
nt|lml: I might have done more with the south hand if only to ward off 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  and meanwhile 5 IMPS to Italy, as North found a more successful @H lead at the other table|pg||
nt|haans: can anyone tell all scores|pg||
nt|iris100:  1@H, 3@C and a spade, thats it for N|pg||
nt|andyv:  less pressure at 4@h on declarer|pg||
nt|garnetts: They were pushed to 5@H next door|pg||
nt|mcarroll: They bid and made it in Open!|pg||
nt|sybarra: and why not?|pg||
mb|5D|nt|haans: she did not jump|pg||
nt|sharynr: Once again, a touch too high|pg||
nt|petergill: A good coup by Luke Gardiner, making EW guess, and they have now guessed wrongly|pg||
nt|jaapfr: until b8 i said: now they go overboard:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  if not, S|pg||
nt|andyv:  S's raise very risky on only 3@ss|pg||
nt|Gerben42: what did 2@H show exactly?|pg||
nt|imp_jan: molenaar might have dbld since 3@S might have been a preemptive raise|pg||
nt|andyv:  doesn't look like N took it as a preemptive raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: but no jumping from E :)|pg||
nt|sharynr: too bad, 3nt would have been better|pg||
nt|don paulus: good action by S|pg||
nt|haans: all i can say is HOLY ...|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Still, -200 is better than -620|pg||
nt|rnmalik: wow|pg||
nt|imp_jan: well noth thought apparently he had enough extra's|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: maybe. 2H going down. in my view it is better and safer to act initially on the S hand|pg||
nt|haans: me 2|pg||
nt|rnmalik: even in this sequence-looking for @S check I think|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 13 imps|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Indeed Rashed|pg||
nt|mrace: 3@D shows some sort of balanced strong hand with @Ss i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: looks like Noname have a decent win here barring a disaster on 10|pg||
nt|sybarra: S not wanting N to bid again!|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Not easy in the play|pg||
nt|rnmalik: play very important. I thought it was a marked small @H lead|pg||
nt|chick: nicely bid|pg||
nt|murat e: well done|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzus: passed 3nt |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: strange|pg||
nt|sybarra: that lead doesnt hurt |pg||
nt|vugraphzus: this is quite fun table|pg||
nt|garnetts: will cash AK @H then clubs for 11 tricks|pg||
nt|mrace: this looks like a push board|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard to find a constructive lead for W.  @d was only one that didn't give an immediate trick|pg||
pc|sA|nt|cherdano:  2N 18-19 balalnced, 3@D transfer, 3@S superaccept i assume|pg||
nt|garnetts: slam needs both major suits to break 3-2 with an extra residual chance in spades and the club ace right or led |pg||
nt|vugraphzus: and some more greek speech |pg||
nt|sybarra: that could be right also |pg||
nt|iris100:  but you wont make 4!E from E|pg||
nt|jaapfr: to be honest me too:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but which leaddddddddddddddd?|pg||
nt|imp_jan: @CK and not queen?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|andyv:  cash K@h, clear clubs and exit @h|pg||
nt|garnetts: mmaybe not with the unblock|pg||
nt|jaapfr: oh bad luck|pg||
nt|don paulus: didnot both deny @d control ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if you call that luck|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y|pg||
nt|mcarroll: This sequence may get them there|pg||
nt|lml: looking at that dummy I would try another club|pg||
nt|lml: its the only real chance|pg||
nt|sybarra: esp  holding k of @D |pg||
nt|mcarroll: The tricky lead of @D8 is not going to work either|pg||
nt|lml: I admit it is a slim chance :)|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|cherdano:  after @CAK and seeing the heart break, declarer can endplay South|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: seems that way.i couldnt read notes|pg||
nt|iris100:  4@H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: screamed for D lead in my view|pg||
nt|mrace: @h didnt give much either i guess with friendly @Ds|pg||
pc|h8|nt|cherdano:  so he won't need the @D finesse|pg||
nt|sharynr: yes, kib suggests a trump back to let declarer do all the owrk|pg||
pc|hA|nt|iris100:  as N doesnt follow 3 rounds of @D|pg||
nt|lml: he wanted to make sure parnter would ruff high|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kiwibridge: lol|pg||
nt|jaapfr: yyy|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|petergill: The vulnerability was vital to North's decision to bounce the auction. He knew EW have 8+ @H's if South has only 4 spades. |pg||
nt|chick: hehehe|pg||
nt|murat e: can make plus one though same lead in open room|pg||
nt|murat e: may go down on a wrong h |pg||
pc|s5|nt|sharynr: work*|pg||
nt|don paulus: would you then prefer 2 @c over dbl ? with only 3 @s ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably not going to mess around much here |pg||
nt|imp_jan: dynamic defense|pg||
nt|andyv:  very much so|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: yes he played K|pg||
nt|imp_jan: diamond cont makes decl trumpshort|pg||
pc|h4|nt|april7: probably @H lead, because ace of @S makes no sense|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|don paulus: very close match apart from board 11|pg||
nt|don paulus: sry 12|pg||
nt|april7: wrong side, sorry|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yes, slightly lucky escape for E/W then|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|nt|nigel_k:  Possibly their defence to 1NT left West with no option other than pass|pg||
nt|chick: yep, a big swing back for NED, although some kibs saying it is a gift, not earned|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ralfwil: Wrong to play @hK! only the @h9!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: must lead a diamond even with a void on that auction|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|petergill: Good comeback by New Zealand - they got 800 (the max) for 12 imps on the last board|pg||
nt|murat e: decision ý would say but w took his ace quickly|pg||
pc|h6|nt|andyv:  can't get to dummy|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|haans: yes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i prefer double, since S lacks club ten|pg||
nt|haans: x of 2@H usually mean no spades|pg||
nt|jaapfr: lol|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Gerben42: 140 in the other room was a great result for NS|pg||
nt|imp_jan: deceptive @CK...|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Unfortunately the web site is down and we can't see their convention card|pg||
nt|andyv:  simple game sometimes:)|pg||
nt|mrace: time to claim|pg||
pc|d3|nt|imp_jan: still good @S9..|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|mcarroll: Me too - now it is easier|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|rnmalik: of course|pg||
nt|sybarra: an imp is an imp |pg||
mc|11|nt|andyv:  yes, but @s back will make it down 2|pg||

nt|haans: REHI ALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL|pg||
nt|garnetts: I am not shocked |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thx David and Basar, thx all specs for your comments, join us again in 90 minutes for another round|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: ty all|pg||
nt|sybarra: and last bd now  |pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to Basar our wonderful operator,  great job ! |pg||
nt|haans: 50 minutes to next match|pg||
nt|petergill: Credit that 9 imp gain to Luke Gardiner's daring but sensible tactical bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: thx all last board now.i hope you are enjoyed the show|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  The defence dropped a trick so 3 imps to N/S|pg||
nt|tweety1: maybe some imps exchanges here:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think the auction next door was dreadful|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard to imagine how E/W got to that lovely contract in the OR|pg||
nt|tweety1: Many people opens 1 @c instead of @d with W's hand nowadays... and the only disadvantage is...|pg||
nt|andyv:  even so, I'd pass 1H like a shot with the E hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: Their method needs looking at--personally I do mind the 1@C on a doubleton--but dislike the 1@h rebid--but if you must then also must bid 2@D after 2@C |pg||
nt|tweety1: agree  1nt seems better than 1 h|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR, W opened 1@c, which was alerted as 2+... and E showed a preference for @cs|pg||
nt|chick: not totally sure I agree ... E in the other room made a decision to protect his @HK and got unlucky|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is last bd of this set |pg||
nt|vugraphzus: laura is saying " maybe i should bid 5 spades"|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sorry i get very much comments from spouses|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N makes with inspired club guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: thx all last board of the match|pg||
nt|rnmalik: that is -4|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 5 brds to go|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl of 2@s would have suggested @s support without risk|pg||
nt|murat e: it is hard to say usa team having a nice play on this set|pg||
nt|murat e: wests heart ace was not running anywhere|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: waiting for south now|pg||
mb|1N|an|14-16|nt|rnmalik: I have another in the evening that is my time|pg||
nt|garnetts: Thanks all and have fun--bye for now |pg||
nt|sybarra: thx also to Peter and Hans my co commentators. great fun guys! |pg||
nt|ybob: lucky 6@D here|pg||
nt|chick: an imp gain.  USA will be hardpressed to make back 20 imps in one hand |pg||
nt|vugraphzus: this is the last board of this match.thx all for watching|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 6@C fine result|pg||
nt|jaapfr: why inspired normal play also ok:)|pg||
nt|don paulus: tx basar - we havenot noticed you - so great job :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Delete that - mixing the teams up again|pg||
nt|Gerben42: another good result for Netherlands, 300 vs a partscore|pg||
nt|andyv:  another misfit but this time 3N plays a lot better|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: long way to go|pg||
nt|murat e: it was commented that seven clubs on w a major suit squeeze on south|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wait i was wrong no entry to hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: multi again |pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  NS can make grand slam|pg||
nt|cherdano:  in several strains|pg||
nt|cherdano:  but 6@C is the best contract|pg||
nt|sharynr: A multi opening|pg||
nt|garnetts: well after this |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I guess it's lunch time Basar?|pg||
nt|haans: ty :))|pg||
nt|rgdruru: and 6@s|pg||
nt|don paulus: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Information.htm|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well W had already said in the other room that he wanted to play 6S, ie E had no reason to think the heart king needed protection|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty Basar as always....great job! |pg||
nt|chick: but it closes the IMP gap, keeping this session exciting :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry, meant as private|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: as N had JUMPED to 2@H, there was a fair chance the !A was there, ergo 6NT was an awful bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty also Cornelia and Gary, for your thoughts and insights on these hands |pg||
nt|vugraphzus: last board now.thx all.i hope you enjoyed the show.|pg||
mb|d!|nt|vugraphzus: last bord was just made.fixed it now|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: yes its:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  is 3S general strength, or does it show clubs?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: welcome back:)|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: well Japan_Czech will enjoy theirs :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: yuck --not a great spot |pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to the WBF for organizing and bringing this to bbo   we LOVE seening the jrs. ! |pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, thanks Basar and thanks to the organisers in Istanbul such as Murat Molva and Ata Aydin.  |pg||
nt|chick: it's been done, but they will have to set 6@CXX about 8 tricks|pg||
nt|lml: not my choice on this hand  with 4 @S but thats me|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree with you Linda  (maybe just old fashioned me) |pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  slam will be difficult to find now|pg||
nt|garnetts: but curiously the spades mean it will play OK|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: i agree |pg||
nt|rnmalik: action board again|pg||
nt|murat e: so the most critical board of the match....|pg||
nt|jaapfr: tx Basar indeed great|pg||
nt|mrace: yes|pg||
mb|2C|nt|haans: not available|pg||
nt|iris100:  possible 3SA on the last one|pg||
nt|iris100:  but i think it goes down on a @S lead and @C switch on the third trick|pg||
nt|andyv:  E won't get too excited|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sharynr: zig and zag|pg||
nt|santyclz: Awfully heavy for a weak jump, maybe intermediate?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx specs for your informative and funny comments, we love them |pg||
mb|p|nt|don paulus: re-hi|pg||
nt|haans: hi|pg||
nt|petergill: A low heart lead????|pg||
nt|haans: lead low @H = make|pg||
nt|petergill: More daring bidding by NS gives Andy Hung a lead problem|pg||
nt|haans: u first|pg||
nt|petergill: the textbooks say 4th best from this holding|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 7@C and 7NT do make in practise but how to bid it:)/|pg||
mb|3S|nt|don paulus: surprising result board 27 !|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: first blood of this match|pg||
nt|don paulus: y|pg||
nt|sybarra: might even have trouble making 4 |pg||
nt|rnmalik: that should be the contract|pg||
nt|sybarra: ak of clubs, ruff, and ace of hts |pg||
nt|rnmalik: less damage|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: ty guys|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 12 imps for that great slam|pg||
nt|rnmalik: last board of this segment|pg||
nt|lml: they are playing it from the right side though |pg||
nt|sybarra: almost surprised we are not playing 3 nt here |pg||
nt|mrace: tuff though on @s lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  A nasty guess in diamonds awaits declarer as well|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: this is last board of the round thx everyone|pg||
nt|iris100:  but then, you just give up a @D|pg||
nt|ralfwil: With @hK and J  on Sthere is also 13 tricks in nt|pg||
nt|chick: especially with N chiming in with a bid|pg||
nt|murat e: now a lightner double beats the grand because east will be on play|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 1@S1@H2@D4@C will do|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no I think these are 14's Rashed|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I think we play 14 in the Quarter finals?|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: yes 14 boards|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I agree, but life is not perfect so I would probably compromise my principles and open a multi|pg||
nt|mrace: if S jumps with @H a and continue @S|pg||
nt|hoz: Y, not easy 9 tricks|pg||
nt|mrace: if he ducks @H def is dead|pg||
nt|hoz: no, then he has 2S, 2H, 3D and 2C|pg||
mb|4S|nt|cherdano:  meanwhile, 3@S would have been down 5|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a fun match, next round starts in 45 minutes, thanks Basar great operating and thanks Rashed and Salim|pg||
nt|murat e: lead from wrong side|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: ugh|pg||
nt|petergill: Luke Gardiner did well to make himself declarer - now can he get the clubs right?|pg||
nt|haans: 10-12 nt win lots because opps not know what to bid|pg||
nt|rgdruru: i guess 6 @D i pretty hard to reach, especially after nt opening|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thanks kibs, best session so far for feedback|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that is some serious handhogging by W. lucky that D K is on|pg||
nt|andyv:  showing @ds and longer @cs|pg||
nt|Gerben42: so Macura will try 3@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|rgdruru: not that it should be bid|pg||
nt|haans: nore logical that NT-bidder have @DK|pg||
nt|haans: as logical as @CA|pg||
nt|rgdruru: even so, both 3nt and 6 @D are down if k @D on W|pg||
nt|haans: yep so better slam has been missed|pg||
nt|ybob: S made that opening works|pg||
nt|mrace: hiw 2@C ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: game|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thx Basar another great job, Shirley and Cornelia nice to join you again, cheers|pg||
nt|jaapfr: now 7@C down played by N and we order a @H lead:)|pg||
nt|lml: one thing about this hand is your are very likely to be able to enter the auction later with your fine heart suit|pg||
nt|murat e: makes on a club lead|pg||
pc|h6|nt|rnmalik: Gary no swings in borad 10, so Noname comfortable winners:)|pg||
nt|mrace: how ?|pg||
nt|murat e: wow|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: he led a heart|pg||
pc|h9|nt|petergill: EW lead low = like I think, attitude leads versus NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: wow!   ed |pg||
nt|sybarra: wd |pg||
nt|haans: not better that max 50%|pg||
nt|jaapfr: played by E|pg||
nt|murat e: passssssss|pg||
nt|andyv:  good discipline on part of E/W|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jaapfr: can not play @DA so must play @DQ and cah her 9 tricks|pg||
nt|lml: playing it from the west hand is going to get the Netherland Red an imp|pg||
nt|Gerben42: why bid 3-over-3 on a known 5-3 fit?|pg||
nt|hoz: now D to Q, another C|pg||
nt|mrace: i mean if he plays @H now|pg||
nt|mrace: and S jumps with A|pg||
nt|mrace: he needs to play @D|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|santyclz: The open room reached 5@c on bd 29 on what looks very much like a bidding misunderstanding.|pg||
nt|sybarra: optimist!|pg||
pc|sT|nt|rnmalik: @CA|pg||
nt|sybarra: that maybe should have opening lead |pg||
nt|mcarroll: This can make|pg||
nt|april7: there was an accident in OR in 3NT in this hand, wrong card pulled probably!?|pg||
nt|mrace: he got it|pg||
nt|hoz: later a H, and then things get complicated|pg||
pc|s4|nt|haans: its been a good mstch|pg||
nt|haans: match|pg||
nt|chick: wow, this may be close to 20 imps after all|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 7@C pls|pg||
nt|imp_jan: fredin dbl by south|pg||
nt|ralfwil: return to 6nt!!!!|pg||
nt|murat e: wow|pg||
nt|imp_jan: return to 7n|pg||
nt|chick: silly double though, never double a contract you can beat unless you can also double and beat anywhere they run to|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but 7nt best XX C:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: fast passes after double.they didnt even think about 7cl or 6nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: south says "wow" for dummy|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sharynr: opps had to get @C started to defeat a game|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes a good win, have fun later I see you are on with Shirley she is good fun|pg||
nt|haans: time to claim|pg||
nt|chick: they'll pay for it|pg||
nt|jaapfr: mb they want beer?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: The Noname team has a good goalkeeper ....|pg||
nt|jaapfr: cash|pg||
nt|sybarra: for those asking,  the 3 @S bid was like puppet stayman,   shows the 6 card suit is the other majors |pg||
nt|mrace: oh well|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|cherdano:  and maybe double by North would have actually been the best bid|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, 1-1 clubs was indicated by EW's silence in the bidding - with a club void, West might have bid over 1@C|pg||

nt|Gerben42: up to EW to seal the match here, by bidding 7|pg||
nt|imp_jan: seven not ridiculous|pg||

nt|sybarra: with these hands |pg||
nt|Gerben42: i'm not fond of bidding preempts in transfer...|pg||

nt|mrace: if they stay out of slam, seems like another chance to catch up|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mcarroll: Tough but it still makes - def cant lead @Hs so there are 2 discards on the long @Ds|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard to see how they will get there with the start of this auction|pg||

nt|april7: good pass by N, if he knew, X were best|pg||
pc|s3|nt|april7: worst lead though|pg||
nt|boedhy: without the two very strange results in the open room the Poles would be in front...|pg||
pc|s4|pg||

nt|andyv:  neither:)|pg||
nt|mrace: lol|pg||

pc|s2|nt|rnmalik: good discard by W for a switch to @H|pg||

nt|Gerben42: if @D are good and @HK available, 13 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  just has to be careful not to lose 2@cs, one via ruff|pg||

mb|p|nt|lml: but he is happy enough to defend clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrace: 24 hcps are always a danger|pg||
nt|andyv:  16 with good 5 card suit should just bid 3N...too much pressure on pd|pg||
nt|mrace: either overbid or underbid most of the ime|pg||
nt|andyv:  the vul is the deciding factor|pg||
pc|d3|nt|andyv:  another 10 imps to usa|pg||
nt|hoz: both black suits are misplaced, a C lead from E, a S lead from W could create a problem|pg||
nt|hoz: I mean for 3NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  agree.. but game figures to be in the 45-50% range... have to bid it if vul.|pg||
nt|mrace: i think i would bid 3 nt with S hand, |pg||
nt|hoz: agree|pg||
nt|mrace: i wouldnt try to find if we precisely have only 8 tricks|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|nt|boedhy: spotted well Avram|pg||

pc|h4|nt|mcarroll: They stopped in 1NT in Open|pg||

nt|vugraphzus: we are waiting for east|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 16 imps trailing in 2 brds not easy to bridge|pg||

nt|kfay: Although Meckstroth and Dwyer might be hard-pressed to believe that|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy: think Kazmiercza will have a bad night tonight|pg||
nt|kfay: based on the first 3 hands|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|boedhy: tricky board|pg||
nt|april7: another misfit for EW, but bad fit also for NS, losing 6 tricks in a @H contract|pg||
nt|boedhy: 5 low is probably always down 4@s is close but very hard to reach|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: multi again |pg||
nt|sybarra: Marion in other room tried 3 @S |pg||
nt|lml: nothing wrong with this hand in third chair|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mcarroll: No points - no fit stay out of the bidding if possible|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 23 vs 17|pg||
nt|boedhy: think this will end the auction|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @S might even be the better bid  |pg||
nt|sybarra: if opps getting in will be at the 4 level |pg||
nt|chick: 4 boards to go, so don't count Neth out yet :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|imp_jan: 7 hearts on a diamond / spade squeeze|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@C p 3@D, meant as transfer but understood as natural?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lml: bidding 4@s should not get that reward|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Gerben42: 6@H does not seem to go down|pg||
nt|mrace: 2@D-3@S-4@s|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like E will be pulling trump by ruffing @ds|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sybarra: shouldnt make |pg||
nt|rogerclee: i think they play 2@C is weak with diamonds or strong bal|pg||
nt|rogerclee: so 3@D was preemptive, 3n said he was strong|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|mcarroll: and effectively the match|pg||
nt|lml: 3@S shouldn't make|pg||
nt|sybarra: that too |pg||
nt|lml: now well West defend?|pg||
nt|murat e: the dutch lost wiyh 1 imp in the semifinals|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: no no:)|pg||
nt|lml: I believe that double suggests hearts although I am talking about what I play|pg||
nt|rogerclee: then it became a little unclear|pg||
nt|Gerben42: ah so then 4@D was misunderstood perhaps|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: If the defence get this right, declarer will not enjoy this hand|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Declare may enjoy it even less in Open as he was doubled in 3NT|pg||
nt|rogerclee: well he completed the transfer and then marion bid 5N to pick|pg||
nt|rogerclee: now i guess bob did not have confidence in the auction and bid 6d just in case marion had diamonds|pg||
nt|rogerclee: marion passed just in case bob had diamonds|pg||
mb|p|pc|d7|nt|lml: if East double in the direct chair it is takeout of hearts|pg||
nt|mrace: that works since S has the @h A|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lml: so this double shows hearts|pg||
nt|mcarroll: This could be interesting|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|imp_jan: if i was marion i wld always correct to a heart contract|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 7 tricks max|pg||
nt|april7: @H lead would have been much better, but if N's suit is @S then @S is better|pg||
nt|boedhy: yep Probably Greece- Italy and Netherlands - Japan for the semi finals|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mrxxx: that's why i personally reject playing certain openings as weak or strong|pg||
nt|Gerben42: hasn't got much to do with that, the misunderstanding was in 5NT|pg||
nt|mrxxx: it makes it harder to preempt, because opener can always be strong and there will be room for misunderstandings|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: director has called|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Walddk5: and USA, unofficially, won by 1 IMP against Greece!|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk5: So Italy, NL, USA and Japan/Czech in the semis|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|rnmalik: that too with @C finesse|pg||
nt|andyv:  17 imps riding on this|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|nt|sybarra: at the end,  they will be glad pards have them "covered" at the other table |pg||
nt|lml: I think he has to lose two diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: so no fun but the great score in the Open Room saves the day|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Gerben42: or 20|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: tým thýnks there ýs a tempo break wýth 4 @H býd|pg||

nt|vugraphzus: Tim|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Here you see the result|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So a good board for USA although 4@H went down|pg||

mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: so now the last board, great job Martin, Rashed and Basar@H|pg||
nt|april7: 2@H by S after transfer|pg||
nt|sybarra: as always ty Basar,  great job once again! |pg||
nt|andyv:  i don't think there's much chance of them winning the appeal, but I can still see E/W filing one...just depends on what 4@c was|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mrace: depends on how declarer plays|pg||
nt|andyv:  choices would be limited... almost have to take @s finesse then... have to hope the major suit honors split right|pg||
mb|d|mb|3D!|an|6-9 +4!h|nt|sybarra: thx to my co commentators, Mike and LInda,  great fun  |pg||

nt|chick: ah, bergen|pg||
mb|4C|nt|lml: 3@h is a bit percarious.  best to pass here|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am sure it many of my fellow turkish yellows working behind the scenes |pg||
nt|kfay: It's a pretty common treatment to play 1M-(Dbl)-3M-1 as a mixed raise|pg||
mb|4H|nt|kiwibridge: next segment in about 2 hours, thanks a;; kibs for joining us|pg||
nt|april7: E might balance and 2@S is makable by W|pg||
nt|murat e: 5 clubs is a good save|pg||
nt|kfay: so while i'm sure 3@c would have been fit, 3@d shows what the alert says|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: why 3? 1 is enough for the moment|pg||
nt|mrxxx: can they make 140 :)|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 140..|pg||

mb|p|nt|imp_jan: yess|pg||
nt|Gerben42: declarer will play safe for 8 tricks if given the chance though|pg||

nt|imp_jan: not safe for the match though, little does he know|pg||
nt|Gerben42: who won the other match?|pg||
nt|murat e: 5 cubs makes actually|pg||
mb|d|nt|april7: another small swing by NS|pg||

mb|p|nt|april7: for NS|pg||
nt|sybarra: restart is in about 45 min |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: or 40 min |pg||
nt|rogerclee: this lead will force declarer to play 3 rounds of hearts to north|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy: very tricky in this sequence ...|pg||
nt|boedhy: to balance that is|pg||
nt|Gerben42: I hear it was Italy|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rnmalik: thanks Gary, Martin and Basar. Really enjoyed and have won a coke from a sleepy kib|pg||
nt|lml: they can beat this if they untangle everything|pg||

nt|lml: lets see if they find it|pg||
nt|rogerclee: or not|pg||
