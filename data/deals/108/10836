pc|hK|pc|h5|nt|hedyg: interesting that they play X for 4 cards in @s, wonder what they play when they do NOT have 4 cards in @s|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h6|pg||
nt|cindy:  many players wont raise on xxx if they have no chance to win the contract    is this one of those cases ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont know, but double with 4 spades is the norm in much of the world|pg||
nt|cindy:  a few players are now playing double denies four spades   im not a big fan of it|pg||
nt|hedyg: i like being able to bid 1@s with 4 cards|pg||
nt|cindy:  because when partner bids 1@s and they preempt, you have no idea how many @s partner has|pg||

nt|cindy:  big difference between 4 and 5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in my view W should bid 2D, but otherwise 2H for sure. you know 2S is coming at your left so you cant hide your support from pd. he is the one with the sopade length so further ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: competition will be up to him, so you have to give him the info that will allow him to decide|pg||
nt|hedyg: but not when he bids X, he might or might not have 4 cards|pg||

nt|marlowepi: many people have long been playing that double denies 4 spades. there is an excellent rationale for it. but there is also a good rationale the other way|pg||
