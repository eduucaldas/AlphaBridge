nt|marlowepi: S must rise and lead club|pg||
nt|cindy:  right Marshall   ty|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S can place the minor suit honors, and W is very unlikely to be making a genius play here from spade king|pg||
nt|othered1: on the auction, double-dummy play is possible.  But that doesn't exactly help with @H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: club K has to be knocked out before Ds established|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right the hearts are the longterm issue but that question does not affect the early play|pg||
nt|othered1: Here, I think, the auction has helped quite a bit.  In a blind position, @SA is double-dummy without specific indication|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|pc|cJ|nt|marlowepi: the auction has helped, but it is likely the correct play regardless, as long as you believe it is realistically too deep for W to switch to spades holding the king|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|othered1: That duck should make things easy for declarer now.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W should have won that. now S can make him poay|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pay|pg||
nt|marlowepi: H ace king and a spade, planning to lead a third heart toward the jack and later endpolay W. with the bonus chance of dropping heaft queen, as here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: oh, dummy has heart ten, so shd have just said "third heart"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if you believe club king is marked and E has spade king, this line may be clear|pg||
nt|othered1: If west has at least 5-5, is there any way for declarer to go down after playing @HAK?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the longer S thinks, the more W will realize he should be squirming|pg||
pc|s6|nt|othered1: From the auction and hitch on the @CJ, you know where all the high cards are|pg||
pc|c5|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|d7|nt|marlowepi: the fct that W fled from 1S doubled suggests strongly that S2 shift was a stiff|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|othered1: Now isn't he at the mercy of the @HQ again?|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, he made a clear error i think|pg||
nt|othered1: Like I said above, giving west m 5-5, there was no way the rest of the cards could like that would go down after @HAK.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|othered1: could lie|pg||
pc|c3|pc|sJ|pc|s4|pg||
