mb|p|nt|hedyg: no just @ss|pg||

nt|ady: just spade     thx|pg||
nt|jstokes: not necessarily a minor, I think.  Their one bids are sound (14+) and two bids are weaker, natural|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|cindy:  hi Hedy :)   hi everyone|pg||
nt|hedyg: we are a bit late due to a group of ca 50 players coming back late from a day cruise|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: to all you specs who have been wandering back and forth amongst the various VG rooms today:  All roams lead to Rhodes|pg||
nt|hedyg: Fantoni team playing vs a Israel junior team|pg||
nt|cindy:  haha  hi Marshall :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: Fantoni explaining the lead system to the opps|pg||
nt|nickd: hello from athens|pg||
nt|jstokes: Hi Nikos|pg||
pc|sK|nt|cindy:  unfortunately S has picked off the opps best suit|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|ady: a partial in spades for e/w|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@c was alerted by the lady in E (14+)|pg||
nt|hedyg: X= @H|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|nickd: he will jup to gamme|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S  is a decent contract   but bad lay of the cards for e/w|pg||
nt|nickd: jump to game|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: i think W should bid 2D|pg||
mb|p|nt|jstokes: 1@s must have been forcing|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hedyg: interesting that they play X for 4 cards in @s, wonder what they play when they do NOT have 4 cards in @s|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: west has a good hand     well worth game bid|pg||
pc|d5|nt|cindy:  many players wont raise on xxx if they have no chance to win the contract    is this one of those cases ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont know, but double with 4 spades is the norm in much of the world|pg||
nt|cindy:  a few players are now playing double denies four spades   im not a big fan of it|pg||
nt|hedyg: i like being able to bid 1@s with 4 cards|pg||
nt|cindy:  because when partner bids 1@s and they preempt, you have no idea how many @s partner has|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@s was not alerted at the table|pg||
nt|jstokes: Oh, I see, Hedy -- I thot X was negative, but it was hearts -- are you there?|pg||
nt|nickd: 1@s not forcing but shows 14-18 hcp |pg||
nt|hedyg: Fantoni staring at the dummy, arms crossed|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes i am sitting right behind Nunes|pg||
nt|hedyg: lucky me :)|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|nt|hedyg: you dont know anyhow, do you?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|hedyg: i am having a great vacation, emphasis is put on friendly atmosphere, meeting old friends and making new ones. bridge is a bonus|pg||
nt|jstokes: hard to believe this has no play -- bad lie of cards (for declarer); lots of wasted values|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|cA|nt|cindy:  you know its at least 5|pg||
pc|c4|pc|d6|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|d7|nt|cindy:  big difference between 4 and 5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in my view W should bid 2D, but otherwise 2H for sure. you know 2S is coming at your left so you cant hide your support from pd. he is the one with the sopade length so further ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: competition will be up to him, so you have to give him the info that will allow him to decide|pg||
nt|hedyg: but not when he bids X, he might or might not have 4 cards|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|jstokes: well, maybe some play, with no heart shift|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|c7|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|sQ|nt|cindy:  too confusing for me|pg||
nt|marlowepi: many people have long been playing that double denies 4 spades. there is an excellent rationale for it. but there is also a good rationale the other way|pg||
nt|hedyg: Fantoni shook his head and then ruffed|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ady: stooped short of game in CR     some fortunate imps going n/s way|pg||
nt|ady: 11 tricks in CR    seems a lot|pg||
nt|hedyg: still thinking|pg||
nt|hedyg: asking if 1@S was a forcing bid|pg||
nt|ady: North led a trop diamond in CR  and switched to a low spade  and west ran the clubs discarding all 4 hearts in dummy   north refusing to ruff|pg||
nt|jstokes: 11 tricks in closed room after @DA lead and trump shift -- West pitch hearts on clubs and N didn't ruff; then some crossruffing, North ruffed in with the King and played another ...|pg||
nt|jstokes: trump -- West's clubs were good now|pg||
nt|jstokes: (sorry, David)|pg||
nt|hedyg: head held up by left hand...|pg||
nt|hedyg: not looking happy at all|pg||

nt|cindy:  could you tell that wasn't a serious question ?|pg||
nt|haans: Fulvio Fantoni interview (english): http://www.confsudbridge.org/hitsII/fantoni001i.aspx|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Hans|pg||
nt|jstokes: spec suggesting 5@H could make on prior hand with endplay in clubs -- almost, but need to draw 3 rounds of trumps and ruff a diamond in dummy, so no trumps left in dummy after the ...|pg||
nt|jstokes: 3rd club is won by east|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|hedyg: i think we are thrilled to be able to play against him and we expect him to do well :)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|chick: Might as well just bid 6 and hope for the best, since making 5 will still be a bottom|pg||
nt|othered1: Except that had one of the primary indications -- 3N had do shot|pg||
nt|othered1: no shot|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: hi commentator next session|pg||
nt|jstokes: Hi Hans|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|hedyg: would have been able to make with 2 2 @hs and elimination and endplay, but not with 3-1 @hs|pg||
mb|3D|nt|othered1: in a mediocre field, getting to 5 of a minor often is a great result, when 3N doesn't make and the killing lead is clear.|pg||
nt|haans: hihi Hedy and Joe and all|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|othered1: Any idea what double of 1N is and why east would pull to 2@D?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@s= 10-13, 5+ @ss|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 3@s= 6cards no 2nd suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: ah ok sorry that is different. i thought you had said that the opening 2S showed both majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: True, the one exception to my comment is when 1. you have definitely determined that you have an unstopped suit that the opponents know about, and 2. are off two cashing tricks :)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|chick: no idea, perhaps some special agreement|pg||

nt|hedyg: deep Fantoni in the tank|pg||
nt|hedyg: took out a card and put it back|pg||
pc|dT|nt|haans: odds for small dim|pg||
nt|jstokes: 2@C likes does show something in diamonds, but if it is only the king, playing a diamond now might lose a trick|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|nt|ady: Fantoni must be worried hearts will provide discards for diamonds|pg||

nt|cindy:  why not ?|pg||
nt|hedyg: who would you assume is short from the bidding?|pg||
nt|cindy:  how else are you going to beat this hand ?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|marlowepi: E did not bid and W did not lead a club honor. so D is not stiff r E would have bid 2D|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|pg||
