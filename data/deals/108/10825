nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|chick: Ed mentioned to me that 13 HCP probably isn't exactly a weak 2, so not sure what it might mean|pg||
pc|s6|pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|chick: This was headed for a partscore in any case, but this wasn't a good place for it|pg||

nt|othered1: On the other hand, people to tend to manufacture swings against players of south's class, figuring that left to his own devices, he'll do something right.  And he did here, by not ...|pg||

mc|7|nt|othered1: That wasn't maximum, but it was plus on a hand where either side could go minus|pg||
nt|chick: with a singleton @D, he might also have reopened with a X|pg||
nt|othered1: Right shape, but I'd need a very understanding partner to double with those few high cards and a 5-card side suit.|pg||
nt|chick: all true :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|2C|nt|chick: This is a bridge Festival, not a high-level event.  Many of the EW pairs will be intermediates|pg||

nt|chick: It's probably a great experience for the EWs to play against him, but also intimidating to be on vugraph at the same time as playing against a World Champion :)|pg||
nt|chick: I don't know if results are posted anywhere, but as a Pairs event, we won't have any comparisons during the session play|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|chick: Might as well just bid 6 and hope for the best, since making 5 will still be a bottom|pg||
nt|othered1: Except that had one of the primary indications -- 3N had do shot|pg||
nt|othered1: no shot|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|mb|1N|mb|d|nt|othered1: in a mediocre field, getting to 5 of a minor often is a great result, when 3N doesn't make and the killing lead is clear.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|othered1: Any idea what double of 1N is and why east would pull to 2@D?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chick: True, the one exception to my comment is when 1. you have definitely determined that you have an unstopped suit that the opponents know about, and 2. are off two cashing tricks :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|chick: no idea, perhaps some special agreement|pg||

mc|12|nt|chick: probably some will find a game and make it, so not a great result for EW|pg||
nt|othered1: only 23 hcp and those who find game will have to be in the dreaded five of a minor (see board 5)|pg||
nt|chick: I would bet that a few will be in 3N down and a few in 3N making .... spade lead is not obvious by any means|pg||
nt|othered1: assuming NS defend 3N reasonably accurately|pg||
nt|othered1: But @S shift may be found by many|pg||
nt|chick: certainly, but remember also this is not an international event, may players here are well below experts :)|pg||

nt|jaapfr: and not E pass on 3nt|pg||
nt|chick: assuming they are game-forced, 3@H is reasonable, but not passing 3N|pg||
nt|othered1: Maybe east wasn't confident about the opening 2-bid strength, so held way back later.  But I think east's hand may be a clear exception to Hamman's Rule |pg||
