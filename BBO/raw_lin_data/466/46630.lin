nt|Walddk2:  I like the idea of ignoring jacks in your point count when asked in a relay sequence. They are often pretty useless.|pg||

nt|lady007:  to sign off in any suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does "min" mean exactly 5zz??|pg||
nt|lady007:  the ZZ points are used to make it easier to ask the exact honors in relay sequences and to make it easy to determine on a low level if you have enough high cards for a slam|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lady007:  when you just show you HCP partner doesnt know if you have 4 jacks or an ace, which might make a 2 trick difference in slam|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|pc|c4|pg||
nt|lady007:  these points are only used in relay sequences, where you have at least GF values and are often looking for slam|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lady007:  for their opening bids they use normal HCP, since those jacks and lower honors still might come in handy in game|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  The method devised by Daniel Auby and Johan Ebenius many years ago. Sadly, they both passed away at a young age.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i seem to recall someone using zz as part of definition of opening bids -- maybe grue-moss when vul|pg||

nt|lady007:  tbo i am not sure if 3Nt was 5-6 or 5-7|pg||

nt|lady007:  dont the Irish at the other table also play a 2@C opening as natural?|pg||
nt|paulg:  yes, they play the same system as EW here|pg||
nt|lady007:  I know the hand is a littl weak, but 3rd seat , and it takes away so much bidding space|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Yes, but South didn't think he had enough vulnerable.|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  With so many defence values.|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  *defensive|pg||
nt|lady007:  the 2m openings in precision are sometimes difficult to deal with yourself, but also very hard for the opponents, since the 1 level is so easy and conventient to overcall and bid on, and having to get in on the 2 level is not at all as nice|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|sQ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|lady007:  declarer not tricked as well, thinking south needed the ace of spades|pg||
nt|lady007:  but hes still safe|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|d2|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h9|pc|hK|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|lady007:  or maybe he figured out that if north has the ace of spades that south should have Qx hearts|pg||

nt|lady007:  asking just for 6 spades|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lady007:  (its not in the notes. normally 3Nt asks but then north will show his entire hand and with north declaring they might not be too keen to do that)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lady007:  I will probably start playing it with Per-Ola Cullin. He is Johans previous partner and they used to play the same system|pg||

mb|3C|nt|Walddk2:  So you're replacing Bertheau, I like that :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2nd 8-bagger of the set  and again in @C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lady007:  also unlikely that you make 3NT|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lady007:  At the other table we see why transfer preempts or 3NT as any minor preempt doesnt work equally well as a direct preempt|pg||
nt|eamongall: He will need about 10 overtricks to reach 300 |pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: NS use opening 3N to show solid @H/@S opener  so 4@C would have been natural|pg||

pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|hK|nt|Walddk2:  3 turned out to be a wise decision. In the other room South opended 3NT (broken minor), West doubled and North bid 4@C, all pass.|pg||
nt|Aurora:  Last 2 hands :) Many thanks@H to all commentators & operator.  Next session tomorrow same time: http://livebridge.net/bbo/wbf/2016wbg.php?dsp=sch&sid=13|pg||

nt|eamongall: they boosted it to 9 |pg||
mb|1N|nt|lady007:  yes I also think 4@C would have resulted in EW playing 4@H. but if north wouldnt double that (which I dont think he will) then thats basically the same thing|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i always like when we can explain PASS as the most preemptive action|pg||

pc|s4|nt|lady007:  might have to guess the diamonds to make this|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Diamonds 3-3 helps. 2 spades, 2 hearts, 4 diamonds and 1 club.|pg||

pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: but @D could be a restricted choice problem|pg||

nt|Walddk2:  South is marked with spade length. I think he will go for the drop.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if @S reliably 5-3  that increases chance of getting @D right|pg||
